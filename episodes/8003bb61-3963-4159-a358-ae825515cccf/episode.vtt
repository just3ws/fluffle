00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Learning to swim is a magical time in a child's life.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 The excitement of the water.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.700
 Playing with friends.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 Making memories on vacations that will last a lifetime.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.800
 British Swim School has locations throughout the U.S.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.200
 where we specialize in teaching anyone to swim.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.900
 From babies to adults, beginners to those who need a refresher.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.000
 British Swim School's instructors make learning to swim fun

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.600
 with gentle teaching methods.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.600
 When a young man is up late playing video games,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.600
 he thinks the only thing he has to worry about is getting spawn camped.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 But then he realized something was watching him

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 from the darkness outside his bedroom.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 And then we take a look at the story of three young boys

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.600
 at home with their teenage babysitter.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 Many people often say they wish they could see a UFO.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 But this story is so terrifying, you'll never say that again.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 [Music]

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 I'm your host Jason Garbiner. I'm having a great day.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 This is the last episode of this trunk.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 It's not the end of the season.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 The next two weeks are going to be classic episodes.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 They have picked some really good ones.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 A lot of behind the scenes stuff.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 And then there's going to be a week and no episodes.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 I'm actually going to be physically gone on vacation.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.600
 I won't be home.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 But I'm bringing a microphone in case there's some breaking news.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 We have to do any sort of podcasting stuff.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 But we will be back the first week of September.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 Last week of August.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 I'm still trying to figure everything out.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 It's been a whirlwind the past couple of weeks

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 just trying to get these episodes together.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 Someone who's never a whirlwind.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 Someone who's a light, gentle breeze.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 Hopefully.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 Blowing in.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 Is that a thing people are called?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 Is that a compliment?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600
 I think it is.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 Blowing into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 Everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 Meredith Riddle.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 Woo yeah!

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 Come on in.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 Come on in.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600
 Meredith.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600
 She's like made of smoke and clouds and stuff like that.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 She's like what normal, carbon based human?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.600
 Why now am I a wisp of air since you just needed that weird segue.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
 Meredith.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.600
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 Just help spread the word about this show.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600
 That really, really helps out a lot.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 Now Meredith, you lucked out.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 This is a pretty creepy episode.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 I'm assuming you like creepy stuff if you listen to this podcast.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600
 Meredith, we're going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
 Let's get it out of the garage.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.600
 We're driving all the way out from Dead Rabbit Command to some doot house.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 I didn't give us a location to the anonymous story,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600
 but we're going to some doot house.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 [Potatoes]

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
 You know what's interesting?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600
 It's such a small world.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600
 These stories could be taken to play somewhere around me.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 I don't know if I've ever announced on the show.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600
 I don't know if I've ever announced this.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 We've talked about it on the Patreon Discord.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600
 I've talked it with listeners in real life.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 Hans Wormhat, the very famous Hans Wormhat,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.600
 long time friend of the show he would describe.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.600
 I doubt that he likes the show if he knows about it.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 Hans Wormhat lives in Oregon.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 And I live in Oregon.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.600
 So who knows, we might have passed each other's paths at one point.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.600
 He may be my boss, but I know.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600
 I should walk into my boss and be like, "Hey man,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 how do you feel about monkeys?"

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600
 And see what he says.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 Small world, though, isn't it?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.600
 Hans Wormhat and Jason Carpenter.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.600
 I almost don't even feel like I'm in the same category as him, right?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 Hans Wormhat is an icon.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 I would not consider myself on the level of the stature of Hans Wormhat.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.600
 This show could become the next Joe Rogan podcast.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 He could have 10 million listeners a day.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 And I'd still be like, "But I'm not Hans Wormhat.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600
 He's an icon, you know what I mean?"

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.600
 So I agree with what stuff he says, because I'll be honest with you.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.600
 This isn't a Hans Wormhat segment.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.600
 I'm talking about this just randomly, but for people who are just the first episode there,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 who's Hans Wormhat?

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.600
 Hans Wormhat doesn't believe monkeys exist.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.600
 Believes that space doesn't exist.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 The space believes that the color orange is satanic.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 Those are like the fun stuff that I talk about.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.600
 He also has these other conspiracy theories that I'm shocked he hasn't been kicked off YouTube.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.600
 It's one thing to say, "Monkey..."

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
 I guess this has become Hans Wormhat thing.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.600
 I hope this isn't one of those rant episodes.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 Hans Wormhat.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.600
 Monkeys don't exist to find.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.600
 That's a funny conspiracy theory.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.600
 He believes that every monkey you've ever seen is animated.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 Not like a little McGillagrell guy, but like drawing or animatronics or a puppet.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600
 Monkeys don't exist.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600
 Gorillas don't exist.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 It's an evil plot to make humans believe in evolution, which is satanic.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.600
 See, that's why they fake the monkeys in the first place.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600
 Monkeys don't exist.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.600
 He also believes, I remember this was so weird, I was like, "I can't cover that on my show, bro."

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.600
 He doesn't believe that the slave trade existed in the United States.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.600
 I'm like, "What are you talking about, dude?"

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.600
 And he'll pass this whole video, I'll put it in the--

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.600
 I'll risk my YouTube channel by putting it in the show notes.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.600
 If it's still up, right?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600
 The video could have gotten taken it down.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600
 I don't even know who I'm talking about.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 This is just off the top of my head.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.600
 John's Verm Hat doesn't believe there are any slaves in America, zero.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600
 And he goes, "Here's his proof."

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.600
 He would show drawings of boats.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.600
 And he goes, "Look at how many people they stored on these boats.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.600
 That's inhumane.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.600
 You can never in any way, shape, or form put a bunch of people on a boat like that

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.600
 and have them not half of them die."

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.600
 Yeah, dude, that was what made it so horrible was the fact that it was completely inhumane.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.600
 They created the slaves like they were barrels of water, right?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.600
 They just stored as many as they could on.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.600
 You knew you were going to lose 15% of them coming over.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.600
 Yeah, dude, that's the point.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.600
 That's why people don't like slavery.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600
 It's inhumane.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.600
 He doesn't believe that the American slave trade ever existed,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.600
 which I'm very curious because he's very religious.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.600
 I wonder if he thinks that the Egyptians had slaves,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.600
 like they enslaved the Israelites.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.600
 He hasn't done a video on that.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.600
 But he believes that there was no slaves in America, zero.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 That's so weird.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.600
 That's like absolutely bizarre.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.600
 I wonder what would happen if he got ahold of the World War II never existed.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.600
 We covered that on a podcast a long time ago.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600
 World War II never happened.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600
 It was all crisis actors.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.600
 Your grandpa was in on it.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.600
 I had a bunch of relatives he fought in World War II.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.600
 They're all in on it.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 It was all a stage show.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 World War II never existed.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.600
 Slave trade never existed.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.600
 Just for the sensors out there.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600
 I'm not saying that.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.600
 Hans Verm Hat, though, lives in Oregon.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600
 That's the whole point of that.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.600
 It went all the way from Hans Verm Hat, lives in the same state as I do,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600
 to possibly nuking my YouTube channel.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600
 Absolutely bizarre.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.600
 I do love conspiracy theories.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.600
 So when you meet people who genuinely believe in them,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.600
 it's just so fascinating.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600
 I used to.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600
 I talked about that on a show.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.600
 I never believed that World War II never happened.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.600
 I never believed that monkeys don't exist.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.600
 But I believed in other big conspiracy theories.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.600
 Meredith, let's go ahead and get this episode actually started.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.600
 We're pulling up to this young dude's house.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 He goes by the online name Tiz Me Flow.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 We're going to go ahead and call him Terry.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.600
 Terry, 16-year-old boy, has a habit of staying up late playing video games.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.600
 Living the dream, right?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.600
 Isn't that awesome?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.600
 You're running around.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.600
 You're playing some Team Fortress 2.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.600
 You're playing some killing floor.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.600
 Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600
 Killing them clots.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 Blowing them up.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.600
 Maybe a little battlefield.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.600
 Maybe a couple of Call of Duty.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600
 I don't know.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 This guy could have been super lame.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.600
 He might have been playing farming simulator all day long.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.600
 Sorry to insult all you farmers out there, both real and simulated.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.600
 He'd stay up late and he'd be playing these video games.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.600
 And of course, he'd get too loud.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.600
 And his mom would come and--

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600
 Terry, what are you doing?

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 Why are you yelling so loud?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.600
 Mom, you won't believe it.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.600
 We just capped the point for the third time in a row.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 I don't care.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.600
 I don't care.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.600
 I don't care.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600
 That was a rhetorical question, Terry.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 You can't be loud.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600
 It's late at night.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600
 Quit yelling.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600
 Okay, maw.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600
 Tchoo-choo-choo-choo-choo.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.600
 We're going to cap it one more time, guys, before I go to bed.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 This happened a couple of times.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600
 It's happened to all of us, right?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.600
 Mom, spoiling our fun.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 Well, one night, same setup, right?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.600
 He's up late.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.600
 The entire house is pitch black.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.600
 And his room is only illuminated by his monitor.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.600
 Oh, yeah, took him out.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.600
 Shot him in the stomach.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600
 Go us.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.600
 And while he's playing this video game, he has his bedroom door open about six inches.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.600
 There's about a six-inch gap between the door and the door frame.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.600
 But it must have just been--

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600
 Airflow.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.600
 No wonder why this guy gets yelled at for being loud.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600
 Shut your door, bro.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600
 He has his door open about six inches.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.600
 It must have just been for airflow or something like that.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.600
 Because the entire house is pitch black.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.600
 He goes, "When you turn and you looked out my door, you would just see the darkness of the hallway."

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.600
 Yeah, come on, guys.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.600
 One more round for victory.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.600
 Sounds like the most annoying guy to play with, honestly.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:38.600
 Everyone's like, "Oh, man, he's playing his game and he sees out of the corner of his eye,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:50.600
 his mom staring at him from that hallway, like her face is wedged in between the gap of the door frame and the door."

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:56.600
 So you have that six-inch gap and he sees out of the corner of his eye, his mom staring at him.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:04.600
 But not just staring at him, he said her face was locked in a scream.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.600
 Now, he has his headphones on. Of course, you're going to have to be a lot louder than the game.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.600
 So he's used to her screaming.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.600
 But when he sees out of the corner of his eye, he sees his mom yelling at him.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.600
 Like a perfect image of his mom yelling at him.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600
 Furrowed, browed.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.600
 She looked so angry that she couldn't get this guy to hear him.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.600
 She looked so frustrated because she knew he couldn't hear her.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:35.600
 So now she's having a yell late at night to get his attention and he sees his mom yelling at him from the hallway,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.600
 face wedged right in between the door and the door frame.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.600
 He turns and he looks and as he's turning, he takes his headphones off to hear what she's yelling about.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600
 He knows what it is, right? He knows what it is.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.600
 He's being too loud.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.600
 He takes his headphones off, he's turning to face her and he goes, "What?"

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.600
 And then he realizes he's just looking into pitch blackness.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.600
 There was no one standing in the hallway.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 There was no one even else awake in the house.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:24.600
 It was just Terry sitting in his bedroom, staring through the crack in his door into the pitch black hallway.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 Now you could argue that it was his imagination, right?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.600
 He's up late.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.600
 He's seen his mom yell a lot of times.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.600
 So it's like an after image or something like that, right?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:45.600
 But he says, he realized immediately like it was something else, something paranormal.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.600
 He goes on to explain.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.600
 He goes, "I've never had anything paranormal happen to me ever."

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:56.600
 He goes, "That was the only time anything that you could possibly say was paranormal happened and nothing's happened since."

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600
 And he saw that.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:03.600
 He saw his mom with her face wedged in the door screaming at him and then he turned and she was gone.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.600
 Now it was so just weird.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 He didn't tell anyone about it.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.600
 He didn't tell anyone.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.600
 He was in the next day.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.600
 He's like, "Hey, Mom, did you get to me being loud last night?"

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.600
 She's like, "What?"

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.600
 He didn't tell anyone.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.600
 And eventually his sister who lived with him, she moved away.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.600
 She went to college and he goes, "I never really liked my sister's room.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.600
 I always felt kind of unsettled by it.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.600
 And after she left the college, he goes, "I always kept her bedroom door shut."

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600
 It just was very unsettling.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.600
 Something in her room creeped him out.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.600
 A few years later, he was saying he was talking to his family and he told him this story.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 He said, "You know, it's so weird.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.600
 One night I was up late and I thought I saw mom yelling at me.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.600
 Yelling at me from the darkness of the hallway."

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600
 And it was unsettling.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.600
 She wasn't really there.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.600
 It actually creeped me out.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.600
 Like when I turned and I looked, she wasn't there at all.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.600
 I was alone or I was the only one awake.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.600
 And at that time, this, I don't know how often this happens in families.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.600
 My family was very vocal about stuff they had seen.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:13.600
 At that time, his mom and his sister said, "Yeah, we've had some paranormal encounters as well."

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.600
 Some weird stuff has happened in this house before.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.600
 He doesn't go into detail about what they saw, but that's interesting, right?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.600
 It's an interesting thing.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.600
 So we talk about this as a ghost researcher.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:32.600
 You want to have multiple witnesses and you want to have multiple witnesses that aren't interfering with each other's perceptions.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.600
 If you have three people living in a house and they're all experiencing the same thing,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.600
 and each morning they're like, "Oh, dude, you won't believe it.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.600
 I woke up last night and heard phantom footsteps down the hallway."

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.600
 The other two people, I can almost guarantee, will hear phantom footsteps.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.600
 Even if it's just the wind, even if it's just the creaking of the old house.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:56.600
 We covered a story recently where a mom was hearing her voice called in the house.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.600
 She heard someone going, whatever her name was, Louise or whatever.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.600
 Louise, and it was her voice.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.600
 It wasn't like Jacob Marley flowing around.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.600
 It wasn't that exaggerated, but she said it was the sound of my name being called.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 There was a tone of desperation to it.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.600
 She never told her kids about it.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.600
 She was trying to shield her kids from the haunting.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.600
 One day, years later, she hears her son talking to his friend.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.600
 The son goes, "This place is really creepy. You want to hear something weird?"

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.600
 "Sometimes I hear my name being called when I'm the only one alone."

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.600
 That's a verifiable haunting at that point.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.600
 The mother never told her son what was going on.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.600
 She just happened to overhear that.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.600
 The son never told the mom what was going on.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.600
 In this type of situation, where you have three people,

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.600
 and they weren't telling the 16-year-olds,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.600
 they probably used a big old security cat.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.600
 They didn't want to scare them around.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.600
 They were scaring them out of the house.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 They were experiencing paranormal.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.600
 What does that mean? Is that phantom noises?

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.600
 Is that stuff flying off the shelves?

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.600
 Is it full body apparitions? We don't know.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.600
 It's definitely something that the mother and the sister individually

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.600
 thought was weird.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.600
 Something was going on in this house.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.600
 I read that story, like, literally last night before I'm recording this episode.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.600
 It's just creepy, right?

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.600
 A vengeful spirit. That's a trope.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.600
 Something screaming at you from the darkness.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.600
 But the fact that it took the form of his mom

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.600
 adds a level of terror to it.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.600
 And what if it was trying to lure him out into the hallway?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.600
 Or what if he turned around when it was looking at him,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.600
 and had he not turned around, had he not caught it out of the corner of his eye,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.600
 that it would have creeped closer into the bedroom?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.600
 So for all you gamers out there,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.600
 Dead Rabbit Radio recommends sleeping on all the lights in the house.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.600
 Make it shine as bright as Rockefeller Square's Christmas tree.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.600
 Ghosts have a hard time sneaking up on you in the light.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.600
 It's not impossible, but it's a little bit over your electric bill.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.600
 You're like, you're real super high, but you're like,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.600
 "But at least I'm not getting attacked by a ghost that looks like my mama."

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.600
 Meredith Riddle, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonicopter.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.600
 We're saying goodbye to our gamer friends.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.600
 We're going to fly all the way out to Canada.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.600
 [imitates car engine]

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.600
 It's October 7th, 1979, and we're in Wabaska.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.600
 That's a town in Alberta, Canada.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.600
 Maybe a township, maybe a shire, I don't know.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.600
 Other countries have weird names for their localities.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.600
 Wabaska.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.600
 Wabaska in Canada, it's 8 p.m.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.600
 And there's a mom with her little boys, with her little boys hanging out there.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.600
 We're going to have this mom, and she has three sons, Charles, who's seven,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.600
 Nick, who's six, it's a busy mom,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.600
 and Milo, who's a nine-month-old little baby brother.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.600
 So he's like, [imitates car engine]

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600
 and he's like crawling around.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.600
 And the mom's like, "I need a break, I need a break.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.600
 I'm going to go out, hang out with my friends.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.600
 I'll see you guys in a couple hours."

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.600
 So she hives, they're not washing them by themselves.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.600
 She gets a babysitter.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.600
 They get their 14-year-old cousin.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.600
 This babysitter will go ahead and call her Nancy.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.600
 All of these names I've made up, by the way, we don't have the actual names of these people.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.600
 So if you go to Wabaska and you start knocking on people's doors,

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.600
 asking for Charles, you might just get some weirdo.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.600
 October 7, 1979, we're up here.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.600
 Nancy's going to be watching these boys.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.600
 I can do it, don't worry, you go out and have fun.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.600
 "I'm a big girl," said the babysitter.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.600
 "I'll watch your babies."

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.600
 And the mom's like, "Okay, I'm here, I need a break, I need a break.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.600
 I don't care who's watching right now."

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.600
 Now, this is a rural part of Wabaska.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.600
 They're all living in a trailer on their grandma's piece of property.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.600
 So the grandma has a big piece of property.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.600
 It's near this lake in the area.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.600
 And you have this trailer where the boys are hanging out,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.600
 the babysitters there, and their mom's like, "See you later."

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.600
 They're on their grandma's property.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.600
 And so even if something went really south, right,

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.600
 they could just run across the field, get grandma.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.600
 And luckily, their aunt is a nurse.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.600
 Actually, now the thing about why didn't you get grandma

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.600
 or the nurse to watch these kids or whatever.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.600
 The mom leaves.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.600
 The mom goes to do what she needs to do.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 You have these three boys, Charles, Nick, and Milo,

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.600
 being watched over by this babysitter.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.600
 And the mom said, "I'll be back around 10.30."

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.600
 So it's only going to be a couple hours that they're by themselves

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.600
 or with a babysitter, with a teenage babysitter.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.600
 And Charles is our narrator in this story.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.600
 He's the one who posted this to UFO reporting groups.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.600
 He said, "We're sitting in the trailer."

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.600
 And I remember clearly it's nighttime, right?

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.600
 It's dark outside.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.600
 And Milo is in his little walker.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.600
 Me and Nick are just kind of hanging out.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.600
 Nancy's doing whatever she's doing.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.600
 He goes, "I start to notice that there are these multi-colored lights

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.600
 shining into the trailer."

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.600
 He goes, "I'm sitting there, and I start to see these lights

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.600
 get projected into, like, on the walls of the trailer."

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.600
 So he's looking around his house, right?

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.600
 They're all living in the trailer.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.600
 And he sees these lights just appearing on the wall around him.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.600
 He's like, "What in the world is going on?"

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.600
 So he gets up, and he starts walking over to the window

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.600
 to look outside to see what could be projecting this light show.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:42.600
 And he says that he begins to hear a, quote, "high low noise."

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.600
 A high low noise.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.600
 That's a very, very interesting detail.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.600
 When we talk about the paranormal, things don't always make sense.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.600
 If I told you to imagine a high noise,

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.600
 that's also a low noise that might be hard for us to think about.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:05.600
 But in the world of the paranormal, it doesn't have any sort of physical real--

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.600
 When I say physical, like, "physical" properties, you know?

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.600
 Like, it doesn't necessarily follow the rules of the universe.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.600
 It's a high noise and a low noise at the same time.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.600
 And it's getting-- Whatever this is, it's not going from high to low or low to high.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.600
 The high low noise is getting louder and louder and louder.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.600
 And Charles is starting to almost be stunned by this noise.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.600
 It's starting to have physiological effects.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:45.600
 And Charles goes, "I looked out that window, and I realized that I could no longer see any stars in the sky."

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.600
 This noise is deafening him.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.600
 At this point, Nick is also reacting to this.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.600
 The babysitter is like, "What in the world is going on? Where is that coming from?"

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.600
 And Milo starts crying.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.600
 Little baby Milo and his walker.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.600
 Truly the most helpless in the story, right?

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.600
 Everyone else is mobile.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.600
 Everyone else can hold up the weight of their own neck.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.600
 Everyone else can move or hide, but Milo is just in his walker.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:15.600
 And you now have this trailer that's not only filled with the sound of this high low noise that's becoming increasingly louder,

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.600
 it's filled with the sounds of kids screaming.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:28.600
 Charles realizes the reason why he can't see any stars is there is something blocking the night sky.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:39.600
 He said there is this massive circular craft hovering only a hundred feet off the ground.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.600
 He said it was just right above like the tree line.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:53.600
 He said it was above the trees, it was above the trailer, but that was just like the rim of it.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.600
 Most of it was just covering this patch of field.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.600
 There were only outskirts of this massive rim and he could see this.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:07.600
 And he said you could see the lights that were bombarding them were on the sides of the UFO.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.600
 It almost like ran the circumference of the UFO on the side.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:20.600
 These multi-colored lights were coming from the trailer that they're in right now begins to shake.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:30.600
 Trailers, these trailers are not built to weather even earthly events like tornadoes or hurricanes.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.600
 And right now as this UFO is hovering overhead, it's not moving, it's just there.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.600
 The trailer begins to violently shake.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.600
 The noise is so loud now.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.600
 Charles has his ears completely cupped.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.600
 He's putting his head into a pillow.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.600
 He still can't block the noise.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.600
 It's a sonic attack.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.600
 Everyone's screaming.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.600
 Everyone's crying.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.600
 The trailer's shaking.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.600
 The lights are blinding.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.600
 The noise is still getting louder and louder and louder.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.600
 And then a noise above all.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.600
 Is the scream of Nancy.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.600
 When she yells out.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.600
 Where's Milo?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.600
 Charles turns and looks at the Walker.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.600
 That Milo was in.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:35.600
 He's gone.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.600
 At that point, both Charles and Nancy, just a word of advice.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.600
 Nick is completely useless for the rest of the story.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.600
 He's basically in a fetal position somewhere in the trailer.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.600
 He does not appear in the rest of the story.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:55.600
 Charles and Nancy look and they both see that the door to the trailer is swung wide open

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.600
 and standing in the middle of that field,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.600
 directly underneath the bottom of this massive craft.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.600
 Is Milo.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.600
 Now there's no way he would have been able to get out there on his own.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.600
 I mean, okay, nine months old, I think you can crawl then.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.600
 But the amount of time that's passed so far, there's no way he would have gotten out by his own.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.600
 He couldn't have gotten out the Walker by himself.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.600
 The Walker's empty. He's in the middle of this field.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.600
 And Charles said, "I looked into that field and I saw my baby brother

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:36.600
 and he was in the middle of the field, completely frozen in place."

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.600
 Charles is staring outside of this door.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.600
 The night sky completely dark.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:46.600
 The only light coming from this UFO and there in the middle of the field,

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:55.600
 directly underneath this vehicle, is a little baby just frozen in place.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.600
 Charles is sitting on the couch and he's like, "What just happened?

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.600
 What just happened?"

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:11.600
 And he realizes that there's some block of time that's gone now.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.600
 He remembers standing at the door staring at and the next thing he knew,

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.600
 he was sitting on the couch.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:22.600
 Nick, Nick is still in the fetal position on the ground screaming.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.600
 Charles jumps up off the couch and he runs to the window and he looks out

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 and he sees the UFO but now it's farther away.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.600
 He says, "Now it's starting to hover over the lake."

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.600
 It's leaving the area.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.600
 He turns around, Milo is crying, the babysitter is almost in shock at this point,

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.600
 and Mom walks in.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.600
 And Charles, his immediate thought was, "She must have seen what happened."

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 She had just left not too long ago.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:57.600
 This giant vehicle showed up. This had to be visible from pretty much anywhere in Wabaska.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:04.600
 He turns to his mom and his mom is furious as she's coming in the door and she goes,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.600
 "What is going on?

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.600
 What is go- Why is Milo screaming? Why is Nick in the fetal position?

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.600
 What is going on?"

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.600
 And the babysitter doesn't have words for it and neither does Charles.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:24.600
 Charles quickly realizes the mom did not come back because she saw the UFO.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.600
 The mom walked into the trailer because it was 10.30 p.m.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.600
 Now remember the story started at 8 p.m.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.600
 The UFO showed up at 8 p.m.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:42.600
 And Charles, he didn't know, he goes, "Later on in life I heard about a thing called lost time in relation to UFOs."

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.600
 He goes, "I did not even know. It took a long time. I didn't know what that meant."

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.600
 He goes, "The event started. It was maybe like a couple minutes.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.600
 And then I'm sitting on the couch and it's 10.30 p.m.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:27:02.600
 I had no way to figure out that that was a real phenomenon or what."

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.600
 First he thought his mom came home early because she saw the event.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:13.600
 Then he realized, "No, the four people in the trailer lost two and a half hours of time."

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.600
 Now the mom walks over to Milo.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.600
 Nobody knows what to tell her, right?

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.600
 Nick is completely useless.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.600
 Charles is trying to process all this stuff.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.600
 The babysitter, Nancy, is freaking out and Milo is crying so hard.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:33.600
 This little baby boy is crying so hard that he's having a hard time breathing.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.600
 He can't even catch his breath.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.600
 He sobs are preventing him from breathing properly.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.600
 And the mom walks over to Milo and Charles and Nancy go over to him.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.600
 Because they're still like, "How do you even explain that?"

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.600
 They're still trying to process it themselves when it happens.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.600
 Charles goes, "We walk over and my mom is trying to calm down Milo.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.600
 He's sobbing so hard."

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.600
 And they're all standing there looking at Milo in the walker.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.600
 When all of a sudden Milo's eyeballs roll to the back of his head

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.600
 and he begins going into convulsions.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:11.600
 This little nine-month-old infant is in a full-body seizure right now.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.600
 And foam begins to come out of his mouth.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600
 His body goes limp.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.600
 He completely stops breathing.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.600
 And the mom is trying to do CPR.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.600
 Everyone's freaking out.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:28.600
 The screams now reach the grandma's house on the same property.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.600
 Without any sort of paranormal phenomenon, any sort of alien technology

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.600
 to mute the screams of these kids,

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.600
 the grandma hears just this cacophony of crying and yelling.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:47.600
 And the grandma comes over and she sees her grandson limp.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.600
 This little nine-month-old baby, all this foam coming out of his mouth.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.600
 They take the baby, they take Milo to the grandma's house,

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.600
 and the aunt happened to be there.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.600
 And she begins doing CPR.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.600
 She begins to scoop the foam out of Milo's mouth.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.600
 She's just pulling this thick foam out.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.600
 They then take him to Slave Lake Hospital.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.600
 Apparently that's the name of the hospital in Wabaska.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.600
 Slave Lake Hospital, where he was treated.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.600
 And he's okay.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.600
 Charles said that Milo is A-okay.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.600
 However, he did add this detail.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.600
 He did say that his little brother was okay.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:32.600
 He did suffer minor brain damage due to a lack of oxygen for a short period of time.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.600
 Now the aunt said when she was pulling the foam out of baby Milo's mouth,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.600
 she was saying, "I don't know what this is.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.600
 I've dealt with people who have epileptic fits and I've dealt with people who have had seizures.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.600
 And they will sometimes foam, they'll sometimes spit stuff up,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.600
 but nothing like this, nothing like this.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.600
 She's just like pulling out of this goo.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.600
 In a thing that's very typical of paranormal or UFO encounters,

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.600
 that people who haven't experienced them have a hard time believing,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.600
 but this is true, I've encountered this as well.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.600
 That amazing and terrifying event that had real-world ramifications, right?

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.600
 This little baby had brain damage from this.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.600
 Saw the UFO, the trailer, shaking, you had four witnesses,

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.600
 three that could comprehend it, and then a little baby.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.600
 Carl said, "I remember the event. Never forgotten about it."

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.600
 That's why I can talk about it to the National UFO Reporting Center.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.600
 That's where we got this.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.600
 We got it from ThinkAboutItDucks.com.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.600
 They got it from National UFO Reporting Center.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.600
 He goes, "I remember the event.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.600
 Nick remembers bits and pieces."

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.600
 Nick kind of remembers stuff of it.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.600
 He goes, "When I talk to my cousin, you know, they're all adults now, right?

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.600
 This story happened back in 1979."

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.600
 He goes, "When I've talked to my cousin about it, the babysitter,

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.600
 she doesn't remember it at all.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.600
 She has no memory of the UFO.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.600
 She has no memory of the trailer shaking or the lights,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.600
 but she will remember a night."

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.600
 She goes, "I do remember when Milo got brain damage,

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.600
 which I'm assuming would be pretty memorable, right?

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.600
 But that's all she remembers about it."

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.600
 And we see that in paranormal events.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.600
 I've gone on Ghost Hunts where we've experienced phenomenon,

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.600
 and then years later, like obvious stuff,

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.600
 and then years later, I'll be talking to someone.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.600
 And they do remember when that happened, and they're like, "No."

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.600
 I was like, "You don't remember when that shadow man grabbed you by the shoulders?"

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.600
 "No."

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.600
 And I would tell him about the night.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.600
 He's like, "Oh, no, no, I remember that night we all went out."

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.600
 I was like, "You remember when we went to that spooky forest?"

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.600
 He's like, "Yeah."

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.600
 And I go, "Then you don't remember what happened after that?"

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.600
 He's like, "No."

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.600
 "I don't remember."

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.600
 So it happens, right? It's weird.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.600
 I think that would be one of the most memorable events of your life,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.600
 but different people remember different parts of it.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.600
 Myloath probably doesn't remember any of it.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.600
 For one, he's not even told.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.600
 Two, minor brain damage.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.600
 Fascinating story.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.600
 I read this story a while back, and I just couldn't wait to share it with you,

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.600
 because, and I wanted to wrap it up like this,

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.600
 I see people all the time online.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.600
 And I said the other day, my friend, Magania, here in town,

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.600
 she's like, "I hope I get possessed."

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.600
 I'm like, "Dude, quit saying that."

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.600
 I hope I get possessed.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.600
 She just recently moved into a new house.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.600
 I hope I get possessed.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.600
 I hope there's a monster in the basement that takes over my soul.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.600
 It's like, "Dude, you are an idiot.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.600
 You are actually dumb for saying so."

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.600
 "No, no, it's cool, man."

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.600
 What?

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.600
 What are you talking about?

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.600
 She's an extreme example, right?

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.600
 She's a great kid, but she's also an extreme example of that.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.600
 You see people online a lot talk about, "I wish I had a paranormal thing happen to me."

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.600
 "I believe in UFOs, I believe in aliens, I believe in ghosts, I believe in demons."

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.600
 "I wish something paranormal would happen to me."

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:59.600
 And these are the stories you come across where you go, "No, you don't."

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.600
 Like, I get wanting to see it, because then it will give you some sort of proof.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600
 First off, it doesn't.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.600
 Like, I've seen a lot of ghosts.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.600
 I didn't see a ghost until I was 18 years old.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.600
 And, um...

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.600
 You can't say that it necessarily...

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.600
 Because you think you're going crazy, right?

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.600
 When you first start seeing stuff, you go, "That's obviously not real."

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.600
 "I must be going crazy."

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.600
 And even now, you know, I've had a lot of experiences, I've seen a lot of stuff.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.600
 I think that you could explain a lot of it.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.600
 Maybe not all of it, right?

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.600
 But you could explain a lot of it away.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.600
 So it doesn't really necessarily give you proof.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:42.600
 I mean, I think that if you believe it, that should just be good enough, right?

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.600
 I don't think you need proof, because you'll never have the concrete proof that you want.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.600
 But then you also invite stuff like this happening.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:57.600
 It's not anything to toy around with, whether it's my friend talking about getting possessed by a demon,

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.600
 which I still can't believe that that sentence even came out of her mouth.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:09.600
 "To... I wish I saw UFO, I wish I saw aliens. These things are not meant for human consumption."

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.600
 They're just not.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.600
 You have to wonder, like, are aliens and Bigfoot and ghosts and stuff like that,

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.600
 are the reason why they're so hard to pin down,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.600
 the reason why they're so hard for everyone to see,

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:27.600
 is because the side effects of interacting with them are so bad.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:34.600
 You know what I mean? Like, the side effects of having these things in your life is a net negative.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:40.600
 Because this baby got brain damage, because this UFO showed up.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.600
 So it's, you know, be careful what you wish for, right?

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.600
 You don't know what type of thing you're inviting into the world.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.600
 When you go, "Oh man, I wish I had had an experience."

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.600
 "Oh, all these paranormal stories sound so interesting."

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.600
 Best case scenario, you see a light in the sky moving away that you go,

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.600
 "Whoa, no human craft could move like that."

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.600
 Nowadays with drones, that's almost...

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.600
 You basically got to shake hands with an alien, right?

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.600
 I see lights in the sky every so while.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.600
 I won't say all the time, but I see lights in the sky making weird moves.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.600
 Yeah, it's probably a drone, right?

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 But, you know, that's the best case scenario.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.600
 You see a light in the sky you can't explain.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.600
 Even grears dropping flares from an airplane type of scenario, right?

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.600
 You're like, "Oh, that's unusual."

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.600
 Now I have proof that there are lights in the sky that I can't explain.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.600
 The worst case scenario is you see something like this, right?

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.600
 Or not, I mean, who wouldn't, you know, seeing something like this would be cool.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:42.600
 You know, the baby brain, the baby brain damage is the thing you don't want.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.600
 You know, when you interact with these things, when you invite them into your life,

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:52.600
 we have no idea of the short or long-term consequences of these type of paranormal encounters.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.600
 I would argue that ghosts are pretty benign, but they're just...

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.600
 They're also super spooky.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.600
 You know, how many people... they say what...

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.600
 Most accidents happen in the house.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.600
 This is my conspiracy theory I just came up with.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.600
 I literally just popped in my head.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.600
 This is how my brain works.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.600
 And we'll end it like this.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.600
 This is a good insight into the mind of Jason Carpenter.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.600
 I literally just thought of this.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.600
 You know how they say most accidents happen at home?

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.600
 And the deadliest places in your bathroom.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:31.600
 What if, like you could say like, 50 to 70% of all bathroom fatalities are because you got scared by a ghost?

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.600
 Like you're in your house and you're taking a bath, and then it's a nice relaxing bath,

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.600
 and then you're going, "Man, that sure was nice."

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.600
 And then you stand up, and the ghost, the ghost just goes, "Boo!"

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.600
 And you slip and fall.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.600
 And we would never know.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.600
 And maybe you slipped and fall, but you just broke your ankle.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.600
 You're like, "Good thing I didn't die."

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.600
 And then the ghost starts kicking you a couple of times in the head.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.600
 It's like, "I want a new friend! I want a new friend!"

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.600
 And it kills you.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.600
 That is obviously a not-well-fleshed-out thought.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.600
 I don't know how it plays in the previous 40 minutes of the episode that I've recorded.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.600
 But I'll wrap it up like this.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.600
 We just don't know what...

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.600
 Oh, that's what I was talking about.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.600
 We don't know what the long-term or short-term effects are of having this paranormal.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.600
 This baby got brain damage because a UFO showed up.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600
 So think about that.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.600
 The next time you're sitting at home when you go, "You know what?

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.600
 I think UFOs are pretty cool.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.600
 I would like to see one one day. You selfish, you selfish jerk!"

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.600
 The next time you have that thought, I want you to imagine a baby with brain damage.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.600
 Minor brain damage.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.600
 Don't get too creepy, right?

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.600
 But the next time you wistfully think of wanting to have a paranormal activity,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.600
 remember the story of Baby Milo.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.600
 These things may be fun to look at,

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.600
 but only if you're not a baby.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.600

 What a way to end an episode!

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.600
 I was second-guessing myself.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.600
 I was like, "What? What, baby?

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.600
 Now I'm going to get a bunch of letters from pro-baby advocates.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.600
 They're like, "Babies can see UFOs too."

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.600
 I go to their website and it's a bunch of pictures of babies going,

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.600
 "Ugh, you're all brain damaged."

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.600
