 Did you know about one in nine people over age 65 have Alzheimer's disease?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.200
 The AHEAD Study is looking for people ages 55 to 80 to join the National Institutes of Health

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.200
 Funded AHEAD Study. The AHEAD Study aims to prevent Alzheimer's disease before symptoms appear.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.720
 Discovering a treatment that targets brain changes early means doctors may one day prevent

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:32.080
 memory loss. Help us get ahead of Alzheimer's. Visit AHEADStudy.org. A supernatural thief on the

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.080

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.520
 fear, and the souls of children today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.160
 Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. We have a lot of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:07.840
 good stuff for you today. So I wanted to start the story off with the tale of a photo that I happened

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.920
 to find while I was out walking today. Now of course, talking about a photo can be difficult

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.000
 about on a podcast. And I'm going to start off by saying that this story is 100% true because

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.840
 you could be thinking, "Oh Jason's just larping. Jason's just trying to set up some narrative

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.440
 going on with the podcast." But today I was, and it's 100% true. I showed the picture to Veronica

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.560
 earlier. I kind of had to explain to her why the picture was more worrying than normal, but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.040
 there could be a totally logical explanation for this. So let me actually go get the picture here.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:59.120
 It's not like I can actually show it to you or anything, but so I found this picture. It's on

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.640
 one of those little instax, Fuji film instax thing. It's basically the kid version of an old

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.120
 Polaroid camera like I had when I was a kid. So it's a little picture. It's probably about two

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.680
 inches by an inch and a half, a pink border on it. And in the picture, what I'm going to do too,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.840
 just so you can have a frame of reference, is I'm going to take a photograph of this picture

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.920
 and I will put it up on the website. So if you go to DeadRabbit.com, you'll see a copy of the picture.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.360
 And if you're listening to this on YouTube, you're probably looking at a photo of it right now.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.640
 So let me explain to you a little bit about it. It's funny because I didn't plan on talking about

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.040
 this. So we'll see about those other stories. But the photo, you're going to see black smudges on

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.480
 the sides. That's not dirt or anything to make it look any creepier. It is the ink coming off of

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.040
 the back of the picture. The little film has been slightly removed. When I found this, it was raining.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.480
 So it wasn't in the best condition, but all the dirt isn't to make it look spooky. That is just

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.720
 ink. I got ink all over my hands when I picked this photo up as well. I had to carry it with me.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.560
 But if you're not looking at the photo right now, let me explain it briefly to you. The camera

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.720
 is tilted slightly. So the camera itself is tilted slightly. So it gives it a look as if someone

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.360
 wasn't looking straight on at their subject, but they're holding their camera at a, I don't know,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.160
 60 degree angle. In the picture, we see what looks to be an apartment. The apartment looks fairly,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.640
 I don't want to say abandoned because that makes it too creepy. But you can see that the blinds are

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.680
 kind of a skew. They're not lined up right. The only thing we see in the photo is an oven,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.280
 a stove, I guess whatever, that thing that you put food in. Cabinets, the top of a chair,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.960
 presumably a kitchen chair, a couple of knickknacks on a windowsill, and what appears to be a young

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:58.240
 woman cowering in fear of whoever's taking the picture. So my first instinct, obviously, is that

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.040
 this is a staged photo some kids are messing around. And that is very likely. There's actually

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.800
 three scenarios here. One is that this is a staged photo and these kids are messing around,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.320
 and they either lost it or they left it there intentionally. It was raining. So again, if someone

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.760
 was going to put this out there to be like, ooh, let's do some spooky stuff, you may want to have

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.560
 waited until it wasn't raining or put it somewhere where it wouldn't get wet. But again, it just adds

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.400
 the creepiness factor that is sitting out in the rain. It was sitting face up. I walked right by it

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.680
 and looked down, picked it up. The other option is this. So there is a famous, if you're into

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.400
 true crime, you most likely have seen this photo before. Let me actually get some more info on.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.200
 Again, I didn't plan on doing this part of the show. I showed it to Veronica and I was going to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.040
 save it, but I was just looking at it on my, put it on the top of my fridge and I said, no, I'm

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.800
 going to do that story now. So let me get some quick information for you here. So there is,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.240
 if you're into true crime, you've come across this photo. It's a very famous photo. It's the last

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:12.400
 photo of Regina K. And who Regina K is, sorry, it's the last photo of a woman named Regina K.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.440
 Walters. And I'll also have this photo on DeadRabbit.com. All the show notes are going to be in as

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.280
 normal. So if you forget the website or whatever, you can still locate this stuff. But I really

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.760
 think you should check it out. There is a photo of a woman named Regina K. Walters. She is, it was

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.560
 chilling the first time I saw it. It's actually still quite chilling, but it's a photo of her

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.720
 standing on what looks to be an abandoned barn or a house that has been partially destroyed.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.160
 She is standing there. Her hair has dyed black. She's wearing different clothes than she had on

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.320
 then when she was kidnapped. And she's cowering in fear in front of the camera. And the camera is

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.680
 tilted about 60, 70 degrees at an angle. So that's what made me a little more suspicious of the photo,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.040
 is that it matches this very famous true crime photo. So the first option again is that it's

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.080
 completely made up and it just coincidentally matches one of the most famous last photos of a

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.080
 victim that it's pretty iconic again. If you've in true crime, you've probably seen it. The second

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:23.440
 scenario is that it is fake and it happens to, sorry, the second scenario is that it is fake.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.440
 And the people who took it were making it match that photo in the first place. That was kind of

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.480
 the point. They go, "Oh, that's a creepy photo. Let's, let's do that. Let's do this sideways thing,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.960
 this angle." The third option, the least likely of all the options, is that it's real, that this

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.760
 young unidentified woman was really cowering in fear, that the photo was staged as some sort of

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:57.520
 fetish or warning or trophy. As of now, there's no, been no reports of missing women in my area.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.600
 So, and it's a small town. So it's not something that I'm super concerned about. I just think it's

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.360
 an interesting item. So we're going to go ahead and we're going to hold on to this. And again,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.240
 I want to 100% assure you that this is not a LARP. This is not an ARG. This is not some fictional

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.720
 narrative that I am building up for the podcast. This is 100% true. And I understand if you go,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.080
 "Oh, Jason's just mucking about." Like, I get that you would think that. I know that I did the four

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.720
 short story episodes a while back, but those were completely different intro music, completely

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.120
 different tone. They were labeled as such. I may continue to do those. I don't know. They still

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.640
 get hits, but I don't know if I'm going to keep doing that. But this is 100% true. As far as my

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.680
 part of the story of finding the photograph, I can't verify that the photo itself is not fake.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.680
 But if it is fake, I had no part in taking the photo. I had no part in planning the photo. I

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.960
 had no part in anything like this. It was just laying on a rock as I was walking by. And I'm

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.200
 not so famous in my area that someone would be like, "Oh, Jason Carpenter walks by here. Let's

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.720
 leave him a photo and get on his podcast." So, yeah, really weird. I took it. I showed it to Veronica.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.720
 She thought it was weird. I showed her the backstory and showed her the photo of the young woman who

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:25.440
 was also missing. The dude who did kill her. I just looked that up. He's in prison. He's like in

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.800
 his 70s. So I don't think he's kicking it around in my neighborhood. But so, yeah, weird. I'll keep

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.240
 you updated. I'll tell you this right now. There's probably no ending to this story. I'm probably

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.440
 not going to come back a week from now and being like, "I was being chased by guys in cloaks."

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.760
 Or, "This woman went missing." To be honest, it probably is just a weird series of coincidences.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.760
 But I will keep you guys updated. I wanted to go ahead and share that story with you.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.840
 It's kind of different than what I normally show. It kind of falls into my personal experience

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.800
 ghost story type things. And I kind of prefer to cover stuff that I can show you articles and

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:05.200
 verify. But I'm going to post a photo of the photo. And I'll post a copy of the other photo of

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.120
 the young woman that I think this photo is emulating. And we'll go from there. Okay,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.280
 so let's go ahead. I didn't plan on doing that. But I was like, "Because that actually just happened

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.400
 today where I found the photo." And I was like, "Oh, we'll do it later." But no, I'm glad we did it

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.400
 today. So, and I know no one's going to believe me. But anyway, so let's get it. And that's fine.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.120
 That's fine. I don't, yeah, it's good to be skeptical, even of me. Never heard to be

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:35.440
 skeptical of anybody. So, but it is true. So anyways, okay, and we're back. Actually,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.240
 I took a bit of a break there. I talked to this next story I went on for like 20 minutes talking

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.240
 about. I think it's an interesting story. I don't know if it's 20 minutes interesting.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.640
 And I said it'd be easier for me to just rerecord it than to have to edit it down. So

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.760
 I do think it's definitely an interesting story. But I talked about it way too long.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.560
 What we're going to do is we're going back in time to the late 1800s. So we're after the

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:03.280
 Civil War. We're in the United States. We're in the South. And there was a man who was known as

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:10.320
 Railroad Bill. So Railroad Bill is half factual, half legend. Maybe the legends are true. I don't

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.400
 know. We'll explore that in a bit. But Railroad Bill was just a normal dude. Well, he's a little

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.640
 more than normal because nobody knew anything about him. He just kind of popped up in the area.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.800
 We don't know anything about his childhood or where he came from. And even people there,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.960
 they weren't too familiar with who he was. He went by the name of Morris Slater. But even then it

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.000
 seemed like that may not have actually been his real name. People stories go that he originally

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.040
 started off as a circus performer and ended up getting a job at a Turpentine company,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.160
 which I guess somebody has to manufacture Turpentine. Turpentine is paint remover. It's most popularly

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.680
 known as the dip that Judge Doom put shoes in. I'm sure a painter will be like, "No, it's more

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:59.200
 popularly known as paint remover, but anyways, worked at a Turpentine company." He also enjoyed

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.080
 riding the rails. So there was a rail company back in the day called Louisey. They weren't really

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:10.880
 good with names back then. This railroad company was called Louisville and Nashville Railroad.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.360
 So again, like, yeah, you're just kind of describing what it is. He hitches a ride on the rail. The

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:22.800
 breakman on the train finds him and picks him up and throws him off the train. And from this event,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.960
 Railroad Bill vowed vengeance on the train company. But anyways, then this breakman throws him off the

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.200
 train and he like falls into the dirt. And most people's first reaction would be like, "Whoa,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.920
 I'm glad I didn't get mangled horribly by the train." Railroad Bill's first reaction is to pull

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.480
 out his rifle, which he somehow kept a hold of. If I was throwing a guy off a train, I wouldn't

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.840
 then be like, "And take your rifle with you!" But anyways, Railroad Bill takes out his rifle and

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.840
 opens fire on the breakman. Train just keeps on chugging along. From that day, Railroad Bill vowed

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.600
 vengeance on the train company. Now, getting thrown off a train isn't the easiest thing to endure,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.520
 but Railroad Bill made it his life mission to go after the train company. He actually quit his job

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:14.080
 at the Turpentine company. He's like, "You can kill toons on your own." And formed a gang that then

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.560
 hijacked trains and robbed them. And what they would do is they would put one guy on the train,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.400
 they would hide a guy on the train, and be like, "Tip one, don't get thrown off." But they would

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.080
 put a guy on the train. And when the train would kind of be out in the middle of nowhere, the dude

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.360
 would open the door out and throw all the goods out of the train. The story goes that Railroad Bill

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.440
 would then get the goods, get the contraband. Is it contraband? Well, he would get the stolen

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.600
 property and then give it to the poor. He hated the railroad so much, he's like, "I don't even

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.880
 want to make money from this. I'm just going to give all this stuff to the poor." So the people in

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.440
 the area saw him as like a folk hero, as a real Robin Hood type guy. He also, this is why the

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.320
 story is true crime-ish, but the reason why I'm covering it, I came across this in that great

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.840
 book that I love, National Directory of Haunted Places. There'll be a link below if you want to

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.840
 buy the book yourself, which I highly recommend everyone doing. And it is affiliate links, so

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.280
 when you buy something, I get a little bit, but still, I highly recommend everyone getting this

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:14.160
 book. The rumor goes that he actually had the power to shape shift, and he could assume either the

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:22.000
 form of a big black dog or any inanimate object. Now, if I had a choice between becoming, like,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.920
 yeah, being a big black dog helps you like run around and like menace people, but if I can become

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.640
 any inanimate object, I would just become a hundred dollar bill and then have my buddy,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.240
 which back then was a ton of money, have a buddy buy stuff and then like they hand over the hundred

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.160
 dollar bill and they don't notice the little picture of the guy like winking at the get, at that

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.880
 is a compass going "wink!" And then after they get the goods, he can turn back into a human and run

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.680
 out the back door. That's how I would rob stuff if I could turn into inanimate objects. But anyways,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.160
 I wonder like if you turned into a stagecoach and people were inside you, would that be comfortable?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.240
 They're like, it's just like an eight month ride through the wilderness. But anyways, so, well,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.080
 if you turn into a stagecoach is that inanimate. Technically, the coach part is you'd have to

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:12.000
 get some wheels put on you. But anyway, so railroad bill could turn into an inanimate object or a

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.200
 big black dog. And that's the legend. The reason why that legend grew was because they could not

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:23.680
 catch this guy. First off, there was a $350 reward, which again is a ton of money back then. And as

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.600
 his crime spree progressed, at one point, okay, at one point he was fell asleep behind a water tower

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.320
 along these train tracks. These train employees found him. They grabbed his rifle, they grabbed his

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.800
 pistol, and then woke him up. They're like, get up, get up railroad bill, we're assuming because

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:46.320
 you're by railroad. Railroad bill jumps up, sprints 100 yards, pulls out another gun he had hidden,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.880
 and starts a gun battle. And the dudes weren't prepared for that. They have to hide in this

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.960
 little shed and he's like shooting in the shed. And the other guys are like shooting. And around

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.840
 that time, this is just luck, this isn't supernatural, a train pulls up to the water tower, railroad

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.840
 bill jumps in the train, hijacks it to make his getaway. But he hated the train company so much.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:14.320
 He drove the train about 200 yards, stopped it, got off the train, and started another gun battle

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.720
 with the people in the shed. And he kept shooting at them until he ran out of ammo and then just

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.800
 took off. Eventually, more law enforcement got called in, a sheriff was killed. At that point,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.440
 the reward was raised to $1,250, which in today's money was $34,000. So everyone was out looking

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.400
 for this guy. You had Pinkerton detectives, you had vigilantes, bounty hunters, law enforcement,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:42.720
 railroad officials, just normal dudes or shotguns. He ends up getting cornered in a swamp, and 100

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:48.000
 men are on his tail. Now these are all different groups. So some of them are going to be expert

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.680
 trackers, some of them are just going to be moonshine people. Not like they're made of moonshine,

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.720
 but you know, like people who drink a lot of moonshine. It's much easier to evade one group of

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:06.240
 people that are working as a group than it is to have to outrun basically 100 different battle

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.720
 plans. Every group's searching for him on his own. For five days, he evades them in the swamp. And

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.640
 that's again why people are like, "Yep, told ya, he's a shapeshifter." I can imagine like these

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.480
 hillbillies walking through a swamp looking for this dude, and there's just this giant tree there

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.400
 with like these cartoon eyes just like looking at him and he's like "hehehehe" and then once they leave

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.680
 he turns back into a human and runs away. Or he like turns into a frog, I guess it's not an

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.320
 animated object. He turns into a frog that doesn't move, so that's inanimate. I kind of probably

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.080
 pushed in the boundaries there. But anyway, so he does all this stuff. He eventually does meet his

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:51.120
 end. He's at like a convenience store, like an old-timey shop, and two different teams of vigilantes

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.120
 come at the same time and they riddle him full of bullets and he dies. And you go, "well that's proof

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.840
 that he's not a shapeshifter." However, I will argue that maybe he's simply shapeshifted into a dead body

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.680
 to keep everyone. That's inanimate, right? And then afterwards he jumped out of his grave. Actually,

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.920
 I know for a fact that's not true, because his body was on display for so long in so many different

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.280
 cities that judges had to say, "you can't, you have to stop displaying this guy's body." He was that

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.760
 big of a local legend, that big of an outlaw. The people loved him, law enforcement hated him.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.840
 Whether or not he was a shapeshifter is definitely up for debate. I'd like to think that he was. I

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.560
 think that makes the world more interesting. He should have shapeshifted into a bulletproof vest

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:34.080
 at the end, but anyways, so again, he was such a local figure that they're actually, I believe it

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:41.840
 was in the 20s, they wrote a ballot for railroad bill. A little ballot. And I'm going to sing a

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.800
 part of it for you. Now, I can't play it for you, because copyright, even though it was in the 1920s,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:52.960
 the only recording I have is copyrighted, but the lyrics themselves are not copyrighted.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:59.520
 Railroad bill up on a hill, light and cigar with the $10 bill. Now, before you criticize the lyrics,

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.240
 again, this is an old-timey song. So it's not like these guys are coming out with their A-game.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.880
 Like, this was, these people were like, "damn, he rhymed hill with bill and bill again." But anyways,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:18.080
 railroad bill up on a hill, light and cigar with the $10 bill. Railroad bill took my wife.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:26.480
 If I don't like it, gonna take my life. Not only is he a shapeshifter, not only is he a train

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.760
 bandit, not only is he a, well, not modern-day Robin Hood, but not only is he an American Robin Hood,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:38.240
 he also cucks you. Yep. So that's the story of railroad bill. Now, imagine that story I just

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:44.400
 told you expounded to 20 minutes and you'll understand why I cut out a bunch of stuff. And

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.000
 also, I went on too long talking about that. I can't, I didn't have room to talk about our next

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.040
 story. So let's go ahead and move on to our next story here. We're going to England. We spent a

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.680
 lot of time in England. We spent a lot of time in South America and we've spent a lot of time in

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.960
 England. I'd like to do some more like Australia, Eastern European stuff, African stuff. We spent

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.680
 a little bit of time in Africa. Crazy Cryptid Week was there, but now we're back in England. And

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.840
 we're going a little bit back in time here, which tends to happen. I don't know. Every time I go to

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:18.960
 England, I get caught in some sort of time warp. 1920s. Now, in Gillingham, England, which is in

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.200
 the states, they don't call them states over there or whatever, they call them like the cities are

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:29.680
 called shires and the states are called counties or something like that. But anyways, in the shire of,

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.760
 and someone's like totally like, no, that's not true at all. But in the shire slash town of Gillingham,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.200
 in the 1920s, they had the Gillingham Fair. And one of the highlights of the Gillingham Fair was

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:47.120
 they would build this three story structure out of wood and canvas. And you're thinking that seems

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.160
 incredibly dangerous. That seems very flammable. Uh-huh. So they built this three story structure

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.720
 out of wood and canvas, and it was for a firefighters demonstration. And they had this thing. It's

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.000
 called the bridal party rescue. I don't know if that's what it's actually called, but that's what

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.920
 we're going to call it. They had this event that was a bridal party rescue where you had

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.440
 two firefighters who would act as newlyweds. So they'd go up there. I don't know if they put on

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.200
 tuxes and wedding dresses because they're both dudes because this is the 1920s. But anyways,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:18.400
 they go up there and they have a bridal party and they're in the structure. And this is out of

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.000
 fair. So people are watching this like you have this huge crowd watching this event. And then you

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.600
 have flares go off and smoke go off and everyone goes, oh no, help me, help me, firemen of Gillingham.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.920
 The firefighters come and they bring out their ladders and they rescue the people out of the

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.640
 structure and everyone claps and they're like, well, these are very efficient firemen. And then

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.840
 they start a real fire and they burn the structure down and they just put it out with their hoses.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.880
 And everyone would be like, yay, there's nothing else to do back then. I mean, like that was the

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.720
 highlight of your year when you got to see that happen. And went off without a hitch for quite a

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.960
 while. So but eventually there was a hitch so you know where this story is going in 1929. So now

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.720
 we're on July 11th, 1929. It's fair time. Everyone's like, oh dude, are you going to go see the canvas

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.920
 structure burned out? Oh yeah, totally man. Of course I'm going to see the canvas structure

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:11.440
 burned down. That's all I'm going to do this year. So they go out there and for this bridal party this

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:19.040
 time you had nine boys and six men. So you had two of them or the bride in the groom. And the

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:24.080
 rest of people were pretending to be the wedding guests. And for what, and this is where the story

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:31.600
 goes weird and we're going to explore this more. But for whatever reason, the smoke bombs and the

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:38.720
 flares, they don't go off. Instead the second stage starts. So this people are in this building.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.080
 You have a total of 15 people here. The fire starts. Now that's supposed to happen after

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:50.720
 everyone's out of the building. Again, it's three stories. It's 40 feet tall and it catches on fire.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.880
 Now it doesn't take a rocket science to know that canvas and wood are incredibly flammable.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:02.400
 The building just ignites. Now the firefighters on the scene, on the ground, who were there to be

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.280
 there to do the mock rescue and then put the fire out afterwards, they realize immediately what's

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.720
 going on. They just flamesshoot out the building. They look at each other, drop their tea in crumpets,

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.160
 grab their gear and start trying to put out the fire. But the audience thinks that it's part of

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.360
 the show. They're like, "Man, special effects have gotten really good this year. Normally there's

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.320
 just smoke coming out of the windows, but look at those flames go." The audience is cheering at this

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.600
 fire. The people in the building are screaming for help. They immediately know that things have gone

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.120
 sideways because some of the adults in the building are firefighters. They immediately begin screaming

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.120
 for help and the audience is now even clapping even harder. They're like, "This is the best performance

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.360
 those people have ever given." Normally they're just like, "Help me, help me." But these guys actually

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:51.120
 seem like they're crying for their lives. This is amazing. The crowd is cheering them on. Firefighters

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.800
 are probably just like, "Shut up. Actually, the firefighters probably didn't even hear him. They're

00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:01.040
 just blasting this thing with water." And the audience continued to applaud until the first boy

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:08.880
 jumped off the top of the building on fire, smashed into the ground. And the audience is kind of like

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:15.040
 slowly stopped clapping. They're watching this and then another boy jumps out of the building on fire,

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.120
 crashes into the ground. Of the people who were there, so there was 15 people in the building,

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:25.440
 of the people who were there, 13 of them died at the scene. Horribly burned, choked out on smoke,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:33.440
 two of them leapt to their deaths on fire, two were severely injured, and then they died later.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:38.080
 So out of the 15 people in the building, all 15 died. They don't know how the fire started. They

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.680
 don't know who started the fire. They don't know what happened at the event. They just know it was

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.600
 this horrible tragedy. Basically, the city shut down. There was this huge funeral. They're all

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:54.080
 buried in the same location. So I read about that event, and I was like, "That's just a tragic event."

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.960
 But what's weird? It is weird that all this time we don't know who started the fire. You think that

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.960
 would be one detail you would know, because if someone's job was to start the fire, because

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.480
 they're firemen, they're not like mucking about. They're not just throwing matches and stuff,

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.480
 waiting to go off. They're very controlled to burn, but no firefighter was ever accused or

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.400
 brought to trial or anything like that. The fire just started. And you go, "Okay, just a tragic

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:21.360
 coincidence, technological failure." Whatever. 22 years later, in the same town, Shire, of Gillingham,

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:28.960
 there was a bus and a streetlight out of all the streetlights in the world that could have

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.960
 won out. One streetlight goes off. A bus driver's driving down the road. This bus driver worked

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:41.280
 for a company called the Chatham and District Traction Company. They needed a... Someone needs

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.760
 to invent a time machine and go back in time and teach people how to name stuff. The Chatham and

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:51.840
 District Traction Company, which you can actually shorten district traction to distraction,

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.600
 auto-lean up. Street lights out. Bus drivers are going down the road. Now normally it would

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.640
 want to be a huge issue, but something else was going on in the street. And also the bus driver

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.080
 did had his sidelights on, but he didn't have his headlights on, which was actually at the time

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.920
 totally legal. You didn't have to drive their headlights on. And this was later, obviously,

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.320
 and that's why the streetlight being out and him not having headlights on is an issue. While he's

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:26.240
 driving this bus down the road, there is a march. There is a parade of 52 young kids of the Royal

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:33.600
 Marines volunteer cadet corps between the ages of 9 and 13 marching down the street. And they're

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.720
 nice little uniforms. They're dark uniforms. That doesn't help. He doesn't see them with the street

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:45.040
 light being out and him not having any headlights. He plows into them. The bus driver didn't even know

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.720
 he hit him. It was a double-decker bus and they're little kids. So it's tragic as that is. I mean,

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.920
 it's... Be hard to see. He runs over him and he doesn't even realize that he has hit anything

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.760
 until he started to feel the car wobbling like he was driving over loose stones,

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:07.440
 which would have been bodies caught up in the wheels. Witnesses at the scene say,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.840
 "We don't believe that because the minute he impacted them, you just hear it screaming everywhere."

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:17.440
 They believe that he knew much quicker that he had hit these kids and for whatever reason kept going.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:24.480
 Out of the... I mean, okay, now you're driving a bus down the road and there's 52 kids marching

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:31.920
 in the intersection. You have to have... This is school shooter numbers of the damage he did.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.920
 Like I imagine if a bus hits a bunch of kids at a certain point, they're going to start moving out

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.880
 of the way or if he hits a broadside, he's only going to take out a chunk of them, out of 52 kids,

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:49.520
 24 killed, 18 injured. So more than half of the kids in that group got ran over or maybe a couple

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:56.320
 got trampled. At the time, it was the highest loss of life in any road accident in British history.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:04.000
 I saw both of these events and I thought, yes, coincidence. Both of these events relied on

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.560
 just a little problem. And we see that with a lot of stuff like plane crashes, they can say it was

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.720
 just this one instrument or this could have been prevented if just this one little piece was in

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:21.440
 place or whatever. But it seems chilling that both of these events separated by 22 years in the same

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:29.840
 city with mass loss of life of a lot of kids both happened through happenstance. They both happened

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.720
 by sheer bad luck. Him not having his headlights on, like I said, that was legal at the time, so

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.960
 they didn't... they probably wouldn't have made an issue. But the street light going out and him

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.480
 running over the kids and then the light, the fire mysteriously being set before it was supposed to.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.880
 And nobody was ever held accountable for that. I was looked at these two things and I thought,

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:57.120
 this sounds very like dairy, Maine. This sounds very like a pennywise type situation. And I started

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.480
 now, again, a lot of times people go, man, you're really skeptical. But I don't always start off

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.920
 like that. So with this, I go there were 22 years apart. Let's see what happened 22 years after the

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.720
 bus accident. Let's see what happened 22 years before the Gillingham fire. Like I tried to look

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:18.160
 for some sort of pattern, some sort of pennywise style pattern. I couldn't find any, to be fair.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:24.400
 But it does seem in that short amount of time that all these kids were killed, it really does give

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:31.360
 the two stories a connected, really creepy vibe and not only were mass amounts of kids killed,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:38.560
 but the way they were killed was terribly brutal. Is it possible that the town of Gillingham is

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:45.600
 powering itself from the torment and death of children? If I wanted a liable lawsuit, I would

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:52.000
 say definitely. If I wanted to be skeptical about it, I'd say no, they're just two tragic events in

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.840
 the same area. And you can look all over the world for tragic events in the same area, and they may

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:02.720
 meet some sort of pattern. But there's a part of me that thinks that there's something a little

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:08.400
 more creepy going on there. I have no proof of that. And it hasn't been replicated. I can't prove it.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:16.160
 I just get it. It just gives me a creepy feeling, a creepy hunch that there is something there,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:23.040
 or more importantly, there was something there that made these events happen. I have no proof of

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:30.160
 that whatsoever. At all. Just a hunch. But sometimes a hunch is all you really have.
