1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,560
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,160
 We often hear stories of people seeing ghosts.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,680
 But what happens when the ghost sees you?

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,000
 And then we finish off close encounters of a canine kind week

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,160
 with one more showdown between a dog and an alien.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,960
 When a hiker and his seven-year-old golden retriever

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,480
 are up in the mountains of Washington,

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,360
 they're just expecting to enjoy the beauty of nature.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,360
 Little did they know they were about to be thrust

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,360
 into a deadly battle between a loyal dog

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,840
 and an alien that defied the laws of physics.

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,360
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 [music]

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,360
 Hey, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,360
 I'm your host Jason Carvin, or I'm Having a Great Day.

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,360
 I hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
 I'm gonna apologize in advance.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,360
 I am recording this episode apparently during rush hour.

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,360
 In my neighborhood, every single car that can possibly drive by

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,360
 will drive by at least twice while I'm trying to record this episode.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,360
 But someone who's always welcome to make a bunch of noise

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
 while I'm recording, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
 is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
 Everyone, give it up for Thomas the Dink Engine.

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
 Woohoo, yeah! Woohoohoohoo!

39
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,360
 Come on in, chug your way on in to Dead Rabbit Command.

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
 Thomas the Dink Engine, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,360
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,360
 That helps out so much. It really does help the show grow.

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
 Thomas the Dink Engine, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
 Everyone, climb on board this magical floating vehicle

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,360
 and take us all the way out to Florida.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,360
 The reason why we're in Florida, let's take a look at this story.

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
 It's actually very short, but it's super interesting.

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,360
 I find stories where we have that Venn diagram of the world of the paranormal

51
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,360
 and the world of just generalized high strangeness combining.

52
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,360
 And I guess it's kind of the same thing, but let me be more specific.

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,360
 Ghosts and time rifts. That type of thing, right?

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 Ghosts and portals to another world. Technically you could say ghosts.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,360
 I mean, they're the horror portal to the other world, the underworld.

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,360
 But no, let's take a look at this story and again, it's like, it's so short.

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,360
 It's almost like a couple sentences, but I think we can extrapolate some stuff out of this.

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 Plus the second half of the episode's nuts and it's really long

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
 and I want to give that room to breathe, so this is a good combination.

60
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,360
 The reason why we're in Florida is there's a city called Apopka.

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,360
 And in Apopka there's a place known as the Orange Blossom Trail.

62
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,360
 And the story is thus, if you're driving down Orange Blossom Trail,

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,360
 sometimes you're driving down Orange Blossom Trail late at night,

64
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:51,360
 and you'll see a Native American warrior cross the street.

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:02,360
 But while he's crossing the street, he looks at you.

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,360
 Like, what? Is that it?

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,360
 Are you trying to set a record for World's Shortest Ghost Story?

68
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:17,360
 No, no, no, no. Let me explain it a little bit more. Let me use more words to tell the same story.

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,360
 He doesn't just cross the street. He's not like looking at you as he's crossing the street.

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,360
 He crosses the street and then looks at you.

71
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,360
 Same thing. Think about it this way.

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:39,360
 If I was crossing the street, staring, looking to see if cars were coming that way so don't get hit,

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
 you go, "Oh, he was looking the whole time."

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,360
 But imagine if I'm walking across the street and I don't look, I never look while I'm crossing the street.

75
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
 And I'm like, "Ah!"

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,360
 But the point is, is like, if I'm crossing the street and then I turn and look,

77
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,360
 something's caught my attention, as opposed to if I was constantly looking across the street.

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:06,360
 So the way I read this story, this three-sentence story that I'm not going to talk about for 15 minutes, no, it's not going to be that long.

79
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,360
 The way I saw this story was that it's possible that we have different types of ghosts.

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,360
 One of the types of ghosts is a recording of an event.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,360
 And these are what are considered non-sentient ghosts.

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,360
 This isn't actually somebody's spirit. It's for whatever reason.

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,360
 Some event happened. It could be a mineral event like underneath the earth that recorded things.

84
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,360
 What's known as the stone tape theory, some sort of magnetic geological formation that's recorded in a Venice plane over and over again.

85
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,360
 They're non-sentient. You can't go up and talk to these types of spirits.

86
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,360
 If you go to some old-timey castle in England and you see Marie Antoinette being dragged down the hallway,

87
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,360
 go, "No, no, not my head. Not my head!"

88
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,360
 That's not actually Marie Antoinette's ghost.

89
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,360
 That's a recording of the terror that she was feeling as she was being led to the chopping block.

90
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,360
 Then there are sentient ghosts or sentient spirits.

91
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,360
 And these are the ones that you can actually interact with.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,360
 These are the ones you wake up in the middle of the night because you need to get them in a night snack.

93
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,360
 You walk into your kitchen and there is a little boy crouched down in the darkest corner of your kitchen.

94
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,360
 He goes, "Help me!" and then vanishes.

95
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,360
 That could just be a recording. That could just be the reason why you're in heaven.

96
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,360
 They're like, "Hey, how'd you die?" and you're like, "Massive heart attack! Massive heart attack!"

97
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,360
 A little boy popped up in the middle of the kitchen or in the darkest corner.

98
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 The creepiest part. Probably should have been installed a nightlight over there.

99
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,360
 But let's imagine you walk into your kitchen and you are getting a midnight snack and there's a little boy crouched in the corner.

100
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,360
 He goes, "Help me!" and you go, "How can I help you?"

101
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,360
 And he's like, "Oh no, he pressed me that question before I knew what I was going to answer!"

102
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
 He's like sitting there and he's like, "Hmm, how could you help me?

103
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
 Do you think you could give me some of your daughter's toys and I could play with him in the kitchen?"

104
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
 He's like, "He's being super noisy!" He's all crashed in the dolls together.

105
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,360
 He's like, "Bang, bang, bang! You die!" and you're like, "Oh man, why did I give that ghost kid all those toys?"

106
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,360
 "Oh yeah, because he's terrifying and I don't want to die in my sleep.

107
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,360
 I don't want him to crawl up my nostrils and possess me."

108
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:27,360
 Sometimes ghosts can be recordings and the interesting thing is you don't really know which ones are which until you interact with them or try to interact with them.

109
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
 You don't know.

110
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:37,360
 But the ones that you can do generally like EVPs with where you're recording it, those would be interactive spirits.

111
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
 Sentient spirits.

112
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,360
 This ghost, I think, is neither.

113
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
 Yet it acts like both.

114
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
 I've never investigated this one personally.

115
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
 These are all just hunches.

116
00:07:49,360 --> 00:08:01,360
 But it crosses the street in the exact same location every single time, which would make it seem like a recording of a non-sentient ghost, a stone-tape ghost.

117
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,360
 It crosses the street in the same place.

118
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,360
 It turns and looks each time, which would make you think it was a stone-tape ghost.

119
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:20,360
 What I think it is, and this is where I've nothing to back this up on, just call it paranormal researcher hunch, is that it's in a time loop.

120
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,360
 And the difference between that is that at one point, this is what I imagined happened.

121
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
 I feel like we've covered something like this similar before on the podcast, but I could never find it.

122
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 I've been looking for it the past couple of days.

123
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
 Trying to find it.

124
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:43,360
 What I imagine is, let's go back in time, let's go back to 1413 in Florida, and there's a Native American warrior crossing this field.

125
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
 There's no road.

126
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
 He's just crossing a field.

127
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
 He's hunting a deer.

128
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,360
 Hunting deer through Florida, or I don't know, alligator, whatever they had down there.

129
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,360
 He's hunting, and he, something, see this is the difference.

130
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,360
 If he was just looking the entire time, then he's just looking the entire time, but something catches his eye.

131
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:18,360
 He's crossing this field, something catches his eye, and he turns and he looks, and he sees a Honda Civic sitting in the middle of the field.

132
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,360
 He continues on his journey.

133
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,360
 And this time loop, he's basically seeing us in the future.

134
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
 Remember, this ghost story is repeated multiple times.

135
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
 It's not like he's trapped in a time loop.

136
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,360
 It's not like he's like, "Oh, if only I could kill that deer."

137
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,360
 But I just keep seeing all these vehicles from an era that I don't even know what a car looks like.

138
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,360
 I don't know that this is a Tesla, and that's a Ford.

139
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,360
 But I just have this weird feeling again.

140
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
 To be honest, the story could be made up.

141
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
 It could be an urban legend.

142
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:59,360
 But if this ghost, it's not a ghost, if this traveler is actually stuck in a time loop, but yet in our timeline, he walked across,

143
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:09,360
 something caught his eye, he looked, he saw a vehicle, Chevy, two guys on a motorcycle, a guy riding a horse, right?

144
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,360
 Well, you probably would have been like, "Yeah, I know what that is."

145
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,360
 Actually, not in 1413, they didn't have horses in America, but he would turn and he would look, he would see something.

146
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
 He would go on his way.

147
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,360
 And that's the main timeline we're in.

148
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,360
 And yet there's still enough.

149
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,360
 Every time we see him, it's replaying him seeing us.

150
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,360
 And each time he's seeing a different vehicle and a different group of people in said vehicle.

151
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,360
 Yet in the main timeline, he still collapses, so he only sees one.

152
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,360
 Or he only remembers one incident, I guess I should say.

153
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
 He's seeing it each time.

154
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:59,360
 Each time he looks and sees you in the vehicle, he sees it, but the timeline collapses, the wave closes, or crashes would be a better term,

155
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,360
 the wave crashes when he continues on his journey.

156
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,360
 He'll go back to his tribe and say, "Hey, I was walking across this field.

157
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,360
 I saw this four door, I saw this four door sporty electric car, newest truck by Chevy.

158
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
 He's all given the sales.

159
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,360
 What are you talking about, dude? Where's that deer you're supposed to kill?

160
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
 Oh, an alligator ate it.

161
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
 It collapses. He only remembers one.

162
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
 What are you talking about? Wait a second.

163
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,360
 You just read four sentences on Shadowlands.net.

164
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
 Yeah, I do.

165
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
 I think that's it.

166
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
 Do I have anything to back it up?

167
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
 No.

168
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:44,360
 I think I love stories where you have ghosts and feel like Jason, yeah, the stories are cool too,

169
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
 but this story is not one of them.

170
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,360
 He read four sentences and extrapolated all this stuff.

171
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,360
 I just have a feeling, which is the thing you always want every scientist to say, right?

172
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
 Every researcher, they're like, "Can you cite your evidence?"

173
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,360
 You're like, "Well, I could, but I just have a feeling."

174
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
 And everyone's like, "You know what? Well, except that.

175
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
 He has a feeling. That's all I mean."

176
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
 I don't know. I find it fascinating.

177
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,360
 If you live in Napauca, check it out.

178
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
 Here's actually to be super interesting.

179
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
 What if you drove really fast?

180
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
 Don't take this advice.

181
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
 You're like getting pulled over by the cops.

182
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
 They're like, "Why were you going 100 miles an hour?"

183
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,360
 Well, Dead Rabbit Radio told me to drive super fast down this road late at night.

184
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,360
 What if when you see the warrior crossing the road, you gun it?

185
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,360
 Maybe you could actually drive into the past.

186
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,360
 I mean, most likely you would drive into a fence or drive into a tree,

187
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
 lining the road.

188
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
 But what if you could go back into...

189
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
 1413's a little too far back for my taste.

190
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 What if you could go back to, say, 1770?

191
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
 You're driving around in your Ford pickup truck now,

192
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,360
 and you're like, "Drive to Philadelphia," and you're like, "Ben Franklin! Ben Franklin!

193
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,360
 Before you crack that bell, I'm going to tell you all about the future of America."

194
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
 And then I'm telling him all this stuff.

195
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,360
 He's like, "I don't know. I don't know if that's accurate.

196
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,360
 I'm pretty sure, good man, that I do not crack this Liberty Bell.

197
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
 I don't know where you got that part of history."

198
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
 And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure that happened."

199
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,360
 And then you get electrocuted when you tie a key to a kite.

200
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,360
 He's like, "That would kill me. What are you talking about?

201
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
 Is this what you guys are told?"

202
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 I said, "Yes. A fascinating story. Maybe involves time travel. Maybe it's just a ghost."

203
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
 And if you live in the area, maybe find out for me.

204
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,360
 Maybe travel into the past and put flyers for Dead Rabbit Radio all around the colonies.

205
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
 And that would be awesome.

206
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,360
 And you're like, "Hear ye, hear ye. Dead Rabbit Radio, have the big bell.

207
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,360
 You're ringing in people's ears as they're trying to sleep. Listen to this podcast."

208
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
 They're like, "Ah!"

209
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
 That would be great.

210
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,360
 That would be pretty funny if there was a wood carving of you doing that.

211
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,360
 Thomas the Dink Engine, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the world's famous carbonicopter.

212
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,360
 We are leaving behind at Papka.

213
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
 Take us all the way out to Washington.

214
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,360
 D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

215
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
 We're headed up to Washington.

216
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,360
 Specifically, we're headed to Snow Qualomy Pass, Washington.

217
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,360
 It's October 1996.

218
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,360
 And it's three in the afternoon. It's a beautiful sunny day.

219
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,360
 Well, I guess it's October 1996. It's pretty cold.

220
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,360
 But still, it's beautiful and the sun exists.

221
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
 The sun is shining down on this forest.

222
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,360
 And we're going to meet a man named Dr. Jonathan Reed.

223
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 He's a psychologist from Seattle.

224
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,360
 And we're also going to meet his loyal puppy, Susie, a seven-year-old golden retriever.

225
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,360
 We're like petting. We manifest long enough to pet Susie a bit.

226
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,360
 Actually, I do want to take a little bit of time here to say this.

227
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,360
 This story is pretty gross. This story is pretty gross.

228
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,360
 And if you love dogs or have a dog or have ever petted a dog, strap in.

229
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,360
 Or shut the podcast off.

230
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,360
 Because the first episode of Close Encounters of the Canine Kind Week, we covered

231
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,360
 a very neutral encounter between dogs and aliens.

232
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,360
 And the second one, we covered the story of two dogs that brutally ripped

233
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,360
 an 18-inch man into pieces.

234
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
 He was a little alien. He wasn't a human.

235
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,360
 But still, you probably shouldn't do that, dogs.

236
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,360
 So it was a draw the first episode. The dogs won the second episode.

237
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,360
 Well, in this third installment of Close Encounters of the Canine Kind,

238
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,360
 dog lovers beware.

239
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
 You're still petting Susie. You're like holding on to her.

240
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,360
 You're like, Jason, just don't tell the story. And that never happened.

241
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,360
 Jonathan, Dr. Jonathan Reed and his seven-year-old golden retriever, Susie,

242
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:05,360
 are hiking around this area. They're about an hour and a half out from their car.

243
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,360
 It's a beautiful day. Walking around, watching little blue jays land on trees

244
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,360
 and squirrels going like, "Yeah." And they're eating nuts.

245
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,360
 And it's saving some for later. They're like, "Oh, yeah, winter's coming up."

246
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,360
 "I should eat all my nuts!" "Oh, man, he's got a big stomach ache."

247
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
 He's like, "I'm just going to sit here and let my stomach rest for a couple months."

248
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
 "I'll be fine."

249
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,360
 When all of a sudden Susie ran ahead.

250
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,360
 You didn't think dogs were going to do that, right? You didn't have it on leash.

251
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
 You don't take a dog on a leash in the middle of the woods.

252
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
 And Susie's just kind of like running around and stuff like that.

253
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
 But this time Susie actually runs into the forest.

254
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,360
 Off the trail now into the forest.

255
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,360
 And Jonathan's like, "You know, Susie will be back."

256
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,360
 That's what dogs do. They probably smelled a squirrel.

257
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,360
 They probably smelled a fat squirrel who can't run because they ate too many nuts.

258
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,360
 Susie will be back soon.

259
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,360
 But when Jonathan starts to hear his dog just frantically barking,

260
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,360
 and then yelping,

261
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,360
 he realizes something's wrong.

262
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,360
 He realizes it sounds like there's a man in his forties

263
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,360
 imitating a golden retriever in the woods.

264
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,360
 That's not what a dog sounds like. Something must be terribly wrong with Susie.

265
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,360
 And Jonathan's first instinct was wildlife,

266
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,360
 which is what you would expect in the woods.

267
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,360
 What do you think? Maybe she smelled a bear?

268
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,360
 Maybe she stepped on a porcupine?

269
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
 Could be all sorts of dangers out here.

270
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
 And Jonathan's fearing the worst.

271
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 I don't think he's so much worried about a dog stepping on a porcupine.

272
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,360
 He's looking for a weapon as he's running through the woods

273
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
 towards the sound of the barking.

274
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
 And he sees this large tree branch on the ground.

275
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,360
 And he picks it up and he's like, "Ah, the mighty club."

276
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 Neanderthals used this to crack open the school.

277
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
 And I too shall use it to defend Susie, no matter what.

278
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
 I don't think he gave that monologue.

279
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
 He stops and he poses with the stick.

280
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,360
 He's like, "Stick, branch, weapon of all mankind,

281
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
 the first weapon we've ever used."

282
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
 He picked it up and he started running.

283
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,360
 He's continuing to run and he estimates that from the trail

284
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 to the sound of the barking, it's about 150 yards.

285
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
 So imagine that he's also out of breath.

286
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
 That's what, like a football field in a half.

287
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,360
 He's like, "Ah, he's all stepping on porcupines the whole way."

288
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
 "Ah, ah, ah."

289
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
 But he kept going.

290
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
 He's got to save his dog.

291
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,360
 He runs over and he sees Susie standing in kind of like a bit of a clearing.

292
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,360
 And she is continuing to position her body around

293
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,360
 like she's trying to find something.

294
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
 And she's looking for something.

295
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
 And she's looking for something.

296
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,360
 She's trying to find something.

297
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,360
 And she's barking in anger,

298
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,360
 yelping in fear and gnashing her teeth.

299
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
 "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah."

300
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,360
 Trying to bite something.

301
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,360
 And he's watching Susie do this.

302
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,360
 He can't really see where the threat is,

303
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,360
 but that's when he realizes it's everywhere at once.

304
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:23,360
 He's watching a figure move around Susie so fast.

305
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,360
 It looks like the air itself is being disturbed around it.

306
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,360
 It's like even more faint than a blur.

307
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,360
 He can almost just see the trails of the motion of where it once was.

308
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,360
 It's whipping circles around the dog.

309
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
 He's watching this play out and that's what Susie is.

310
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,360
 Susie is trying to get a bite of this thing.

311
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,360
 And this thing is constantly moving away from Susie's jaws.

312
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 But at the same time, Jonathan realizes that this, whatever this is, could just leave.

313
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
 Could just leave.

314
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,360
 The fact is trying to outmaneuver Susie,

315
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,360
 he realizes that whatever is moving so quickly,

316
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,360
 it's like he can see the air being disturbed around it.

317
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
 He's trying to also get his dog.

318
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
 The thing could just leave.

319
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
 It's obviously fast enough, right?

320
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
 But as Susie is trying to get a bite,

321
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,360
 this blur is moving away from her mouth

322
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 to almost try to get a good strike in itself.

323
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,360
 And he's watching this play out.

324
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,360
 And it's not long before, almost in an instant,

325
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,360
 this happens instantaneously,

326
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:43,360
 Susie is able to reach out and lock her jaws onto this creature's forearm.

327
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,360
 But the reason why Susie was able to strike a blow

328
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,360
 was because this creature had stopped

329
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,360
 because it was now ready to attack as well.

330
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,360
 It could move, it could evade,

331
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,360
 but if it wanted to take down Susie,

332
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
 it had to come to a complete stop.

333
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,360
 And that's what Jonathan is seeing going on right here.

334
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,360
 He said Susie grabbed a hold of this thing's forearm.

335
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,360
 And he gets a better view of it later on in the story,

336
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
 but I'm going to give you the description of it now

337
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 just so you can kind of picture what's about to happen.

338
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,360
 He describes it when he's able to get a closer view of it.

339
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
 We'll get to that in a second,

340
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
 but he didn't take all this detail in right now.

341
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,360
 These are happening way too quick for him to be able to take all this detail.

342
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,360
 But he describes this as a four foot tall humanoid.

343
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,360
 The term he ended up using as he became more comfortable with the UFO community,

344
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,360
 at first he was just saying it was like this four foot tall humanoid

345
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:52,360
 with bulging eyes, like these big bulging eyes that were a...

346
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,360
 not like a pitch black, like you would traditionally picture a gray alien's eyes,

347
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,360
 but it was more of a lighter eye, these big bulging light colored eyes.

348
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:13,360
 He uses the term nowadays, he said it looked like a reptilian gray hybrid.

349
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,360
 But at the time he wasn't huge in the UFO community when he first saw this.

350
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,360
 So he probably knew what a gray alien was just from,

351
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,360
 because X-Files was really big at the time,

352
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,360
 but nowadays when they talk about the story they say it was a reptilian gray hybrid.

353
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,360
 So you can picture this, it's a four foot tall reptilian gray hybrid,

354
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 bulging eyes, but a kind of a lighter color, not that pitch black.

355
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,360
 It was also wearing a black jumpsuit that covered it from feet to neck.

356
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,360
 Everything else was basically wearing this black jumpsuit

357
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,360
 and it was just one piece with no seams in it.

358
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,360
 Again, he can't see the seams from where he's at as his dog is locked in mortal combat with this alien.

359
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,360
 He's like, "That's so bizarre, I don't see any stitching on that suit."

360
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
 But this is, I wanted you to be able to picture this.

361
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 So Suzy has a hold of this alien's forearm and the alien...

362
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:16,360
 Sounded like the drop ship was coming for me.

363
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,360
 Aliens have finally figured out where I broadcast this podcast from.

364
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,360
 Suzy had the alien by the forearm, the alien at the same time,

365
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,360
 reached out and grabbed Suzy's snout.

366
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:43,360
 In a single motion, the alien began to pry off Suzy's jaws from his arm.

367
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,360
 And then it turned and looked directly at Jonathan,

368
00:23:52,360 --> 00:24:06,360
 who's standing there at that huge tree branch just watching this creature attack his dog, attack his loyal companion.

369
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:13,360
 And the alien looked at Jonathan with what Jonathan described as murderous eyes.

370
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 He saw the human emotion, saw the hate and the anger in this creature's eyes.

371
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:30,360
 This alien has now grabbed a hold of the top of Suzy's jaw, the snout, and begins to pull her head back.

372
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:37,360
 But really, the lower jaw is still underneath his forearm.

373
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,360
 It bit onto the alien's arm and now he's pulling the top of her snout back.

374
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:53,360
 He frees his arm and then completely tears off the top of Suzy's skull.

375
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:03,360
 In an instant, just removes the top jaw, the eyes, the brain,

376
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,360
 and shreds it off of Suzy's body.

377
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,360
 Jonathan's stunned and horrified.

378
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:24,360
 He's staring at Suzy's body, sands the top of her head, right?

379
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:31,360
 He's just watched Suzy's body kind of take a step or two and then collapse in a heap.

380
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:43,360
 What happens then is something that Jonathan's looking at the remains of his dog

381
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,360
 and the gore involved in such a violent act.

382
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,360
 He can still see the tongue, he can still see the lower jaw, everything else is intact.

383
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
 The top of its head has been removed.

384
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,360
 And while he's taking, I mean, such an amazing level of violence.

385
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,360
 I mean, I guess the last episode in this series, we had two aliens rip apart a little man,

386
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
 but they had no connection to little man.

387
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,360
 Little man probably had a family, people may have been watching from the bushes crying,

388
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:17,360
 but Jonathan's looking at his loyal dog, his loyal dog's corpse at this point, laying on the ground,

389
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:25,360
 and through his sorrow and his rage and his terror, he can't even begin to comprehend what's about to happen next.

390
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,360
 He said what it looked like was he's looking at Suzy's corpse, he's looking at the body of Suzy.

391
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,360
 He said it began to crumple in on itself.

392
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:53,360
 He said it was almost as if somewhere unseen within her body was a black hole

393
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,360
 because she began to compress and crumple and contort

394
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,860
 and crush into a singular point

395
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,120
 and he's watching this body go!

396
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,220
 (makes knockout sounds)

397
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,100
 This whole!

398
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,860
 I mean, golden retrievers are big dogs.

399
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,180
 Even if it was a Dwawa it would be pretty impressive,

400
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,500
 it would be pretty freaky.

401
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,920
 But to watch this dog basically melt into a singular point

402
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,520
 and melt's not even the right word,

403
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,360
 like getting sucked into a black hole

404
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,960
 is probably the best descriptor for it.

405
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,120
 It just got sucked in

406
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,280
 and then all that was left on the forest floor

407
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,960
 was a small pile of white ash.

408
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:50,480
 How could you even comprehend what you just saw?

409
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,520
 Like how shocking would that be?

410
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,760
 Is bad enough your dog got its head ripped off?

411
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,960
 In such a gory fashion too, right?

412
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,080
 If someone chopped your dog's head off,

413
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,200
 that would be, it would,

414
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,240
 that would probably ruin your day, right?

415
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,400
 That would be horrible.

416
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,520
 But if someone ripped its head off,

417
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,360
 you're like, please go talk about killing dogs

418
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,600
 and we know you've had bad experiences with dogs

419
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,720
 in the past, I'm not pro killing dog by the way.

420
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,160
 I'm not pro killing dog

421
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,960
 in any, in any way, shape, or form.

422
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,480
 No, I'm not pro killing dogs.

423
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,760
 I'm just saying that there are,

424
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,160
 if you came out in your backyard,

425
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,520
 you're like, okay, I'll just,

426
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,040
 I won't start listing ways

427
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,200
 that you can find your dog's head.

428
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,880
 I love dogs.

429
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,000
 I do.

430
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,440
 I'm not, I don't wanna make it sound

431
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,840
 like I'm some sort of maniac.

432
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,040
 I was like, I can't wait to tell this story.

433
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,280
 Anyways, let's move past the dead dog.

434
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,560
 It would be shocking, that's what I was gonna say.

435
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,240
 Jonathan, finally his rage overcomes his shock

436
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,740
 and he begins charging this alien,

437
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,240
 tree branch firmly in hand.

438
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,760
 He begins charging the alien

439
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,000
 and he sees the alien kind of takes a step back

440
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,500
 and he figures it's going to attack me.

441
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,960
 Whatever happens next, I'm doing it in self-defense.

442
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,440
 He's running towards this little guy,

443
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,920
 four foot tall dog murderer

444
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,920
 and he brings that tree branch down on his head so hard.

445
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,480
 Splits its skull right open.

446
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,200
 And he said, he goes,

447
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
 I thought it was going to attack me.

448
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,520
 It took a step back when I was running towards it

449
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,840
 and I thought it was gonna attack me.

450
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,280
 Maybe it was gonna start running around in front of me

451
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,480
 and also get behind me, find my weakness, rip me to pieces.

452
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,320
 I didn't know, he goes,

453
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
 I figured it was gonna kill me too.

454
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,800
 It already killed my dog.

455
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,440
 I had to hit this thing as hard as I could

456
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,880
 to save my own life.

457
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,080
 And that's totally possible, right?

458
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,400
 If this thing had started moving again,

459
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,280
 there's no way Jonathan could have gotten it to it.

460
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
 And he saw what happened the last time.

461
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,000
 Two living things, an alien and a creature from Earth.

462
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,520
 His dog Susie went toe to toe.

463
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:09,520
 So he came in and ferociously smashed this creature's head open

464
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,720
 and it is so violent.

465
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,400
 The way he describes this story,

466
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,440
 the way he describes these wounds,

467
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,520
 it's interesting, again,

468
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,880
 we don't see this level of violence

469
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,240
 typically in alien stories.

470
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,760
 He goes, I hit it so hard, I cracked its skull open,

471
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,520
 blood begins spurting out.

472
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,640
 I can see brain matter.

473
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,000
 This creature falls to the ground

474
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,840
 and there's just blood soaking the soil of the forest.

475
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,320
 Pieces of flesh still stuck to shattered skull

476
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,280
 just laying there on the ground.

477
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,400
 His, after everything he's seen,

478
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,280
 after everything that he's been through

479
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,560
 just in the past 10 minutes, right?

480
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,960
 Five minutes, probably, 30 seconds.

481
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,080
 I mean, this was such a short encounter.

482
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,040
 Despite everything that he'd seen previous to this,

483
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,240
 he thought when he was looking at the brain

484
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,200
 and the busted skull and the blood,

485
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,600
 he thought, oh my God, I just killed a kid.

486
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,680
 I just killed a human child who was pulling a prank.

487
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,800
 A kid was wearing a costume and I bashed his head open.

488
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,560
 Oh my God, I just killed somebody.

489
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:26,800
 And this is a super interesting reaction.

490
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,240
 He actually goes into shock.

491
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,480
 That's not the interesting part.

492
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,840
 I imagine that would happen.

493
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,280
 He goes into shock.

494
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,680
 He sits on the ground.

495
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,720
 He's feeling completely nauseous.

496
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,880
 And despite everything that he's seen previous to this,

497
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,800
 right, I'm not talking about his life experiences.

498
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,120
 Again, I'm talking about just past minute or two.

499
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,960
 This thing moving completely fast,

500
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,080
 ripping his dog's head in half,

501
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,600
 turning the dog into ash

502
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,880
 with some sort of internalized miniature black hole.

503
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,680
 He goes, I think I just killed a kid.

504
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,640
 Now kids these days are on some crazy things,

505
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,560
 but black holes are not one of them.

506
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,400
 He honestly sits there for a while and he thinks,

507
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,120
 oh my God, my career's over.

508
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,000
 Like, I'm gonna go to prison.

509
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,920
 I murdered someone.

510
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,280
 How am I gonna explain this to people?

511
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,640
 That's so interesting because obviously,

512
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,920
 like at this point is when we get the description

513
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,760
 of the creature.

514
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,360
 When he bashes its head in,

515
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,720
 that's when he says it had this suit on

516
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,080
 and it would have these bull-gene eyes.

517
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,160
 The bull-gene eyes are probably

518
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,360
 'cause you just bashed its brains and the eyes are popping out.

519
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,400
 But this is when he gets a close up view of this alien.

520
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,360
 And I'm wondering if that is some sort of

521
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,500
 self-defense technique for aliens.

522
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,160
 We've covered stories before

523
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,600
 where people have had their guns drawn on aliens

524
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,640
 and guns drawn on cryptids

525
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,160
 and they can't pull the trigger.

526
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,200
 Not because they haven't changed a heart.

527
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,480
 These are experienced hunters

528
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
 that are out in the middle of the woods

529
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,960
 that have a bizarre encounter

530
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,960
 and they literally cannot pull the trigger.

531
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,200
 They want to, but they physically cannot.

532
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,940
 We covered a story recently about two hunters

533
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,000
 who went out to go kill wild boars

534
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,840
 who encountered a wolf man, a werewolf,

535
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,160
 and they didn't remember dropping their guns,

536
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,280
 but they did.

537
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,720
 Like they were ready to shoot other animals

538
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,560
 and kill them.

539
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,360
 That's why they went out there.

540
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,960
 And when they got back home,

541
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,720
 one of their wives was like, "Where are your guns?"

542
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,400
 And they didn't realize that they had left them there.

543
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,240
 Is this some sort of self-defense mechanism?

544
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,640
 Because obviously kids can't run so fast they're a blur.

545
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,920
 Although some parents may argue with me on that.

546
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
 Kids can't run so fast that they're a blur.

547
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,120
 They definitely can't rip the skulls off of dogs.

548
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,320
 And then the dog body just shrinks into nothingness.

549
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,760
 But he's sitting there for a good while

550
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,360
 and he's thinking, "Oh my God, I just killed a kid.

551
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,560
 I just killed a kid."

552
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:55,620
 Eventually though, he starts to realize

553
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,520
 that what has happened here is truly a bizarre event.

554
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:05,300
 And that is a creature of some sort.

555
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,880
 Alien, possibly some sort of cryptid government laboratory.

556
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,200
 Who knows, but that is not a human.

557
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,460
 He starts to kind of come to his senses.

558
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,900
 That's when he begins taking photographs.

559
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,060
 He was up in the middle of the woods.

560
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,900
 It was a beautiful day.

561
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,800
 He figured, "I'll bring my camera with me."

562
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,200
 Brought out with the rest of his gear.

563
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,680
 He begins to take photos of it.

564
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,400
 There are photos of this alien.

565
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,800
 Takes photos of this thing.

566
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,700
 And at that point, he begins to hear

567
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,540
 this strange humming coming through the forest.

568
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,700
 He encounters it like as if the story

569
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,340
 could not get any weirder.

570
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,440
 I found out about this story from

571
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,180
 the thing about it docs.com.

572
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,780
 They got it from a book called "Unsolved UFO Mysteries,"

573
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,460
 which I bought a copy of just so I could get more details

574
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,300
 on this story.

575
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,260
 I found this fascinating.

576
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,340
 And the book got it from, "Dr. Reed had called into

577
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,660
 coast to coast AM with Art Bell and actually had told

578
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,240
 this story on the radio."

579
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,600
 He had multiple call-ins about this story.

580
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,360
 We'll get to more of that in a second.

581
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,360
 But he sees or hears something in the woods nearby.

582
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,120
 He goes out there and sees a,

583
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,600
 what he describes as a black obelisk

584
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,020
 floating about three feet off the ground.

585
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:22,520
 He described as being 10 feet tall, four feet wide,

586
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,400
 letting off this strange humming sound.

587
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,040
 He's taking photographs of that.

588
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,120
 He walked up to it, he touched it.

589
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,460
 I guess probably he still is in shock.

590
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,900
 At this point, it's been about an hour or two

591
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,860
 since the encounter.

592
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,220
 Like he was sitting there for that long,

593
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,260
 trying to convince himself that he didn't actually

594
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,100
 kill another human.

595
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,200
 He goes up, he touches this obelisk.

596
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,580
 And the humming stopped.

597
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
 And then he said the humming returned again,

598
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,460
 but this time it sounded friendlier.

599
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,800
 And then he slipped and said that he slapped the obelisk

600
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,680
 and his hand began to burn.

601
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,000
 So he's like, okay, I'm done with the obelisk stuff.

602
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,160
 I don't know what this is.

603
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,660
 It's getting late.

604
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,000
 Again, it was three when all of this started around 3 p.m.

605
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,200
 He's been sitting out here for a couple hours.

606
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,260
 He's still an hour and a half from his car.

607
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,560
 And he's like, I gotta get back to the car.

608
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,400
 I gotta get back to the car.

609
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
 I don't know what else is out here.

610
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,000
 There's an alien killing my dog.

611
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 There's this, there's this giant floating hand burning thing.

612
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,060
 I definitely don't want it to be dark around this.

613
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,360
 So he's like, okay, I'm gonna time to hike back to my car.

614
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,760
 And again, and just kind of a weird, I don't know,

615
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,680
 you could just be a human or you could just still be

616
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,520
 in shock.

617
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,960
 He gets back to the site of the alien showdown

618
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,580
 and he goes, I better bury this guy.

619
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,600
 I should bury this alien, right?

620
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,800
 I can't leave it out here.

621
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,760
 I can't turn it into a pile of ash.

622
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,520
 He realizes he doesn't have a shovel,

623
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,060
 but he does have a thermo blanket.

624
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,280
 It's one of those foil blankets.

625
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,000
 And he goes, you know, what's even better

626
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,720
 than burying an alien?

627
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,040
 Bringing it home.

628
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,960
 So he threw that little four foot alien

629
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,560
 on top of the thermo blanket and then carried it

630
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,400
 like a hobo, like just bundled it up.

631
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,320
 And he said it was incredibly light, not the blanket.

632
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,720
 This is an advertisement for the thermo blanket.

633
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,120
 He said the body of this alien only weighed around 50 pounds.

634
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,320
 Now 50 pounds, so he has an hour and a half hike

635
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,480
 back to his car and it's getting darker rapidly,

636
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,600
 but he does wrap this alien up in the blanket,

637
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,040
 throw it over his shoulder

638
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,760
 and carries it through the woods,

639
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,880
 back to his car, opens up his trunk

640
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,160
 and tosses the alien inside.

641
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,700
 And as he's driving back to his home in Seattle,

642
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:16,120
 he begins to think, you know what the best outcome would be?

643
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,080
 When I pull up to my home,

644
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,620
 I open the trunk and there's nothing in there.

645
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:28,040
 This was all just some sort of horrible dream.

646
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:34,300
 But little did he know the nightmare was just beginning.

647
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:41,580
 I don't do many two-part episodes on Dead Rabbit Radio,

648
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,840
 but this story gets even weirder

649
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,680
 and I wanted to save the rest,

650
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,540
 though there's a whole other part of the story.

651
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,220
 Now we've changed locations like a good horror movie,

652
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,060
 started off in the woods, now it's in the suburbs.

653
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,300
 We're gonna see what happens at Dr. Reed's house.

654
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,060
 We're also gonna take a look at,

655
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,900
 there's some people who say the story's completely made up.

656
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,420
 There's a UFO watchdog group that has taken,

657
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,580
 particular, it's very interesting,

658
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,660
 and out of all of the, the story may be made up, right?

659
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,940
 I will say this, I wasn't able to find the photograph yet

660
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,580
 of this alien's body, I did find a YouTube video.

661
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,180
 (laughs)

662
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,820
 I listen, dude, I've tied up all my notes for this,

663
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,300
 all my notes for this story, and I was like,

664
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,180
 I'll do the rip, the dog apart, this is crazy.

665
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,620
 I know my listeners are gonna love this.

666
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,220
 And then after I got everything prepped,

667
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,900
 I go, oh, there's a YouTube video of the alien, what?

668
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,140
 And then I looked it up and I was like,

669
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,220
 (laughs)

670
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,380
 I was like, oh, okay.

671
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,780
 So there is a whole other side to the story.

672
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,320
 There's actually two more sides of the story,

673
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,380
 but we'll have it wrapped up in the next episode.

674
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,020
 We'll talk about what happened when he brought

675
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,420
 the alien home, and then we'll talk about,

676
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,500
 there are people who say this whole thing was fate.

677
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,380
 Everything was fate.

678
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,940
 And what's interesting though,

679
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,500
 is there's only one group that's saying that.

680
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,500
 This isn't a super disputed case,

681
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,860
 a lot of people go, no, yeah,

682
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,700
 (laughs)

683
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,060
 the YouTube video's kind of goofy,

684
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,700
 YouTube video's kind of goofy,

685
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,380
 but there's a lot of people who say this story

686
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,780
 is 100% authentic, and then there's one UFO,

687
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,700
 a watchdog group that completely says that

688
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,380
 not only is this story fake, it's actually a scam,

689
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,820
 and that involves identity theft,

690
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,060
 or changing identities, all sorts of crazy stuff.

691
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,180
 So we're gonna take a look at that

692
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,300
 on the next episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

693
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,820
 I'll put the YouTube video,

694
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,620
 I'll put the YouTube video in the show notes,

695
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,100
 and they're like, oh man, that story was so good.

696
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,260
 The story is good, might be true,

697
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,940
 might just be a bad video.

698
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,340
 Who knows, maybe the FBI made the video

699
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,360
 like that on purpose, disinformation.

700
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,900

 You don't have to listen to it every day,

706

 I'm glad you listened to it today,

707

 have a great weekend guys.

708
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,440
 (upbeat music)

709
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,020
 (upbeat music)

710
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:33,960
 - What makes for a great vacation?

711
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,800
 Depends on who you ask.

712
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,320
 Are you looking to get away or bring everyone together?

713
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,480
 Do you wanna get outside and play?

714
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,840
 Or see a play at the plate?

715
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,080
 Fortunately, however you operate,

716
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,520

719
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,000
