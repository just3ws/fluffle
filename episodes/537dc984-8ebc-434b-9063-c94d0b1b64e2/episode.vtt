WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.280
 Is it possible that being abducted by aliens

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.880
 makes it less likely that you believe in Bigfoot?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.080
 And then we take a look at the terrifying phenomenon

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.280
 known as the Dark City.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.680
 Is it possible that at any moment, no matter where you're at

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.880
 or what time of day it is,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.480
 the entire world can be shrouded in darkness?

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.880
 And that's only the beginning of the mystery.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.680
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.280
 I don't know what it's called.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 Actually, I'm a walk-in radio.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.880
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.080
 I'm your host, Jason Carvener.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.880
 And I hope you guys have some awesome plans for your weekend.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.680
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.280
 So first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.080
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for Valencia,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.080
 the researcher.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.680
 Woo-hoo! Yeah, walking on in Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.880
 Shut the door. Shut the door.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.480
 It's really cold.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 You're letting all the heat out.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.080
 Valencia, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.080
 If you guys can't spread the Patreon, you can do what Valencia did.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.280
 She has been making sure that people know about Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.680
 That's another great way to help the show grow.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 It really, really is.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.080
 Tell your friends, tell your family, put up flyers around town.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.680
 All of these are great ways to spread the word of the show.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.080
 And that helps the show grow.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.680
 And also, let's take a look at our submission for Fan Art Friday.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.080
 This is from Beetle Babe.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.880
 Beetle Babe recently got as a gift one of the tumblers.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.480
 I think that's a tumbler or a coffee mug or something like that.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.480
 But it's from the Dead Rabbit Radio merch shop.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.280
 Beetle Babe got this as a gift and they absolutely love it.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.080
 And I'm so glad that my merchandise is selling.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.080
 But it's really cool to get a photograph of some merch.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080
 That's really cool.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.880
 I don't have one of those myself.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.680
 I have a shirt and I have some other stuff.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.280
 I think I got a sticker from them as well.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280
 But great.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.380
 I just love this image and I love that people are so passionate about the show that they're

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.880
 getting stuff as gifts.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.580
 Like that's just so cool.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.380
 You guys are a really cool group of people.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.180
 I was thinking about that the other day because I interacted with a lot of you guys on Reddit

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.480
 or through email or through YouTube comments or through the export.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.280
 What a fantastic group.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280
 What a fantastic group.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.480
 I'm very proud to have you guys on my side.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.680
 Valencia, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.380
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:07.480
 Let's drive all the way out to a crop circle.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.480
 Driving down and making new.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.280
 There's like scientists trying to study it.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.880
 They're like, this is the best crop circle ever.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.280
 Valencia is like doing donuts, doing donuts.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.480
 I'm running it all over.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.580
 They're like, our evidence.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.780
 We're out in the middle of this corn field and I'm meeting the corn.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.780
 I'm meeting the corn.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.780
 I'm meeting the evidence.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.880
 I'm flying around and I got magical powers now.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.220
 We're out in the middle of this corn field because we're about to watch somebody get

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.220
 abducted.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.220
 This UFO is like, dude's like, dude, what's that?

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.220
 What's that?

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.220
 We're like, look, look up, dude.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.220
 It's not with me.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.220
 I'm just eating corn.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.220
 I'm not making that noise.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.780
 And all of a sudden this guy gets abducted by an alien.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.780
 He flies away.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.780
 I should have brought a camera.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.380
 This is a paranormal podcast and we're concerned about the taste of the corn.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.500
 And then we see a guy run up and he's like, oh my God, did you see that?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.020
 That guy just got abducted by aliens.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.500
 We're like, yeah, it's pretty crazy, huh?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.220
 And he's like, yeah, that's totally, that's awful.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.420
 Like, what do you think is going to happen to that dude?

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.220
 I'm like, well, I'm assuming they're going to run some tests on him.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.220
 Hopefully he'll be back.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.980
 The guy's like, man, that's crazy.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.380
 And then we see a pickup truck driving through the cornfield as well.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.980
 And it pulls up in front of that second guy and out of the pickup truck jumps these dudes

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.340
 with AK-47 and ski masks.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.340
 They're all, get in the truck.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.340
 Get in the truck.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.100
 He's like, what's going on, man?

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.100
 What's going on?

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.460
 And they throw him in the back of the pickup truck and they're like hitting him with the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.460
 butts of the rifle.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.460
 And he's like, no, no, please.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.460
 I have a family.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.140
 Pick up truck drives away.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.340
 That's our true crime element for this episode.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.140
 And I'm sitting there belly full of corn and we just watched two people get abducted.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:03.580
 One abducted by an alien and one abducted by man, the most dangerous animal of all.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.580
 Recently, Zargosa University in Zargosa, Spain, we've been there before.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.700
 There's a very famous paranormal story known as the Zargosa Goblin.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.700
 I'll put it in the show notes.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.700
 We covered it.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.740
 But in Zargosa University, they recently did this study.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.980
 It's so fascinating.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:31.700
 They wanted to know if people who were abducted by aliens suffer post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.780
 I would say probably right.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.860
 They're kidnapped.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.980
 They're brought aboard ships.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.980
 It's super traumatic.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.260
 And at the very least, even if you're brought aboard ship and they're bleep blop bloop,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.940
 we are here to bring peace among the stars.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.460
 We're this advanced race and we believe all of these crazy things, that would probably

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.500
 mess you up a little bit.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.340
 And that's assuming they're just being your friend.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.940
 It's the one where you get abducted by aliens and you're strapped down and they stick a

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.280
 hose in your mouth and they're making you ingest as clear liquid as their laser cutters

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.300
 are removing your fingertips.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.700
 That'll probably mess you up more than seeing the earth from orbit.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.820
 The Zargosa University recently did this study and they said out of 19 people that they

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.900
 were able to find who said that they were abducted by aliens.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:27.700
 Out of 19 people who claimed to be abduction survivors, 9% of them had PTSD or symptoms

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.260
 that would diagnose them as having post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.020
 So 47% based on this study.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.500
 37% of alien abduction victims have PTSD.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.420
 It's interesting because Zargosa University, the study they go, "We don't believe in aliens.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.540
 We don't believe in any of this stuff.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.540
 We don't believe in any of this stuff."

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.540
 I actually found this, I found out about this through an article in the New York Post written

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.580
 by Hannah Sparks.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.260
 So thank you for bringing this to my attention.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.140
 But I read this study and they're like, "We don't believe in aliens.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.540
 We don't believe in aliens."

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:08.340
 But it's interesting to note, they continue, that they, speaking of the alien abduction

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.180
 survivors, they believe it was a real event.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.300
 It didn't happen.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.220
 But they believe it was a real event so much so that the fear is real.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:28.380
 Even though aliens don't exist, those are their words, but even though aliens don't exist,

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:36.100
 the trauma was so real to them, they developed PTSD.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.620
 But let's look at the other guy who got kidnapped by the humans in the pickup truck.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.020
 Because they did.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.940
 Zargosa University used them as the control group.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.220
 Actually, I think they had a control group of people who had never been abducted, but

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.380
 they have the people who've been abducted by aliens and then they interviewed people

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.940
 who had been kidnapped by humans.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.380
 So they interviewed 32 people who had been kidnapped by humans.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:08.860
 How high do you think the PTSD rate is among humans who are kidnapped by other humans?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.420
 I would say 100%.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.300
 Honestly, I'd be super scared all the time.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.700
 No!

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:23.980
 It's 46% of humans who are kidnapped by other humans.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.220
 There's no doubt it wasn't a lucid dream.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.780
 They're sitting in the back of a pickup truck for three days.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.780
 All that stuff and you're tied up and then eventually you get freed.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.220
 Because otherwise you couldn't be in this study.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.620
 You're like, "Hey, I'm still kidnapped.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.220
 Do you think I can participate in this study in Zargosa University?

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.460
 It has to pay your ransom."

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.900
 They're like, "Okay, now we have some questions to ask you."

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:53.780
 Among people who had been kidnapped by other people, the PTSD rate is only 46%.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.580
 That's super low.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.820
 That's insane.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:03.780
 And it is lower than people who claim to be kidnapped by aliens.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.980
 The study was called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Suggestibility and Disassociation

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.980
 Related to Alleged Alien Abduction.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.060
 What was interesting about it, they did say that the fear is real to them.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.340
 Whether or not, they say they don't go, "Well, maybe they were abducted by aliens.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:26.060
 I think all these people are not, they didn't really get abducted by aliens, but they believe

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.060
 they do."

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.140
 I wonder if during the study the abductees, like, "You believe me, right?

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.860
 You believe that aliens exist?"

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.700
 The researchers are like, "Yeah, sure."

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.500
 But what's so interesting about this is, well, this makes sense.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.620
 The thing about if you believe the event is real and then you have PTSD because of it,

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.420
 I understand that.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.100
 It's interesting to note that it's the same.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.580
 It's a little bit higher than human abduction, which again you'd think would be 100%, but

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:59.940
 the suggestibility portion of this is really interesting.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.620
 When they did, they didn't give an exact percentage, but what they realized was that

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:14.020
 alien abductees scored lower in suggestibility, lower than the control group and lower than

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.260
 the kidnapping group.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:23.380
 They were more of a skeptic after the abduction than before.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.740
 And this kind of makes sense.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.260
 It kind of makes sense.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.900
 Let's put it this way.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.020
 You believe in Bigfoot.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.600
 You believe in ghosts.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.980
 You believe in tarot cards, psychics.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.980
 And you believe in aliens.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:47.340
 And then one day you are abducted by aliens.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.220
 It would actually make sense for you to go, "I don't believe in that other stuff."

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.060
 I've never seen a Bigfoot.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.420
 I've had sensations that might have been a ghost.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.420
 Tarot card, psychics.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.180
 I mean, there's never been any real proof, but I know aliens exist.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.900
 Because I've seen one.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.900
 I saw four.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.340
 They were surrounding my bed and getting their laser beams ready.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.660
 But I don't believe in that other stuff.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.020
 That actually makes total sense.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:20.940
 Because you had a concrete encounter with something that, yes, while it is bizarre,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.940
 you know it's real now.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:27.940
 You know that is as real as people getting kidnapped by regular people.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.620
 But then you go all that other stuff, like I've never seen any proof of that.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.820
 You think some people might think it's the other way around.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.340
 Well, if you see aliens, you go, "Well, then it all must be real."

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.620
 But that's just not the case.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.540
 It's interesting too, I was looking at this.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.820
 In 1991, there was a nationwide poll of 6,000 Americans.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:50.220
 And 119 gave answers that were indicative of alien abductions.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.220
 Basically, the poll was asking, "Have you ever done this?

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.620
 Have you ever levitated out of your bed?

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.180
 Have you ever been visited by tiny, great people?"

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.620
 It asked these questions that would make it seem like if you answered these questions,

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.100
 that maybe you've been abducted by aliens, even if you wouldn't say that.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.100
 Even if you wouldn't classify it as, "Oh, I've been abducted by aliens."

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.820
 You may say, "Have you had lost time?

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.860
 Have you been in part of an interstellar war?"

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.660
 They're like, "Oh, that does remind me.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.900
 My first summer in college, when I fought all those reptilians on Octuria 7, they asked

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.580
 you these questions that if you answer yes to enough of them, you probably have been abducted

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.580
 by aliens."

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.580
 119 people out of 6,000 gave answers that were indicative of alien abduction.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.620
 And if you extrapolate that out, that would mean in the United States alone, it's possible

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:44.740
 you have 4 million people who have experiences that would be indicative of them being abducted

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.740
 by aliens, which is a huge amount.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.340
 Obviously, if you didn't know 4 million was a big number, you're like, "Golly, Jason!

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.500
 I didn't know that 4 million.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.500
 Wow!

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.500
 That's a big number."

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.300
 It's so crazy, steady, I love stuff like this, super, super-vastinating.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.180
 "Valencia, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.220
 We are leaving behind this crop circle.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.340
 We're destroying all their evidence.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.260
 As the helicopter is lifting off, fly us all the way out to London."

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:18.860
 It's April 2, 1904.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.820
 We're in the Wimbledon District of London.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.140
 Specifically, we're at a London Underground Station.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.260
 So that's like their subway.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.500
 Choo-choo!

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.420
 Trains coming down the track.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.580
 While these people are getting ready to go about their business, they're hanging out

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:40.500
 in the London Underground Station that all of a sudden, the entire train station is shrouded

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.660
 in darkness.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.620
 Now it's not just like the lights went out.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:55.220
 It's as if you took the entire London Underground Station and dipped it in black ink.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.260
 It's that level of darkness.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.020
 You can't see anything.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:05.140
 There is zero light coming in, not even a sliver, which would allow you to make out

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.660
 shapes in the darkness.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.140
 You guys have ever been in a super dark room, and as your eyes begin to adjust, you can

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.860
 see, maybe you can't see the knobs on your dresser, but you can see the outline of the

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.020
 dresser in the darkness.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.460
 You just need a little bit of light to be able to do that.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.020
 That is not the case on April 2, 1904.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.940
 It is completely black.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.540
 They couldn't see any outlines of the structures around them.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.700
 They couldn't see each other.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.780
 Blimey, meepeepers, they're not working.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.140
 My, me, the governor, they're talking and they're yelling and the employees are like,

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.780
 we don't know what's going on.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.260
 We're just as trapped in the dark as you are.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.900
 It's almost too dangerous to even move around.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.980
 You could shout, you could shout, ah, porridge, I'm late for my meeting.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:59.860
 Well, a couple minutes pass and everything returns to normal.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.020
 There's no notation to the sensation of it turning off and turning on.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.420
 We don't know if it was like a slow fade up or if it was just like a blink and it was

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.620
 back, but after a few minutes, everything returned to normal.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.620
 But that didn't matter.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:16.060
 People were still very, very puzzled and worried about what had happened because it was extremely

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.780
 dangerous here in an area where one wrong step in your train meet.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.580
 You're landing right in front of those tracks.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:28.660
 So people were complaining about this and eventually the city sent out some scientists

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.660
 to study what could have caused this and they actually like closed up all the entrances.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.580
 They covered like all the ventilation, everything like that to try to eliminate all light and

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.820
 they couldn't.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:45.260
 They could not at any point replicate the pitch darkness that they had seen, that the

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.940
 people in the train station had seen on that day.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.300
 Eventually scientists in town, the researchers were looking at this and said it's possible

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:58.900
 that what happened was you had some sort of toxic gas, which you always want to hear happen

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.980
 at your workplace, right?

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.220
 Maybe some sort of toxic gas seeped up through the earth because this is an underground metro

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:10.740
 station and everyone inhaled it and it caused temporary blindness.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:18.340
 People weren't super happy with that answer, but that was the best they had.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.740
 March 7th, 1911.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.500
 We're in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.300
 It's 4pm.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.340
 And it's an average day up to this point.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.420
 People are walking around the city.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.420
 A few people are driving.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.780
 I don't know how widespread cars were in Kentucky 1911, but I'm sure there were a couple.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.860
 People walking on the street, probably like a bunch of horses too.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.820
 People were riding horses on the street, chasing just like a basic fax or don't even mention

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.780
 it if you don't know.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.780
 They're having a race.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.900
 They're having a drag race with horses.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.900
 Demolition Derby.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:53.100
 Anyways, I don't know about the transportation of Kentucky in 1911.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.420
 It's not important for the story now.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.620
 I'm just thinking about horses.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:06.940
 At 4pm on March 7th, 1911, the city goes black.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:17.140
 And if it's possible, the city was actually darker than the underground metro station.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:24.580
 You had a population of around 50,000 people suddenly plunged into a darkness darker than

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.740
 night.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.180
 At the time, 1911, you had a lot of people who were smokers.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.740
 So they had matchboxes with them.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.060
 So when the lights go out, and I'm not just talking lighting, but the sun's gone.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.220
 An entire city is pitch black.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:46.140
 People were pulling matchbooks out of their pocket and lighting matches.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.300
 They said, "Listen, I've been smoking for years.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.540
 I'm holding a match.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:56.620
 I feel the match striking against the side of the box.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.460
 I hear it strike against the side of the box.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:08.700
 I hear that telltale sound of when the sulfur ignites on the edge of the matchstick.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.700
 I hear it.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:17.220
 I can feel the heat, but I can't see the flame.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.220
 It's that dark.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.140
 You can hold a lit match in your hand.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.220
 You can't even see the light."

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.100
 People also reported this darkness as being different than the one that was experienced

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.220
 in London.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.780
 They said moving through it was...

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.540
 There was something tangible about the darkness.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.380
 They said it was almost like you were moving through water.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.780
 It was thick.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.720
 This time, the darkness lasted an hour.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:53.140
 Some people reported that when the city went black, and obviously, it's widespread panic,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:58.020
 people began moving through the darkness trying to find loved ones or just get home by some

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.540
 more matches so they can smoke a cigarette in the darkness.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:08.180
 They said when the light returned, when everything was back to normal, they were in a different

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.820
 location, which you would figure if you were walking.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.820
 If you were walking, you'll be in a different location.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.660
 They said they were farther away than they should have been.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:22.260
 If they moved what would have seemed like a block, they would have been eight blocks away.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.500
 They didn't give an exact measurement.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.300
 They didn't say it was eight for one, but they said that when you moved, you actually ended

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.620
 up farther away, much farther away than you should have.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:38.220
 One woman said she was at her house when everything went black.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.220
 She couldn't see anything.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.580
 All the outlines are gone.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.800
 It's like you're walking through this void.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.260
 She was moving through her house by touch.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.540
 The things were physically still there.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.020
 She couldn't see them.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:58.460
 When the darkness lifted, she found herself in a locked room.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.660
 Now I know what you're thinking.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.660
 We're not done.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.300
 We still got some more stuff here, but this is where I want to pause.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:07.540
 I know what you're thinking, because this is exactly what I was thinking.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.740
 Is there anything to back any of this up?

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:15.180
 Let me give you a little bit of provenance for this story.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.100
 I found out about it on the website Anomalien.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.180
 They wrote an article about the mysterious phenomenon of the onset of sudden darkness.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.380
 I like Anomalien, but they publish a lot of goofy stuff too.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.780
 They'll take a sentence or a headline and then extrapolate it.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:38.540
 Most famously, that episode that I got unending emails from you guys where I said there was

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.980
 like a three second delay in your eyesight.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.980
 I don't remember exactly what the time was.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.940
 Dude, you guys are like Jason, you clearly didn't read that article, right?

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:52.660
 And they also Anomalien also kind of made it more goofy than it actually was.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.340
 But anyway, so Anomalien does do that.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.620
 I do that from time to time.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.340
 This was one that I was super interested in, because Dead Rat Baratio, we've been investigating

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.060
 the black bedroom phenomenon, which is something that this show has identified.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.780
 No one else has put these stories together that we've come across through people's accounts.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.020
 It's really cool and it's really creepy.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.060
 I'll put those episodes in the show notes.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.260
 So when I read about these cities going dark, I was like, wow, could this be connected to

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.260
 it?

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.180
 But by the time, I mean, I'm reading the article by the time it said the city in Kentucky went

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.580
 black, I was like, okay, the Wimbledon, whatever happens at the Brits, whatever, you can walk

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.820
 around darkness all day long.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.220
 No, I tried verifying that.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.220
 I couldn't find anything.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.100
 But by the time I'm reading the article and it gets to the Kentucky story, I was like,

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.260
 there has to be something.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:40.740
 Like if this story is true, that is such a huge event that there has to be something.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.340
 I'm not talking it would necessarily be in the newspaper.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.340
 It would be.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.740
 It would be a front page news story.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:51.120
 But I'm thinking they're also in the in the 40 in catalog and all these stories of high

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.900
 strangeness there should be mentioned of this.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.500
 So I started looking around.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:05.820
 The only sources I could find involving the stories all pull off of one website.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:11.060
 It's a Russian website called philosophy of life.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.940
 And this is the earliest post involving these stories.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.700
 You have the post on an alien.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:25.860
 Every other source I found to these two cities going completely black were from Russian websites.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.420
 Like they had someone posted it on a Russian like version of Facebook.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.740
 Then there was another story from another Russian website.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:39.740
 But all of them pulled from an article written on September 23, 2011 on a website called

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.140
 philosophy of life.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.460
 Now what's interesting is philosophy of life.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.540
 It describes itself as having articles from different areas of life.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.000
 And then they have this list culture and art science and religion history and adventure

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.700
 geography astronomy and stories about famous people.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.780
 So it's just kind of like a history website.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.820
 They're the very first ones to run the story.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.220
 They ran it on September 23, 2011.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:12.900
 I went and there is zero mention of these events prior to that article being published.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.380
 Well, you go, okay, Jason.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.660
 So they made it up like they say that they're philosophy of life, but they must be some

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.780
 wackadoodle website.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.320
 It's interesting because I started looking around this.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.220
 I started looking around philosophy of life website.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.180
 The articles they have posted right now, like two days ago when I was researching this, they

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.860
 have three articles on their main page.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.180
 A biography of J.K. Rowling.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.140
 A biography of Christopher Columbus.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.140
 And a article on what is meltwater.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.140
 I was like, what?

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.820
 I don't think you've ever heard that term before.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.580
 What is meltwater?

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.580
 Meltwater.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.860
 And I go, oh, is that going to be some weird scientific curative or something like that?

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.860
 No.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.220
 Meltwater is water that is melted from snow.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.420
 I was like, what?

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.220
 But maybe they used to be a weird wackadoodle website, right?

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.860
 Maybe these are their current articles they're talking about famous people.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.580
 And I'm sure I guess meltwater would fall under science and religion.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.940
 They had a section called like the unknown section.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.580
 So like phenomenon, right?

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.580
 Forty and phenomenon, like we talk about weird stuff.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:29.660
 They had two articles in the unknown section, two.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:34.620
 This article, which was titled darkness Egyptian.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.660
 You'll see that phrase pop up around the internet, really only on three other websites that

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.860
 mentioned this.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.900
 And the Anom alien, darkness Egyptian, because they were comparing these events to one of

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:53.100
 the biblical plagues when God was trying to get the pharaoh to let the Israelites go.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.420
 There's darkness in the city.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.940
 It's called darkness Egyptians, the name of the article.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:04.780
 They have two articles in the unknown section, darkness Egyptian and a general write up on

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:12.260
 the mythological creature known as the harpy, which you could find anywhere.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.380
 You could find information about harpies anywhere.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.380
 Check Wikipedia.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.500
 You can go to my fifth grade class, learn about mythology back then.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.660
 That's it.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.700
 Everything else on this website, everything else that's been around, the website's been

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.200
 around since at least 2011.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.500
 So we're talking 11 years at this point, 12.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.060
 Everything else on this website is completely legit that I could see.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.100
 I didn't see anything about like hidden history.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.580
 I didn't see anything about alternative energy sources or curative medicines.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.140
 It was all legit stuff.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.540
 It was philosophy of life, interesting articles about different areas of life.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.380
 The two of them were weird.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.980
 One of them is just basic knowledge, harpies.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.660
 And then this article, this is the very first mention of this phenomenon on this website.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.060
 That's super fascinating.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.580
 I expected to find this on some fringe conspiracy website.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:09.140
 The fact that it's a Russian website is super interesting as well because a long time ago

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.260
 we covered a story called the Paris time gap.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.580
 And I believe it was on the iceberg.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:24.340
 It was a story that on December 29th, 1902 at 1.05 a.m., all the pendulum clocks in

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.940
 Paris stopped.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:34.980
 Everyone woke up and everyone was nauseous.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.860
 And what's interesting is I covered that and I was talking about it coming from these Russian

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.940
 websites and there is no knowledge of this conspiracy theory or this event.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.300
 In the West there was zero.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.060
 But I remember getting emails from people who are Eastern European who listen to the

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.820
 show in that region of the world and they're like, "Oh no, I remember hearing that story

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.820
 a long time ago."

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.780
 Like it was super, I wouldn't say super common, but it's not like on the level of the Bermuda

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:05.380
 Triangle, but I got feedback saying that is actually like a, it's a well-known conspiracy

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.580
 theory.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.540
 They thought everyone knew that.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:14.300
 If you were into the paranormal, you knew the story of the Paris time gap.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.020
 But it's something that we only saw over there.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.500
 I was never able to find any proof that it actually happened.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.140
 But again, it was a conspiracy theory.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:25.260
 It was a regional conspiracy theory.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.940
 And now we have this happening again.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.820
 We have this Russian website that seems legit by all other means.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.740
 I mean, go to the link.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.980
 It's just like some boring history website.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.900
 Yet they have this story, Darkness Egyptian.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.780
 They have this story about the black cities.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.860
 And there's one more story I want to highlight here before we end up for the week.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.900
 July 16th, 1957.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.820
 We're in Orles, France.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.980
 It's 12 in the afternoon.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.180
 It's high noon.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:05.900
 And Madame Jeanette, she's a 54-year-old nanny, loads up a stroller with some, you know,

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:11.180
 diapers and a fresh baby bottle and a fresh baby.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.180
 You have to have a baby.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:17.380
 She takes, do nannies call the people masters, like Master Bruce from Batman.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:23.260
 Anyway, she takes the master's baby, puts her in the stroller and they go through a stroll

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.540
 through city park.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.940
 Baby falls asleep.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.740
 Madame Jeanette goes, you know, I'm going to sit down on this bench, little baby persons

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.740
 catching some Z's.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.020
 I'm going to sleep too.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.620
 That's what nannies do in the baby sleeping.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.860
 They fall asleep in public.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.940
 Madame Jeanette just sits down on the bench and then this, I like this story because it

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.060
 describes the process a little bit more.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:49.700
 And this story also, 2011, philosophy of history.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.700
 That was the first place I found this story.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.580
 And then everywhere else was Russian websites and then finally a nom alien.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:01.020
 But anyways, we're going to get a description of how the phenomenon works.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:08.100
 Madame Jeanette sitting on the bench and she said, the lights fade out suddenly, which

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.180
 is an interesting, almost a contradiction, right?

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:18.620
 She compared it to when you click a light bulb off, it goes out, right?

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.180
 It shuts off.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.820
 But there is this mechanism where it doesn't instantly go off.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:29.340
 It feels like it does, but it's a...

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.620
 It fades so quickly, it seems instantaneous, but it does in fact fade out.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.860
 She's sitting in the dark.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:45.740
 Now, it was noon when she sat down on this bench and now everything is pitch black.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:52.780
 Everything around her is enveloped in darkness, including the baby stroller.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.100
 And Madame Jeanette says that instantly the little girl began crying.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.980
 The baby under her care began bawling.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:06.900
 It's like whatever this mechanism was, it woke up the baby and terrified her.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:12.020
 And Madame Jeanette is sitting there and she has to feel for the stroller.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:17.340
 She has to find the stroller by touch and then she has to feel for the baby inside of

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.340
 it.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.780
 And then she pulls a little baby out and she's holding this precious little girl close to

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.820
 herself and Madame Jeanette's trying to soothe her.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.180
 Me, me, me, it's okay, Master Baby.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.180
 It's okay.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.260
 Me, me, me.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.860
 This darkness only lasts 15 minutes.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:45.540
 And then the darkness fades away quickly.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.020
 And now she's sitting in the sitting part.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:54.340
 She can see normally, however, it's evening now.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.420
 But at least she can see.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.100
 Maybe dark outside the street lights may be on, but at least she's not trapped in this

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.100
 darkness.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.020
 But now we have this massive time shift.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.500
 In the first story, we had people getting lost in the darkness and then up in random

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.500
 places.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.340
 This one is our first time where we have a noticeable time shift.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.820
 She's in the darkness for 15 minutes, but now it's evening.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.820
 It terrifies her.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.180
 This whole event is freaking her out.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:25.860
 She races home with the stroller and when she gets there, the family of the baby, they're

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.260
 freaking out as well.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:36.380
 Not because they had also been enveloped by this blackness, but because the nanny and

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:44.340
 Master Baby had been missing for three days.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.140
 The police and the family didn't suspect that the nanny was doing anything with the baby

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.700
 in those three days.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:55.100
 One because the nanny was a very well respected member of the household and people knew her

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.100
 in the community.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.780
 It would be so out of character for her to do something.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:07.100
 The other thing that they noticed was the diapers and the bottle were fresh and they

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:11.780
 were the ones that she loaded into the stroller in the first place.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.660
 So it wasn't like she had been taking this baby around for three days walking around

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.820
 in three-day-old poopy diapers.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:25.460
 It was like she had just left the house 15 minutes ago.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.540
 Is there any truth to these stories?

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.580
 The one with Madame Jeanette and the London Underground Station, I think it would be

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.860
 easy enough for those to fly under the radar.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.660
 Those aren't necessarily going to...

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.140
 The one in the London Station, you think there would be a series of articles about

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.940
 health effects on the station or what happened or something like that?

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.820
 I think those could fly under the radar.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:51.620
 The one in Kentucky, I think would be really hard to black out an entire city and did not

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.140
 be in the paper.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.500
 If Louisville, if 50,000 residents of the city were enveloped in darkness and they were

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.820
 just bumbling around for an hour and teleporting around town, I think that would make the local

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.940
 gazette.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.380
 But then where are these stories coming from?

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:14.100
 It's so interesting because this is a website, the original publishers of this in 2011.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.140
 I could find no earlier source.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.620
 And it got to the point where I just started searching in Russian.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.540
 I was actually using...

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.540
 What is it?

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.540
 Scrilich?

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.540
 Srillik?

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.540
 I was using that alphabet.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:32.180
 I was like taking words and translating them into Russian and Google searching for those

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.860
 to find more stuff on this.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.980
 And I couldn't find anything.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.660
 The earliest example I could find was in 2011.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.660
 It was...

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.140
 This story has not been told before that.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:46.460
 So one, even if the story had been told before that, I doubt a website that's so dedicated

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.580
 towards just like general knowledge things.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.340
 Do you know about Harpeys?

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.780
 And again, there's only two unknown stories in there of unknown phenomenon.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.940
 Not like they have this huge thing and they were trying to figure out the wackiest stuff.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:06.700
 I don't understand why they would run the story if it was fake, if they thought it was

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.980
 fake.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.380
 And I don't think they just ran it.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.380
 I think they wrote it.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.380
 You know what I mean?

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.740
 I don't think that they had come across it on another website and go, "Hey, let's put

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:15.900
 this next to Harpeys.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.380
 That'll be good."

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.540
 I think philosophy of life created this story or wrote it up.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.700
 See, but again, like why?

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:31.240
 It doesn't make sense for them to write a fictional story when everything else is real.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.180
 So where did they get it from?

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.900
 I'm super puzzled by this.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.580
 Just like I was puzzled by the Paris time gap.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.580
 Why isn't it in any Western media?

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:46.420
 Especially because the three incidents take place in Western countries, France and Britain

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.540
 and America.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.780
 And Anomalien published it.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.900
 That was just a few days ago when Anomalien ran this.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.980
 It was like the first week of January, maybe the last week of December, but I had never

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:00.980
 heard of this before.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.980
 This is absolutely fascinating.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.580
 There's so many questions I have about it.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.180
 And the big one though is, is this real?

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.180
 Did this really happen?

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.180
 You have to factor in a bunch of things.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:17.300
 One, it sounds ludicrous in a nutshell because we're talking, not the idea of people being

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.340
 trapped in darkness because again, we've been cataloguing those events when we're looking

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.420
 at the Black Benjamin phenomenon.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.820
 That's not what's ridiculous about it.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:29.100
 What's ridiculous is that it could happen to large groups of people and it not be in

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.900
 the media.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:36.860
 But then you also got to realize that the media is constantly picking and choosing what stories

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:42.460
 and narratives we hear and they've been doing that since the beginning.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.340
 So what, it's just so fascinating.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.940
 I wonder what else is out there.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:50.820
 I'm going, I don't know if these stories are true, but I definitely find them absolutely

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.740
 fascinating and I find it fascinating that a website, a Russian website called Philosophy

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.740
 of Life is the first people to publish this story that I could find.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:03.220
 And they put it alongside all their other verifiable stuff.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:07.340
 I mean, I didn't have to fact check whether or not JK Rowling was real, whether or not

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:11.860
 she enjoyed the sweet, sweet taste of meltwater.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.780
 This is all such a fascinating story.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:20.380
 What we can really suss out of it is everything in a whole, the Black Benjamin phenomenon seems

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.380
 to be real.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:26.260
 We're getting so many unrelated reports about it around the world.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.340
 Are these stories real?

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.900
 Are these particular ones?

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:34.260
 The one that I find most suspect is the one that took place in Kentucky where 50,000 people

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.980
 saw this and there's not a single news report.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:41.380
 However, let's put on our conspiracy caps to wrap this up.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:46.660
 This would be a phenomenon that if it was happening, the government and the media would

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.780
 have to cover it up.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.260
 Because just like they'll cover up the existence of aliens, just like they'll cover up the

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.740
 existence of unidentified flying objects in our airspace.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.620
 Especially during the Cold War.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.940
 At least those were things you could shoot at.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.220
 Even if you couldn't shoot them down.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:10.900
 They were physical objects that we could open fire on and say, "Go away, go away, go away"

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.900
 and it flies away.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:17.940
 That's not really effective, but this is, whether this is a natural or a supernatural

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:23.740
 phenomenon, you're completely powerless once you're in its grasp.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.500
 And the military couldn't deal with it.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.540
 The scientists couldn't even replicate it.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:34.180
 How would a government be able to calm down the population if this was an actual real

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.180
 thing?

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.060
 I mean, we know tornadoes are coming, I think, right?

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.060
 We can kind of predict those.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.660
 We can't predict those when we see the neighbor's house way up in the air.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:47.620
 You can't predict an earthquake, but you can prepare a city for it.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:52.660
 You know, natural disasters, don't live next to a volcano, that type of stuff.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:59.060
 But everything going pitch black and then you teleporting around the city, how do you

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.180
 prepare for that?

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.260
 And if it is supernatural, if it's something naturally could steady it and maybe figure

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.340
 out some way to predict it or mitigate it, but if it's supernatural, if it's some sort

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:14.580
 of dimensional rift opening up or reality itself is collapsing in a certain geographical

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.820
 area, there'd be no way to combat that.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:22.460
 The easiest way to combat that was to make people think it never happened in the first

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.980
 place.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.180
 You would not want panic in the population.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:32.260
 But I don't know if the stories of darkness egyptian are true.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.020
 I do believe the black bedroom phenomenon is real.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.820
 So that's interesting.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:44.980
 All that is is a more localized and indoor version of the stories we've looked at today.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.980
 So what is this?

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:48.980
 What is going on?

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:54.420
 This is absolutely fascinating and quite terrifying as well.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:59.900
 And then the big question though is what happens when it happens to you?

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:05.580
 This really gets to the root of all of these stories we talk about on Dead Ravv Radio, isn't

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.580
 it?

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.940
 It's always happening to somebody else and in the back of our mind we're thinking, what

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:16.260
 if this happened to me?

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:21.660
 And again there's no defense because we don't know what it is.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.340
 And I think at first you would assume it was something natural.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:28.100
 You wake up in the middle of the night, your bedroom's completely black.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.020
 It's nighttime, Jason.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.460
 What do you expect my lights on?

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.860
 But then you realize that there's zero light coming in, not even the light from the street

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.700
 lamps outside your house.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:44.260
 From the moon hanging overhead.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:51.380
 The best you could hope in that situation is that you could remain calm and that it's

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:55.100
 temporary.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.300
 Because it has to be temporary, right?

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:04.380
 Every example we've ever come across, it's a temporary phenomenon.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.260
 It eventually ends.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:13.380
 But those are the stories told by the survivors.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:20.980
 How many stories are out there with people waking up in a pitch black void?

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:29.420
 Or walking down the street and all of a sudden the city is shrouded in an unearthly darkness?

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.780
 Or sitting with your loved ones in your living room watching a movie.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.580
 And at first you think the power is out.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:47.340
 And then as the minutes turn to hours and the hours turn to days, and you and your family

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:54.940
 are desperately holding on to each other, because you know that if they wander off into

00:40:54.940 --> 00:41:02.660
 this black void, you'll never see them again.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:12.980
 You're thirsty, you're hungry, you're panicked, and you're trapped.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:18.780
 How many people have ended their existence in these black voids?

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.900
 We just think they've gone missing.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:28.140
 But in fact they disappeared into the darkness Egyptian.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.820
 No one ever saw them again.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:37.060
 And more terrifying than that, they couldn't even see their own hands.

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:40.260
 They couldn't even see their own body.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:58.060
 They simply spent their last days wandering through an unknowable, unending world of darkness.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:09.220
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.740
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm so glad you listened to it today.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.740
 Have a great weekend guys.
