1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 An up-and-coming Russian model is horribly mutilated in a brutal crime.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Bulgaria has its own nymph that will make you dance to death.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And then we travel to Japan to take a look at a story that some people claim is one of the earliest meetings between aliens and humans.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Who was the woman in the boat?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Find out today on the seductress special of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I'm a wild big doll.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Actually, I'm a wild big doll.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm your host Jason Carvener. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It is the seductress special because I met my future wife this weekend.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Now before you panic, before you go, don't leave us, Jason, don't leave us.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 She's gone. She's still alive. I think that sounded ominous.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 She's gone. She was passing through Hood River on a road trip or the road trip in the Hood River.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Didn't really make heads or tails of that.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 She was there with a bunch of friends. I was at a bar with my friends.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Her and her friends are at this bar and I saw her and I go, I need to talk to this girl.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 She looks like if Taylor Swift was a librarian at a community college, which in my world is his top notch.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Now before you guys go, that is sexist, Jason. You describe the woman in physical terms.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Hold on. Hold on. Let me tell you why I'm in love with her.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 So I walk up to her and start making conversation with her, which is a little...

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I normally don't approach girls in packs, but I do from time to time.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 This one I kind of had to. And so I walk up to her and I start chatting her up.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 We're talking for a bit. We probably talked for like 20, 30 minutes.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Long enough for me to fall in love. We're talking, that's all it takes.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I'm talking to her. We started talking about science because she's like a chemist.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And I go, or a chemistry major. Again, I wasn't paying super close attention at this point.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 But anyways, we're talking and she goes, "What does Silver say to Gold when he walks in a bar?"

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Now that is a very clunky delivery of a joke. That's a terrible delivery, right?

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 It should just be, "What does Silver say to Gold?"

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So I'm just going to do it that way because I'm a professional comedian.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I'm not. But more so than her, "What does Silver say to Gold?"

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And the answer or the punchline, not the answer, it's not a quiz. You don't get great at it on this.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I always start over. "What does Silver say to Gold?"

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I guess you do need the second part. "What does Silver say to Gold when he meets him in a bar?"

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 "A.U. How you doing?"

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So she told me that joke and my immediate internal response was, "How many children do you want?"

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Like, who doesn't want to be with a girl that goofy, that she'll tell that joke to a total stranger in the first 10 minutes of me.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 But she's gone. She left with her friends.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 So Taylor, if you're still out there, I hope you are. Again, she's not buried.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I don't know why she's making this so ominous. She's still out there, law enforcement.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I had nothing to do. If she isn't, I had nothing to do with it.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 But Taylor, that's her fake name because she does look like Taylor Swift, kinda.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Taylor, if you're out there and you're- she doesn't listen to this podcast too.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I asked her about that because you never know. She doesn't believe in ghosts.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 She also said, "I was smart." Which proves to me she doesn't listen to the podcast.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But anyways, you know where I live. Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Oh, so this is the seductress special for two reasons. One, because I met the future Mrs. Jason Carpenter.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And two, I'll get to in a second, but I got three stories of seduction and darkness and kinda lightheartedness.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 No, I guess they're all pretty bad. So don't listen to this episode, future wife.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Let's go ahead. We are going to go to Russia. Let's take the rabbit robot.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 We haven't broken this out in a while. And we're rowing across the ocean.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Hey, actually, all these stories kinda take place around each other, so this would be cool.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 We're gonna take the rabbit robot. We're gonna take it to Russia.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 We're gonna get there, and it's the year 2016, 'cause it took so long time reset, and it started over.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 So the year's 2016, we're in Russia. There is a young woman named Stefani Dubrovina.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Stefani Dubrovina, and she's a 17-year-old fashion model in Russia.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 "Live in the High Life." That's not true. It's funny, a lot of people think models live very glamorous lives.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Same thing with porn stars, but mostly for the most part, models. They're usually in abject poverty.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 You, I can almost guarantee you live better than 90% of the models out there.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And I'm even talking about models who do like runway shows.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Like, of course, the models who do like suicide girls or just like webcam stuff, they're not making a ton of money,

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 but like when you see models in magazines, a lot of times they're very, very poor.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 You're really not making a lot of money. You're probably, and unless you're a top model,

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 America's top model, or is that America's next model? It doesn't matter.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Very rarely do you make millions of dollars. A good model can clear like 50,000 a year,

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 and then the majority of models are like 20,000.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 So it's really, really, or maybe more, but it pay us a lot of expenses with it as well.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And they know they don't have to pay you that much, 'cause there's 100,000 other girls who would kill to get where you're at.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So it's a very, very low income job, unless you're a super, super elite.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 But anyway, she looks like she's living a glamorous life, but she's not.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 She does have a sister, Eliza Vita, Eliza Vita Dubrovina, who's 19.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 So Stefani's 17 years old fashion model, her older sister, Eliza Vita.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 They are very, very close. They actually are uncannily close.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Same hair color, same lipstick shade.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Eliza Vita is not a model. She's an attractive woman, but she's not a model.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So one day, Stefani is found dead. Dead in her apartment.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Her lover, who is 44-year-old Alexi Fativa. He's 44, she's 17.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 He had left the apartment that he was staying at with Stefani and Eliza Vita was visiting.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 He leaves to go buy some wine. This is what he says. He comes back to the apartment.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Stefani is stabbed to pieces, and that's not an exaggeration.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 189 stab wounds, eyeballs cut out, ears cut off, and Eliza Vita is like, "See ya."

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And she starts walking out of the apartment, and Alexi's like, fighting her,

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 and holds her there until the police show up.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Now, that happened in 2016. The reason why this is news today is because the trial is starting.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 What happened is the police say that Eliza Vita killed her out of jealousy.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 She was so jealous that her little sister was so much more beautiful than her,

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 drove her to a fit of rage, and she got drugged at a party.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And oddly, there's not a lot of details on this case. She would be really big,

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 because true crime people are kind of eracious about this stuff.

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And every time they have an article about these people, it's just photo after photo of models and stuff like that.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 So you think it would be more information, but I don't know what type of drug she was on,

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 or if it was voluntary or involuntary that she was at a club or a party and something got laced.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Anyways, they're saying Eliza Vita was drugged out, and she was finally pushed past the boiling point due to her jealousy,

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 and mutilated her face and stabbed her all over the place.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 That rhymed, unfortunately. Gouged her eyes out and so on and so forth.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Eliza Vita's saying, "No, no, no. Alexi did it. I was just there."

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And what's weird is she was arrested in 2016. The trial's taking place now.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 It took her three years for her to be competent to stand trial.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So whatever drugs she was on, that would have had to be a massive dose.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Or she was faking it, or both.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 But three-- When's the last time you took a drug trip that lasted three years?

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 No human ever. I guess maybe, like, if you did a bunch of acid.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But again, like, I think even if you did a bunch of acid in one night, it wouldn't take you three years.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 You wake up, you're like, "Oh, I got a horrible hangover. Man, what did I do last night?"

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And they're like, "Well, three years ago you killed your sister." And she's like, "Ugh, I knew I shouldn't have drank the punch."

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And to put a little paranormal bent on it-- You know, we do cover true crime, but to put an extra little dead rabbit radio bent on this story--

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 She says that now that she's competent, now that she can stand trial, she says,

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 "Now that I've regained my memory after that horrible drug trip that lasted three years, I saw in the apartment Alexi shapeshift into a demon."

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 "I didn't kill her, he did. But I'm the one standing trial."

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Now, you probably didn't turn over, demon. That's probably part of her drug hallucination,

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 but the police have said Alexi was just a witness to this whole thing. He had nothing to do with it.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Which is also an interesting note. A lot of articles said he was the witness, but I'm thinking--

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I thought he came home after the murder. So there's some details that aren't 100% in there.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 But driven mad by someone else's beauty? It's not really a seductress.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 It doesn't really fit the theme of the show, but it does lead us into our next story.

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I guess just being so enchanted by beauty that it drives you mad.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 I guess that's kind of-- that's seduction. Not seduction you want to do, because you don't want to get murdered, but it's seduction, so it fits.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 But it also leads into our next story. Now, our next story was actually a request in kind of a roundabout way.

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 So our next story, though, and it leads into this, is actually a request.

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I got this request from a listener named-- and it's kind of not what he requested, but--

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I got this email from a listener named Jaysodor. Jaysodor or Jasador? Jaysador?

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Also listed, also calls himself the Bulgarian Jason. So thank you so much for this recommendation, Jaysador.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 He's from Bulgaria, which is obvious from the name. And it's funny because a long time ago, I did an episode about the Czar China Hole,

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 and I ragged on Bulgaria for not having warlords. There was something-- they were looking for a great Bulgarian warlord,

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 and I go, "What were there, like, two?" And I've gotten so much YouTube comments and the occasional email,

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 and Jaysador mentioned that, too. He's like, "You know, we have, like, a long rich history of warlords.

127
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It's just not very well-known." And I understand that. It was obviously a joke when I said that.

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I'm sure, you know, Bulgaria is a total war-torn country that has no vegetation, because war after war after war after war over there.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 They can't build a house because there's constant warfare for the past thousand years, while the rest of Europe was building cathedrals.

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Bulgaria is just one giant village to this day. Again, I'm just joking.

131
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Thank you for all the people who responded to my anti-Bulgarian rant, and we'll respond to this one.

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Thank you, Jaysador, for this recommendation, though. So what he did was he sent me this email. I thought this was interesting.

133
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 I'm going to read what he wrote to you. I'm going to read this particular part, because I can't cover this part,

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 because it's all in Bulgarian stuff, language, but it led me somewhere else. Let me read this part of the email.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I want to--and I'll have this video in the show notes. I wanted to--if you can speak Bulgarian--

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I wanted to introduce you to a more obscure thing in Bulgaria. It's a village called Shai-shensi.

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It's super weird, this whole video. These old ladies live hundreds of miles from the nearest cities.

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 They just kind of grow what they eat, and every night they are like, "Oh, yeah, we just close up the windows,"

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 or "The Samodivas are going to get us." Like, super effin-casually.

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Like, you know when you live near the train station for a long time, you stop noticing things,

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 and someone comes over and they are like, "How can you actually stand this noise? It's the same effin thing."

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 They say you go around the houses and sing and dance, and the locals just kind of let it be.

143
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 So I read that, and I go, "What's a Samodiva?" Like, that was my takeaway there.

144
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 So there is like this 40-minute-long video, and it probably is a fairly interesting video about this culture there,

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 but I don't--and he offered to translate it, but I think you've--I appreciate that offer.

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But with a daily show, a lot of times we're just kind of getting stuff out.

147
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 But in this email, I go, "What is a Samodiva?" So I looked that up.

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And this is the reason why we have this "Ductress Special," so thank you, again, Jaystador,

149
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 assuming I'm pronouncing that correctly, for giving me kind of the theme for this episode.

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I go, "This is something I can put my hat on. I can find two other seductress stories to work into this."

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 So we are traveling to Bulgaria.

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 So we're going to carry the boat over land.

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I'm sure there's some rivers that go from Russia to Bulgaria.

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And we know we're in Bulgaria because the blue crystal waters of Russia slowly start to turn brown and swampy.

155
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 And now we're rowing through a swamp super slow.

156
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 See a sign that says, "Welcome to Bulgaria."

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And I go, "So, we're rowing past the Bulgarian Warlord Monument."

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 He goes, "Here lies Bulgaria's greatest warriors, all two of them."

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 We look at each other. We're like, "Yeah, that's what I thought, bro. That's what I thought."

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 We're rowing the boat down the Bulgarian River Slash Swamp at this point, and we hop out.

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 We carefully unpack the clean water we brought with us and some sandwiches that are in Ziploc bags.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 We don't want to eat anything around here, where I have a lot of listeners in Bulgaria.

163
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 We're walking through Bulgaria now, eating our clean Russian food and drinking our pure crystal water.

164
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And the towns people are like, "Oh, there must be witches. How do they seal such things? What is this plastic wrap? What's plastic?

165
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 What plastic is? Anyways, we're walking around Bulgaria and we decided to take a shortcut through the woods.

166
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 So we walked through the woods and kind of like, "Duh-duh-duh" walking around.

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 I'm like, "Hey, did I tell you about that hot chick I met at a bar?"

168
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 You're like, "Yes, Jason, several times on the way on the boat right over."

169
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 I was like, "Oh, I can't wait to see her again."

170
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 So as we're walking through the woods, we see a beautiful woman out in the woods.

171
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Just kind of dancing around by herself, doing the robot.

172
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 We're like immediately entranced by this woman.

173
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And what we're seeing is a bean known as a Samo Diva.

174
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 They're described as blonde, tall, slender women with pale glowing skin and fiery eyes.

175
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Her eyes just burn into our soul.

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And she is so beautiful. We both fall in love.

177
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Now that's bad. It's bad to fall in love with a mythical creature right off the bat.

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 It's probably even worse when both of us are in love, because then we're going to fight each other for her.

179
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 We're like, "Ugh, wrestling, rolling through the dirt, rolling through the mud of Bulgaria."

180
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 We're like, "It burns! It burns! It's not normal mud!"

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 But anyways, we have to call a quick truce because I can't kill my listener and I can't be killed myself.

182
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 So we both hop up and we begin pursuing this woman.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And she's running away. "Okay, this guy's dark. This guy's dark. Okay, it's part of the legend.

184
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 We're not just doing this because we're creepers. Part of the legend."

185
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Okay, let me get to the legend part, because that sounded really dark.

186
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 What it is is that when you see a Samo Diva, you become instantly in love with her,

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 and then you begin to chase her and she runs away.

188
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And what she's doing is she's actually draining your energy from you.

189
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 So the more you chase her, you can never catch her. The more you chase her, the more she runs,

190
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 the more energy she's draining from you, and eventually you become weakened,

191
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 she circles back around and she tortures you to death.

192
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Which, I mean, if she's that attractive, that's a death I'm willing to do.

193
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Like, the running part? No, I'm not cool with that. I'm like, "Oh, my knees!"

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 But, I mean, like, I'm being tortured to death by a stunning woman.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Yeah, I mean, it's not on my to-do list of ways to die, but, you know, there's worse things to see.

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Like, I'd rather see a beautiful woman cutting my heart out than, like, fall face-first into a meat grinder.

197
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 A very slow meat grinder. A rusty meat grinder that needed to be maintained a couple years ago.

198
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 So, horribly killed by this woman. Tortures you. Not just kills you, tortures you.

199
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Also, if you're walking by the forest, because they usually hang out in the forest,

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 we'll get to that in a second, but you're walking by the forest,

201
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 they tend to hang out by themselves. Samo diva. Samo means "alone" and diva means "wild".

202
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 So, that means, like, "alone" in the wild. It actually means "alone" and "wild" or something like that.

203
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 You see them in a d- Sometimes they go to dance parties, because they do hang out with each other.

204
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 See them in a dance party. If you see them dancing, they play such beautiful music, and they're so hot,

205
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 you go to the dance party and you dance until you die.

206
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 They hang out at night, they go away when the sun comes up, and you just- you're dead in the woods.

207
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Which would be a way to explain why people died of heart attacks and stuff like that.

208
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 It would also be a way to explain when you find your elderly grandpa in the woods dead, and his pants are down.

209
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 We've looked at myths like this before. That would be a way to explain why you would come across bodies in the woods,

210
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 who apparently died of natural causes. People who die of heart attack in the woods, you would create myths around that.

211
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 You'd be like, "Oh, maybe this happened."

212
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Or you could be saying, "Hey, listen, I'm a woman. Jason, you keep going off on these adventures

213
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 and getting murdered by mule women who turn into mules, and you're falling for these beautiful

214
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 six-foot-tall, blonde-haired maidens that torture you to death, and for some reason you're okay with that.

215
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 I'm a woman. I don't have to worry about that. I'm not going to wrestle you in the burning Bulgarian mud.

216
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I am not under their power, but if a- so if a man sees them, they're going to dance until they die,

217
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 or they're going to chase him through the woods and get exhausted and get murdered.

218
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 If a woman sees a Samodiva, they will kill themselves on the spot, because they are so beautiful,

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 and a human woman can never be that beautiful, you will murder yourself on the spot.

220
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 So that's why in the email, the elderly women were like, "Oh, yeah, we sing and dance to keep the Sam-

221
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 or they're shedding the windows to keep the Samodivas away."

222
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 They do that because if a woman sees a Samodiva, they will kill themselves on the spot.

223
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 So you have a risk of doing it too.

224
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Yeah, you're right. You wouldn't wrestle me in the noxious Bulgarian Earthscape, but you would just kill yourself.

225
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And you have a couple different origin stories. One of them is the daughter of the Lamia, or the Lamia.

226
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 It's this snake monster goddess dragon thing from old, old times.

227
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Some people say that they are virgins who died before they lost their virginity. That's pretty dark.

228
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And then there's no jokes there. And then the other one is they're just wicked women.

229
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 These things are normally considered evil. Mischievous at best. Evil at worst.

230
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Sometimes they're just wretched women, horrible women who died in her trap between heaven and hell.

231
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 What I love is they don't have a lot of easy ways to kill them.

232
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 There's a Macedonian version of this myth that if you poke them with a thorn, they die or they lose their powers,

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 which is actually... If you are a forest-dwelling creature and your weakness is thorns,

234
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 how do you even survive to the modern age? To even be a legend. You should have died out during the times.

235
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 That's an interesting question.

236
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 If we accept that these like, fey-type spirits exist, these forest nymphs, cryptids...

237
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Cryptids are a bit different because you figure cryptids may have evolved, but like, spirit-based...

238
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 This is what I'm getting at. Where was Zeus during the Age of the Dinosaurs?

239
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Like, were the Greek gods around during the Crestation period?

240
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Were the Greek gods around during the Jurassic period?

241
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Was Zeus straight up like, changing himself into a T-Rex and getting banged by other T-Rexes?

242
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Like, that's interesting. Like, all of these forest nymph-type characters, were there leprechauns getting chased by stegosaurus back in the day?

243
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Because technically they would have had to have been.

244
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Because the leprechauns, fey, all that stuff exist out of our reality. They're interdimensional.

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 So they would have existed. They may have popped their head in every 65 million years and go, "Oh no, an asteroid!"

246
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And then went back. But I don't think Bigfoot was getting chased by a pterodactyl.

247
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 But I think that these type of creatures, these... What are we talking about again?

248
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Oh, these Samodivas. Did they exist? Were they like, riding on the backs of triceratops?

249
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Interesting. Hmm. I wonder if anyone's looked into that.

250
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 I don't think anyone is as insane as I am, but, interesting.

251
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So, they get pricked by a thorn and they die. Or they lose their power or something like that.

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 It's kind of the same thing. But, because that's how they exist.

253
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Also, they take baths. They're only around from, like, the evening they leave before the sun comes up.

254
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 But the first thing you do every night is they take a bath. Which is, everyone should do really. Or shower, at least.

255
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 But anyways, so they take a bath, they take all their clothes off. They wear these long white dresses and they have like a green or a rainbow belt.

256
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 So, they take their clothes off and they jump in with all their other hot nymph buddies. And they're swimming in the water.

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 If you happen to jack one of their dresses, you have power over them. They will marry you and they can have children.

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 But the whole time, they'll be thinking, "If only I could get my dress back."

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 These creatures are pretty popular in Bulgarian myths.

260
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 There are a lot of the, like, antagonists or obstacles for the hero to overcome.

261
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Sometimes they're the main antagonists. Sometimes they're just something...

262
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Because they're medicinal. One of their key points is that if you overhear them talking to their buddies,

263
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 all they do is talk about medicine and stuff like that.

264
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So, there's Bulgarian folktales where people are, like, hiding in the bushes.

265
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And they're like, "Oh, did you know if you rub mushrooms on your eyeballs, you can grow wings,

266
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 and then the guy will go back and rub mushrooms on his eyeballs and fly and save his damsel in distress?"

267
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 So, sometimes they're simply an obstacle to overcome or to get information from.

268
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Sometimes they're bad guys, but they have a legend of a guy who jacked his chick's dress

269
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 and forced her to marry him and she got pregnant and had a kid.

270
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And then they went to the wedding where they were going to get married.

271
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 So, they go to the wedding, his wedding, they're getting married, and his dad is like,

272
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 "I thought you said that girl was a Samodiva."

273
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And he's like, "Oh, she was. I stole her dress."

274
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And they're like, "Dude, she's dancing horribly. That's not what a Samodiva dances like."

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And the dude's like, "Let me get her clothes."

276
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 This is years later after he stole her clothes.

277
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Let me put her clothes on her, then she'll have her powers again.

278
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 And he gives her back the clothes, she puts it on, she dances away, he flies away.

279
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And he's left with this son that he has no wife for.

280
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Not the worst ending to a fable.

281
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He didn't end up like getting his liver eaten out for eternity.

282
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 He just has to be a single dad. There's nothing wrong with that.

283
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And this is the part, so we have these tall blonde, they're blonde, oh by the way,

284
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I think I mentioned that a couple of times, they actually have blonde hair.

285
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 It's part of them being so beautiful, but their hair is described as loose/a wig.

286
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And I guess you can yank their hair off and that also can diminish their power.

287
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 It doesn't completely take it away, but it does weaken them to a certain point.

288
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And my favorite part of this myth is they are known to live in-

289
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Not around trees, like normal nymphs, they live inside trees.

290
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 They're also known to live in abandoned shacks and dark caves.

291
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And I like all of those things because those are probably the only three places

292
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 that are worse than my apartment.

293
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 So I don't have to worry about bringing a Samodiva over to my place.

294
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Because then I don't feel bad about bringing them back to my place.

295
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Like my place is still pretty clean since I had it fengshui'd by that girl who came over.

296
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 But my bedroom is just like four feet of clothes on top of my bed.

297
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But you can't really complain about my bedroom if you live in a tree.

298
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Like I think that is a fair thing.

299
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 You come in over my apartment and you're like, "Have you ever vacuumed?"

300
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I vacuumed a couple months ago."

301
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And she's like, "Ugh."

302
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And that's fair.

303
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Okay, I'm sure the tree is not-

304
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 At least has a clean floor.

305
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It's clean as ground can get in Bulgaria.

306
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 But I'll give Bulgaria that.

307
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 I'm sure their carpets are cleaner than mine.

308
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 But I'd be like, "Listen, listen.

309
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Yes, my bed is covered in clothes.

310
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Yes, some of those clothes probably have like, flex of sand and wood in them.

311
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Because I walk everywhere.

312
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 I'm a nymph like you.

313
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 I live in the forest as well.

314
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Or I just walk through wooded areas.

315
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Which is creepy.

316
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And yes, sometimes because I throw my clothes on my bed,

317
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 dirt and pieces of wood on it, the dirt and the pieces of wood get on the bed.

318
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And I brush it off with my hand and then you come over.

319
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And you're like, "Why is there a piece of bark on your bed?"

320
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Which to a normal woman, obviously, I will say, "Why?"

321
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I will come up with a quick lie as to why there is bark in my bed.

322
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 But if you live in a tree, maybe they like bark.

323
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 If you live in an abandoned shack, to you I live in a mansion.

324
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Like, yes, I could probably do more dishes.

325
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I'll do my dishes.

326
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 But at least I have a sink.

327
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 You have an abandoned shack.

328
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 If you live in a dark cave, the fact that I even have a lighting makes me daddy warbucks.

329
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 So the Samodiva is an actual cryptid that I could see myself in a relationship with.

330
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 A Samodiva is a cryptid or a nymph that I could actually see coming over to my place.

331
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And before she tortures me to death, go, "This place isn't that bad."

332
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 I could see myself in a relationship with a Samodiva.

333
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 But more importantly, I think a Samodiva is the only cryptid that could see itself in a relationship with me.

334
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Because, let's be honest, even Bigfoot would come over and be like, "Uhhh..."

335
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 "Me not know about safety of sitting down on couch."

336
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I'm like, "No, dude, it's totally cool."

337
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 "Uhhh..."

338
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 "What's that smell?"

339
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 "Me smell many smells in woods."

340
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 "This smells like decaying elk and axe body spray."

341
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And I'm like...

342
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 "Just get in the bed, Bigfoot."

343
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 "Just get in the bed."

344
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Mothman would just fly away.

345
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Leprechauns would be like, "My luck has run out."

346
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 "This truly is the end of the rainbow."

347
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 "This is where color does not exist."

348
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 But the Samodiva is a creature after my own heart.

349
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And in the end, she may not be seductress.

350
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 No.

351
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 It is I who am seducing her.

352
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Why does that sound so dark?

353
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 What is supposed to sound?

354
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 But, we've run out of time for the Hollow Boat story.

355
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 So, the seductress episode is just those two stories.

356
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 The Hollow Boat story, though, we will tell you tomorrow.

357
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 I'm gonna give you a little bit of a teaser here now.

358
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 The year is 1803.

359
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And a boat crashes onto the shore of Japan.

360
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It's 10 feet high, 17 feet wide,

361
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 with a diamond-shaped bottom and a lid.

362
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And when the fishermen open it up,

363
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 they find food, water, a beautiful woman,

364
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 and a box she refuses to let anyone see what's inside.

365
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Yeah, I like that. I like ending that on a teaser.

366
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 That's kind of cool.
