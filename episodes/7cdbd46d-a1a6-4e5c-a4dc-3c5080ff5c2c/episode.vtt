00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 AG Touring!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Is it possible that a family of misfits

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Caught upon the power of the slug

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 To wipe out their enemies?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And then we travel down a lonely country road

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 To come upon the scene of a terrible car accident

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Which begs us to ask the question

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Does everyone on earth have a guardian angel?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Or are some people just left to the whims of fate?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 I'm your host Jason Garbender, I'm having a great day!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Hope you guys are staying warm!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Cause I'm free!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 See, I'm so cold!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 And I can't run any heaters cause they're too loud!

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 So, I'm just gonna complain about it

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 As I record this podcast.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 As someone who never complains walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Our newest Patreon supporters

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Everyone give a big warm round of applause for Okulanda!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Okulanda, come on into Dead Rabbit Command

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Shut the door, shut the door, you're letting the heat out

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Okulanda, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Just help spread the word about the show

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 That really, really helps out a lot

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 We also have a merch store

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And I have an Amazon wish list

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 If you wanna buy me a book

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 If you wanna buy me a spooky book, you can check that out

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 But, if you don't wanna spend any money on me

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 That's fine too, just spread the word about the show

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Okulanda, I'm gonna go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 We're gonna turn on the heater and we're gonna hop on inside

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Let's leave behind Dead Rabbit Command

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 We're headed all the way out to my house

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 *imitates sound of a car*

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 It's like right around the corner

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 We could've just walked there to waste the gas

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 But, we're here, we're at my dumpster

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Is specifically where we're going

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 I talked about this on my TikTok

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 I posted this yesterday on my TikTok

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 But I wanted to go on a more detail

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 I was taking my trash out the other day

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And as I was cramming my garbage into this dumpster

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 The garbage people haven't come to empty it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 'Cause of the stupid winter storm

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 There, luckily, at the top of the trash

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 I didn't have to dig through a bunch of chicken bones to get it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 But to be fair, it was in the dumpster

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 It did have trash on it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Was a Mason's hat

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 It wasn't like a Shriners cap

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Man, that would've been a cool find

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 It's a baseball cap with the Mason's logo on it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 You know, like the compass and the G

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 There's a specific term for it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 It's called like the SNC

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Or like the Scales and Compass logo

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Is what it's called

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 And I'm looking at it and I'm like, what?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Is this real?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Pinch me, pinch me, I'm gonna pinch myself

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 No, it's cool, like I do collect baseball caps

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 I've talked about it before on my show

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 I collect all sorts of hats, but mostly baseball caps

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 But here's this Mason's cap

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 So I put my garbage in

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And I pulled that one out

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Took it home

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 That's the end of the story

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 It's not like a ghost of a Mason showed up last night

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Or anything like that

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 I just think it's really interesting

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 I talked about it on TikTok

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 I posted it on TikTok and I made a joke

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 I gotta be specific, it was a joke

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 That I'm going to wear it so cops don't pull me over

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And then I'm gonna wear it to court hearings

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 So the judge will let me go

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 The reason why I have to specify it's a joke

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Because apparently, I did some research on this

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 It is illegal

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 In some states, I haven't checked out Oregon specifically yet

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 But it's illegal in some states to pretend you are a Mason

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Isn't that weird?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Like the law doesn't say you can't be a Mason

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 But it does specify you can't lie that you're a member of a group

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 And it shows like fraternal orders

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 It's one of the ones that is...

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 You can't say that you're a Mason

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And not actually be one of those dudes

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 So I will say this

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 I'll probably end up wearing it because I do collect hats

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 And it's definitely a oddity of a hat

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 But what it means is that other Masons will come up to me

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Like hide in the bushes in the skull count

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And they'll ask you questions

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 To see if you're really a Mason

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 And what makes it illegal apparently

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Whether or not they used to enforce these laws

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 I found a story from like 1930 of a guy

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Who went to jail for this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 But I mean again it was 1930

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 People were going to jail for all sorts of stuff

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 But nowadays on the record books

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Like they were saying like Maryland

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 You get like $100 fine

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Whether or not anyone actually gets prosecuted for this stuff

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 I don't know

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 I guess I'll find out soon when I'm doing my

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Just put in jail dead rabbit radio special

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 A Mason walks up to you and they'll ask you questions

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Apparently there's some like Mason questions

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 And they'll be like "Where's the Jorat on Sunday?"

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 And duvety it's the grape level

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Like there's like a code or something

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 I don't know any of that stuff right

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 So if I'm wearing the Mason cap

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 And someone comes up to me and starts asking me questions

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 They're like "Where's the bathroom?"

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 I'm like "Whoa whoa whoa I'm not a Mason I'm not a Mason"

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 They're like "No seriously I have to go to the bathroom"

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 As long as I don't pretend to be a Mason

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 I guess it's legit

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Maybe I guess I'll find out when I get arrested

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 For wearing this Mason's hat

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Yeah cause it's a copyrighted symbol

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 It's weird

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 But then I thought you know I have that Israeli police hat

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 That I bought a long time ago

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 I talked about that on a previous episode

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 And people would come up to me and go

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 "Are you from Israel or are you Israeli?"

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Usually it was other Israeli people

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Who'd be like "No I just bought the hat"

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And they'd always be like "Aww"

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 I thought I made a friend

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 But I think as long as I don't claim to be an Israeli police officer

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Or claim to be a Mason guy

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 But what's interesting like no one

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 I never got prosecuted for pretending to be a cop

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 When I wore the Israeli police hat

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 But the like...

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 If I saw someone wearing a Mason's hat

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 I guess...let me ask you this

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Would you assume they were a Mason?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 I don't know if I would

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Cause if I see someone wearing like a Los Angeles Raiders hat

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Or LA, what are they now? The Las Vegas Raiders?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 You don't assume their members of the team

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 You assume their fans of the Raiders

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Or their criminals from the 1990s

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 If you saw someone with a Mason's hat

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Would you assume they were a Mason?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 You're already like "Jason don't even finish the sentence"

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Obviously that's what people think

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Or maybe they're just fans of the Mason's

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Maybe they're fans of the work

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 I don't know

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 If I see someone wearing a hat that says "Army" on it

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 I don't always assume they're in the army

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 And if I see someone wearing a hat that says "Swat" on it

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 I never assume they're a Swat person

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Because they're standing there ordering Taco Bell at 1 in the morning

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 So it's interesting that you don't get prosecuted

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 For impersonating a Swat officer

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Or impersonating a member of the Raiders team

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 But there might be more of a thing

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 I don't think many people who are wearing sports gear

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Try to pass themselves off as members of the New England Patriots

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 But if you had a Mason's hat on

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 I think the key would be "Am I pretending to be a Mason?"

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Or "I'm just wearing a hat I found in the garbage"

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 So anyways, I now have a Mason's hat

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 It may show up in a livestream at some point

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Who knows?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 I may end up in prison because of it

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Who knows?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 I guess the future is our oyster

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 We will see what happens with my garbage hat

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 I'm wondering why the person threw it away

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Did they move out?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Did someone find it?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 I don't know

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 I guess we will find out

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 I keep saying that

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 I can almost be assured that when I say "Find out"

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Something bad will happen

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Again, either a bunch of Mason's will break in my house

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 And beat me up for impersonating them

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Or anything from that to me getting lice

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Because again, I did find a baseball cap in the trash

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 But I will keep you updated

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 I will keep you updated as to the court hearings

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Or beatings or lice infestation

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Whichever way happens, you will know about it

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Okulanda, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dirgeable

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 We're going to leave behind my dumpster

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 We're going to leave behind a great way to start this episode

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 We're leaving behind his dumpster

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 We're headed all the way out to the Midwest

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 There's this really cool, relatively new subreddit

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Called "The Church of Charles Fort"

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 I'll put the link on the show notes

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 If you guys don't know who Charles Fort is

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 He's the guy, back when was it?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 It was in the early 1900s, he started publishing all these books

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Like "The Book of the Damned"

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 His name has become synonymous with weirdness and high strangeness

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 There's that magazine "40 in Times"

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 The term "40" is basically the steady of the bizarre

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 So Charles Fort was one of the very first guys to start compiling records of

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Frogs falling from the sky, mysterious events, fairies, things like that

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 That's really, really good stuff

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 He's basically the Jacques Valet of his time period

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Just someone who was really enthusiastic about figuring out how the world worked

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And how all this paranormal stuff started

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 And there's this new subreddit called "The Church of Charles Fort"

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 They're posting a lot of really good stuff there

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 I recently just became a mod

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 I was recently talking to the guy who started it

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 A user going by the name "Cold Black Water"

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 And he goes "I just want to cover obscure stuff"

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 "I don't want to cover stuff that's been told a hundred times"

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 And I was like "Can I help you? Can I please?"

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 "Please be a part of your team so graciously he let me be a mod on that"

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 And we really want to...

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 This will be great, because we need more things like this

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 I'm tired of hearing about Bermuda Triangle

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 I'm tired of hearing about the same stories over and over and over again

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 And this is one of the... I had never heard this story before

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 So thanks for posting this and hopefully this subreddit

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 We get more great stuff like that

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 There is an article written by a researcher named T. Peter Park

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 About the Lincoln legend

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Here's the story

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 In the late 1890s in the Midwest of the United States

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 There's a small town, it's unnamed

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 This is a story that T. Peter Park heard himself back in the 1960s

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 And it was a friend of a friend who was there

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 It was my doctor who knew someone who witnessed these events

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 And he was fascinated by this story

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 He always seemed to be one step behind of the actual legend

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 And no one could ever specify when it happened outside of like the late 1890s

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Or where it happened

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 But he heard this story so many times he...

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 He had to get to the bottom of it

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 In the late 1890s in this unnamed small Midwestern town

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 A family of strangers move into town

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 A horse comes walking in

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Buggy, like stagecoach stuff

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 A dad

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 [laughs]

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Go down, slow horse

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Slow horse, time to stop

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 And then there's a mom sitting next to him and being like

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 "Oh, I guess we're here now!"

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 And then in the back of this wagon

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 There's a daughter and these two sons

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 And they're like stretching, they're like

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 "Ah, it's finally nice to be home!"

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 And the townspeople are like, "Who are these total weirdos?"

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Because what they're looking at is the Lincoln family

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 They all shared these weird characteristics

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 They were all...

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 The word that's kind of summed up

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 To explain all five of them is "frogish"

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 They were described as being very "frogish" people

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 They were squat-bodied people with ugly faces

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 And sickly white skin

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 Their eyes seemed to bulge out of their sockets

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 And they had broad foreheads

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 [laughs]

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Out of all of those, I don't even know why they mentioned the foreheads

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 That's fine, I know a lot of people with broad foreheads

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 But anyways, like, that just seems like such a de-escalation

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Considering the fact you described them as frogs

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 It's not like you're like "And then kids, wait for this!"

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 They had really big foreheads

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 "Oh, that's so spooky, like, you could've just left that part out"

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 And these guys are just kind of walking around town

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And but here's the thing, man, looks aren't everything, right?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Like, even if you were...

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Even if you did look like an ugly frog

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Whatever, like, maybe you're a really hard worker

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Maybe you're a nice guy

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 They weren't...

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 [laughs]

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 They weren't at all

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 So not only do they look like "frogish" people

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 They also were very unfriendly

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 But, okay, they're unfriendly

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 You might be unfriendly too if everyone described you as looking like a human frog

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 But it's not just that they were ugly

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 It's not just that they were unfriendly

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 They also were super, super creepy

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 What people would see is every show often

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 A member of the Lincoln family would be spotted walking around town late at night

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Looking into windows

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 [panting]

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And then disappearing back into the shrubs

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Maybe you're walking with your special girl through town square

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 And you see some movement in the distance

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Very frog-like movement

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 You're like, "Oh, no, here they come, so you gotta cut your date short"

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 You don't even get to first base

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 And baseball hadn't even been invented yet

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 But what are you gonna do, right?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 They're weirdos and they look weird and they're kind of mean

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 But, you know, what are you gonna do?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Are you gonna run them outside of town just because they're a bunch of weirdos?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Nah, just let them be

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 They're not really hurting anybody

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Well, that was kind of the idea

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 But in 1896, one of the Lincoln boys

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Specifically starts stalking the daughter of a prominent local family

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 So there's this young maiden, she's sitting there

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Fixing her hair

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 It's all curly and stuff and the frog man

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 He's not actually a frog man

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 But this Lincoln, we'll call him Charlie

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Starts stalking the young daughter of a prominent local family

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 But stalking is just not cutting it anymore

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 He's tired of just hiding in the bushes

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Staring through the window while she's sleeping

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 He wants the real thing

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 So one night he tracks her down

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 And rapes her and murders her

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 And it sounds like, okay, that's enough

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 We shouldn't have even let it get this far

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 But it's done, so they lynch the kid

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 There's no trial, it's the 1890s

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 They chase him down, he was hiding out the lagoon

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 He's sitting on the lily pad, no one will suspect that the frog person is here

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 They grab him, they lynch him, it's over with

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 At the young man's funeral

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 The Lincoln family is there

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 As well as other town officials

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 For some reason, I guess they're rubbing it in

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 They lynched him, they murdered him

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 I don't know why they're attending his funeral

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 We'll always remember that the great time we had

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 Hanging you

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 As they're at the funeral, the father of the clan

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Of the Lincoln clan curses the town

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 The whole town will regret this

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 How dare you kill my son who raped and murdered that woman

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 How dare you?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 And then he had this slug in his hand

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 And he throws the slug at the dead girl's father

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 And says, "This, this is your doom!"

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 And the family storms out from the funeral

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Now that would be horrible, right?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 I mean, like all of it

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 All of it getting a slug thrown at you on your birthday would be awful

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 But getting a slug thrown at you

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 Being cursed by the father of the kid who raped and murdered your daughter

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 It'd be awful in any situation

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Anyways, I just imagine like this slug hitting the dude

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 And just kind of tumbling down his clothes

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And being like, "Uh, if that's the worst you got then I'm not worried"

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 But it wasn't the worst they had

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 What happens shortly afterwards

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Is the dead girl's father is found dead

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And shortly after that

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 The girl who'd been raped and murdered her own brother is found dead

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 But it wasn't just that they were dead, it's tragic

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 It was how they died

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 Both the father and the brother were found squished

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Just pulped, they were just so pfft

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Like all over the place

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 They're all goode, right?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 And not only were they basically turned into pie filling

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 They were covered in slime

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 So you have two bodies that both look like someone stepped into a bowl of raviolis and kept walking

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And then you have like this slug-like slime covering them

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 So...

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 That's alarming, right?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And people immediately think that the Lincoln's had something to do with it

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 Then the townspeople start to see the dead Lincoln boy

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Walking around town

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Everyone knew what he looked like

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Cause he was constantly looking in their windows

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 He's seeing around town and what's...

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 That's alarming, right?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 So now we have a revenge

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 We have a sluggy revenge

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 We have a possible ghost, a revenant, walking around town

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 And people who see him start to go insane

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 So the townspeople are like, "Enough's enough"

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 They could have kicked him out when they first showed up, but we had opened hearts

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 We should have kicked him out when they started stalking people, but we didn't

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 We should have kicked the rest of the family out when one of their sons brutally assaulted this young woman

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 We got this family members turned inside out

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 And now people are going and saying, "What else will it take?"

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 They march to the young man's grave now

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 To make sure that he's actually dead

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 And when they're walking towards his grave, they notice something

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 There's a set of footprints headed the opposite direction from his grave

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 So the idea is that he got out and he walked away

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 But they just walked past that, they still gotta know for sure

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 They opened up the grave

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 His body is not in it

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 Shortly after that, the Lincoln's moved away

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 They left town, which is what the townspeople really wanted in the first place

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 But they just kept letting this problem prolong

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Ever since then, every natural disaster that befalls the town

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 The Lincoln's are blamed for it

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Natural disasters, droughts, floods

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 It's all blamed on the Lincoln curse

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Very very interesting urban legend, it's actually super detailed for an urban legend

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 But we had, it's pretty original for an urban legend as well

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Urban legends for the most part are universal, the Phantom Hitchhiker

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 You'll find that everywhere

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 The story about the baby, please stop bringing this up

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 The story about the baby in the microwave

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Very common urban legend where the babysitter takes acid

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 I was talking to Stuart Meatball

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 He is a long time listener of the show

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And he lives in Scotland and I asked him, "Is that an urban legend in Scotland?"

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 He goes, "Well, an interesting difference

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Acid apparently isn't as readily available in Scotland as it is in America

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Heroin is the drug of choice, it's very cheap

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 So in their version of the story, the babysitter does heroin

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And accidentally puts the turkey in the bed and the baby in the oven

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 So we have those details, this story seems so regional

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 And what's fascinating about it is the story exists

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 The story is not some fictional account that was made up

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 It existed at one point and people told it to each other

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 But it's always, let's say T. Peter Park heard this story back in 1966

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 When he was at the University of Virginia

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 And he was always told it was this town, it was this other town it was happening in

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 It's never the town you're in

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 It's my uncle knew a woman who heard this story before

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Because she grew up in this town

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Or her grandpa grew up in this town

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 There's always this weird connection but it's never where you're at

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 It's never the person you're hearing it from

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Really, really interesting urban legend

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 And it's existed for enough that when T. Peter Park was investigating it

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Not only was he finding other people who had heard of the story

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 But people were falsifying documents, people were actually trying to mislead him

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 People were actually falsifying documents, writing fake letters

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Because he was really searching for this and people were like

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 "Oh yeah, I have some letters from my grandpa's trunk or something"

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 And he sent these to this researcher and they turned out to be fake

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Because where does this even come from?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 It's really, really interesting, the article is quite long

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 I really wanted to focus on the urban legend itself

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 But I'll put in the show notes, the article to show the investigation he did

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 To try to figure out what part of the story is true, where it came from and things like that

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 But in the end, spoiler alert, he's never able to find out any more information than he really had in the beginning

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 That being, there's a story of a family called the Lincoln's

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Who came into a town and tragedy befell all the residents of this sleepy, unnamed midwestern town

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Very, very interesting urban legend

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 You have to wonder, is it one that did have some truth to it?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Because going back into the 1890s, this is such a regional story

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Parts of it may have been in the local news

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 But if that newspaper went under, if that newspaper stopped publishing at a certain point

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 They would have no archives for us to go back to

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Maybe this is one of those stories, that there are elements of it

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 That's true, a weird family came into town

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Their son assaulted someone and the son was lynched

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 That stuff unfortunately happens, not him getting lynched

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 He shouldn't be assaulting and murdering people

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 But it's interesting because this could be one of those stories that does have a lot of truthful elements in it

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 But over time it's become monstrous and supernatural

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Either way, it's pretty much lost the history at this point

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 It's always creepy when you have stories about vengeance from beyond the grave

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 But the person coming back to wreck vengeance is actually the bad guy in the story in the first place

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 So it's like he was evil in life and now he's even more evil in death

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 And there's no stopping him

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Because how do you kill something that's already dead?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Okulanda, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carpenter copter

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 We're leaving behind this small Midwestern town

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 The Lincoln's are throwing slugs at us, we're like run run run

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Let's get out of here, we're leaving behind this town

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 We're headed all the way out to another unnamed location

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 This story is not an urban legend, but it is a story

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 A lot of times when people post things online, they don't want to give away too much information

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 A lot of times people don't want to put information in and they think it may lead back to them

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 So I understand that I would like this information, but I understand that

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 I found this online, it was written by someone who goes by the name "Proof Test 4150"

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 We're going to call him Terry

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 We're going to call him Terry, but if that's accurate it's just a stab in the dark

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 It's a really interesting story and I want to jump into the meat of it

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 In 1998 Terry is driving down this country road

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And he's sitting in the back seat and then you have the driver and the passenger up front

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Both friends of his and they're coming up to a four-way stop

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 But I can't believe people still do this or ever did it

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Some idiots thought it would be funny, clever, I don't know what it is

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 They removed the four stop signs

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 So now you basically are just waiting for people to die

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 This is not a funny prank, it's super dangerous

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 They removed the four stop signs

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 And Terry and his friends are driving down this road and they come to this intersection

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 They just get T-boned by this other car going 60 miles an hour

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Now Terry comes to and he's covered in his own blood

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 He's sitting in the back seat, he's covered in his own blood

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 He says that he had been unconscious for about 30 minutes

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 I don't know if that's the case

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 I think that's a long time to be unconscious

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 I think simply getting T-boned by another car going 60 miles an hour is going to distort your sense of time

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 But whatever the thing is, he's sitting in this car, he's covered in his own blood

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 And the driver of his car, his friend, is in so much pain he can't even speak

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 He's just kind of making these noises

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 And Terry's sitting back there and he's like, "Oh my god, what is going on?"

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Like, you know what's going on but you're still in shock and his buddy is just kind of groaning

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 And his other friend, Terry's other friend is outside of the vehicle pacing back and forth

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Now this story again takes place in 1998, so we don't have cell phones

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 I mean they existed but they were so rare

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 You don't have cell phones, you're out in the country

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 It's almost like you just gotta wait

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Maybe send someone to a nearby house to make a phone call

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 If you have that wherewithal, there's a lot of people in shock

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 You're just kind of waiting, it would be awful

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 And at this point, the driver starts screaming

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 So now what things have gotten worse, right?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Your poor buddy up there is in so much pain he can't even do anything but gurgle

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And now he's screaming and Terry's sitting in the back seat

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 And that's when an older man walks up, it wasn't like Methuselah or anything like that

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 But older than these guys were, these guys were like in their early 20s

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 This dude walks up and asks Terry, "Hey, do you need anything? Do you need any help?"

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 And in a state of shock, Terry obviously needs some help

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 But he's like, "I think my friend's dying, can you help my friend? Can you help my friend?"

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 This older man who's in his 40s is standing outside the car and goes, "Yeah, do you want me to pray with you?"

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 "Do you want me to pray for the driver with you?"

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 And Terry's like, "Yeah, please"

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 So they begin to pray and this man is just kind of consoling Terry and keeping him comfortable

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 And everything's going to be okay, you're going to be okay, and Terry's just distraught

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 And he's worried more about other people than himself

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 This man stands there the entire time talking to him

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Even when the firefighters finally show up and they have to cut Terry out of the car

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 The car is so mangled up he can't get out on his own

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 They have to cut him out of the car, the man is always just standing there

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 And then after Terry is removed from the car, the man just kind of leaves the scene

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Weeks later, weeks have passed now and everyone's fine, everyone's totally fine

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 The friend's still screaming weeks later, "Hey everybody, how's it going?"

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 A couple weeks later the friends get together and they're kind of talking about what would happen

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Because what else would you talk about, right? This is kind of going to be your main subject for a while

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 They start talking about everything that happened and the two friends are like, "Hey Terry, you know, we've been meaning to talk to you"

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 "We went for all the blood to get cleaned up and us to be helped from the hospital"

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 But what was up with you in the backseat?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 And Terry's like, "What are you talking about?" And they're like, "Well, I was busy screaming because I was in so much pain"

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 And this dude was outside walking around the car trying to figure out what to do

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 But you were just in the backseat just kind of mumbling to yourself

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 So what are you talking about? I was talking to that guy who came up to the car

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 And that's the two friends kind of licking each other and we're like, "Yeah, you keep saying that"

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 And you said it then, "You keep saying thank you sir, thank you for staying with me"

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 There was no one there

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 There was no one there this whole time

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 We don't know what you were talking about

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 And Terry starts to think, "Whoa, is that like a guardian angel or did I just suffer massive brain damage?"

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Like, what was that? He knew the guy was there, he knew for a fact this guy was there, but

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Fast forward 20 years

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Terry never forgot what this guy looked like

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 It was a pivotal moment in his life, it was a stranger who stayed with him until he was okay

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 In one of the scariest moments of his life, the stranger stayed with him

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 But one day Terry looked in the mirror and the man stared back at him

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 He realized this man who would come to the car, I should have described earlier, I shouldn't have described it, it looked like

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Here, pretend this happened, the man walked up to the car and he had a shaved head and a beard

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 So now I'm too lazy, clip that out and put that in the episode somewhere

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Terry's looking in the mirror, over the years he ended up shaving his head, he's like, "Ah, you know, I'm gonna go for this cool Jason Statham look"

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 And over the years he said, "You know what, I wanna be like Kratos from God of War, I'm gonna grow a big old beard from the new versions, from the PS5 versions, I'm gonna grow a big beard"

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And so one day he looks in the mirror with this shaved head and his beard and he looks up and he goes, "It's you!"

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 He realized that the person outside of the car was him from the future

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 And he finishes off his post with this quote, "I know it seems strange that I didn't recognize myself, but I look so different now than I did back then"

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 "When I recognized the man in the mirror as the man at the scene of my wreck, I was genuinely overwhelmed with emotion"

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 "I'm certain it was me"

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 It's an interesting story and let's put on a conspiracy cap to wrap this up

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 What it basically does is it turns the idea of guardian angels on its head

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 It's a guardian angel story with a dash of time travel

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 And it makes you ask the question, is it possible that guardian angels are us from the future?

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Now not everyone recognizes their guardian angel, but very famously there's that episode that I did and this was a viral video

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 There was a man standing there and someone walked by him and tapped him on the shoulder

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 And when the guy turned to look, there's this massive gate swinging towards him and the dude jumps out of the way

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 And they never knew who the guy was who tapped him on the shoulder, it was really weird video

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 And you have to think, if that guy had not tapped him on the shoulder, he would have been grievously injured by this swinging gate

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 I'll put all that in the show notes, but...

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Usually that's how guardian angels show up

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 So we have incidents like that where we can't prove it's them in the future, but when we look at the story and the guy's adamant

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 This guardian angel was myself from the future, what does that say about guardian angels?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 Are they us from the future? Are they... is it some sort of mental time travel or spiritual time travel?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 No one else saw him there

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 No one else saw him there

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Is it possible that his own consciousness reached in to the past to have this conversation with him?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Because the Terry in the future remembered how tragic the event was

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.760
 So when the event happened in the timeline the future Terry was remembering the event and manipulated the memory

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.620
 Fascinating fascinating story you can really play around with this when I say time traveler

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.060
 I'm not necessarily mean bleep-blop bloop. We're sitting in a machine and

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:56.900
 It takes them back to that event it could just be the consciousness the spirit

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.720
 Existing in two points in time at the same moment and what I find

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.260
 Intriguing about this conspiracy theory is when we talk about guardian angels

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.220
 The question I always have is how come everyone doesn't have one

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.560
 How come for every video I can see of a guy

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:23.980
 Dodging death because of a warning from a stranger. I watch another video of four people pushing this metal structure down the road and

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.500
 they hit the power lines and

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.140
 Like they were pushing the structure. This is real video

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:35.900
 Unfortunately, they were pushing this metal frame down the road and had these four long poles on it and the poles were tall enough

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:42.060
 To touch the power lines and I'm watching this video and it's for people being electrocuted to death

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:46.100
 Because they hadn't they had misjudged the height. They probably never even thought of that

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.380
 So where was their guardian angel?

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:55.460
 Like there's video after video after video and even not on video. There's scores of people who die in

00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.500
 All sorts of ways either bizarre ways like the one I described are just fairly mundane ways

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:05.500
 Where's their guardian angel and it could be that guardian angels aren't this external force

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:11.540
 They're us there's something in us that's stretching across the timeline

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:19.500
 That would explain why not everyone has a guardian angel because if you look at the idea of angels themselves these messengers of God

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.500
 There's trillions of them

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.940
 Like numerically, I don't even think you can count them

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:31.820
 They I know what demons they say there's 10,000 demons her every finger on the hand of every human

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:38.100
 So that's a lot demons and demons are one-third of the amount of angels

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.700
 So I I that those are estimates that have been put out by theologians

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:47.340
 And there's definitely more than enough angels to for every human to have a guardian angel or hundreds of thousands each

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:53.300
 But they're not there a lot of people die in avoidable ways is the phenomenon of the guardian angel

00:33:53.860 --> 00:34:01.660
 Different than angels as we know them the guardian angel is actually yourself somehow you're able to

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:08.420
 Expand your consciousness so it defies time and space. Is it something you can train?

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:14.100
 Is it something you can prepare for is the story of Terry just a fluke?

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.820
 Is it a result of massive head trauma?

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.900
 But if that was the case, how would he know what he was gonna look like 20 years from now?

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:28.780
 It's a bizarre story and it may lead us down the path of finding out what the truth is behind the phenomenon

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.780
 No one has guardian angels

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.600
 Maybe when you are at your lowest point

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.440
 Maybe when your back is against the wall, maybe when your life depends on it

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.660
 The only person you can count on

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.860
 To come to your aid is yourself
