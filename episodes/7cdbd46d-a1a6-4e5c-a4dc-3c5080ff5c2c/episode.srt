21
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Is it possible that a family of misfits

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Caught upon the power of the slug

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 To wipe out their enemies?

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And then we travel down a lonely country road

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 To come upon the scene of a terrible car accident

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Which begs us to ask the question

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Does everyone on earth have a guardian angel?

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Or are some people just left to the whims of fate?

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio!

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio!

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I'm your host Jason Garbender, I'm having a great day!

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too!

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Hope you guys are staying warm!

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Cause I'm free!

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 See, I'm so cold!

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And I can't run any heaters cause they're too loud!

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 So, I'm just gonna complain about it

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 As I record this podcast.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 As someone who never complains walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Our newest Patreon supporters

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Everyone give a big warm round of applause for Okulanda!

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Okulanda, come on into Dead Rabbit Command

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Shut the door, shut the door, you're letting the heat out

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Okulanda, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Just help spread the word about the show

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 That really, really helps out a lot

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 We also have a merch store

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And I have an Amazon wish list

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 If you wanna buy me a book

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 If you wanna buy me a spooky book, you can check that out

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 But, if you don't wanna spend any money on me

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 That's fine too, just spread the word about the show

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Okulanda, I'm gonna go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 We're gonna turn on the heater and we're gonna hop on inside

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Let's leave behind Dead Rabbit Command

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 We're headed all the way out to my house

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 *imitates sound of a car*

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It's like right around the corner

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 We could've just walked there to waste the gas

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 But, we're here, we're at my dumpster

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Is specifically where we're going

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I talked about this on my TikTok

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I posted this yesterday on my TikTok

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 But I wanted to go on a more detail

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I was taking my trash out the other day

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And as I was cramming my garbage into this dumpster

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 The garbage people haven't come to empty it

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 'Cause of the stupid winter storm

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 There, luckily, at the top of the trash

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I didn't have to dig through a bunch of chicken bones to get it

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 But to be fair, it was in the dumpster

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 It did have trash on it

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Was a Mason's hat

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 It wasn't like a Shriners cap

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Man, that would've been a cool find

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 It's a baseball cap with the Mason's logo on it

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 You know, like the compass and the G

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 There's a specific term for it

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 It's called like the SNC

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Or like the Scales and Compass logo

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Is what it's called

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And I'm looking at it and I'm like, what?

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Is this real?

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Pinch me, pinch me, I'm gonna pinch myself

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 No, it's cool, like I do collect baseball caps

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I've talked about it before on my show

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I collect all sorts of hats, but mostly baseball caps

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 But here's this Mason's cap

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 So I put my garbage in

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And I pulled that one out

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Took it home

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 That's the end of the story

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 It's not like a ghost of a Mason showed up last night

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Or anything like that

96
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I just think it's really interesting

97
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I talked about it on TikTok

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I posted it on TikTok and I made a joke

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I gotta be specific, it was a joke

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 That I'm going to wear it so cops don't pull me over

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And then I'm gonna wear it to court hearings

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 So the judge will let me go

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 The reason why I have to specify it's a joke

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Because apparently, I did some research on this

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 It is illegal

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 In some states, I haven't checked out Oregon specifically yet

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 But it's illegal in some states to pretend you are a Mason

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Isn't that weird?

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Like the law doesn't say you can't be a Mason

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But it does specify you can't lie that you're a member of a group

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And it shows like fraternal orders

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 It's one of the ones that is...

113
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 You can't say that you're a Mason

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And not actually be one of those dudes

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So I will say this

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I'll probably end up wearing it because I do collect hats

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And it's definitely a oddity of a hat

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 But what it means is that other Masons will come up to me

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Like hide in the bushes in the skull count

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And they'll ask you questions

121
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 To see if you're really a Mason

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And what makes it illegal apparently

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Whether or not they used to enforce these laws

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I found a story from like 1930 of a guy

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Who went to jail for this

126
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 But I mean again it was 1930

127
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 People were going to jail for all sorts of stuff

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 But nowadays on the record books

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Like they were saying like Maryland

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 You get like $100 fine

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Whether or not anyone actually gets prosecuted for this stuff

132
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I don't know

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I guess I'll find out soon when I'm doing my

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Just put in jail dead rabbit radio special

135
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 A Mason walks up to you and they'll ask you questions

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Apparently there's some like Mason questions

137
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And they'll be like "Where's the Jorat on Sunday?"

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And duvety it's the grape level

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Like there's like a code or something

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 I don't know any of that stuff right

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So if I'm wearing the Mason cap

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And someone comes up to me and starts asking me questions

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 They're like "Where's the bathroom?"

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I'm like "Whoa whoa whoa I'm not a Mason I'm not a Mason"

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 They're like "No seriously I have to go to the bathroom"

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 As long as I don't pretend to be a Mason

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I guess it's legit

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Maybe I guess I'll find out when I get arrested

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 For wearing this Mason's hat

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Yeah cause it's a copyrighted symbol

151
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 It's weird

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 But then I thought you know I have that Israeli police hat

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 That I bought a long time ago

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 I talked about that on a previous episode

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And people would come up to me and go

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 "Are you from Israel or are you Israeli?"

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Usually it was other Israeli people

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Who'd be like "No I just bought the hat"

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And they'd always be like "Aww"

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I thought I made a friend

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 But I think as long as I don't claim to be an Israeli police officer

162
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Or claim to be a Mason guy

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 But what's interesting like no one

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 I never got prosecuted for pretending to be a cop

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 When I wore the Israeli police hat

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 But the like...

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 If I saw someone wearing a Mason's hat

168
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I guess...let me ask you this

169
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Would you assume they were a Mason?

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I don't know if I would

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Cause if I see someone wearing like a Los Angeles Raiders hat

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Or LA, what are they now? The Las Vegas Raiders?

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 You don't assume their members of the team

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 You assume their fans of the Raiders

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Or their criminals from the 1990s

176
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 If you saw someone with a Mason's hat

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Would you assume they were a Mason?

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 You're already like "Jason don't even finish the sentence"

179
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Obviously that's what people think

180
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Or maybe they're just fans of the Mason's

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Maybe they're fans of the work

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I don't know

183
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 If I see someone wearing a hat that says "Army" on it

184
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I don't always assume they're in the army

185
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And if I see someone wearing a hat that says "Swat" on it

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I never assume they're a Swat person

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Because they're standing there ordering Taco Bell at 1 in the morning

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So it's interesting that you don't get prosecuted

189
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 For impersonating a Swat officer

190
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Or impersonating a member of the Raiders team

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 But there might be more of a thing

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I don't think many people who are wearing sports gear

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Try to pass themselves off as members of the New England Patriots

194
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 But if you had a Mason's hat on

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 I think the key would be "Am I pretending to be a Mason?"

196
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Or "I'm just wearing a hat I found in the garbage"

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 So anyways, I now have a Mason's hat

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 It may show up in a livestream at some point

199
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Who knows?

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I may end up in prison because of it

201
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Who knows?

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I guess the future is our oyster

203
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 We will see what happens with my garbage hat

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I'm wondering why the person threw it away

205
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Did they move out?

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Did someone find it?

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I don't know

208
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I guess we will find out

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I keep saying that

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I can almost be assured that when I say "Find out"

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Something bad will happen

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Again, either a bunch of Mason's will break in my house

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And beat me up for impersonating them

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Or anything from that to me getting lice

215
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Because again, I did find a baseball cap in the trash

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 But I will keep you updated

217
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I will keep you updated as to the court hearings

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Or beatings or lice infestation

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Whichever way happens, you will know about it

220
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Okulanda, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dirgeable

221
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 We're going to leave behind my dumpster

222
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 We're going to leave behind a great way to start this episode

223
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 We're leaving behind his dumpster

224
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 We're headed all the way out to the Midwest

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 There's this really cool, relatively new subreddit

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Called "The Church of Charles Fort"

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I'll put the link on the show notes

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 If you guys don't know who Charles Fort is

229
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 He's the guy, back when was it?

230
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 It was in the early 1900s, he started publishing all these books

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Like "The Book of the Damned"

232
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 His name has become synonymous with weirdness and high strangeness

233
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 There's that magazine "40 in Times"

234
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 The term "40" is basically the steady of the bizarre

235
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 So Charles Fort was one of the very first guys to start compiling records of

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Frogs falling from the sky, mysterious events, fairies, things like that

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 That's really, really good stuff

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 He's basically the Jacques Valet of his time period

239
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Just someone who was really enthusiastic about figuring out how the world worked

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And how all this paranormal stuff started

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And there's this new subreddit called "The Church of Charles Fort"

242
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 They're posting a lot of really good stuff there

243
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I recently just became a mod

244
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I was recently talking to the guy who started it

245
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 A user going by the name "Cold Black Water"

246
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And he goes "I just want to cover obscure stuff"

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 "I don't want to cover stuff that's been told a hundred times"

248
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And I was like "Can I help you? Can I please?"

249
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 "Please be a part of your team so graciously he let me be a mod on that"

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And we really want to...

251
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 This will be great, because we need more things like this

252
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 I'm tired of hearing about Bermuda Triangle

253
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 I'm tired of hearing about the same stories over and over and over again

254
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And this is one of the... I had never heard this story before

255
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So thanks for posting this and hopefully this subreddit

256
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 We get more great stuff like that

257
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 There is an article written by a researcher named T. Peter Park

258
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 About the Lincoln legend

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Here's the story

260
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 In the late 1890s in the Midwest of the United States

261
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 There's a small town, it's unnamed

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 This is a story that T. Peter Park heard himself back in the 1960s

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And it was a friend of a friend who was there

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 It was my doctor who knew someone who witnessed these events

265
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And he was fascinated by this story

266
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 He always seemed to be one step behind of the actual legend

267
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And no one could ever specify when it happened outside of like the late 1890s

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Or where it happened

269
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 But he heard this story so many times he...

270
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 He had to get to the bottom of it

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 In the late 1890s in this unnamed small Midwestern town

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 A family of strangers move into town

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 A horse comes walking in

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Buggy, like stagecoach stuff

275
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 A dad

276
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 [laughs]

277
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Go down, slow horse

278
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Slow horse, time to stop

279
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And then there's a mom sitting next to him and being like

280
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 "Oh, I guess we're here now!"

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And then in the back of this wagon

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 There's a daughter and these two sons

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And they're like stretching, they're like

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 "Ah, it's finally nice to be home!"

285
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And the townspeople are like, "Who are these total weirdos?"

286
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Because what they're looking at is the Lincoln family

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 They all shared these weird characteristics

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 They were all...

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 The word that's kind of summed up

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 To explain all five of them is "frogish"

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 They were described as being very "frogish" people

292
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 They were squat-bodied people with ugly faces

293
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And sickly white skin

294
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Their eyes seemed to bulge out of their sockets

295
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And they had broad foreheads

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 [laughs]

297
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Out of all of those, I don't even know why they mentioned the foreheads

298
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 That's fine, I know a lot of people with broad foreheads

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 But anyways, like, that just seems like such a de-escalation

300
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Considering the fact you described them as frogs

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 It's not like you're like "And then kids, wait for this!"

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 They had really big foreheads

303
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 "Oh, that's so spooky, like, you could've just left that part out"

304
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And these guys are just kind of walking around town

305
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And but here's the thing, man, looks aren't everything, right?

306
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Like, even if you were...

307
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Even if you did look like an ugly frog

308
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Whatever, like, maybe you're a really hard worker

309
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Maybe you're a nice guy

310
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 They weren't...

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 [laughs]

312
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 They weren't at all

313
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So not only do they look like "frogish" people

314
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 They also were very unfriendly

315
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 But, okay, they're unfriendly

316
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 You might be unfriendly too if everyone described you as looking like a human frog

317
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 But it's not just that they were ugly

318
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 It's not just that they were unfriendly

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 They also were super, super creepy

320
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 What people would see is every show often

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 A member of the Lincoln family would be spotted walking around town late at night

322
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Looking into windows

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 [panting]

324
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And then disappearing back into the shrubs

325
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Maybe you're walking with your special girl through town square

326
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And you see some movement in the distance

327
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Very frog-like movement

328
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 You're like, "Oh, no, here they come, so you gotta cut your date short"

329
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 You don't even get to first base

330
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And baseball hadn't even been invented yet

331
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 But what are you gonna do, right?

332
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 They're weirdos and they look weird and they're kind of mean

333
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 But, you know, what are you gonna do?

334
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Are you gonna run them outside of town just because they're a bunch of weirdos?

335
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Nah, just let them be

336
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 They're not really hurting anybody

337
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Well, that was kind of the idea

338
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 But in 1896, one of the Lincoln boys

339
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Specifically starts stalking the daughter of a prominent local family

340
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 So there's this young maiden, she's sitting there

341
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Fixing her hair

342
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 It's all curly and stuff and the frog man

343
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 He's not actually a frog man

344
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 But this Lincoln, we'll call him Charlie

345
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Starts stalking the young daughter of a prominent local family

346
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 But stalking is just not cutting it anymore

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 He's tired of just hiding in the bushes

348
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Staring through the window while she's sleeping

349
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 He wants the real thing

350
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 So one night he tracks her down

351
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And rapes her and murders her

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And it sounds like, okay, that's enough

353
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 We shouldn't have even let it get this far

354
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 But it's done, so they lynch the kid

355
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 There's no trial, it's the 1890s

356
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 They chase him down, he was hiding out the lagoon

357
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 He's sitting on the lily pad, no one will suspect that the frog person is here

358
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 They grab him, they lynch him, it's over with

359
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 At the young man's funeral

360
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 The Lincoln family is there

361
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 As well as other town officials

362
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 For some reason, I guess they're rubbing it in

363
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 They lynched him, they murdered him

364
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I don't know why they're attending his funeral

365
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 We'll always remember that the great time we had

366
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Hanging you

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 As they're at the funeral, the father of the clan

368
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Of the Lincoln clan curses the town

369
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 The whole town will regret this

370
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 How dare you kill my son who raped and murdered that woman

371
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 How dare you?

372
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And then he had this slug in his hand

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And he throws the slug at the dead girl's father

374
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 And says, "This, this is your doom!"

375
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And the family storms out from the funeral

376
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Now that would be horrible, right?

377
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I mean, like all of it

378
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 All of it getting a slug thrown at you on your birthday would be awful

379
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 But getting a slug thrown at you

380
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Being cursed by the father of the kid who raped and murdered your daughter

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 It'd be awful in any situation

382
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Anyways, I just imagine like this slug hitting the dude

383
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And just kind of tumbling down his clothes

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And being like, "Uh, if that's the worst you got then I'm not worried"

385
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 But it wasn't the worst they had

386
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 What happens shortly afterwards

387
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Is the dead girl's father is found dead

388
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And shortly after that

389
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 The girl who'd been raped and murdered her own brother is found dead

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 But it wasn't just that they were dead, it's tragic

391
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 It was how they died

392
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Both the father and the brother were found squished

393
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Just pulped, they were just so pfft

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Like all over the place

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 They're all goode, right?

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And not only were they basically turned into pie filling

397
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 They were covered in slime

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 So you have two bodies that both look like someone stepped into a bowl of raviolis and kept walking

399
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And then you have like this slug-like slime covering them

400
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 So...

401
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 That's alarming, right?

402
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And people immediately think that the Lincoln's had something to do with it

403
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Then the townspeople start to see the dead Lincoln boy

404
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Walking around town

405
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Everyone knew what he looked like

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Cause he was constantly looking in their windows

407
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He's seeing around town and what's...

408
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 That's alarming, right?

409
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 So now we have a revenge

410
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 We have a sluggy revenge

411
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 We have a possible ghost, a revenant, walking around town

412
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And people who see him start to go insane

413
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 So the townspeople are like, "Enough's enough"

414
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 They could have kicked him out when they first showed up, but we had opened hearts

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 We should have kicked him out when they started stalking people, but we didn't

416
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 We should have kicked the rest of the family out when one of their sons brutally assaulted this young woman

417
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 We got this family members turned inside out

418
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And now people are going and saying, "What else will it take?"

419
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 They march to the young man's grave now

420
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 To make sure that he's actually dead

421
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And when they're walking towards his grave, they notice something

422
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 There's a set of footprints headed the opposite direction from his grave

423
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So the idea is that he got out and he walked away

424
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But they just walked past that, they still gotta know for sure

425
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 They opened up the grave

426
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 His body is not in it

427
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Shortly after that, the Lincoln's moved away

428
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 They left town, which is what the townspeople really wanted in the first place

429
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 But they just kept letting this problem prolong

430
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Ever since then, every natural disaster that befalls the town

431
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 The Lincoln's are blamed for it

432
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Natural disasters, droughts, floods

433
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 It's all blamed on the Lincoln curse

434
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Very very interesting urban legend, it's actually super detailed for an urban legend

435
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 But we had, it's pretty original for an urban legend as well

436
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Urban legends for the most part are universal, the Phantom Hitchhiker

437
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 You'll find that everywhere

438
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 The story about the baby, please stop bringing this up

439
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 The story about the baby in the microwave

440
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Very common urban legend where the babysitter takes acid

441
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I was talking to Stuart Meatball

442
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 He is a long time listener of the show

443
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And he lives in Scotland and I asked him, "Is that an urban legend in Scotland?"

444
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 He goes, "Well, an interesting difference

445
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Acid apparently isn't as readily available in Scotland as it is in America

446
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Heroin is the drug of choice, it's very cheap

447
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 So in their version of the story, the babysitter does heroin

448
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And accidentally puts the turkey in the bed and the baby in the oven

449
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 So we have those details, this story seems so regional

450
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And what's fascinating about it is the story exists

451
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 The story is not some fictional account that was made up

452
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 It existed at one point and people told it to each other

453
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 But it's always, let's say T. Peter Park heard this story back in 1966

454
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 When he was at the University of Virginia

455
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And he was always told it was this town, it was this other town it was happening in

456
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 It's never the town you're in

457
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 It's my uncle knew a woman who heard this story before

458
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Because she grew up in this town

459
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Or her grandpa grew up in this town

460
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 There's always this weird connection but it's never where you're at

461
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 It's never the person you're hearing it from

462
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Really, really interesting urban legend

463
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And it's existed for enough that when T. Peter Park was investigating it

464
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Not only was he finding other people who had heard of the story

465
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 But people were falsifying documents, people were actually trying to mislead him

466
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 People were actually falsifying documents, writing fake letters

467
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Because he was really searching for this and people were like

468
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 "Oh yeah, I have some letters from my grandpa's trunk or something"

469
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And he sent these to this researcher and they turned out to be fake

470
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Because where does this even come from?

471
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It's really, really interesting, the article is quite long

472
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I really wanted to focus on the urban legend itself

473
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 But I'll put in the show notes, the article to show the investigation he did

474
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 To try to figure out what part of the story is true, where it came from and things like that

475
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But in the end, spoiler alert, he's never able to find out any more information than he really had in the beginning

476
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 That being, there's a story of a family called the Lincoln's

477
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Who came into a town and tragedy befell all the residents of this sleepy, unnamed midwestern town

478
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Very, very interesting urban legend

479
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 You have to wonder, is it one that did have some truth to it?

480
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Because going back into the 1890s, this is such a regional story

481
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Parts of it may have been in the local news

482
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 But if that newspaper went under, if that newspaper stopped publishing at a certain point

483
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 They would have no archives for us to go back to

484
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Maybe this is one of those stories, that there are elements of it

485
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 That's true, a weird family came into town

486
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Their son assaulted someone and the son was lynched

487
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 That stuff unfortunately happens, not him getting lynched

488
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 He shouldn't be assaulting and murdering people

489
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 But it's interesting because this could be one of those stories that does have a lot of truthful elements in it

490
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 But over time it's become monstrous and supernatural

491
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Either way, it's pretty much lost the history at this point

492
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 It's always creepy when you have stories about vengeance from beyond the grave

493
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 But the person coming back to wreck vengeance is actually the bad guy in the story in the first place

494
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 So it's like he was evil in life and now he's even more evil in death

495
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And there's no stopping him

496
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Because how do you kill something that's already dead?

497
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Okulanda, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carpenter copter

498
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 We're leaving behind this small Midwestern town

499
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 The Lincoln's are throwing slugs at us, we're like run run run

500
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Let's get out of here, we're leaving behind this town

501
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 We're headed all the way out to another unnamed location

502
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 This story is not an urban legend, but it is a story

503
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 A lot of times when people post things online, they don't want to give away too much information

504
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 A lot of times people don't want to put information in and they think it may lead back to them

505
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 So I understand that I would like this information, but I understand that

506
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I found this online, it was written by someone who goes by the name "Proof Test 4150"

507
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 We're going to call him Terry

508
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 We're going to call him Terry, but if that's accurate it's just a stab in the dark

509
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 It's a really interesting story and I want to jump into the meat of it

510
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 In 1998 Terry is driving down this country road

511
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And he's sitting in the back seat and then you have the driver and the passenger up front

512
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Both friends of his and they're coming up to a four-way stop

513
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 But I can't believe people still do this or ever did it

514
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Some idiots thought it would be funny, clever, I don't know what it is

515
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 They removed the four stop signs

516
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 So now you basically are just waiting for people to die

517
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 This is not a funny prank, it's super dangerous

518
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 They removed the four stop signs

519
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And Terry and his friends are driving down this road and they come to this intersection

520
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 They just get T-boned by this other car going 60 miles an hour

521
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Now Terry comes to and he's covered in his own blood

522
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 He's sitting in the back seat, he's covered in his own blood

523
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 He says that he had been unconscious for about 30 minutes

524
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 I don't know if that's the case

525
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 I think that's a long time to be unconscious

526
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I think simply getting T-boned by another car going 60 miles an hour is going to distort your sense of time

527
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 But whatever the thing is, he's sitting in this car, he's covered in his own blood

528
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And the driver of his car, his friend, is in so much pain he can't even speak

529
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 He's just kind of making these noises

530
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And Terry's sitting back there and he's like, "Oh my god, what is going on?"

531
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Like, you know what's going on but you're still in shock and his buddy is just kind of groaning

532
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And his other friend, Terry's other friend is outside of the vehicle pacing back and forth

533
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Now this story again takes place in 1998, so we don't have cell phones

534
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I mean they existed but they were so rare

535
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 You don't have cell phones, you're out in the country

536
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 It's almost like you just gotta wait

537
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Maybe send someone to a nearby house to make a phone call

538
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 If you have that wherewithal, there's a lot of people in shock

539
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 You're just kind of waiting, it would be awful

540
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And at this point, the driver starts screaming

541
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 So now what things have gotten worse, right?

542
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Your poor buddy up there is in so much pain he can't even do anything but gurgle

543
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And now he's screaming and Terry's sitting in the back seat

544
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And that's when an older man walks up, it wasn't like Methuselah or anything like that

545
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 But older than these guys were, these guys were like in their early 20s

546
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 This dude walks up and asks Terry, "Hey, do you need anything? Do you need any help?"

547
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And in a state of shock, Terry obviously needs some help

548
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 But he's like, "I think my friend's dying, can you help my friend? Can you help my friend?"

549
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 This older man who's in his 40s is standing outside the car and goes, "Yeah, do you want me to pray with you?"

550
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 "Do you want me to pray for the driver with you?"

551
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And Terry's like, "Yeah, please"

552
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 So they begin to pray and this man is just kind of consoling Terry and keeping him comfortable

553
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And everything's going to be okay, you're going to be okay, and Terry's just distraught

554
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And he's worried more about other people than himself

555
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 This man stands there the entire time talking to him

556
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Even when the firefighters finally show up and they have to cut Terry out of the car

557
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 The car is so mangled up he can't get out on his own

558
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 They have to cut him out of the car, the man is always just standing there

559
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 And then after Terry is removed from the car, the man just kind of leaves the scene

560
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Weeks later, weeks have passed now and everyone's fine, everyone's totally fine

561
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 The friend's still screaming weeks later, "Hey everybody, how's it going?"

562
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 A couple weeks later the friends get together and they're kind of talking about what would happen

563
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Because what else would you talk about, right? This is kind of going to be your main subject for a while

564
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 They start talking about everything that happened and the two friends are like, "Hey Terry, you know, we've been meaning to talk to you"

565
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 "We went for all the blood to get cleaned up and us to be helped from the hospital"

566
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 But what was up with you in the backseat?

567
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 And Terry's like, "What are you talking about?" And they're like, "Well, I was busy screaming because I was in so much pain"

568
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And this dude was outside walking around the car trying to figure out what to do

569
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 But you were just in the backseat just kind of mumbling to yourself

570
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 So what are you talking about? I was talking to that guy who came up to the car

571
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 And that's the two friends kind of licking each other and we're like, "Yeah, you keep saying that"

572
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And you said it then, "You keep saying thank you sir, thank you for staying with me"

573
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 There was no one there

574
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 There was no one there this whole time

575
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 We don't know what you were talking about

576
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And Terry starts to think, "Whoa, is that like a guardian angel or did I just suffer massive brain damage?"

577
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Like, what was that? He knew the guy was there, he knew for a fact this guy was there, but

578
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Fast forward 20 years

579
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Terry never forgot what this guy looked like

580
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 It was a pivotal moment in his life, it was a stranger who stayed with him until he was okay

581
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 In one of the scariest moments of his life, the stranger stayed with him

582
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 But one day Terry looked in the mirror and the man stared back at him

583
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 He realized this man who would come to the car, I should have described earlier, I shouldn't have described it, it looked like

584
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Here, pretend this happened, the man walked up to the car and he had a shaved head and a beard

585
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 So now I'm too lazy, clip that out and put that in the episode somewhere

586
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Terry's looking in the mirror, over the years he ended up shaving his head, he's like, "Ah, you know, I'm gonna go for this cool Jason Statham look"

587
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And over the years he said, "You know what, I wanna be like Kratos from God of War, I'm gonna grow a big old beard from the new versions, from the PS5 versions, I'm gonna grow a big beard"

588
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And so one day he looks in the mirror with this shaved head and his beard and he looks up and he goes, "It's you!"

589
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He realized that the person outside of the car was him from the future

590
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And he finishes off his post with this quote, "I know it seems strange that I didn't recognize myself, but I look so different now than I did back then"

591
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 "When I recognized the man in the mirror as the man at the scene of my wreck, I was genuinely overwhelmed with emotion"

592
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 "I'm certain it was me"

593
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 It's an interesting story and let's put on a conspiracy cap to wrap this up

594
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 What it basically does is it turns the idea of guardian angels on its head

595
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 It's a guardian angel story with a dash of time travel

596
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And it makes you ask the question, is it possible that guardian angels are us from the future?

597
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Now not everyone recognizes their guardian angel, but very famously there's that episode that I did and this was a viral video

598
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 There was a man standing there and someone walked by him and tapped him on the shoulder

599
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And when the guy turned to look, there's this massive gate swinging towards him and the dude jumps out of the way

600
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 And they never knew who the guy was who tapped him on the shoulder, it was really weird video

601
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And you have to think, if that guy had not tapped him on the shoulder, he would have been grievously injured by this swinging gate

602
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 I'll put all that in the show notes, but...

603
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Usually that's how guardian angels show up

604
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 So we have incidents like that where we can't prove it's them in the future, but when we look at the story and the guy's adamant

605
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 This guardian angel was myself from the future, what does that say about guardian angels?

606
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Are they us from the future? Are they... is it some sort of mental time travel or spiritual time travel?

607
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 No one else saw him there

608
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 No one else saw him there

609
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Is it possible that his own consciousness reached in to the past to have this conversation with him?

610
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Because the Terry in the future remembered how tragic the event was

611
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,760
 So when the event happened in the timeline the future Terry was remembering the event and manipulated the memory

612
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,620
 Fascinating fascinating story you can really play around with this when I say time traveler

613
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,060
 I'm not necessarily mean bleep-blop bloop. We're sitting in a machine and

614
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,900
 It takes them back to that event it could just be the consciousness the spirit

615
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,720
 Existing in two points in time at the same moment and what I find

616
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,260
 Intriguing about this conspiracy theory is when we talk about guardian angels

617
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,220
 The question I always have is how come everyone doesn't have one

618
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,560
 How come for every video I can see of a guy

619
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:23,980
 Dodging death because of a warning from a stranger. I watch another video of four people pushing this metal structure down the road and

620
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,500
 they hit the power lines and

621
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,140
 Like they were pushing the structure. This is real video

622
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:35,900
 Unfortunately, they were pushing this metal frame down the road and had these four long poles on it and the poles were tall enough

623
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:42,060
 To touch the power lines and I'm watching this video and it's for people being electrocuted to death

624
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,100
 Because they hadn't they had misjudged the height. They probably never even thought of that

625
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,380
 So where was their guardian angel?

626
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:55,460
 Like there's video after video after video and even not on video. There's scores of people who die in

627
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,500
 All sorts of ways either bizarre ways like the one I described are just fairly mundane ways

628
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,500
 Where's their guardian angel and it could be that guardian angels aren't this external force

629
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:11,540
 They're us there's something in us that's stretching across the timeline

630
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:19,500
 That would explain why not everyone has a guardian angel because if you look at the idea of angels themselves these messengers of God

631
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
 There's trillions of them

632
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,940
 Like numerically, I don't even think you can count them

633
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:31,820
 They I know what demons they say there's 10,000 demons her every finger on the hand of every human

634
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:38,100
 So that's a lot demons and demons are one-third of the amount of angels

635
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,700
 So I I that those are estimates that have been put out by theologians

636
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,340
 And there's definitely more than enough angels to for every human to have a guardian angel or hundreds of thousands each

637
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,300
 But they're not there a lot of people die in avoidable ways is the phenomenon of the guardian angel

638
00:33:53,860 --> 00:34:01,660
 Different than angels as we know them the guardian angel is actually yourself somehow you're able to

639
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:08,420
 Expand your consciousness so it defies time and space. Is it something you can train?

640
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:14,100
 Is it something you can prepare for is the story of Terry just a fluke?

641
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,820
 Is it a result of massive head trauma?

642
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,900
 But if that was the case, how would he know what he was gonna look like 20 years from now?

643
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:28,780
 It's a bizarre story and it may lead us down the path of finding out what the truth is behind the phenomenon

644
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,780
 No one has guardian angels

645
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,600
 Maybe when you are at your lowest point

646
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,440
 Maybe when your back is against the wall, maybe when your life depends on it

647
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,660
 The only person you can count on

648
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,860
 To come to your aid is yourself
