1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
 In Ohio, there's a young man who has a job at picking up roadkill.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:15,400
 But when he sees the same corpse over and over and over again, it leads him into a troubling

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,480
 mystery.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,680
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy that the modern world is not created by humans,

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,680
 created by the parasites that have attached themselves to our genitals, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:41,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,040

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,640

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
 starting April 5th.

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
 But let's go ahead and get this episode started, we got a lot of talk about, so let's go ahead

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
 and introduce one of our Thanksgiving livestream contributors walking into Dead Rabbit Command

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,040
 right now, give it up for Walking Stick.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,280
 Wooo, yeah, yeah, you're doing your name dude, you are doing your name, walking on in

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
 here.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,880
 Walking Stick, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode, if you guys can't

 Just help spread the word about the show, tell your friends, tell your families, tell everyone

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
 you know.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,160
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the place to go for the most obscure stories.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,120
 Walking, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're leaving behind

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,560
 Dead Rabbit Command, we're driving all the way out to Ohio.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,000
 Hey guys, full disclosure man, I just woke up from like a 3-4 hour nap, I've been super

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 tired, you guys have been sitting in the Jason Jalopy this whole time, you're like oh man

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,760
 this guy at least has to get some CD player or something in here, or he's not 45 years

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,040
 old and get an MP3 player in here.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,640
 Sorry guys, I've just been so tired but I'm really excited to share these stories with

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,480
 you, some really really cool stuff, let me put my glasses on and let's get started.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,800
 We're in the state of Ohio, now we don't have an actual city listed for this, what happened,

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,120
 I talked about this a couple episodes ago.

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,360
 The X board, I just love the X board right, those are my people, I'm there, I enjoy it,

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,920
 there's a lot of good people on there, there's some stupid stuff on there as well but overall

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,200
 I think it's a really good community.

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,480
 On the X board they had a Midwest threat a while back and they were talking about like

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:34,020
 spooky stories, urban legends, weird unsolved crimes in the entire Midwest area and we covered

36
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,680
 it recently, oh and we went to Aberdeen, South Dakota, that was a really cool one, that was

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,680
 the one with the house, Jason the Oldenball house, that is a narrative, I'll put it in

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,720
 the show notes, I don't want to give any of it away.

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,240
 But anyways now we're in Ohio which is also part of the Midwest and there's this dude,

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,280
 we're going to call him Tony, he didn't give out his real name so that's it, that's just

41
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,960
 a guess.

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,620
 Tony had a job in the county, in a county in Ohio, I'm sure it's so sparsely populated

43
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,600
 there's just one county.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,760
 In the state of Ohio there's a guy named Tony and he had a job disposing road kills, so

45
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,000
 he was driving his county truck down the road, he thought that was the engine, that was actually

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,360
 a Kid Rock song playing and he's driving this truck down the road and he sees like a dead

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,080
 possum and he's like oh ok, he jumps out of his truck and he gets his shovel, throws

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
 it in the back of the truck, I'm sure it was more sanitary than that, I don't think he

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,320
 was driving around a Ford, F-150 that was just covered in the grime and gore of a thousand

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,760
 dead road kill, maybe he put it in a bag, throws the possum in a bag, throws it in the back,

51
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:44,360
 the bag immediately rips, guts everywhere, drives down the road a little bit farther,

52
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,960
 he sees a deer and he's like oh this is what we call a two shovel job, so he gets two shovels

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,320
 and he lifts the deer, throws that one in the back cause there's no bag big enough, driving

54
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,880
 on the road, then he sees an opossum, I don't know what the difference is, I don't know

55
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,040
 what the difference is between the two animals, maybe it's the same thing, scoops the opossum

56
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,280
 into the truck and he did this job often enough that he began to see a pattern, not that animal

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:21,680
 life was very fragile and not faster than vehicles, every Wednesday he would come across

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,440
 a dead coyote, he goes, Jason you know it's wilderness, oh I was just one barren state,

59
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,360
 it's one county and it's all run by animal wildlife, of course he's gonna run into a

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,680
 coyote, maybe it's weird that it's every Wednesday he sees a coyote but is he seeing coyotes

61
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,120
 on different days as well, every Wednesday he would see a dead coyote, it was always

62
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:53,160
 a brand new coyote corpse and it was always in the same location, outside of this veterinarian

63
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:02,160
 office there would be a dead coyote, it's bloated corpse sitting there in the Ohio sunshine,

64
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,480
 and he said it was weird because I'd always seem to see it around the same time so it

65
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,720
 wasn't just like every Wednesday he would see this but every Wednesday around, let's

66
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,040
 say he didn't give the exact time but every Wednesday around 5pm when he was finishing

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,240
 off his rounds, he would come across the dead coyote sitting outside this veterinarian

68
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,000
 office and he'd get up and he'd scoop it up, throw it in the back of his truck and drive

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 off and it would probably take a couple Wednesdays before you even noticed that this was a pattern,

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,280
 but he starts noticing every Wednesday around the same time outside this veterinarian office

71
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:43,120
 there's a dead coyote and he's going here enough he starts to realize another pattern,

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,360
 at this veterinarian's office there's never any cars in the parking lot, if he'd pull

73
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,760
 up in his truck he'd see this freshly killed coyote corpse, this seemingly empty veterinarian

74
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,400
 office because not only is there no cars in the parking lot, he said I never saw anyone

75
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,080
 inside, I don't think people would want to show up to work if there's a dead coyote

76
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,520
 out there like I haven't cleaned it up and then we'll go in, but he goes to this veterinarian

77
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,600
 office that never had any cars in the parking lot, never had anyone inside, the only business

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:23,000
 they seemed to have was me picking up a coyote corpse every Wednesday, and one day a man

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,520
 after my own heart, paranoid freak, he goes it was Boss and he goes hey I'm really enjoying

80
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,880
 the animal-innered business, I'm hoping I can eventually work my way up the ladder,

81
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,760
 to chef, I'd love to start cooking these things and open my own restaurant, but right now

82
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,400
 I'm happy scooping up warm guts, but Boss this is really weird, every Wednesday around

83
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,440
 the same time there's a fresh coyote corpse outside of that veterinarian office and what's

84
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:03,440
 even weirder is no one's ever at the veterinarian office, and he said his Boss seriously, seriously

85
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,280
 advised him to stop talking about this, don't ask any more questions, just do what we pay

86
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,920
 you for, scooping up warm animal intestines, I don't want to hear anymore about this vet

87
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,840
 veterinarian office or this coyote or nothing and I would like to impress on you one more

88
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:31,360
 time, drop it, I know the coyote corpse that you're loading in the truck, this investigation

89
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:41,240
 or this line of questioning you have, it's done, Boss goes back to filling out some paperwork,

90
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:50,320
 Tony leaves the office, this statement by his Boss to just stop looking into this seriously

91
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,800
 do not ask any more questions about this, hit home, he actually said I never looked into

92
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,400
 it, I absolutely did drop it and we can only assume to this day this man is still picking

93
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,000
 up corpses, no, I think what the assumption we can take from the story is he did continue

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,640
 to still do the job and did continue to still pick up a coyote corpse every week from there,

95
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,760
 but he no longer verbally or no longer out loud spoke of this weird mystery that was

96
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:25,040
 going on in his town.

97
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:33,120
 Short story, that's all we have, I love local stories like this, absolutely love stuff like

98
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:41,440
 this, because it's so small, literally so small town in this story, has no giant implications,

99
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,200
 not geopolitical, it's not these huge machinations moving across the planet, it's a small town

100
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:53,320
 that has a mystery that someone probably did look into before, someone probably did ask

101
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,120
 too many questions and the Boss remembers what happened when someone continued their

102
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,240
 line of questioning on this matter, right?

103
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,440
 Boss said just drop it.

104
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,280
 As Tony leaves the Boss turns and he's eating coyote guts, he's like num num num num num

105
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,360
 and I'll throw the remains outside of the veterinarian office, it's a mystery, it's

106
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,920
 such a local mystery and it's one of the great things about the internet, I mean like global

107
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,480
 trade and all of this stuff, it's the fact that we can have these local mysteries spread,

108
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,440
 I mean this one's super obscure, the thread that it was on is already gone, I archived

109
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,920
 it, you can look through it and look at all the other cool things on there, but yeah I

110
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,280
 love this story and what would you do, right, if your Boss was like don't ask any more

111
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,240
 questions about this?

112
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,680
 Would you, I would be curious about it still, but if my, and it would depend on like my

113
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,800
 relationship with my Boss and how adamant he was, like if he's beating me up, he's

114
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,080
 beating me up, he's dressing me up as a coyote and he's like you're next, then I definitely

115
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,120
 would drop that line of questioning, but it's such a weird mystery, you'd still want to

116
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,320
 find out more, but if someone was like, "I just love it," right, it doesn't have any

117
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,280
 high stakes, there's another one I have like that, that I've never, I've always wanted

118
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,400
 to find a place to talk about it, so we'll talk about it now, someone posted a long time

119
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,760
 ago on Reddit, they said, "What are some Reddit questions or Reddit posts people have made?"

120
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,880
 and then they never posted again after that, like are there any sort of times that a Redditor

121
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,560
 brought up a mystery or said something was going on and then the account just disappeared.

122
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,640
 And one of, it's interesting because we covered someone like that before where they believed

123
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,240
 that aliens weren't going to invade last year, they made a prophecy like seven years ago

124
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,560
 and then as we were getting closer to the date, I'll put the edit episode, there's two episodes

125
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,680
 on it, in the show notes, that was the same time that the federal government said they

126
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,760
 were going to release their files on the UFOs, so it seemed to collide together, right?

127
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,520
 And that was great mystery, but then the Redditor showed back up, the Redditor showed back up

128
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,640
 and said that they were in love with some great alien and they just totally, they blew

129
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,800
 their own mythology, right?

130
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,880
 They should have never returned, they kind of blew that.

131
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:07,000
 But I did find this one, again, just such a weird mystery or mental illness, this one

132
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,040
 has a little less evidence than a Coyote corpse each week.

133
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,640
 The person asking, the person posting this thread on Reddit, they went by the name MBTA

134
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,680
 Cole, one of their examples, they go, this is what I'm kind of looking for, they go,

135
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,520
 there used to be this Redditor who went by the name Bang Song Lee.

136
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,360
 And Bang Song Lee posted this thing on Reddit and they were truly disturbed by this story,

137
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,920
 but eventually they stopped posting and they apparently deleted their account, there's

138
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,720
 no, I couldn't find this thread anywhere.

139
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,360
 But Bang Song Lee, we'll call him Lee for short, Lee was going to his local university

140
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,440
 and he was posting on Reddit because he believed that the school administration had placed

141
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,240
 some sort of tracking device on him.

142
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,440
 Classic paranoid delusion, right?

143
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,280
 He said the reason why he knew, for a fact, I guess this does have evidence, this is just

144
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,480
 much evidence as the rotting Coyote corpse, he goes, the reason why I knew they were tracking

145
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,760
 me was because I would often go to the student lounge on campus.

146
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,920
 You have your little food court and your little dining area and you can just sit there and

147
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,160
 people watch and eat your food and read the school newspaper and all that stuff.

148
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,960
 He said every time I'd go to the student lounge, I would order my favorite drink, an Arnold

149
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,680
 Palmer, what is that, like half lemonade, half iced tea, he'd go and he would order

150
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:34,960
 an Arnold Palmer and every single time he did this, he'd go, one Arnold Palmer please,

151
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,920
 the dean of the school would appear.

152
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,920
 It was like he's being summoned, like he's Betelgeuse or something.

153
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,560
 He would order an Arnold Palmer and apparently out of nowhere, he didn't mystically appear,

154
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,440
 but he'd walk from around the corner or he would be standing in line behind Lee or there's

155
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,320
 a strategically placed bush that the dean was hiding behind.

156
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,200
 Whenever Lee asked for an Arnold Palmer, the dean of the school would pop out of nowhere

157
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:07,600
 and say, what a twist and then walk away.

158
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,000
 And Lee said this happened every single time I asked for an Arnold Palmer.

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,840
 Sometimes I imagine like the bartender turns around to get it and when he turns back it's

160
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,280
 the dean and the bartender's closed, what a twist.

161
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,040
 Maybe sometimes Lee would try to throw him off and say, I'd like a Palmer Arnold please.

162
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,400
 The dean still appears, he's in the vent, the heating vent, what a twist.

163
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:34,440
 He said every single time he asked, every single time he ordered an Arnold Palmer from the

164
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,760
 student lounge, the dean would appear in some fashion and say, what a twist.

165
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,480
 And Lee posted this on Reddit and then never replied to any comments and then never posted

166
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
 again.

167
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,280
 And that username is no longer in the Reddit database.

168
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,880
 Just a weird local mystery.

169
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,360
 Again, this one he might have been mentally insane.

170
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,000
 I don't know if the dean was actually omnipotent and had the ability to appear out of nowhere

171
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,560
 when he asked for an Arnold Palmer, but one of those weird mysteries that you would never

172
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,760
 know of outside of someone posting it on the internet.

173
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,760
 People who knew Lee, he probably talked to them about it all the time, right?

174
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,360
 Cause he's trying to make sense of it.

175
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,760
 And maybe the story got weird enough that people in the college were kind of mentioning

176
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
 it.

177
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,040
 Oh, there's that guy who always says the dean follows him and the dean, the dean standing

178
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,840
 there and he's like, I know, where do you get that impression?

179
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,840
 This is eyes are shifting from side to side, trying to listen for what his order is.

180
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,640
 Just a weird mystery.

181
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,320
 It's a little less, a little less grim than the coyote one.

182
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,720
 Like the coyote one, I don't even, I think on the paranormal side, we think maybe there

183
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,320
 was some vampire cult there or they were doing some sort of sacrifice.

184
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
 Maybe.

185
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,360
 But it could have also been that the veterinarian office was like a mob front or a place they

186
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,240
 moved the money through.

187
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,800
 It could have been something a little more mundane than paranormal.

188
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,240
 This guy, he could have uncovered a college plot where the dean had a compulsion.

189
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,200
 It was the dean's mental illness that was causing this.

190
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,960
 Or it could have been Lee's mental illness and he was hallucinating the whole thing.

191
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,440
 But just these local mysteries.

192
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
 I love this type of stuff.

193
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,280
 It doesn't always have to be doom and gloom, world ending stuff.

194
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,800
 Sometimes these ones are the ones that stick with you.

195
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,160
 That Arnold Palmer, I've had that in my notes for months.

196
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,480
 I've been trying to get out of the way to talk about it and I'm actually glad it really

197
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
 coincided with this one.

198
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,000
 Just those weird local mysteries.

199
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I love them.

200
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Love them.

201
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,440
 Joaquin Stick, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

202
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,400
 We're leaving behind Ohio.

203
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,400
 We got a Arnold Palmer in each hand and a Coyote Jerky in our pockets.

204
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,080
 We're leaving behind Ohio.

205
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,000
 We're headed all the way out to big city USA.

206
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,760
 And Joaquin Stick, I want you to land on this skyscraper.

207
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,360
 Not one of the pointy ones because then the carboner copter will wobble off.

208
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,200
 One of the skyscrapers with the flat roofs.

209
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,280
 And so we're like, obviously Jason, we're not going to try to land on the entire state

210
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
 building.

211
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
 We're going to land on a building that has a flat roof.

212
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,200
 We're walking around, just making sure we're walking.

213
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,840
 We're walking around and I'm standing there on the edge of this building.

214
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,160
 And I go look down at humanity below us.

215
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
 See all those people down there?

216
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,520
 I hope we're so up.

217
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
 We can't see anyone.

218
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,840
 I was like, okay, let's take the elevator down a couple floors.

219
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,800
 Now we're about seven stories up and we go to a window and I'm like, look down at the

220
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:20,120
 people below us and you see humanity walking back and forth down the street, shopping, driving

221
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,640
 cars, riding bicycles, everything like that.

222
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,000
 And I go, this is the ultimate testament to mankind, the big city.

223
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,120
 The fact that we're able to reshape the planet Earth into this network of steel and concrete.

224
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,160
 This is the perfect representation of man's power over nature.

225
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,040
 We're in these buildings.

226
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,200
 We're looking down at the people.

227
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:48,920
 But we have to remember, even though we've advanced so far, by the way, we reshape things.

228
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,240
 We are still animals.

229
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,480
 We still have monkey bodies with reptile brains.

230
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:08,920
 We're still held to our base passions, like love and hate, envy and lust.

231
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:17,120
 Even though we're in this advanced modern age of humanity, we're still just beasts.

232
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,600
 And that begs the question as to who are we, right?

233
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
 Who are we?

234
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:30,360
 I did an episode recently when I was mentioning a lot of our desires, like our food desires,

235
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,080
 what we think makes us us, is from the gut, from the gut biome.

236
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,160
 Whether or not you're really into sugary snacks or you like more of a savory meat, that has

237
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,760
 a lot to do with your gut biome.

238
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,200
 I would say almost completely to do with your gut biome.

239
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:56,400
 That if you're somehow able to transfer your soul into someone else's body, you wouldn't

240
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
 like sweets anymore.

241
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,320
 You'd actually be working on a totally different stomach biome.

242
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,560
 If you lived for the taste of chocolate covering your tongue, but we put you in a body that

243
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,320
 had a completely different gut biome, you would be like, "I'm not a big sweets person."

244
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,560
 So that's not really part of our personality, and eating is a huge part of what we do and

245
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,080
 what we choose to eat.

246
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,640
 We may not even have that much control over what we choose to want to eat.

247
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,160
 I find it very interesting, humans are the only animal that will starve itself, rather

248
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,800
 than eat the same thing every single day.

249
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,440
 If you gave a man his favorite food, pot roast with a side of potatoes, and you gave it to

250
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,280
 him three times a day every single day within a month, he would be like, "I'm not eating

251
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
 it.

252
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,880
 I refuse to eat this stuff again."

253
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,640
 Every other animal, you can give a squirrel a nut every single day, or give them a mouse

254
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,520
 a cookie, and they will eat that same thing every single day.

255
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,440
 They'll never have a squirrel that's like, "Ah, you know, and acorns are all cool."

256
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,240
 But I've had my fill, I need something else.

257
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,960
 No, they'll eat acorns until they die from acorn poisoning.

258
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,480
 Humans are the only people who, for whatever reason, it's a super weird quirk of our biology.

259
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,840
 They will refuse to eat, they will say no.

260
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,400
 They need food variety.

261
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,520
 I found that out because I was writing a book about how to survive nuclear winter or something

262
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,320
 like that a long time ago.

263
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,200
 Y2K, I was writing a book about Y2K a long time ago.

264
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
 And that was one of the tips.

265
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,640
 When you're building your shelter, you have to have a diverse amount of food.

266
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,600
 Because if you just get pork and beans, you will starve to death.

267
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 Why?

268
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,080
 You know, who's making that decision?

269
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,960
 Obviously, you want to survive.

270
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,560
 You'll eat disgusting things all the time to survive.

271
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,640
 But you won't eat horse testicles every single day for the rest of your life.

272
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,320
 You may eat them if you get trapped out on a horse farm for three weeks.

273
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 So who are we?

274
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,840
 Who actually makes the determination of who we are?

275
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,040
 I think a big part of it is biology.

276
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,160
 The way the electrons travel across your brain, your physical brain, the way your gut biome

277
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,760
 interacts with your brain.

278
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,760
 So that's, some people have addictive personalities and some people don't.

279
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,840
 Some people can do heroin and be like, "Yeah, they ain't for me."

280
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,000
 Other people can do heroin and it's for them and it completely ruins their life.

281
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Weird.

282
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,280
 It's weird quirk because we know that heroin is addictive and some people don't get addicted

283
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
 to it.

284
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,440
 Why?

285
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,200
 And I think we always default back to the soul, right?

286
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,240
 Or the personality of the person.

287
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,480
 He just doesn't have an addictive personality.

288
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,800
 But is there something biological going on there?

289
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:42,520
 What I'm headed towards is that I recently found out about a thing called parasitic castration.

290
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,440
 Parasitic castration is exactly what it sounds like.

291
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,560
 It's a parasite that castrates its host.

292
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,560
 And what's weird is there's not a lot of normie street level information on parasitic castration.

293
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,480
 Probably because a lot of people don't read about this for fun.

294
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,600
 When I looked into this, I was reading the Wikipedia page and I went to go do additional

295
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 research.

296
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,480
 There's all scientific journal stuff, the stuff that you have to pay for.

297
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,800
 And even if it was free, I wouldn't understand it.

298
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,000
 But parasitic castration is one of the six major forms of parasites.

299
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 It's one of the biggies.

300
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,200
 But it's not something a lot of people know about.

301
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,280
 Generally, parasitic castration we see on smaller creatures.

302
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,040
 Like snails.

303
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
 Like crustaceans.

304
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
 Just little things.

305
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,440
 Tiny little things.

306
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,040
 And what they do is they latch on to the sexual organs of the creature.

307
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:48,840
 They will get right up in there and they will feed off of the ovaries or the gonads of their

308
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,320
 host.

309
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,680
 It's like a slurpee in there.

310
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,320
 It's like a constant slurpee machine going on.

311
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,240
 And these creatures are just getting raw resources.

312
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
 Right from the source.

313
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,640
 Right from the balls, right?

314
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,880
 And your sex organs are constantly producing more juice.

315
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,720
 More energy.

316
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,200
 And your sex organs are constantly functioning.

317
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,880
 They're constantly producing more yummy yummy goodness.

318
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,000
 So a parasite that does this has a huge amount of resources to eat.

319
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,960
 Seemingly unlimited.

320
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
 Right?

321
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,640
 And what's interesting is not only does this parasite attach onto the sexual organs.

322
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,360
 Like radically changes the organism's behaviors.

323
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,200
 Because if this, let's take a frog for example.

324
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,720
 This frog had working sex organs.

325
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,720
 It is going to do all the things that someone with working sex organs does.

326
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,280
 It's going to mate.

327
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,400
 It's going to try to have children.

328
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,360
 It's going to try to fight other members of its species to impress the lovely little

329
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,240
 lady frog on the lily pad.

330
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,040
 Competition, care for offspring, mate seeking behavior is all shut down when these parasites

331
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
 are on board.

332
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,280
 I mean it is kind of hard to go to the prom when you have a giant monster attached to

333
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
 your nuts.

334
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,320
 But you don't even want to go to the prom, right?

335
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,840
 You're just fine staying at home.

336
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,480
 You're just fine staying at home with your pants off as this thing with these huge needles

337
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,600
 stuck in there.

338
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,360
 And all of this behavior is gone, right?

339
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,680
 So a lot of the energy that's put into looking more beautiful to attract mates are getting

340
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,720
 stronger to fight off potential rivals.

341
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,640
 All of that biological energy is now being, all of that biological energy is being suppressed.

342
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,360
 It's actually giving the parasite more nutrients to feed off of.

343
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,480
 Because your body's saying, well if I'm not going to try to grow a bigger shell and bigger

344
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,760
 snappers to fight these other crabs.

345
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,840
 I guess I'm just going to sit here and all the food that I eat is going to go towards

346
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,280
 the thing that my body's definitely needing, more sexual resources because it's constantly

347
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,120
 getting drained.

348
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,320
 One of the things is because it's still taking in its daily calorie count, this little crab

349
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,960
 is still eating the same amount of food it normally would if it did have working sexual

350
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,520
 organs.

351
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,240
 Since it's not using it to become a better mate, a lot of these creatures will have

352
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,080
 gigantism because the body doesn't know what to do with all of these extra nutrients so

353
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,600
 they just start to get really big.

354
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,720
 They also live longer because they're not fighting in the wild.

355
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,640
 They're not going out there.

356
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,600
 They're not putting themselves out there for either predators or for rivals.

357
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:45,000
 They sit there and they just consume and grow big and sit there.

358
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,120
 And consume and grow big and sit there.

359
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:55,680
 And the whole time this parasite is attached to the sexual organs, feeding constantly.

360
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,040
 There's another benefit to having these things.

361
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,040
 They actually protect you from getting other parasites.

362
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,240
 So you can see there's a benefit in a way.

363
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,360
 Definitely the negative is having this monster attached to your body, especially in that

364
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
 region.

365
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,760
 But you live longer, you're not going to get other parasites.

366
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,440
 It protects you from that.

367
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,240
 And you just kind of chill.

368
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,960
 You just sit there and enjoy life.

369
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,520
 As much life as a crab can enjoy, as much life as a crab can enjoy while this giant

370
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,320
 thing is attached to its body.

371
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,440
 I read that and I go, "This is really interesting."

372
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,360
 And of course, because I'm a conspiracy theorist, I started thinking of it like this.

373
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,520
 Is there something like this in the human body?

374
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,560
 Now you can say Jason, obviously not.

375
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,560
 You can look down and there's nothing attached to your sexual organs.

376
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,920
 But sometimes it's on the inside.

377
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,400
 I probably should have said that earlier.

378
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,160
 It's not always this thing locked on down there.

379
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:53,960
 Sometimes it's inside eating the eggs or eating the sperm, eating the stuff right out of the

380
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
 gonads.

381
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:02,800
 I started thinking, is there a human comparison to this?

382
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,320
 Because we think, here's the thing.

383
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,640
 I've made the decision not to have kids, not out of any sort of ecological thing or social

384
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
 thing.

385
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,000
 Kid, the idea of having a child absolutely terrifies me.

386
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,960
 I can take care of myself just fine, but the idea of having to worry about having this

387
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,880
 little three-month-old that it could choke at any time and then the kids three and they

388
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,280
 can still choke at any time.

389
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,920
 And now they're 33 and I'm like, "Oh, I hope he's chewing his food okay."

390
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,600
 I would be paranoid all the time and I hear they're from parents.

391
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
 They go, "Yeah, yeah, it is pretty scary."

392
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
 Like there's a lot of good stuff.

393
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,160
 I always tune out once they agree with me that it's scary.

394
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,960
 But I go, "I don't want to have kids."

395
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,840
 What if that's not my choice?

396
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,480
 What if there's millions of people across the planet who are choosing not to have children

397
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:56,160
 and we think it's our choice and it's not a parasite attached itself to us at some point

398
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,760
 and it's spreading?

399
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,000
 Now I don't have a kid, so that means the other night I was able to go see the Batman.

400
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,080
 I didn't have to make plans with nothing, right?

401
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,720
 I didn't have to get a babysitter.

402
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,120
 I do what I want.

403
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,480
 And then yesterday I went to Walmart, bought myself a Batman Hot Wheel.

404
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,200
 Just in the middle of the day.

405
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,760
 About that and a six pack of Dipepsy.

406
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
 Middle of the day.

407
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
 I do what I want.

408
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
 I do what I want.

409
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
 I don't have kids.

410
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,240
 If I had kids, I wouldn't be able to engage in all of the stuff that I want to do at the

411
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,760
 drop of, I definitely wouldn't be able to do a podcast every day, right?

412
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,720
 And I see all these things as plus, I see all these things as positives.

413
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,600
 But what if I never had an option?

414
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,160
 What if all these people who tell you, you know, I'm not into having kids?

415
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,240
 That's not their decision.

416
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,040
 There are chemicals being released into their bloodstream that's traveling to their brains.

417
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,240
 Telling them, you don't want kids.

418
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
 You don't want kids.

419
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
 You don't want offspring.

420
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,960
 Because it's going to take resources from your body that you're now going to have to

421
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,440
 use to raise your child.

422
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,640
 You're not going to be able to eat as much.

423
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,720
 You're not going to be able to have the diet you want.

424
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,280
 So don't have kids.

425
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,360
 Do this is really, really interesting.

426
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:20,560
 This might sound ridiculous, but it's definitely within the realm of possibility that a key

427
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:31,800
 decision, choosing not to have offspring is biologically odd.

428
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,440
 It's something that humans do.

429
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,480
 And I don't think any other species go.

430
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,760
 I don't think there's ever a cat being like, you know what, there's enough kittens in

431
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
 the world.

432
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
 I'm good.

433
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,080
 We have to neuter them or spay them.

434
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,480
 We have to physically remove that as an option.

435
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,680
 And changes their personality, doesn't it?

436
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,440
 Changes the way they eat, changes the way they function.

437
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,520
 And then we go, but I'm making my own decisions.

438
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,760
 No one spayed me.

439
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:10,440
 I'm choosing to break an evolutionary cycle that has existed since the beginning of life.

440
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,120
 And I'm not talking about people who want kids and can't have them for a biological reason

441
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,000
 or they want kids, but they're afraid a genetic disease may follow them.

442
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,520
 I don't want kids.

443
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
 Kids are totally fine.

444
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
 I don't have a problem with kids.

445
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,480
 I don't have a problem with kids at all, but I don't want them.

446
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,000
 I don't see them as...

447
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,960
 I think it's too risky.

448
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,160
 My kids might be total dorks, right?

449
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
 That would be upsetting as well.

450
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
 I just, I don't...

451
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,520
 And I've never been like that.

452
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,640
 I've never been thinking that.

453
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,520
 And at no point in my life did I stop wanting kids.

454
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,720
 I just was like, "Yeah, I'm good.

455
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
 I don't need that."

456
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
 What if that's not my decision?

457
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,800
 And I know a lot of people are saying that.

458
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
 They don't want kids.

459
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,760
 Again, some people, I know people are like, "I have horrible genetic disease right in my

460
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
 family line.

461
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,120
 I don't want to take the risk."

462
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,480
 But they would want to have kids.

463
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
 That's different.

464
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
 And it's tragic, and that's different.

465
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,960
 A lot of times they adopt, and that's awesome.

466
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:14,160
 But I'm wondering if there is a parasite in humans that is making us not want kids and

467
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,000
 indulge in our own desires.

468
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,680
 I'm wondering if that's out there.

469
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,080
 And it would be something that if you said it, people would think you were a fool.

470
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,040
 And if you said it to a scientist, they'd probably go, "Yeah, that's not here.

471
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,720
 And the reason why we know this, because we can test for all this stuff.

472
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,120
 We can test for parasites."

473
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,080
 But if the parasite is just part of human life at this point, and it does basically take

474
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,040
 20% of society and say, "You don't want kids."

475
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,240
 We're infected with this parasite and it makes us not want children.

476
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,560
 Not want to have children.

477
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,600
 Which is biologically super weird.

478
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,240
 Because that is one of the main drives.

479
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,480
 Now what's interesting is I still engage in mate attracting behavior, right?

480
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
 I'm still dating.

481
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,920
 I'm still sleeping with women.

482
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,600
 So it hasn't completely shut off that part of it, fighting rivals and things like that.

483
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,460
 But the idea, once you have offspring, your resources has diminished that you can spend

484
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,460
 on yourself.

485
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,440
 Now you have to do that.

486
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,760
 I wonder if that's out there.

487
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,280
 This is kind of an open-ended question.

488
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,360
 I know it's kind of a weird way to end an episode, but I wonder if this is out there.

489
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,760
 I wonder if there is a parasite infecting the human body.

490
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,000
 Not all of them, right?

491
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,640
 Some bodies fight it off, right?

492
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,440
 Some bodies are less susceptible.

493
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,800
 Could have a whole host of factors of why one person carries this parasite and one person

494
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,760
 doesn't.

495
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,920
 But is there something out there that is making humans not want children?

496
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:55,940
 I always figured it was my decision, but how many of the decisions I make daily are my

497
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
 decisions?

498
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,060
 I'm sure a lot of them are.

499
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,100
 But when I'm walking down the road and I really want that Wachama Colet Bar, I haven't had

500
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,420
 a Wachama Colet Bar in a long time.

501
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,420
 I really, really want a Wachama Colet Bar.

502
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,100
 Those cravings will pop up after I've eaten bread like a day or two before.

503
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,740
 Those are, I don't want a Wachama Colet Bar.

504
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,740
 I love Wachama Colet Bars.

505
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
 Don't get me wrong.

506
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,560
 I'm not going to sponsor this episode, I'm down.

507
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,120
 The cravings come.

508
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,000
 The cravings when I'm walking down the street and I'm going to decide which route to take

509
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 home.

510
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,720
 Which one will take me close to Sturga Station so I can buy a Wachama Colet Bar.

511
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
 That's not Jason.

512
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,040
 That's my gut biome dying off because I gave it bread a while back.

513
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,120
 I was eating all those carbs and now it wants more.

514
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,600
 It knows how much that I love Wachama Colet Bars.

515
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,360
 Do I?

516
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
 So weird.

517
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:53,300
 I find the idea that we are half, we talked about this on yesterday's episode, that we

518
00:32:53,300 --> 00:33:01,980
 are half eternal soul and half biological waste factory meat shield that carries us

519
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,900
 from one location to another engaging in our most base desires daily.

520
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,780
 Eating food that's not nutritious but just tastes good.

521
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:19,480
 You know what stupid sitcoms just for background noise as our eyes glaze over or just refreshing

522
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,400
 the same internet page over and over again like a rat pressing a button getting a hit

523
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,520
 of cocaine.

524
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:34,760
 All this stuff, all this stuff that you can actually, we think that we are this all, no

525
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,040
 we are at least all learning.

526
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,080
 We may not know everything but we're constantly learning this divine spark inside of us but

527
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,420
 somebody can sit down and they can invent an app that 2 out of 10 people who play it

528
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,420
 won't put it down for a month.

529
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,900
 If we were simply the divine spark inside a walking skeleton surrounded by wet, bloody

530
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:04,660
 muscle you would never be able to do that because the divine sparks are limitless and

531
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,140
 they're from the everlasting.

532
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,940
 They existed before stars exploded, right?

533
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,200
 The reason why they're able to create things that are addictive because they're appealing

534
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,480
 to the biological.

535
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,080
 How brains work, how eyes work, how dopamine works.

536
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,360
 How much of us is the meat and how much of us is the soul?

537
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,420
 And then what about all the other life forms on this planet?

538
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:38,000
 Not talking squirrels or coyotes, the parasites, the microbes in our guts, they also have this

539
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,680
 huge pull on us.

540
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:45,700
 This is something that I've been recently thinking about a lot after I've found this

541
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:53,540
 article and I'm not willing to say that it's 100% true but I'm wondering if there is something

542
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:59,340
 that people are carrying that is making them not want to reproduce.

543
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,420
 They just have shut down that part of their body.

544
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,660
 People always go "I'm sure you'll want kids one day."

545
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
 No.

546
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,660
 And is that my decision?

547
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,760
 Is that decision Jason's making because I like the life I live?

548
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:20,340
 Or is there something in my body making me think I'm making that decision?

549
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,120
 Making me think I have enough agency that I can choose to override billions of years

550
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,400
 of evolution by sitting here and going "I don't want kids."

551
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,520
 Even though every life form on the planet, that's what they're designed for.

552
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:42,380
 To be born, to eat, to procreate, and die.

553
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:48,340
 And there's two types of life forms that do not follow that pattern.

554
00:35:48,340 --> 00:36:02,140
 Humans and creatures who have parasitic castrators attached to their body.
