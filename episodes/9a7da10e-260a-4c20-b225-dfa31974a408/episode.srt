1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,360
 They make me happy and they make me feel better.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,560
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,720
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,720
 Who would win in a fight?

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,720
 A dog or an alien?

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,720
 We'll be finding out the answer to that.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,720
 It's kind of a rhetorical question if you think about it.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:48,720
 And then we meet two young girls who have an obsession with a popular artist.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,720
 Using a black magic spell they found on the internet,

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,720
 is it possible that they brought Andy Warhol back to life?

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,720
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,720
 [Music]

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
 I'm having a great day.

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
 I hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,720
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so let's go ahead and get started

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,720
 right now walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
 It's one of our Christmas livestream contributors.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
 Everyone give it up for Thought Not.

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,720
 Woohoo, yeah! Come on in Thought Not.

32
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,720
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,720
 Thought Not, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,720
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally get it.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
 Trust me, I do.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,720
 Just help spread the word about the show.

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,720
 That helps out so much.

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
 Get the word out.

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,720
 Let people know that your favorite podcast is Dead Rabbit Radio.

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,720
 Even if it's not, even if you like through your four podcasts more,

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 just tell them I'm your favorite.

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,720
 Thought Not, let's go ahead and toss you the bunny bicycle.

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,720
 We're going to pedal on out of Dead Rabbit Command.

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
 Don't pop in wheelies.

45
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
 Take us all the way out too.

46
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
 North Carolina.

47
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,720
 Squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk.

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,720
 I'm still trying to find a good sound effect for the bicycle.

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,720
 We might have to get rid of the bunny bike until I can come up.

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
 At least that one does the little gear squeaking.

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,720
 Maybe I should just do the sound of a car going...

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
 You know, through the spokes or something like that.

53
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
 We'll figure it out.

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
 Or we'll get rid of it.

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,720
 We're headed out to Mount Airy in North Carolina.

56
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,720
 It's February 1981 and it's kind of late at night.

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,720
 And there's a farm out near Mount Airy.

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
 And this farm is a farmer.

59
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
 And he is doing his duty.

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,720
 What he's doing right now is he's actually milking his cows.

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
 Which seems weird.

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
 I don't know anything about farm life, right?

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 I watched a couple documentaries.

64
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
 Babe, Charlotte's Web.

65
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,720
 But other than that, like I don't know, like do people...

66
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,720
 I thought people woke up like super early, the butt crack of dawn,

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,720
 and went out and was milking cows then.

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,720
 But apparently, I didn't know that apparently he can do it anytime during the day.

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
 Maybe he slept in.

70
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,720
 And then he decided, oh wait, does milk go bad and a cow is udder?

71
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,720
 Like what if you wait too long to milk it?

72
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,720
 Anyways, all this stuff is easily researchable.

73
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
 But I'm too busy looking up UFO stories.

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
 This farmer, we're going to call him Billy.

75
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
 This farmer is out there late at night.

76
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
 He's milking his cow.

77
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
 It doesn't say like two in the morning or something like that.

78
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
 I'm assuming it's like eight.

79
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
 That still seems really...

80
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
 still seems really like to be walking around the farm.

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,720
 But again, I don't know anything about farms.

82
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,720
 He's milking his cow and he has this good old hunting dog by his side.

83
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,720
 And we're going to call his hunting dog a Jasper.

84
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,720
 So Billy's sitting there getting some milk in a tin pail.

85
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,720
 All of a sudden Jasper starts to bark really loudly.

86
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,720
 [barking]

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
 And starts to run around all over him.

88
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 He's like knocking over the milk.

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
 He's like, oh no, my milk.

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
 I need to do those nutrients.

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,720
 And Billy's dog's running around and Billy realizes something's wrong.

92
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
 Jasper doesn't normally act like this.

93
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,720
 And Jasper's like sniffing the ground and then takes off.

94
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,720
 Just runs out in the darkness and Billy's like, Jasper, no.

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 So Billy goes out after his dog and he sees a little puppy running up to the top of a hill.

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
 Oh, dang that dog.

97
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,720
 Better drink some milk for energy to climb that hill.

98
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
 Glug glug glug glug glug glug.

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
 He's like, bye bye.

100
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,720
 He runs up the hill and he sees his dog.

101
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,720
 Standing over a fallen figure.

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
 He's like, oh, what in the world is that?

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
 Jasper, get away from that thing.

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,720
 And what it is, it's a little humanoid.

105
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,720
 It's this little pink-skinned creature with a big head.

106
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,720
 Large round eyes.

107
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,720
 Imagine one of those precious moment figurines.

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
 Terribly mauled.

109
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,720
 Imagine one of those little kids but all ripped up.

110
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
 It's a pink-skinned large head.

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
 No nose or mouth.

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,720
 And it's wearing a light-colored robe.

113
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
 It's just laying there.

114
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,720
 Because Jasper got into this dude.

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
 Jasper smelled this guy from quite a ways away.

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,720
 He ran up this hill and is greeting our extraterrestrial visitors with a good old bite of its jaws.

117
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
 Arrrrr.

118
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
 This little dude's laying there.

119
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
 Billy's looking at this.

120
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
 He has no idea what it is.

121
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,720
 He figures it's, you know, not human.

122
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
 And its arms and legs are all chewed up.

123
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,720
 It's just laying there going, "Uhhh."

124
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,720
 And what if there's a thing like if you came across an alien like that in that condition.

125
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
 What are you going to do?

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 Like if it was a human, you could call 911, right?

127
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
 What are you going to do for a little alien, bro?

128
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
 Right? They got all chewed up.

129
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
 So he left.

130
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
 He just caught his dog.

131
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
 Went away.

132
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
 He actually kind of scared him.

133
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
 He grabbed his dog.

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
 He drove into town.

135
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,720
 Here's one of those odd details that makes me think the story is true.

136
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
 Because generally fake stories are very clean.

137
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
 You have a through line to them.

138
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
 This is how this story goes.

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 He gets his dog, drags him to the truck, drives into town, drives back to the farm, drops his dog off.

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
 Jasper gets dropped off in the farm.

141
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,720
 And then Billy drives himself to spend the night in a motel.

142
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,720
 Now if it was fictional, it would just be like, "Oh, he went back and he went to sleep."

143
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
 Or, "He took his dog to town, but his dog got loose."

144
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
 Because the dog is going to play an important part on this next thing.

145
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 In a real story, this would make sense.

146
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
 He gets his dog, he goes into town, he goes to the motel.

147
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
 He says, "You can't bring your dog with you.

148
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
 Dude, you can't have a dog in a motel."

149
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 And I'm fine.

150
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
 Because he doesn't want to stay the night at his house.

151
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
 It's spooky, right?

152
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
 Something's up there.

153
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
 So then he has to drive back and drop his dog off.

154
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,720
 It's little details like that that make stories make them more believable.

155
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
 I read a ton of stuff all the time and I'm like, "It's fake."

156
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,720
 Like even the skeptical side of me, I do have a skeptical side when I read a bunch of this stuff.

157
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,720
 But you just start to develop a pretty good BS meter.

158
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
 Now it's not foolproof.

159
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
 It's not foolproof, right?

160
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 Lone Pine Devils, I was wrong.

161
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
 The high school episode I did recently, I was misled.

162
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
 So it's not foolproof, but for the most part, like it's little details like that that make you,

163
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
 there might actually be some truth to that because it's a messy part of the story.

164
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
 Anyways, so no dogs allowed at the hotel.

165
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,720
 He then drops his dog off at the farm.

166
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,720
 This alien creature just got mauled and Billy's too scared to stay there.

167
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,720
 So he goes to the motel, holiday inn, to spin the night.

168
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,720
 And then the next morning he comes back and he walks up to the hill.

169
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 The first thing he does is he goes to the hill and the creature is gone.

170
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,720
 Billy's like, "Well, okay, I don't know if he moved on his own."

171
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,720
 Probably not. His legs are pretty damaged.

172
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,720
 Maybe someone got him. I don't know. It's spooky, but...

173
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,720
 And then he goes to his farm and there he finds Jasper, dead.

174
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,720
 And a couple of Billy's cows had gone missing.

175
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,720
 I found that story on ThinkAboutAdox.com, one of my favorite resources for this podcast.

176
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,720
 They got it from an article written by Gray Barker.

177
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,720
 The dog himself wrote it like every time he died.

178
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,720
 He's like typing out his memoirs. He's like, "This is what's happening. Please don't."

179
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 Gray Barker, he wrote this article in UFO Annual 1981, a UFO journal back in the time.

180
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,720
 It's interesting because ThinkAboutAdox.com added a little addition to this

181
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,720
 in parentheses, they go, "Was there any autopsy on the animal?"

182
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,720
 Which is an interesting quote. I didn't think about that until I finished reading it and saw that sentence.

183
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 I go, "Yeah." That would make sense. They don't know how the dog died. The dog was just dead.

184
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 Yeah. Did you take it to the vet and say, "Hey, can you find out what happened to my dog?"

185
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,720
 And the vet's looking. He's like, "It looks like he ate a couple of arms and legs last night."

186
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,720
 "Is that pink flesh?" "Yeah, forget the flesh. Let's pretend that he didn't maul someone or something last night."

187
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,720
 "Can you tell me how my dog died?" The doctor could cut it open and be like,

188
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,720
 "Well, all the organs are in the right place."

189
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 "Really bad doctor. That's the only thing you notice how to check is where the organs are."

190
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 But yeah, so how did the dog die? Obviously the implication is that the alien bros came back.

191
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,720
 They showed up and they found their little dude laying there with his little cloak on

192
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,720
 and they're like, "Syrus, Cyrus, are you okay?" And he's like, "Felice, can you back to the mothership?"

193
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,720
 "Please put me in the Regenotron." And they take him in and then as he's like floating in some see-through tube

194
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,720
 and his limbs are getting strong again, he's like, "The first thing he does with his new arms is he's like punching his hand."

195
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,720
 He goes, "Guys, we need to even the score." That dog down there, "Tune me up, man."

196
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,720
 And when in the water town they're killing this dog, they just take a couple of cows.

197
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,720
 That's basically the payment. You made us use the Regenotron, you know how much energy that thing uses

198
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,720
 when you're going to steal a couple of your cows. And don't come looking for us.

199
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,720
 On the other side of the Alpha Centauri nebula, it's not like Billy had access to intergalactic warp drive.

200
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,720
 But an interesting story nonetheless, real-world consequences of encountering alien life.

201
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,720
 So many times people are abducted and they don't remember it or they're abducted and they remember it

202
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
 and they have horrifying nightmares. I mean, that's pretty bad if they have implants and stuff like that.

203
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,720
 But stories where people die, animals die encountering aliens.

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,720
 I don't think we hear a lot of them because I don't think people survive them.

205
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,720
 I think these one-off encounters with aliens, like if the farmer just died of a heart attack that night, right?

206
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
 They would have been like, "Oh, no Billy, now where are we going to get our milk for the town?"

207
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
 And they just go to the store, they go to the store, they're like, "Whoa, grocery store's selling milk?"

208
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,720
 It would have been chalked up to a horrible accident, right? And there wouldn't have been no witness to finding the little guy up on the...

209
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,720
 Because they were coming gun form, right? The implication is they came back to the farm later and killed the dog

210
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 and took some cows and if Billy had been there, he would have been dead too.

211
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,720
 I think there probably are more stories of people dying at the hands of alien invaders.

212
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
 But we don't hear about it because there's no one to tell that story.

213
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,720
 But in this case, there was a survivor, luckily for us.

214
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:04,720
 But Jasper, we will always honor you for being the first dog that we know of to mutilate an alien.

215
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
 This week has been really heavy on dog stories. I hope that's not for telling something.

216
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
 I hope I'm not going to have a close encounter with it.

217
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
 Dogs, Jaws.

218
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
 Thought not, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carbentercopter.

219
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,720
 We are leaving behind North Carolina. We're headed out to a high school.

220
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,720
 [imitates carpenters]

221
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,720
 Speaking of high schools, I'm going to do a very quick, dead rabbit recommends.

222
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,720
 I have to keep it quick. I could honestly talk about this movie for the next 30 minutes, but I won't.

223
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,720
 I'll punish the people on the Discord with that, defeat you on Discord.

224
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
 I've already started posting stuff.

225
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,720
 Long time ago, I did a dead rabbit recommends on the Disney movie Zombies.

226
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:55,720
 It was a musical about brain-eating zombies who had to wear control collars to keep them from eating people's brains.

227
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:04,720
 They were right next door to this gated community. It really was a story about race relations in America.

228
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,720
 Humanity had become post-racial. That wasn't an issue anymore because everyone hated the zombies.

229
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 They had found a common enemy. The zombies were like, "Hey, we can't help it. We can't help it.

230
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,720
 We got this nuclear radiation on us and now all of our kids are zombies too.

231
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,720
 We just want to be just like you." It's this bizarre musical that's the central theme.

232
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,720
 But there's all of these weird underlying things like Zed, who's the lead zombie, this dance and groove-in zombie,

233
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,720
 constantly on the verge of eating people's brains. He realizes that he can adjust his control collar.

234
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 It's actually like a watch. It gives him superhuman strength and he tries out for the football team.

235
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,720
 He's throwing people like 30, 40 yards. Then it becomes an allegory on performance enhancing drugs.

236
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,720
 Would it be fair? He wanted to be the first zombie to ever play high school football.

237
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,720
 The reason why you can't do it is because it's not fair. You're extremely powerful.

238
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,720
 Then he starts losing control. They have these bizarre musical sequences.

239
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,720
 I remember when I watched it, I thought, "This movie cannot get any weirder and then the next scene would start."

240
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 You're like, "What is going on?" And I absolutely loved it. It was so weird.

241
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,720
 Then they came out with Zombies 2, which I did not do a Dead Rabbit Recommends on.

242
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,720
 I watched that. I bought it the day it came out.

243
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,720
 So the first one was pretty much the other, right? It was Humans vs. the other.

244
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,720
 In the second movie, they clarified that the zombies are supposed to represent black culture in America.

245
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 The second one, they bring in indigenous culture.

246
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,720
 Werewolves. We were here before the humans got here. We were living in caves the whole time.

247
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,720
 We didn't even know we were here. These werewolves jump out and they're dancing around.

248
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,720
 Again, it has this really bizarre commentary.

249
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,720
 Werewolves just go, "Hey, can we start going to school here?"

250
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,720
 And the administrator is like, "Yeah, sure. You can come here."

251
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,720
 The zombies are like, "It took us 15 years to even be able to set foot in this school."

252
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
 That was a part of the first movie. It was the very first year zombies could go to high school.

253
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,720
 They just get to come in and the administrator is like, "Yeah, sure, whatever."

254
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,720
 You had this antagonism between these two different minority groups.

255
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,720
 Addison, who is the lead love interest, he's in love with the zombie,

256
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,720
 she all of a sudden becomes super obsessed with the werewolves and their culture

257
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,720
 and starts dressing like them and believing she is the savior of their people.

258
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,720
 And I'm like, "Dude, this is a Disney Channel movie. What is going on?"

259
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,720
 And she's saying, "I'm prophesied to help the werewolves. I was a werewolf all along."

260
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
 There is a prophecy about this woman who's supposed to save the werewolves.

261
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,720
 I'm talking about this way longer than I wanted to, but there's a prophecy about this person who's going to save the werewolves.

262
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
 And Addison goes, "That's me." And everyone's like, "That's not you."

263
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,720
 And she's like, "No, no, that's me. I'm going to save the indigenous people."

264
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
 And it really plays on like the white savior trope.

265
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,720
 And at the ending, she goes to use this magical power to save the indigenous people's moonstone.

266
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,720
 And it doesn't work. She wasn't the prophesied one and everything blows up.

267
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
 At the end of that movie, everyone is worse off than they were at the beginning.

268
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
 But they're still singing and dancing. It's super bizarre, but I didn't like it as much.

269
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
 The music wasn't that good.

270
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
 So at the end of that one, it turns out that Addison wasn't a werewolf.

271
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,720
 Like, Jason, I really don't care. Get to the Andy Warhol story.

272
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 Quit holding me hostage. Addison was not a werewolf, but at the end, she goes,

273
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,720
 "Well, if I'm not a werewolf and I don't fit in with the humans because she has white hair,

274
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,720
 she never feels like she fit in. Who do I, what group do I belong to?"

275
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,720
 And as she's going to bed, a UFO shows up.

276
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,720
 And I'm like, "Oh my God, are you going to talk about illegal immigrants in the next one?"

277
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
 We've already talked about indigenous culture being wiped out.

278
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 We've talked about an oppressed group of people living right next door and having curfew and dress codes.

279
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
 And it's like this prison camp that they live in.

280
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,720
 So I was like, are they actually going to do a story about illegal immigrants in Zombies 3?

281
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
 But I was like, they're not going to make a Zombies 3, right?

282
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,720
 I was lucky enough to get Zombies 2.

283
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,720
 Well, on July 15th, Zombies 3 dropped.

284
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,720
 And it is fantastic. Dead Rabbit recommends Zombies 3.

285
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,720
 And I remember going, "Oh my God, I just found out they're going to make this movie."

286
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,720
 And is it going to be about illegal immigrants coming and then the indigenous people and the minority, like the oppressed group,

287
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:37,720
 and then the humans, are they all going to hate the illegal immigrants for like taking their jobs and things like that?

288
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,720
 Taking their places in college?

289
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,720
 The movie's about whether or not Bonzo can get a driver's license.

290
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,720
 Or whether or not Zed can impress a counselor to be the first monster to go to college.

291
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,720
 It starts off with him saying, "If I win the football game tonight, I get a full scholarship to college."

292
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
 And I was like, what?

293
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,720
 And the movie flies by at a clip.

294
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,720
 They do talk a little bit about like the illegal immigrants, the aliens come in,

295
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,720
 and they do better on all the tests than the best cheerleaders in the galaxy because they're flying around the stage.

296
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
 They have alien powers.

297
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
 I was like, obviously they're going to win.

298
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,720
 And then they completely abandoned that theme and it's pretty much,

299
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 can the UFO take off Addison?

300
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
 Is an alien?

301
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
 She's the granddaughter of an alien.

302
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
 Fan-tastic movie.

303
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,720
 I, Dead Rabbit, recommend highly Zombies 3.

304
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,720
 And I'll tell you right now, you don't have to watch all of them.

305
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 If you're looking for a absolutely bizarre movie to put on in the background while you're just chilling,

306
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,720
 Zombies, especially, I think if you watch Zombies 3 and didn't watch any of the other two, you're like,

307
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
 "This is random nonsense."

308
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
 Absolutely fascinating.

309
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,720
 Dead Rabbit recommends the entire zombie trilogy if you have six hours to spare.

310
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 But if not, Zombies 3 is just so weird.

311
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
 And I love it.

312
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,720
 And I thank you for letting me waste your time in the Fast Word button until you,

313
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
 okay, yeah, yeah, okay, we're done.

314
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,720
 Thought not, let's go ahead and have you land this carbon helicopter at this high school.

315
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,720
 We, as my desktop picture, I just clicked on my desktop.

316
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
 It's a picture of Zombies 3.

317
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
 I changed that wallpaper right away.

318
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 Thought not, land this carbon helicopter at this high school.

319
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,720
 We're going to take a look at the story of a young girl.

320
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 We're going to call her Jessica.

321
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,720
 She goes by the internet name Suitcase in her hand.

322
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,720
 She says that this story took place back when she was around 14 years old, the year is 2015.

323
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,720
 Her and her best friend, who we're going to call Madeline,

324
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,720
 while they were in high school, they were obsessed with Andy Warhol.

325
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,720
 Famous artist, Soup Can Man, Campbell Soup Dude, couple pictures of Elvis.

326
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 I'm not a big Andy Warhol fan myself.

327
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
 Was he in Zombies 3?

328
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
 I never really got the appeal.

329
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,720
 I know that he was trying to take art and consumer mass consumption images and go,

330
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
 "This is art.

331
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
 I like the endeavor, right?

332
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
 I like the idea."

333
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 Maybe if I was alive back then.

334
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,720
 But now I'm just like, "I don't hate the guy, right?

335
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,720
 If you're already getting ready to cancel your subscription, I don't hate the guy.

336
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,720
 I just am not a fan of the art that I've seen of his."

337
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
 But anyways, these two girls were.

338
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
 They loved Andy Warhol.

339
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,720
 They loved him so much and often they would sit around dreaming about their eating soup all the time.

340
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,720
 Mom's like, "You guys really need to get some nutrients in you."

341
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 Well, he didn't draw a vitamin mom.

342
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
 He drew soup.

343
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,720
 They would sit around eating soup and Jessica would say, "Man, I really wish I could have met Andy Warhol."

344
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
 And Matt was like, "I agree.

345
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
 I totally agree."

346
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 Well, they start to get obsessed with this idea of meeting Andy Warhol.

347
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,720
 And Jessica goes, "We were also a bit of fans of the paranormal, so we believed in magic and stuff like that.

348
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,720
 So we decided to peanut butter and jelly this thing.

349
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,720
 What if we summoned the soul of Andy Warhol?"

350
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,720
 So Jessica goes, "I don't remember the exact ritual.

351
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
 I remember we got it online.

352
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,720
 We were typing in Andy Warhol summoning spells and there's the huge list."

353
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:17,720
 She goes, "I don't remember exactly what it was, but we got this incantation and then we built a shrine to Andy Warhol in my room.

354
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
 We had all these candles.

355
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,720
 We had photos of Andy Warhol and empty cans of soup.

356
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
 There's flies everywhere.

357
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,720
 And then they had soup cans.

358
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
 Nothing looking back on there.

359
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
 No, I'm assuming they weren't opened.

360
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,720
 Anyways, they had Polaroid cameras because apparently that was a medium he used a lot.

361
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,720
 Polaroid cameras, soup cans, pictures of him, notes written to him.

362
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 So they're like, "Oh, dear Andy Warhol, I wish you weren't dead."

363
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
 Sincerely, Jessica.

364
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,720
 They had all this stuff and they had a laptop playing footage of him on a loop.

365
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
 That's an interesting twist to a spell, right?

366
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,720
 Obviously all this magic was written before technology got to that level,

367
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:07,720
 but photographs are a big part of low magic, basically witchcraft, nature magic type of stuff,

368
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
 where you have to have an icon of someone.

369
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,720
 Nowadays, you could have 24 hours of just continuous video footage of this subject that you're doing the spell on, right?

370
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
 It's pretty interesting.

371
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,720
 She said the entire room was dark except for the candles and the desktop that was playing Andy Warhol doing the G-Series.

372
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
 Andy Warhol doing the jig or something.

373
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,720
 I don't know exactly what he was doing, but they begin the ceremony and as they're doing this,

374
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,720
 the flames are burning on the candle.

375
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
 Andy Warhol's doing the jig.

376
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,720
 They begin to recite the incantation and she said, "We weren't just saying the incantation.

377
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
 We were focusing.

378
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
 We were trying to manifest him.

379
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,720
 We were using basically the law of attraction.

380
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
 We had our intention set.

381
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,720
 We focused on manifesting him into the, cut into our world, into my room."

382
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,720
 And they have their eyes closed and they're doing the incantation and then Jessica said,

383
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,720
 "All of a sudden, I start to feel this pressure all around me.

384
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
 I start to feel a change in the atmosphere."

385
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,720
 She said, "It felt like hot and cold at the exact same time, like loud and quiet simultaneously.

386
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,720
 There's just this completely different energy in the room."

387
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:29,720
 And she opened her eyes and at that time she sees her friend's face is locked in this gaze of horror.

388
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,720
 And so she turns and she goes to look to see what her friend is seeing.

389
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 And there, standing in the darkness of the room, is Andy Warhol.

390
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,720
 Andy Warhol came back alive.

391
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
 You can see that in the newspaper.

392
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
 You haven't been checking CNN.

393
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
 Andy Warhol is alive.

394
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,720
 They see Andy Warhol standing in the darkness and I really like the way that she described this.

395
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,720
 She said, "He was there for a moment and he was incredibly bright."

396
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,720
 She said, "What it looked like was if someone was standing in the dark, pitch black room,

397
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,720
 and someone snapped a photo of them with the flash on and how it illuminates them for a quick second."

398
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,720
 And she goes, "I turn and I see him standing there and I see this huge illumination effect.

399
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,720
 He's just blindingly bright."

400
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
 And then he fades away or he just disappears actually.

401
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
 It's not like a slow fade.

402
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,720
 It's just gone.

403
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,720
 And at this point Madeline's like screaming.

404
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
 She's freaking out.

405
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
 It was definitely like he wanted to see Andy Warhol.

406
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,720
 But at the end of the day you realize you just summoned a spirit.

407
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,720
 And Jessica goes, "I didn't scream.

408
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,720
 It wasn't even like a sense of fear when he was there.

409
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
 Obviously you were startled."

410
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
 She goes, "I didn't scream.

411
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,720
 I was actually just frozen in physical place.

412
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,720
 My emotions, everything just were like muted."

413
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
 She actually felt because Madeline wanted to leave the room.

414
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
 Madeline wanted to run away.

415
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:05,720
 Jessica felt that she needed to be closer to this now gone figure.

416
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 She goes, "I know that he was gone, but I felt like I should be physically next to where he was.

417
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 Like move over there and stand where Andy Warhol just was."

418
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,720
 She goes, "The whole thing felt like a dream."

419
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
 Now Madeline did end up running out of the room.

420
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,720
 And she said shortly after this we stopped hanging out with each other.

421
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,720
 Me and Madeline haven't been hanging out in a while.

422
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,720
 To put it bluntly, she goes, "I really haven't seen her in seven years."

423
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,720
 So I don't really know how she's doing.

424
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
 She's been chopped up and stuck in a hundred soup canes.

425
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,720
 We don't actually know how Madeline's doing, but Jessica said, "I'm doing fine.

426
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
 I'm actually doing better than fine."

427
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,720
 You might want to visit my room nowadays now that I'm an adult.

428
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,720
 I'm in my 20s now.

429
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,720
 I want you to swing on by my house. She's obsessed with Andy Warhol now.

430
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
 Totally obsessed.

431
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,720
 You walk in, she has over 70 books on Andy Warhol.

432
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,720
 I don't think I own 70 books, period.

433
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,720
 She has 70 books on Andy Warhol.

434
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,720
 She has a tattoo of Andy Warhol.

435
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
 That'd be alarming, right?

436
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
 You meet a pretty girl.

437
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,720
 She has a face of a big old weirdo on her bicep.

438
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
 That'd be kind of alarming.

439
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,720
 She has a... well, that's the least of your worries, actually.

440
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,720
 Then you go back to her house and you see her library, Andy Warhol book.

441
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
 She has a tattoo of Andy Warhol.

442
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 She has autographs from Andy Warhol.

443
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,720
 She went to the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.

444
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,720
 And she said when she walked into the museum, she started to feel the same pressure

445
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,720
 that she felt when she was in the room the first time.

446
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,720
 She started to feel the energy change.

447
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
 And you could say, Jason, sure, I wouldn't necessarily say it's obsessed

448
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
 if you have 70 books on one person.

449
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
 I've got the last part.

450
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,720
 But I would say you're pretty obsessed if you have 70 books on the same person.

451
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
 A tattoo of the person.

452
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
 And then all that other stuff.

453
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,720
 She actually has dirt from Andy Warhol's grave.

454
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,720
 That's obsessed with it. That's obsessed, right?

455
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,720
 I mean, like, I really like "Somedy's 3."

456
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
 I really like that movie.

457
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,720
 But I'm not going to be walking around in a Seabrook Shrimps football jersey.

458
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,720
 I definitely want to be carrying around dirt from the set of "Somedy's 3."

459
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
 You could be Jason.

460
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,720
 You're declaring one of America's greatest pop culture artists to a Disney Channel movie.

461
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
 Yeah, I like "Somedy's 3."

462
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
 And I'm not a huge fan of Andy Warhol.

463
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
 But anyways, that's not the point.

464
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,720
 I can't get back on "Somedy's 3."

465
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
 I'll never stop.

466
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,720
 She has dirt from Andy Warhol's grave, and she goes from time to time, the dirt's knocked over.

467
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,720
 And I kind of feel like it's Andy Warhol's ghost knocking it over.

468
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,720
 I should add to that fact going through her history.

469
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
 She has a cat.

470
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,720
 It might be the cat knocking over the dirt.

471
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,720
 But here's my, here's my read on this story.

472
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,720
 I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they actually summoned Andy Warhol back to life.

473
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,720
 And then it disappeared in a flash, but I don't think it disappeared in a flash.

474
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,720
 I think that this girl, Jessica, is possessed by Andy Warhol.

475
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,720
 It might be the dumbest thing I've ever saw on the show, but hear me out.

476
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
 She summoned this guy.

477
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,720
 I mean, she, before, she was pretty obsessed before, right?

478
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,720
 But based on the, the narrative, like she didn't have the tattoo.

479
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
 She didn't have the dirt, as far as we can tell.

480
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
 She didn't go to the museum.

481
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
 If you go to a museum with someone, you're going to get possessed by them.

482
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
 You didn't know that?

483
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
 We learned that in history class.

484
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,720
 You have this girl who's in love with this dude, not necessarily romantically, right?

485
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
 But she's in love with this dude.

486
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,720
 And then she summons him and then Andy Warhol while he's there, he's like,

487
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
 "Yo, I'm going to be this girl now."

488
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,720
 And he's like in the body of this girl.

489
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,720
 Now, the thing would be is that maybe he doesn't have full control over her, right?

490
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,720
 Maybe she's like eating vegetables.

491
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
 She's like, "No, no, you're supposed to be eating soup."

492
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
 Like maybe he doesn't have full control over her.

493
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
 Or maybe he does.

494
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,720
 Maybe Andy Warhol is such an egotist that now that he's in this girl's body,

495
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,720
 he just wants to look at stuff, look at stuff that people made of him, autographs.

496
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,720
 I guess those are his, but he's like, "Oh, the sweet dirt of my grave."

497
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
 He's all rubbing it on himself.

498
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,720
 She's always walking around with dust on her cheeks.

499
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
 What if Andy Warhol possessed this girl?

500
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 That's the best case scenario.

501
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,720
 The worst case scenario is that Andy Warhol did not possess this girl,

502
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,720
 but something pretending to be Andy Warhol possessed this girl.

503
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
 We talked about this recently, I think it was on yesterday's episode,

504
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,720
 or the episode with the Haunted Album, where you'd have a dark creature like a latch itself to you

505
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
 in the guise of something else.

506
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,720
 So maybe there's like a demon who is in hell and he heard like this incantation.

507
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
 He's like, "Who is Andy Warhol?

508
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
 I don't know.

509
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
 I'm going to go up there and be him.

510
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
 Maybe he's cool."

511
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
 And he shows up to the demons like, "Ahh!"

512
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
 He realizes he's super lame.

513
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,720
 He's like, "Oh man, I thought this guy made Zombies 3."

514
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
 But it was too late.

515
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,720
 The zombie, the dinosaur, what if the demon had already taken the form of Andy Warhol?

516
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
 And he saw how much this little girl loved him, so he's like affecting her life.

517
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,720
 He's basically like making her obsessed over some dead dude.

518
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,720
 And when you're obsessed with someone's accomplishments,

519
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,720
 do you have your own?

520
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,720
 You know, there's this source of inspiration, right?

521
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
 I think to look at the people who've inspired me over the years.

522
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,720
 And then I go on and do my own thing.

523
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
 I think that's the normal thing, right?

524
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
 You see someone you're like, "Wow, dude, I wish I could be that cool.

525
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,720
 I wish I was the first monster who went to college."

526
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 And that inspires you on your own journey.

527
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,720
 But people who become obsessed just don't do that.

528
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,720
 They're just constantly collecting and consuming something that somebody else has created.

529
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,720
 There's nothing wrong with that, but you know the difference between obsession and admiration.

530
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,720
 Or just simply like in a dude.

531
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,720
 Before it seemed to be like, "Yeah, we really like Andy Warhol,

532
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
 and we wish we'd met him before."

533
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,720
 To, "His face is forever emblazoned on my body,

534
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,720
 and I have his dirt from his grave in my bedroom."

535
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
 Like, you know what I mean? Like, that's a bridge too far.

536
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 So maybe this demon is actually draining her energy

537
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,720
 and only making her focus on the past instead of her own artistic endeavors.

538
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
 Or just having a life, right?

539
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,720
 Just having a normal life.

540
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,720
 It's a fascinating story. Is it true? We don't know, right?

541
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,720
 We really just have this one person's statement,

542
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
 but it's fascinating nonetheless.

543
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,720
 It does track what we know about these type of incantations,

544
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
 summoning spells, stuff like that.

545
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,720
 It does actually make sense.

546
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
 It's not completely outlandish, as he said,

547
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
 as he talked about Andy Warhol possessing a young girl,

548
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,720
 or something pretending to be Andy Warhol, which would be far worse.

549
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
 At least if Andy Warhol was in your body, I don't know, maybe you could make more soup.

550
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,720
 Maybe you could go get a job at the Campbell Soup factory and work all the way up to CEO.

551
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,720
 And then at that point, Andy Warhol's ghost flies out of her body and goes,

552
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
 "You're all fired. I'm the soup king now."

553
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
 And they're like, "Ah!"

554
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,720
 And all the other CEOs leave, and then it's just this ghost who's running the Campbell Soup factory.

555
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,720
 Right? That's reasonable. That's reasonable.

556
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,720
 But it also shows that the dangers are messing with the stuff.

557
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
 So many times people do this.

558
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,720
 I have a friend who just moved into a new house,

559
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,720
 and she keeps saying, "I hope it's haunted. I hope it's haunted."

560
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
 And I was like, "Yeah, that'd be cool."

561
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
 And she's like, "Yeah, I hope there's a demon there.

562
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
 I hope it would be fun to get possessed."

563
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
 Okay, now you're just nuts.

564
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
 "Nah, it would be totally cool."

565
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,720
 I'm like, "Meghania, knock it off."

566
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,720
 That's like, what are you just even saying that?

567
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,720
 She wasn't saying it in jests. She wasn't saying it to rile me up.

568
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,720
 "Nah, it'd be so cool."

569
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
 It's dangerous stuff.

570
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,720
 People watch a couple movies, and they read a couple books,

571
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,720
 or they read some stuff online, and they go, "I can handle that."

572
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
 And it's the same thing.

573
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
 Like, people watch "Saving Private Ryan" and go, "Pfft. I can do that."

574
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,720
 I think my face is blowing off on a beach somewhere.

575
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
 You always see yourself as a hero.

576
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,720
 You always see yourself as the triumphant victor.

577
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,720
 But you're messing with dark, dark energy.

578
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,720
 And whether you're summoning forth one of the grand archdemons of hell,

579
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,720
 or a pop artist from the 60s,

580
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,720
 you're dealing with dark energy.

581
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,720
 You're dealing with something that you shouldn't be messing with.

582
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
 The consequences could be something as basic as losing your friend

583
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,720
 and developing a lifelong obsession with a dead icon,

584
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,720
 or it could be life-altering events.

585
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
 After life-altering events, right?

586
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,720
 You get possessed so fully by a demon.

587
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
 What happens to your own soul?

588
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
 Terrifying story.

589
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,720
 Don't mess with dark energies unless you know what you're doing.

590
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,720
 And the reality is, no human.

591
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,720
 No matter how long they've been studying this,

592
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,720
 no human knows what they're doing when it comes to the dark arts.
