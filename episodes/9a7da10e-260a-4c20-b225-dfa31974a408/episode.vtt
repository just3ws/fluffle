WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.360
 They make me happy and they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.560
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.720
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720
 Who would win in a fight?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.720
 A dog or an alien?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 We'll be finding out the answer to that.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.720
 It's kind of a rhetorical question if you think about it.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 And then we meet two young girls who have an obsession with a popular artist.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720
 Using a black magic spell they found on the internet,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.720
 is it possible that they brought Andy Warhol back to life?

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.720
 [Music]

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.720
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.720
 I hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so let's go ahead and get started

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.720
 right now walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 It's one of our Christmas livestream contributors.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.720
 Everyone give it up for Thought Not.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 Woohoo, yeah! Come on in Thought Not.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 Thought Not, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally get it.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.720
 Trust me, I do.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 Just help spread the word about the show.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 That helps out so much.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 Get the word out.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.720
 Let people know that your favorite podcast is Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.720
 Even if it's not, even if you like through your four podcasts more,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 just tell them I'm your favorite.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.720
 Thought Not, let's go ahead and toss you the bunny bicycle.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 We're going to pedal on out of Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.720
 Don't pop in wheelies.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.720
 Take us all the way out too.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720
 North Carolina.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.720
 Squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 I'm still trying to find a good sound effect for the bicycle.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.720
 We might have to get rid of the bunny bike until I can come up.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 At least that one does the little gear squeaking.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.720
 Maybe I should just do the sound of a car going...

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720
 You know, through the spokes or something like that.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.720
 We'll figure it out.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720
 Or we'll get rid of it.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.720
 We're headed out to Mount Airy in North Carolina.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.720
 It's February 1981 and it's kind of late at night.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.720
 And there's a farm out near Mount Airy.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.720
 And this farm is a farmer.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720
 And he is doing his duty.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.720
 What he's doing right now is he's actually milking his cows.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.720
 Which seems weird.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.720
 I don't know anything about farm life, right?

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.720
 I watched a couple documentaries.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720
 Babe, Charlotte's Web.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.720
 But other than that, like I don't know, like do people...

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.720
 I thought people woke up like super early, the butt crack of dawn,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.720
 and went out and was milking cows then.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.720
 But apparently, I didn't know that apparently he can do it anytime during the day.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720
 Maybe he slept in.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.720
 And then he decided, oh wait, does milk go bad and a cow is udder?

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.720
 Like what if you wait too long to milk it?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.720
 Anyways, all this stuff is easily researchable.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.720
 But I'm too busy looking up UFO stories.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720
 This farmer, we're going to call him Billy.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720
 This farmer is out there late at night.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720
 He's milking his cow.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720
 It doesn't say like two in the morning or something like that.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720
 I'm assuming it's like eight.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.720
 That still seems really...

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.720
 still seems really like to be walking around the farm.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.720
 But again, I don't know anything about farms.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.720
 He's milking his cow and he has this good old hunting dog by his side.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.720
 And we're going to call his hunting dog a Jasper.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.720
 So Billy's sitting there getting some milk in a tin pail.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.720
 All of a sudden Jasper starts to bark really loudly.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 [barking]

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.720
 And starts to run around all over him.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720
 He's like knocking over the milk.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 He's like, oh no, my milk.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.720
 I need to do those nutrients.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.720
 And Billy's dog's running around and Billy realizes something's wrong.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720
 Jasper doesn't normally act like this.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.720
 And Jasper's like sniffing the ground and then takes off.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.720
 Just runs out in the darkness and Billy's like, Jasper, no.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.720
 So Billy goes out after his dog and he sees a little puppy running up to the top of a hill.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.720
 Oh, dang that dog.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.720
 Better drink some milk for energy to climb that hill.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.720
 Glug glug glug glug glug glug.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720
 He's like, bye bye.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.720
 He runs up the hill and he sees his dog.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.720
 Standing over a fallen figure.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.720
 He's like, oh, what in the world is that?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.720
 Jasper, get away from that thing.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.720
 And what it is, it's a little humanoid.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.720
 It's this little pink-skinned creature with a big head.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.720
 Large round eyes.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.720
 Imagine one of those precious moment figurines.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720
 Terribly mauled.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.720
 Imagine one of those little kids but all ripped up.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720
 It's a pink-skinned large head.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.720
 No nose or mouth.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.720
 And it's wearing a light-colored robe.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.720
 It's just laying there.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.720
 Because Jasper got into this dude.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.720
 Jasper smelled this guy from quite a ways away.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.720
 He ran up this hill and is greeting our extraterrestrial visitors with a good old bite of its jaws.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.720
 Arrrrr.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.720
 This little dude's laying there.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.720
 Billy's looking at this.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.720
 He has no idea what it is.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.720
 He figures it's, you know, not human.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.720
 And its arms and legs are all chewed up.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.720
 It's just laying there going, "Uhhh."

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.720
 And what if there's a thing like if you came across an alien like that in that condition.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.720
 What are you going to do?

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.720
 Like if it was a human, you could call 911, right?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.720
 What are you going to do for a little alien, bro?

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.720
 Right? They got all chewed up.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.720
 So he left.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.720
 He just caught his dog.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.720
 Went away.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.720
 He actually kind of scared him.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.720
 He grabbed his dog.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.720
 He drove into town.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.720
 Here's one of those odd details that makes me think the story is true.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.720
 Because generally fake stories are very clean.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.720
 You have a through line to them.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720
 This is how this story goes.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:59.720
 He gets his dog, drags him to the truck, drives into town, drives back to the farm, drops his dog off.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.720
 Jasper gets dropped off in the farm.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.720
 And then Billy drives himself to spend the night in a motel.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.720
 Now if it was fictional, it would just be like, "Oh, he went back and he went to sleep."

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.720
 Or, "He took his dog to town, but his dog got loose."

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.720
 Because the dog is going to play an important part on this next thing.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720
 In a real story, this would make sense.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720
 He gets his dog, he goes into town, he goes to the motel.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.720
 He says, "You can't bring your dog with you.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.720
 Dude, you can't have a dog in a motel."

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 And I'm fine.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720
 Because he doesn't want to stay the night at his house.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720
 It's spooky, right?

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.720
 Something's up there.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.720
 So then he has to drive back and drop his dog off.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.720
 It's little details like that that make stories make them more believable.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.720
 I read a ton of stuff all the time and I'm like, "It's fake."

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.720
 Like even the skeptical side of me, I do have a skeptical side when I read a bunch of this stuff.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.720
 But you just start to develop a pretty good BS meter.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720
 Now it's not foolproof.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.720
 It's not foolproof, right?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.720
 Lone Pine Devils, I was wrong.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.720
 The high school episode I did recently, I was misled.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.720
 So it's not foolproof, but for the most part, like it's little details like that that make you,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.720
 there might actually be some truth to that because it's a messy part of the story.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.720
 Anyways, so no dogs allowed at the hotel.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.720
 He then drops his dog off at the farm.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.720
 This alien creature just got mauled and Billy's too scared to stay there.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.720
 So he goes to the motel, holiday inn, to spin the night.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.720
 And then the next morning he comes back and he walks up to the hill.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.720
 The first thing he does is he goes to the hill and the creature is gone.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.720
 Billy's like, "Well, okay, I don't know if he moved on his own."

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.720
 Probably not. His legs are pretty damaged.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.720
 Maybe someone got him. I don't know. It's spooky, but...

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.720
 And then he goes to his farm and there he finds Jasper, dead.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:50.720
 And a couple of Billy's cows had gone missing.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.720
 I found that story on ThinkAboutAdox.com, one of my favorite resources for this podcast.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.720
 They got it from an article written by Gray Barker.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.720
 The dog himself wrote it like every time he died.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.720
 He's like typing out his memoirs. He's like, "This is what's happening. Please don't."

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:14.720
 Gray Barker, he wrote this article in UFO Annual 1981, a UFO journal back in the time.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.720
 It's interesting because ThinkAboutAdox.com added a little addition to this

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.720
 in parentheses, they go, "Was there any autopsy on the animal?"

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:29.720
 Which is an interesting quote. I didn't think about that until I finished reading it and saw that sentence.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.720
 I go, "Yeah." That would make sense. They don't know how the dog died. The dog was just dead.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.720
 Yeah. Did you take it to the vet and say, "Hey, can you find out what happened to my dog?"

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.720
 And the vet's looking. He's like, "It looks like he ate a couple of arms and legs last night."

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.720
 "Is that pink flesh?" "Yeah, forget the flesh. Let's pretend that he didn't maul someone or something last night."

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.720
 "Can you tell me how my dog died?" The doctor could cut it open and be like,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.720
 "Well, all the organs are in the right place."

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.720
 "Really bad doctor. That's the only thing you notice how to check is where the organs are."

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.720
 But yeah, so how did the dog die? Obviously the implication is that the alien bros came back.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.720
 They showed up and they found their little dude laying there with his little cloak on

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.720
 and they're like, "Syrus, Cyrus, are you okay?" And he's like, "Felice, can you back to the mothership?"

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.720
 "Please put me in the Regenotron." And they take him in and then as he's like floating in some see-through tube

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:29.720
 and his limbs are getting strong again, he's like, "The first thing he does with his new arms is he's like punching his hand."

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.720
 He goes, "Guys, we need to even the score." That dog down there, "Tune me up, man."

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.720
 And when in the water town they're killing this dog, they just take a couple of cows.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.720
 That's basically the payment. You made us use the Regenotron, you know how much energy that thing uses

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.720
 when you're going to steal a couple of your cows. And don't come looking for us.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.720
 On the other side of the Alpha Centauri nebula, it's not like Billy had access to intergalactic warp drive.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.720
 But an interesting story nonetheless, real-world consequences of encountering alien life.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.720
 So many times people are abducted and they don't remember it or they're abducted and they remember it

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.720
 and they have horrifying nightmares. I mean, that's pretty bad if they have implants and stuff like that.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.720
 But stories where people die, animals die encountering aliens.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.720
 I don't think we hear a lot of them because I don't think people survive them.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.720
 I think these one-off encounters with aliens, like if the farmer just died of a heart attack that night, right?

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.720
 They would have been like, "Oh, no Billy, now where are we going to get our milk for the town?"

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.720
 And they just go to the store, they go to the store, they're like, "Whoa, grocery store's selling milk?"

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.720
 It would have been chalked up to a horrible accident, right? And there wouldn't have been no witness to finding the little guy up on the...

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.720
 Because they were coming gun form, right? The implication is they came back to the farm later and killed the dog

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.720
 and took some cows and if Billy had been there, he would have been dead too.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.720
 I think there probably are more stories of people dying at the hands of alien invaders.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.720
 But we don't hear about it because there's no one to tell that story.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.720
 But in this case, there was a survivor, luckily for us.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:04.720
 But Jasper, we will always honor you for being the first dog that we know of to mutilate an alien.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.720
 This week has been really heavy on dog stories. I hope that's not for telling something.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.720
 I hope I'm not going to have a close encounter with it.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.720
 Dogs, Jaws.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.720
 Thought not, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carbentercopter.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.720
 We are leaving behind North Carolina. We're headed out to a high school.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:25.720
 [imitates carpenters]

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.720
 Speaking of high schools, I'm going to do a very quick, dead rabbit recommends.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.720
 I have to keep it quick. I could honestly talk about this movie for the next 30 minutes, but I won't.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.720
 I'll punish the people on the Discord with that, defeat you on Discord.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.720
 I've already started posting stuff.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.720
 Long time ago, I did a dead rabbit recommends on the Disney movie Zombies.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:55.720
 It was a musical about brain-eating zombies who had to wear control collars to keep them from eating people's brains.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:04.720
 They were right next door to this gated community. It really was a story about race relations in America.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.720
 Humanity had become post-racial. That wasn't an issue anymore because everyone hated the zombies.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.720
 They had found a common enemy. The zombies were like, "Hey, we can't help it. We can't help it.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.720
 We got this nuclear radiation on us and now all of our kids are zombies too.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:26.720
 We just want to be just like you." It's this bizarre musical that's the central theme.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:33.720
 But there's all of these weird underlying things like Zed, who's the lead zombie, this dance and groove-in zombie,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.720
 constantly on the verge of eating people's brains. He realizes that he can adjust his control collar.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.720
 It's actually like a watch. It gives him superhuman strength and he tries out for the football team.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:52.720
 He's throwing people like 30, 40 yards. Then it becomes an allegory on performance enhancing drugs.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:59.720
 Would it be fair? He wanted to be the first zombie to ever play high school football.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:05.720
 The reason why you can't do it is because it's not fair. You're extremely powerful.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.720
 Then he starts losing control. They have these bizarre musical sequences.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:17.720
 I remember when I watched it, I thought, "This movie cannot get any weirder and then the next scene would start."

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.720
 You're like, "What is going on?" And I absolutely loved it. It was so weird.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.720
 Then they came out with Zombies 2, which I did not do a Dead Rabbit Recommends on.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.720
 I watched that. I bought it the day it came out.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.720
 So the first one was pretty much the other, right? It was Humans vs. the other.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.720
 In the second movie, they clarified that the zombies are supposed to represent black culture in America.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.720
 The second one, they bring in indigenous culture.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.720
 Werewolves. We were here before the humans got here. We were living in caves the whole time.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.720
 We didn't even know we were here. These werewolves jump out and they're dancing around.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.720
 Again, it has this really bizarre commentary.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.720
 Werewolves just go, "Hey, can we start going to school here?"

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.720
 And the administrator is like, "Yeah, sure. You can come here."

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.720
 The zombies are like, "It took us 15 years to even be able to set foot in this school."

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.720
 That was a part of the first movie. It was the very first year zombies could go to high school.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.720
 They just get to come in and the administrator is like, "Yeah, sure, whatever."

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.720
 You had this antagonism between these two different minority groups.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.720
 Addison, who is the lead love interest, he's in love with the zombie,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.720
 she all of a sudden becomes super obsessed with the werewolves and their culture

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.720
 and starts dressing like them and believing she is the savior of their people.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.720
 And I'm like, "Dude, this is a Disney Channel movie. What is going on?"

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.720
 And she's saying, "I'm prophesied to help the werewolves. I was a werewolf all along."

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.720
 There is a prophecy about this woman who's supposed to save the werewolves.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.720
 I'm talking about this way longer than I wanted to, but there's a prophecy about this person who's going to save the werewolves.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.720
 And Addison goes, "That's me." And everyone's like, "That's not you."

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.720
 And she's like, "No, no, that's me. I'm going to save the indigenous people."

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.720
 And it really plays on like the white savior trope.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:08.720
 And at the ending, she goes to use this magical power to save the indigenous people's moonstone.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.720
 And it doesn't work. She wasn't the prophesied one and everything blows up.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.720
 At the end of that movie, everyone is worse off than they were at the beginning.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.720
 But they're still singing and dancing. It's super bizarre, but I didn't like it as much.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.720
 The music wasn't that good.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.720
 So at the end of that one, it turns out that Addison wasn't a werewolf.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.720
 Like, Jason, I really don't care. Get to the Andy Warhol story.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.720
 Quit holding me hostage. Addison was not a werewolf, but at the end, she goes,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.720
 "Well, if I'm not a werewolf and I don't fit in with the humans because she has white hair,

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.720
 she never feels like she fit in. Who do I, what group do I belong to?"

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.720
 And as she's going to bed, a UFO shows up.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.720
 And I'm like, "Oh my God, are you going to talk about illegal immigrants in the next one?"

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.720
 We've already talked about indigenous culture being wiped out.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.720
 We've talked about an oppressed group of people living right next door and having curfew and dress codes.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.720
 And it's like this prison camp that they live in.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.720
 So I was like, are they actually going to do a story about illegal immigrants in Zombies 3?

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.720
 But I was like, they're not going to make a Zombies 3, right?

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.720
 I was lucky enough to get Zombies 2.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.720
 Well, on July 15th, Zombies 3 dropped.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.720
 And it is fantastic. Dead Rabbit recommends Zombies 3.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.720
 And I remember going, "Oh my God, I just found out they're going to make this movie."

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.720
 And is it going to be about illegal immigrants coming and then the indigenous people and the minority, like the oppressed group,

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:37.720
 and then the humans, are they all going to hate the illegal immigrants for like taking their jobs and things like that?

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.720
 Taking their places in college?

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.720
 The movie's about whether or not Bonzo can get a driver's license.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:51.720
 Or whether or not Zed can impress a counselor to be the first monster to go to college.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.720
 It starts off with him saying, "If I win the football game tonight, I get a full scholarship to college."

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.720
 And I was like, what?

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.720
 And the movie flies by at a clip.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.720
 They do talk a little bit about like the illegal immigrants, the aliens come in,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.720
 and they do better on all the tests than the best cheerleaders in the galaxy because they're flying around the stage.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.720
 They have alien powers.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.720
 I was like, obviously they're going to win.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.720
 And then they completely abandoned that theme and it's pretty much,

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.720
 can the UFO take off Addison?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.720
 Is an alien?

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.720
 She's the granddaughter of an alien.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.720
 Fan-tastic movie.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.720
 I, Dead Rabbit, recommend highly Zombies 3.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.720
 And I'll tell you right now, you don't have to watch all of them.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.720
 If you're looking for a absolutely bizarre movie to put on in the background while you're just chilling,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.720
 Zombies, especially, I think if you watch Zombies 3 and didn't watch any of the other two, you're like,

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.720
 "This is random nonsense."

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.720
 Absolutely fascinating.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.720
 Dead Rabbit recommends the entire zombie trilogy if you have six hours to spare.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.720
 But if not, Zombies 3 is just so weird.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720
 And I love it.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.720
 And I thank you for letting me waste your time in the Fast Word button until you,

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.720
 okay, yeah, yeah, okay, we're done.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.720
 Thought not, let's go ahead and have you land this carbon helicopter at this high school.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.720
 We, as my desktop picture, I just clicked on my desktop.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.720
 It's a picture of Zombies 3.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.720
 I changed that wallpaper right away.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.720
 Thought not, land this carbon helicopter at this high school.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.720
 We're going to take a look at the story of a young girl.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.720
 We're going to call her Jessica.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.720
 She goes by the internet name Suitcase in her hand.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.720
 She says that this story took place back when she was around 14 years old, the year is 2015.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.720
 Her and her best friend, who we're going to call Madeline,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.720
 while they were in high school, they were obsessed with Andy Warhol.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.720
 Famous artist, Soup Can Man, Campbell Soup Dude, couple pictures of Elvis.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.720
 I'm not a big Andy Warhol fan myself.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.720
 Was he in Zombies 3?

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.720
 I never really got the appeal.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.720
 I know that he was trying to take art and consumer mass consumption images and go,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720
 "This is art.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720
 I like the endeavor, right?

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.720
 I like the idea."

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.720
 Maybe if I was alive back then.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.720
 But now I'm just like, "I don't hate the guy, right?

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.720
 If you're already getting ready to cancel your subscription, I don't hate the guy.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.720
 I just am not a fan of the art that I've seen of his."

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.720
 But anyways, these two girls were.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.720
 They loved Andy Warhol.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.720
 They loved him so much and often they would sit around dreaming about their eating soup all the time.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.720
 Mom's like, "You guys really need to get some nutrients in you."

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.720
 Well, he didn't draw a vitamin mom.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.720
 He drew soup.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.720
 They would sit around eating soup and Jessica would say, "Man, I really wish I could have met Andy Warhol."

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.720
 And Matt was like, "I agree.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720
 I totally agree."

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:45.720
 Well, they start to get obsessed with this idea of meeting Andy Warhol.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.720
 And Jessica goes, "We were also a bit of fans of the paranormal, so we believed in magic and stuff like that.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.720
 So we decided to peanut butter and jelly this thing.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:59.720
 What if we summoned the soul of Andy Warhol?"

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.720
 So Jessica goes, "I don't remember the exact ritual.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.720
 I remember we got it online.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.720
 We were typing in Andy Warhol summoning spells and there's the huge list."

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:17.720
 She goes, "I don't remember exactly what it was, but we got this incantation and then we built a shrine to Andy Warhol in my room.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.720
 We had all these candles.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.720
 We had photos of Andy Warhol and empty cans of soup.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.720
 There's flies everywhere.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.720
 And then they had soup cans.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720
 Nothing looking back on there.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.720
 No, I'm assuming they weren't opened.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.720
 Anyways, they had Polaroid cameras because apparently that was a medium he used a lot.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:42.720
 Polaroid cameras, soup cans, pictures of him, notes written to him.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.720
 So they're like, "Oh, dear Andy Warhol, I wish you weren't dead."

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.720
 Sincerely, Jessica.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.720
 They had all this stuff and they had a laptop playing footage of him on a loop.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.720
 That's an interesting twist to a spell, right?

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.720
 Obviously all this magic was written before technology got to that level,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:07.720
 but photographs are a big part of low magic, basically witchcraft, nature magic type of stuff,

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.720
 where you have to have an icon of someone.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:16.720
 Nowadays, you could have 24 hours of just continuous video footage of this subject that you're doing the spell on, right?

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.720
 It's pretty interesting.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.720
 She said the entire room was dark except for the candles and the desktop that was playing Andy Warhol doing the G-Series.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.720
 Andy Warhol doing the jig or something.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.720
 I don't know exactly what he was doing, but they begin the ceremony and as they're doing this,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.720
 the flames are burning on the candle.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.720
 Andy Warhol's doing the jig.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.720
 They begin to recite the incantation and she said, "We weren't just saying the incantation.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.720
 We were focusing.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.720
 We were trying to manifest him.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.720
 We were using basically the law of attraction.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.720
 We had our intention set.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:57.720
 We focused on manifesting him into the, cut into our world, into my room."

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.720
 And they have their eyes closed and they're doing the incantation and then Jessica said,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.720
 "All of a sudden, I start to feel this pressure all around me.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.720
 I start to feel a change in the atmosphere."

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:16.720
 She said, "It felt like hot and cold at the exact same time, like loud and quiet simultaneously.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.720
 There's just this completely different energy in the room."

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:29.720
 And she opened her eyes and at that time she sees her friend's face is locked in this gaze of horror.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.720
 And so she turns and she goes to look to see what her friend is seeing.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:42.720
 And there, standing in the darkness of the room, is Andy Warhol.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.720
 Andy Warhol came back alive.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.720
 You can see that in the newspaper.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720
 You haven't been checking CNN.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.720
 Andy Warhol is alive.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.720
 They see Andy Warhol standing in the darkness and I really like the way that she described this.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.720
 She said, "He was there for a moment and he was incredibly bright."

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.720
 She said, "What it looked like was if someone was standing in the dark, pitch black room,

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.720
 and someone snapped a photo of them with the flash on and how it illuminates them for a quick second."

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.720
 And she goes, "I turn and I see him standing there and I see this huge illumination effect.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.720
 He's just blindingly bright."

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.720
 And then he fades away or he just disappears actually.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720
 It's not like a slow fade.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.720
 It's just gone.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.720
 And at this point Madeline's like screaming.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720
 She's freaking out.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.720
 It was definitely like he wanted to see Andy Warhol.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.720
 But at the end of the day you realize you just summoned a spirit.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.720
 And Jessica goes, "I didn't scream.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.720
 It wasn't even like a sense of fear when he was there.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.720
 Obviously you were startled."

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720
 She goes, "I didn't scream.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.720
 I was actually just frozen in physical place.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.720
 My emotions, everything just were like muted."

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.720
 She actually felt because Madeline wanted to leave the room.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.720
 Madeline wanted to run away.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:05.720
 Jessica felt that she needed to be closer to this now gone figure.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.720
 She goes, "I know that he was gone, but I felt like I should be physically next to where he was.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.720
 Like move over there and stand where Andy Warhol just was."

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.720
 She goes, "The whole thing felt like a dream."

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.720
 Now Madeline did end up running out of the room.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.720
 And she said shortly after this we stopped hanging out with each other.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.720
 Me and Madeline haven't been hanging out in a while.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.720
 To put it bluntly, she goes, "I really haven't seen her in seven years."

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.720
 So I don't really know how she's doing.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.720
 She's been chopped up and stuck in a hundred soup canes.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.720
 We don't actually know how Madeline's doing, but Jessica said, "I'm doing fine.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.720
 I'm actually doing better than fine."

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.720
 You might want to visit my room nowadays now that I'm an adult.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.720
 I'm in my 20s now.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:55.720
 I want you to swing on by my house. She's obsessed with Andy Warhol now.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720
 Totally obsessed.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.720
 You walk in, she has over 70 books on Andy Warhol.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.720
 I don't think I own 70 books, period.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.720
 She has 70 books on Andy Warhol.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.720
 She has a tattoo of Andy Warhol.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.720
 That'd be alarming, right?

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.720
 You meet a pretty girl.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.720
 She has a face of a big old weirdo on her bicep.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.720
 That'd be kind of alarming.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.720
 She has a... well, that's the least of your worries, actually.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.720
 Then you go back to her house and you see her library, Andy Warhol book.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.720
 She has a tattoo of Andy Warhol.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.720
 She has autographs from Andy Warhol.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.720
 She went to the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.720
 And she said when she walked into the museum, she started to feel the same pressure

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.720
 that she felt when she was in the room the first time.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.720
 She started to feel the energy change.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.720
 And you could say, Jason, sure, I wouldn't necessarily say it's obsessed

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.720
 if you have 70 books on one person.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.720
 I've got the last part.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.720
 But I would say you're pretty obsessed if you have 70 books on the same person.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.720
 A tattoo of the person.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.720
 And then all that other stuff.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.720
 She actually has dirt from Andy Warhol's grave.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.720
 That's obsessed with it. That's obsessed, right?

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.720
 I mean, like, I really like "Somedy's 3."

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.720
 I really like that movie.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:20.720
 But I'm not going to be walking around in a Seabrook Shrimps football jersey.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.720
 I definitely want to be carrying around dirt from the set of "Somedy's 3."

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720
 You could be Jason.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.720
 You're declaring one of America's greatest pop culture artists to a Disney Channel movie.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.720
 Yeah, I like "Somedy's 3."

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.720
 And I'm not a huge fan of Andy Warhol.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.720
 But anyways, that's not the point.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.720
 I can't get back on "Somedy's 3."

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.720
 I'll never stop.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.720
 She has dirt from Andy Warhol's grave, and she goes from time to time, the dirt's knocked over.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.720
 And I kind of feel like it's Andy Warhol's ghost knocking it over.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.720
 I should add to that fact going through her history.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720
 She has a cat.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.720
 It might be the cat knocking over the dirt.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.720
 But here's my, here's my read on this story.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:08.720
 I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they actually summoned Andy Warhol back to life.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.720
 And then it disappeared in a flash, but I don't think it disappeared in a flash.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:18.720
 I think that this girl, Jessica, is possessed by Andy Warhol.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.720
 It might be the dumbest thing I've ever saw on the show, but hear me out.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720
 She summoned this guy.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.720
 I mean, she, before, she was pretty obsessed before, right?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.720
 But based on the, the narrative, like she didn't have the tattoo.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.720
 She didn't have the dirt, as far as we can tell.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.720
 She didn't go to the museum.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.720
 If you go to a museum with someone, you're going to get possessed by them.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.720
 You didn't know that?

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.720
 We learned that in history class.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:43.720
 You have this girl who's in love with this dude, not necessarily romantically, right?

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.720
 But she's in love with this dude.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.720
 And then she summons him and then Andy Warhol while he's there, he's like,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.720
 "Yo, I'm going to be this girl now."

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.720
 And he's like in the body of this girl.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.720
 Now, the thing would be is that maybe he doesn't have full control over her, right?

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.720
 Maybe she's like eating vegetables.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.720
 She's like, "No, no, you're supposed to be eating soup."

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.720
 Like maybe he doesn't have full control over her.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.720
 Or maybe he does.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:15.720
 Maybe Andy Warhol is such an egotist that now that he's in this girl's body,

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.720
 he just wants to look at stuff, look at stuff that people made of him, autographs.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.720
 I guess those are his, but he's like, "Oh, the sweet dirt of my grave."

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.720
 He's all rubbing it on himself.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.720
 She's always walking around with dust on her cheeks.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.720
 What if Andy Warhol possessed this girl?

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.720
 That's the best case scenario.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.720
 The worst case scenario is that Andy Warhol did not possess this girl,

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.720
 but something pretending to be Andy Warhol possessed this girl.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.720
 We talked about this recently, I think it was on yesterday's episode,

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:50.720
 or the episode with the Haunted Album, where you'd have a dark creature like a latch itself to you

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.720
 in the guise of something else.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.720
 So maybe there's like a demon who is in hell and he heard like this incantation.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.720
 He's like, "Who is Andy Warhol?

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.720
 I don't know.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720
 I'm going to go up there and be him.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720
 Maybe he's cool."

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.720
 And he shows up to the demons like, "Ahh!"

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.720
 He realizes he's super lame.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.720
 He's like, "Oh man, I thought this guy made Zombies 3."

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.720
 But it was too late.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.720
 The zombie, the dinosaur, what if the demon had already taken the form of Andy Warhol?

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.720
 And he saw how much this little girl loved him, so he's like affecting her life.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.720
 He's basically like making her obsessed over some dead dude.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.720
 And when you're obsessed with someone's accomplishments,

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.720
 do you have your own?

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.720
 You know, there's this source of inspiration, right?

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.720
 I think to look at the people who've inspired me over the years.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.720
 And then I go on and do my own thing.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.720
 I think that's the normal thing, right?

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.720
 You see someone you're like, "Wow, dude, I wish I could be that cool.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.720
 I wish I was the first monster who went to college."

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.720
 And that inspires you on your own journey.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.720
 But people who become obsessed just don't do that.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:01.720
 They're just constantly collecting and consuming something that somebody else has created.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:08.720
 There's nothing wrong with that, but you know the difference between obsession and admiration.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.720
 Or just simply like in a dude.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.720
 Before it seemed to be like, "Yeah, we really like Andy Warhol,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.720
 and we wish we'd met him before."

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.720
 To, "His face is forever emblazoned on my body,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.720
 and I have his dirt from his grave in my bedroom."

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.720
 Like, you know what I mean? Like, that's a bridge too far.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.720
 So maybe this demon is actually draining her energy

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.720
 and only making her focus on the past instead of her own artistic endeavors.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.720
 Or just having a life, right?

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.720
 Just having a normal life.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.720
 It's a fascinating story. Is it true? We don't know, right?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.720
 We really just have this one person's statement,

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.720
 but it's fascinating nonetheless.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.720
 It does track what we know about these type of incantations,

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.720
 summoning spells, stuff like that.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.720
 It does actually make sense.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.720
 It's not completely outlandish, as he said,

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.720
 as he talked about Andy Warhol possessing a young girl,

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.720
 or something pretending to be Andy Warhol, which would be far worse.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.720
 At least if Andy Warhol was in your body, I don't know, maybe you could make more soup.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.720
 Maybe you could go get a job at the Campbell Soup factory and work all the way up to CEO.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.720
 And then at that point, Andy Warhol's ghost flies out of her body and goes,

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.720
 "You're all fired. I'm the soup king now."

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.720
 And they're like, "Ah!"

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:27.720
 And all the other CEOs leave, and then it's just this ghost who's running the Campbell Soup factory.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.720
 Right? That's reasonable. That's reasonable.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.720
 But it also shows that the dangers are messing with the stuff.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.720
 So many times people do this.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.720
 I have a friend who just moved into a new house,

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.720
 and she keeps saying, "I hope it's haunted. I hope it's haunted."

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.720
 And I was like, "Yeah, that'd be cool."

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.720
 And she's like, "Yeah, I hope there's a demon there.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.720
 I hope it would be fun to get possessed."

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.720
 Okay, now you're just nuts.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.720
 "Nah, it would be totally cool."

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.720
 I'm like, "Meghania, knock it off."

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.720
 That's like, what are you just even saying that?

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.720
 She wasn't saying it in jests. She wasn't saying it to rile me up.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.720
 "Nah, it'd be so cool."

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.720
 It's dangerous stuff.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.720
 People watch a couple movies, and they read a couple books,

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.720
 or they read some stuff online, and they go, "I can handle that."

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720
 And it's the same thing.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.720
 Like, people watch "Saving Private Ryan" and go, "Pfft. I can do that."

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.720
 I think my face is blowing off on a beach somewhere.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.720
 You always see yourself as a hero.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.720
 You always see yourself as the triumphant victor.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.720
 But you're messing with dark, dark energy.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.720
 And whether you're summoning forth one of the grand archdemons of hell,

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.720
 or a pop artist from the 60s,

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.720
 you're dealing with dark energy.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.720
 You're dealing with something that you shouldn't be messing with.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.720
 The consequences could be something as basic as losing your friend

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.720
 and developing a lifelong obsession with a dead icon,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.720
 or it could be life-altering events.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.720
 After life-altering events, right?

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.720
 You get possessed so fully by a demon.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.720
 What happens to your own soul?

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.720
 Terrifying story.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.720
 Don't mess with dark energies unless you know what you're doing.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.720
 And the reality is, no human.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.720
 No matter how long they've been studying this,

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:19.720
 no human knows what they're doing when it comes to the dark arts.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.720
