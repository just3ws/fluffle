 British Swim School, make us flash.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.240
 We've all heard the saying snitches get stitches,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.500
 but in the country of Malta, snitches

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.480
 get a monument built to them.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.920
 And then we travel to Ohio to meet a haunted VW bug

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.120
 that has one mission,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 stop teenagers from having sex today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.700
 (upbeat music)

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.200
 (upbeat music)

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.940
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.100
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.180
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.020
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.300
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.340
 I've actually been having a crazy day.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.460
 But before we get into that,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.140
 let's go ahead and introduce our Thanksgiving livestream

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.100
 contributor coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.460
 Everyone give a big round of applause for Allison's wake.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.020
 Yay, Allison's come on in.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.940
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.580
 If you guys can't support the show financially,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.060
 I totally understand, just help spread the word

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.900
 about the show.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.780
 That also really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.500
 Now Allison's wake is bringing us in.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.460
 Allie's set down this big giant box of beef jerky

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.300
 and I'm gonna eat it all.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.620
 Nom, nom, nom, nom.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.180
 I actually just broke fast.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.580
 I took a 48 hour fast that I just broke before.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.660
 Doing the podcast, I wanted to do 72 hours,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.700
 but the other part of my crazy day is

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.820
 I got prescribed all of these steroids

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.900
 for this tooth issue I'm having.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.460
 So I don't know a ton about steroids,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.580
 but I do know you can't take them on an empty stomach.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.580
 So I did break fast at 48 hours.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.060
 And the reason why I'm telling you guys about this,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.900
 I'm flexing on you guys, it's a little bit of a brag.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.540
 But I would like you guys to try fasting.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.620
 Now there's a lot of health benefits to it and stuff.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.580
 You guys know me, I'm not a big health nut.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.260
 That's probably why I constantly need steroids

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.580
 for my body to keep functioning.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.820
 I'm not a big health nut.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.420
 This is the reason why I fast.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.700
 One, I figure it as personal endurance

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.300
 and I like being able to brag.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.180
 I can go two days without eating.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.060
 But secondly, that's what you brag about.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.380
 You have a hit podcast.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.460
 You have a hit podcast

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.180
 and that's what you're going around telling people.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.020
 I think about it this way.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.100
 Alien drop ships appear in the sky.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.780
 (mimics flying)

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.260
 People are blowing up world leaders.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.460
 Please, please, kill the populace, not me.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.040
 I'm famous.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.700
 All these alien foot soldiers

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.780
 are walking through the streets just blasting dudes.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.260
 I will not have to eat for two days.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.700
 Like I can go at least two days I was out walking.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.740
 I did all my normal stuff.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.580
 I was going to work.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.620
 I'm walking everywhere.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.700
 I walked down to the Walmart

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.660
 to get my prescription, all that stuff.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.220
 If I would be able to go two days without eating.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.140
 And I think most people wouldn't.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.100
 And when I say most people,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.740
 I mean most people in like the modern world.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.540
 I know there's a lot of parts of the planet

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.580
 where they don't eat every day,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.700
 but you need to be prepared.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.140
 You need to be prepared

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.140
 when President Joe Biden begs for the aliens

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.980
 not to kill them.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.140
 That may happen.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.300
 So if you're not,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.300
 this is actually like,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.460
 I think Alex Jones is always trying to sell you supplements.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.660
 I'm trying to sell you nothing.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.580
 Literally don't do anything.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.260
 If your diet allows it.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.780
 Obviously I don't want to get accused

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.820
 of killing a bunch of people,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.580
 a diabetes people or something.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.060
 If you can't go two days without fasting medically,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.260
 don't don't don't die please.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.120
 But if it won't kill you, try it.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.340
 I always think it's interesting to see

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.460
 what the human body can do.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.860
 What your human body can do.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.980
 There's my tummy rumbling.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.780
 So I don't know if the microphone picked it up.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.260
 The microphone is sensitive.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
 If you hear lots of noises, that's probably what it is.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.300
 But let's see if you can do it.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.700
 Maybe start off with just a 24 hour fast,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.860
 but dude, 'cause when those aliens start coming

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.060
 when the zombies invade,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.540
 or maybe it'll just be something lame,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.820
 like a civil war or something,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.940
 and a tornado, boo.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.940
 Think about it, right now,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.620
 if something bad happened,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.860
 I wouldn't be immediately looking for food.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.500
 Which is a good thing because I've stated several times

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.060
 on this podcast, pretty much from like episode seven,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.620
 that I'm willing to eat other humans

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.940
 if my back is to the wall.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.140
 So now knowing that I can go at least two days,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.800
 two active days, two new and my normal routine days,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.260
 when no food means if you and I are ever trapped

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.500
 in a scenario, I will not eat you for two days.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.820
 Allison's is super nervous.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.580
 They're bringing in even more beef jerky.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.660
 I don't know, Allison's, you're looking pretty good.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.540
 Ali, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the oars

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.860
 to the dead rabbit robot.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.500
 We're gonna leave behind dead rabbit command.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.940
 We're gonna row all the way out

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.940
 to Malta, splash, splash, rowing all the way out there.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.180
 Long time listeners of Dead Rabbit Radio know that

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.580
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the number one science podcast

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.860
 in El Salvador.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.460
 From time to time, someone else,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.780
 some real science podcast gets rid of us,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.820
 and acts as off the top.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.980
 But generally, we're at least in the top five,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.140
 but a lot of times we're the number one science podcast

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.540
 in El Salvador, another bizarre flex, but I'll take it.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.900
 Well, recently, the country of Malta has jumped up.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.300
 For a while, I was the number one science podcast in Malta,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.700
 so I was like, okay, I already gave my El Salvador bros

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.940
 some respect by doing a story about a man

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.820
 who had sex with a donkey, making a little donkey baby.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.180
 What can I give to my Malta minions?

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.020
 What can I give them?

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.540
 Is there anything going on in Malta

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.460
 that fits the theme of this show?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.500
 We are now in Malta, specifically,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.380
 we're in the town of St. Julian's.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.980
 And it's about like the mid 1700s.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.340
 So get on your old timey clothes,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.900
 like your pantaloons and like your big old hat,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.180
 everything super rule and like itchy and stuff.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.460
 And we're walking down the streets of St. Julian's.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.740
 I take my shirt off 'cause I'm itching too much.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.900
 We're walking around.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.700
 And in between San Juan, not San Juan,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.220
 San Juan and a place called Berquerara,

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.340
 there's, there's a two different neighborhoods.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.460
 There's like this road going in between those two places.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.980
 And one day there's this dude just sitting on the street,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.700
 kind of just hanging out, reading a newspaper.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.380
 Where a newspaper's around at 1700.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.140
 And there's like wood carvings of like people

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.020
 like herding cows and eating wheat,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.260
 whatever made the news back in the 1700s.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.100
 And this dude, so this guy reading the newspaper,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.760
 we're gonna call him Tommy.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.260
 So Tommy's sitting there and he's reading in this newspaper

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.860
 and a guy comes running by.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.700
 (imitates crying)

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.300
 Tommy's like, what in the world was that?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.100
 And he sees this guy kind of running

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.500
 and he ducks down an alley.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.300
 Tommy goes, oh, that's kind of weird.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.540
 But let me go back to reading this giant wood carving.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.500
 And then a couple of minutes later,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.620
 this other guy's kind of like jogging,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.740
 jogging down the road.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.940
 And he sees Tommy reading these wood carvings

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.260
 and he goes, hey, pardon me, sir, pardon me.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.340
 Sorry to interrupt your, your news reading,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.580
 but did you happen to see some dude run by?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.540
 And Tommy thinks about it and he looks down the street

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.980
 and he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.660
 There was some guy like just kind of like

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.420
 distraught, looked like he was in a lot of trouble.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.900
 And the dude standing up, his eyes go from side to side.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.460
 He's like, trouble, I don't know what you're talking about.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.300
 Do you know where he went?

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.180
 Do you know where this man went?

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.220
 Tommy goes, yeah, yeah, he went down the street a bit

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.540
 and then he turned left going down that alleyway.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.180
 Gentleman goes, well, thank you very much for your service,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.720
 sir, I will let you get back to reading the paper.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.500
 The next day, Tommy wakes up,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.460
 oh, he's milking cows and eating wheat

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.220
 and then he gets his picture carved into the newspaper.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.300
 The most exciting man in Malta that day.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.220
 And he's reading the newspaper and he turns

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.220
 and it says, murder.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.660
 He's like, ah, and it says,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.500
 a man was murdered in between San Juan and Burkara

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.260
 down this alleyway.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.820
 And he's like, oh my God, oh my God,

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.820
 I can't believe what happened and he pieces it together.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.420
 He realized what you realized.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.980
 He snitched the dude out.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.300
 This guy was running for his life

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.140
 and he told this other dude where he's at

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.700
 and the dude got stabbed to death in this alleyway.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.140
 And he's like bleeding out and stuff like that.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.860
 And he's like, ah, and he died.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.820
 Now, why Tommy didn't hear the man

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.480
 getting brutally murdered down the street?

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.380
 I don't know.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.940
 There's some questions I have about the story,

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.940
 but this story is so famous in Malta

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.980
 that not only did they build a giant monument,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.540
 you know, in America, at least when there's a car accident,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.140
 they'll put like a little cross in the road,

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.820
 a little wooden cross and teddy bears by it

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.500
 and stuff like that.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.820
 It's like that, but it's made of stone.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.060
 It's permanent.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.020
 It's about 15 feet tall at the top as a crucifix.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.940
 It's this giant pillar.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.180
 And even today, people put like flowers by it.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.980
 People stop and use it as this monument.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.860
 It's called Ratch Mock Ratch.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.640
 You smash, Mock, smash.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.620
 Now, if you are one of my listeners from Malta,

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.780
 you can go ahead and correct me

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.020
 'cause I can guarantee there's some weird letters in there.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.980
 There's some X's in there.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.580
 I don't know if the X is silent,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.900
 but what this means in English,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.900
 this pillar is called,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.900
 I saw, I didn't see, and I heard, I didn't hear.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.720
 So basically, keep your mouth shut.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.700
 If you see something, say nothing.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.980
 The story's very famous.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.280
 The monument's very famous.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.380
 And at one point, you kind of think,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.580
 maybe this is an urban legend.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.500
 Maybe this pillar was here

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.740
 and someone made up the story behind it.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.700
 No, this is very well known in Malta culture.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.540
 There's actually a pop song about it

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.820
 written by a dude named Tony Camilleri.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.000
 And the name of the song was I Don't See, I Don't Hear.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.140
 And it just basically is like,

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.060
 here, let me read you some of the lyrics.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.620
 I live in punishment.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.700
 I live because I did not control my tongue.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.980
 I didn't see it.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.380
 I didn't hear it.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.860
 This is the warning written on the wall.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.140
 I didn't see it.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.500
 I didn't hear it.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.260
 See what you see, hear what you hear.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.180
 Don't talk to anyone.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.660
 Don't talk to anyone.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.980
 I don't think a rapper could write stronger snitches,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.820
 get stitches there.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.060
 And he didn't get the stitches.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.940
 The other dude got stitches.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.220
 It's weird because the moral of the story

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.640
 is keep your mouth shut.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.780
 Which generally in societies like in America and Britain,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.620
 they have that whole,

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.860
 if you see something, say something.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.140
 This is the opposite, right?

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.140
 But it is ingrained into that culture.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.980
 If you see something, maybe just,

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.580
 maybe just don't tell anyone.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.060
 Really fascinating story.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.740
 And it's like, I was looking up like true crime in Malta.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.340
 And this was one of the ones that popped up a lot.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.300
 The murder of this man.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.740
 And the lesson is keep your mouth shut.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.060
 For me, I grew up in bad neighborhoods, right?

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.980
 Snitches get stitches, wasn't just a phrase.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.020
 It was an actual thing you have to worry about.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.540
 And I always saw it like this.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.380
 'Cause it was so funny, 'cause my friends are like,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.940
 dude, we just can't tell when,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.100
 we can't tell what your view is on law enforcement.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.740
 My view always was, 'cause there have been time,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.820
 I remember once this dude took this little girl hostage

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.260
 and they were doing this hostage situation.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.260
 It was like, where was this?

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.020
 It was in Art and Fair, I think, out in Sacramento.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.780
 And the cops had surrounded the apartment complex.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.820
 They were there for two days.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.380
 Everyone was watching it on the news.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.300
 And I go, you know what?

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.980
 Those cops must be awfully thirsty.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.460
 So I went and got like two or three, 24 packs of soda.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.340
 I got two 24 packs of soda and a 24 pack of water.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.740
 And I pulled up to the line of where all the police were.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.940
 And I went to go give them the sodas.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.060
 And the officer goes, oh, I appreciate that.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.580
 I think he took some waters.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.900
 He goes, I appreciate that, but we solved it.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.740
 Everything's good.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.980
 And I was like, oh, okay.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.300
 And then as I'm driving home, the radio was like,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.620
 the police, what they did was they got a sniper

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.420
 and they were able to have all the infrared stuff

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.340
 to see through the wall.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.740
 I mean, he was holding like a three-year-old girl hostage

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.580
 for like two days.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.860
 And the sniper shot a bullet right through the wall

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.540
 and blew his head off right in front of the kid.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.980
 I mean, the kid was gonna be traumatized either way,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.340
 but they shot him through the wall.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.420
 They could see him through the wall.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.780
 And so yeah, they didn't need sodas.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.940
 They're all going home to their family.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.740
 So on that, like nobody's pro holding

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.380
 three-year-old kids hostage.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.740
 But there's other, I had other interactions with the police

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.340
 that were far less friendly overall.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.620
 So my goal, my always goal was this,

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.540
 is that I think it's wrong to snitch.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.340
 If you're part of a criminal enterprise

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.140
 and you get caught and snitching reduces your sentence,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.660
 you're gonna get stitches.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.820
 If you're part of a criminal enterprise

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.940
 and you're making money off of that criminal enterprise,

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.420
 but they start blowing you off

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.620
 or they start sleeping with your girlfriend

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.380
 or something dumb and you snitch on them,

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.100
 snitches get stitches, that's on you.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.700
 If you're a civilian,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.780
 if you're outside of an organization

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.100
 or you have nothing to do with the money making

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.300
 and you're driving home and you see a crime,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.460
 that to me was never snitches get stitches.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.260
 Now that depended on the,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.860
 depended on the particular gangster

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.740
 who was involved in that situation.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.580
 For me, snitches get stitches is that,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.780
 where you're working with them.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.340
 There are other times I've obviously dealt

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.660
 with law enforcement because I see someone doing this,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.220
 someone doing that, what was it,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.140
 probably a couple weeks ago,

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.540
 some dudes were beating some woman up

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.540
 and some dude, some random guy outside a bar.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.060
 I called the cops, I'm 45 years old.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.020
 I'm not gonna go out there

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.780
 and tussle with a bunch of 19 year olds,

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.300
 a bunch of drunk 19 year olds in the middle of the street.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.140
 I'm not gonna do that.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.620
 I walk outside, these guys are beating up this dude

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.740
 and this girl, the dude and the girl

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.220
 are holding their own honestly

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.820
 and I just doot doot, hello, yeah, this is,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.820
 they know me, the cops know me, yeah, this is Jason,

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.900
 hey, I got a fight, oh nevermind,

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.180
 everyone's getting in their car,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:24.940
 blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.100
 and then I talked to the girls for a bit

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.020
 and that was that.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.460
 So I don't consider that snitches get stitches.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.500
 That's something where I think you could easily say,

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.420
 you see something say something like that.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.260
 It's always a tricky thing though.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.820
 I also know, I've never been,

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.700
 this has never happened to me,

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.140
 but I also know of people who have snitched

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.100
 and they did not work out well for him.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.540
 I actually know of people,

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.300
 I gotta be careful how much they talk about this,

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.140
 but I actually know of people whose family members snitched

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.620
 and they had to like quit their job and move away.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.320
 Like I'm hanging out with this dude

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.300
 and a relative of his snitched

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.900
 and this dude was like, hey dude, I'll see you later

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.020
 or never again, like I have to leave the state.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.940
 I was like, hey, what's going on?

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.060
 And he told me this crazy story

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.620
 about how his buddy, how his relative did this

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.380
 and then went to the police about this

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.620
 and then him and his family were in danger

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.620
 to the point that they had to leave.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.460
 People were trying to actively kill them,

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.900
 like actively kill them 'cause something that is real.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.980
 So it's always an interesting,

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.020
 I mean, when you're on the outside it's interesting.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.660
 I hope that friend of mine is doing fine,

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.520
 but yeah, that was years ago, that was years ago.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.140
 So yes, snitches get stitches is a famous, famous phrase

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.620
 and in Malta it's the opposite, keep your mouth shut.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.980
 It's just an interesting story, it's keep your mouth shut

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.580
 and that's not what your government would want.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.080
 I'm surprised this story is still around.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.320
 It seems counterintuitive that the government

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.540
 would want to keep this story around.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.540
 But, Alison's, I'm gonna give you the keys

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.100
 of the carbon helicopter, we're leaving behind.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.900
 Malta, we're headed all the way out to Ohio.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.020
 (imitates engine revving)

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.980
 And as we're headed out there,

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.540
 I wanna do a really, really quick dead rabbit recommends.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.780
 Speaking of alien evasions,

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.980
 this is what kind of why I was thinking

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.380
 about alien evasions.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.820
 I watched the Doughbuss movie,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.420
 I've watched a lot of great movies recently.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.980
 This one I just watched like two days ago

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.580
 and it jumped to the top of my list of movies

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.980
 I wanted to talk about.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.680
 It's a Netflix exclusive,

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.740
 it's a Netflix exclusive movie starring Michael Pina,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.980
 who's been in like everything.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.900
 He's just this great character actor,

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.100
 he's been in a ton of movies.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.740
 It's called Extinction.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.660
 And it's, I love alien invasion movies when they're done right.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.180
 Same thing I love about zombie movies or pandemic movies

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.420
 'cause it's about the end of the world,

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.820
 asteroids coming down, all this type of stuff

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.420
 and how people are dealing with the end of the world.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.900
 And it's a great alien invasion movie with a twist.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.940
 Michael Pina is kind of like a dad

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.820
 on the cusp of a failing marriage,

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.020
 his kids don't like him.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.540
 He works at like some CERN type laboratory

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.420
 as like an engineer.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:07.420
 And he begins to have dreams, visions of an alien invasion.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.700
 He keeps seeing people just getting shot in the streets

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.260
 and all these drop ships coming down in the cities

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.140
 and people just getting gunned down.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.260
 And he's at work and he has a vision of himself

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.940
 like beating someone to death with his hands.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.620
 He's having these horrible visions about the future.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.940
 And his wife is just like,

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.780
 "Listen, you're just going crazy.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.860
 Please, please get this treated.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.700
 Me and the kids can't deal with this anymore."

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.700
 So he goes to the psychiatrist's office

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.060
 and while he's in the office,

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.620
 there's another patient sitting next to him there

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.980
 and they're like in the waiting room.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.940
 And the other dude turns to Michael Pina

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.220
 and goes, "You're not crazy.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.740
 I see the aliens too.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.780
 I've seen the visions and they're coming."

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.140
 And you're like, "Oh, dude, this movie's really dope."

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.980
 Because not only is it a really tight alien invasion movie,

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.780
 it goes, it's like an hour and a half long,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.560
 but it moves so quickly.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.780
 Not only is it a really good alien invasion movie,

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.740
 you have the mystery is how does he know the future?

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.340
 And I'll tell you right now, as I was watching,

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.780
 I was like, "Oh, I hope it's not that

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.820
 this is also a vision and he's going to wake up

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.580
 and he's like, "Oh, now I know what's going to happen."

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.540
 Like invasion from Mars or something like that.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.680
 No, it's not a twist that it's all a dream.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.820
 You have this really cool alien invasion movie

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.260
 where they are gunning people down on the streets.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.340
 It is like block by block alien invasion

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.900
 mixed with the mystery.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.180
 How does he know, how did he know this was going to happen?

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.340
 Really, really tight movie.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.980
 It reminded me of a short science fiction story

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.060
 that I would have read some Saturday afternoon

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:35.980
 when I was a teenager.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.820
 Like I, it's such a good sci-fi adventure.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.980
 It's actually quite grim.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.300
 I don't know if I'd call it an adventure,

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.500
 but Dead Rabbit recommends extinction on Netflix.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.480
 Really, really recommend that movie.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.980
 I said recently that the export's been putting out

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.240
 a lot of quality stuff and they have.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.060
 The guy who's writing the story had an uncle.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.900
 When he was growing up,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.500
 he had a great uncle who would always tell him

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.220
 about local urban legends.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.900
 And where we're at is in Buckeye Lake, Ohio.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.380
 And he goes, "My uncle would tell me stuff

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.060
 like Crybaby Bridge.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.220
 That's a very typical story.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.420
 We've covered stuff like that on the show before.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.260
 The Grass Man of Ohio,

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.060
 which is basically like a Bigfoot type of creature.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.300
 All these local urban legends."

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:25.300
 And there was one story that this poster had heard

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.840
 that intrigued him for years.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.980
 And he actually tried finding more information on it.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.460
 He could never get any more info on it.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.580
 He goes, "I kind of think that my great uncle

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.700
 might have made it up, but I don't know."

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.580
 He goes, "It's so weird that,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.420
 and I can't find any proof of any of it,

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.820
 so maybe my uncle made it up."

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.460
 But he also knew all about all these other urban legends.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.860
 Why would he make this one up

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.580
 if all the other ones could be traced to something?

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.140
 Back in the late 1950s in the town of Mount Vernon,

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:59.140
 a bright blue Volkswagen Beetle comes driving into town.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.220
 (mimics engine)

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.220
 And inside this Beetle was a father, we'll call him Jake,

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.180
 and his daughter, we'll call her Alyssa,

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.380
 and they're driving down the road.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.260
 The relationship between Jake and Alyssa

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.180
 was so stereotypical, is so cliche, but it is realistic.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.900
 He was a devout Christian man who ruled the house, right?

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.580
 A man's home is his castle,

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.260
 and everyone has to do what he says,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.540
 and he follows the one boss, the big boss in the sky.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.300
 He is a devout Christian.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.340
 She is a rebellious teenager.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.460
 She wants to dress how she dresses

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.860
 and listen to the music what she wants to listen to.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.740
 She's like, "I wanna listen to Chuck Berry."

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.100
 He's like, "Oh, that's so rebellious."

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.740
 And she wants to date who she wants to date.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.540
 Now the one person that united this family is passed away.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.140
 This is like a real life, the righteous gemstones.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.500
 They no longer have this unifying force.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.700
 You just have two people that are on different paths.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.100
 But the rebellious girl is living with her dad

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.340
 and my house, my rules, Jake always said.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.820
 So they would constantly fight.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.100
 She wasn't gonna follow the rules,

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.220
 but she also couldn't afford to get her own place.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.180
 They were constantly fighting.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.940
 It was a house full of torment.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.900
 And it came to a head when the father,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.500
 one day, found out that Alyssa was dating

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.900
 a 20-something year old man.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.220
 He flips out.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.120
 Jake totally flips out because, listen,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.340
 you know this is a recipe for disaster.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.380
 The dude's not gonna stick around.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.540
 At best, he's just gonna break your heart.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.180
 At worst, he's gonna knock you up.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.360
 It's gonna be this huge thing.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.900
 So Jake forbids his daughter from ever seeing this guy again.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.780
 And Alyssa, in the throes of teenage love, doesn't care.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.700
 Doesn't listen to the dad.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.540
 She needs to keep being with this dude, right?

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.940
 Which is the dumb decision.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.960
 But again, very, very cliche

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.220
 because it happens all the time.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.100
 Jake actually thinks that it's solved though.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.160
 He think he actually got through to his daughter.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.460
 But one day when he was rummaging

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.980
 through her room, apparently,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.340
 he finds a pair of men's boxers

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.460
 kind of stuffed away in the back of her closet.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.900
 So Alyssa's at school and Jake is enraged.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.380
 He can't believe that this is a crime.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.460
 Even in the 1950s, I'm pretty sure

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.300
 you weren't allowed to be 25 years old

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.340
 dating a 15-year-old.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.280
 I'm not for sure, but I hope it was against the law.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.420
 He decides to confront this boyfriend.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.260
 So while Alyssa's at school, he jumps in his bright blue beetle

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.180
 and Jake is driving through town,

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.260
 going to this boy's house.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.900
 He's going to probably kill this guy

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.660
 for sleeping with his teenage daughter.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.420
 But he doesn't get the opportunity to.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.340
 He doesn't get the sweet, sweet satisfaction

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.020
 of strangling a man who did you wrong.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.060
 On his way to this boyfriend's house,

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.380
 he blows through a stoplight.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:55.080
 The truck slams into him and he dies at the scene.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.740
 Police show up, "Meow, meow, meow."

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.980
 Taking reports, ambulance shows up, "Meow, meow, meow."

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.180
 They're like, "What are we supposed to do?

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.140
 "He's dead, I don't know, we're throwing him in the gurney."

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.060
 So they put him in the gurney and then the tow truck shows up,

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.860
 "Eat, eat, eat."

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.980
 And they take their wreckage of the blue beetle

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.820
 to like a holding area and then eventually to a scrap yard

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.500
 where they're like, "Put it in the box thing."

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.100
 It's not really good people who work at the scrap yard.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.540
 They don't know what anything's called.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.040
 The workers are like, "What is the box thing?"

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.280
 They just tumble the car around

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.000
 till they get to the compactor.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.840
 That's what I meant.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.560
 They're like, "That makes more sense."

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.720
 (mimics car engine revving)

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.680
 And the blue beetle's getting crushed.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.720
 Until it's now like a little cube and hoisted up.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.440
 Put the cube, put the cube on the box.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.280
 They're like, "Dude, quick, call in stuff boxes.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.240
 "Everything's a box.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.920
 "Stuff gets turned into boxes here.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.440
 "You're fired, you can't work here anymore."

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.240
 So the blue beetle is crushed to bits

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.900
 and the story of Alyssa,

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.700
 we never really know what happens to her.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.980
 Did she stay with her boyfriend?

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.660
 Was she overcome with emotion at the loss of her father?

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.260
 Does she decide to dedicate her life to Christ?

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.780
 We don't know any of this stuff

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.740
 because that would be an involved character development

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.820
 and human interest.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.860
 Instead, the story goes like this.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.460
 Couple weeks later, these two teenagers

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.260
 are making out in the woods near Mount Vernon.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.460
 Mm, well, ooh, Terry, you're so sexy.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.580
 Oh, thank you, Bruce.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.960
 (imitates kissing)

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.080
 They're kissing.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.880
 And they see some headlights in the distance

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.240
 and they're like, "Oh, maybe that's the cops

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.080
 "coming to break us up."

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.920
 And then they go, "Wait a second."

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.480
 No, because unless the cops

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.400
 started driving Volkswagen bugs,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.240
 it's not the cops.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.440
 And they're looking at this blue Volkswagen beetle

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.600
 sitting on the road and then it starts going.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.680
 (imitates engine revving)

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.280
 And it starts driving on the road towards them.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.200
 Now I used to have a Volkswagen bug.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.840
 They're very iconic cars, they're very fuel efficient.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.340
 They are not knowing for their speediness, though.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.740
 But these teenagers claim that they were chased

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.140
 through the forest, through the forest, no paved road.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.540
 The car begins to chase them through the forest.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.660
 And they're like, "Ah, this Volkswagen bug."

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.060
 (imitates engine revving)

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.500
 He's like going, he's like driving over roots

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.860
 and it's a little goalies and stuff like that.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.260
 But they report to the police, we were making out,

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.060
 and a car chased us through the woods.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.260
 And the police are like, "Okay, that's weird.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.780
 "We'll put that down on our paperwork,

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.960
 "but hope that doesn't happen to you again."

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.520
 I actually did probably investigate it a little bit more

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.600
 than that, they're like, "What?

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.560
 "Attempted kidnapping, we'll all write that down,

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.160
 "but hopefully it doesn't happen again."

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.640
 Stories start to spread around town

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.560
 of teenagers in their bedroom.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.840
 Oh, my parents are out of town, Johnny.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.680
 You wanna get to third base?

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.200
 He's like, "Well, that's really aggressive.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.240
 "Do you know what third base actually means?"

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.080
 She's like, "I do, I do."

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.780
 And she starts undressing.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.720
 Do you guys know what third base is?

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.160
 It's up there, called third base for a reason.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.900
 As she begins undressing, she begins taking off her bra

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.660
 and then she's trying to show off her headlights,

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.880
 but instead headlights illuminate the room from outside.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.360
 Ah, it's blinding.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.300
 And the guy would look out the window

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.520
 and there would be a bright blue Volkswagen bug

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.040
 sitting in the street, it's headlights shining

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.880
 on the teenagers.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.500
 Ah, cut it out, man, cut it out.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.460
 I'm trying to have sex with this chick.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.960
 It starts happening all over town.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.360
 Teenagers start saying whenever I start taking my clothes off

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.600
 before I'm about to make some whoopee, headlights appear

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.000
 through the window and I look outside

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.920
 and there's this bright blue Volkswagen bug.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.920
 Teenagers start reporting the blue bug

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.720
 following them around town,

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.680
 whether they're driving with their snuggle bunny

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.080
 or just walking down the street holding hands.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.860
 Bright blue Volkswagen bug behind them.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.560
 And then there are some that say that this car

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.420
 is not a simple voyeur, it's not just tracking down

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.700
 these people or slowly pursuing them through the forest

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.860
 as fast as a Volkswagen bug can drive through a forest.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.300
 People start to realize that teens are going missing

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.360
 in the town of Mount Vernon.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.420
 Now, some of them you could chalk up to runaway,

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.900
 some of them you could chalk up to them just going on,

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.580
 getting tired of their home, joining the military, whatever.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.780
 But there are some who say that the blue beetle itself

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:18.780
 was kidnapping and killing young teenage lovers.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:24.140
 The story is known as the sex-hating Volkswagen

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.840
 of Mount Vernon, Ohio.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.940
 It's interesting because the way that the story

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.460
 was presented to us again was,

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.460
 I don't know if this story is true,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.960
 but all these other stories my great uncle told me,

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.600
 I was able to find verification of.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.060
 It would be one thing if he was like,

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.340
 and that was the time I stopped the leprechaun

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.380
 from ending World War II.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.500
 If he was making stuff up,

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.340
 you think you'd have more made up stuff.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.580
 So the legend may be true in the sense that the great uncle

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.420
 didn't make it up, that he had simply heard it

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.820
 as an urban legend himself,

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.540
 but even going one step further

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.820
 in the world of the paranormal, this makes sense.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.380
 This is something that could happen

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.620
 in the world of the paranormal

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.460
 because it's really fascinating.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.580
 'Cause what we have is a vengeful spirit.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.820
 The father who was trying,

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.980
 really what he was trying to do,

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.740
 yeah, he was probably a little overbearing,

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.700
 but at the end of the day,

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.940
 he was trying to save his daughter.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.460
 She was in a relationship with a much, much older man

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.540
 who was taking advantage of her, right?

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.980
 So despite that he might have come down a little heavy,

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.100
 and he wasn't gonna murder the guy,

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.140
 we have a man who feels like he has to do this

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.740
 to take care of his family,

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.500
 and he dies in that rage, he dies in that moment.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.420
 So a vengeful spirit, a wraith,

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.340
 totally fits with Ghost Lore as we know it.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.620
 And if the car itself,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.980
 the mechanical structure of the car

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.620
 was possessed by a ghost, we see that as well,

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:49.980
 not necessarily with cars,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.780
 but we see dolls possessed by ghost

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.660
 and paintings possessed by ghost.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.020
 I have a friend who says that her lamp

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.300
 is possessed by a ghost.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.180
 It's not really her lamp, she bought it from a thrift store.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.300
 But the point is, is that the idea of a ghost

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.860
 possessing an inanimate object is very, very accepted

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.180
 within the Paranormal Lore.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.300
 But remember this car was destroyed.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.700
 This is a really interesting story

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.420
 'cause we have a vengeful spirit

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.420
 taking the form of the car.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.740
 It was almost like he had infused the physical being

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.580
 of this vehicle with his rage.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.940
 So when he returned to Earth as the spirit,

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.740
 it wasn't him just walking around town,

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.380
 which to be honest, wouldn't be super intimidating.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.220
 I mean, okay, if I was trying to have sex in the woods

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.020
 with some hot chick and some dude starts walking towards me,

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.780
 I'm gonna run, I'm gonna get her,

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.700
 I take her, I take her and I run away.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.140
 But it'd be far more scary, right?

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.140
 To be chased by a, maybe not chased by a Volkswagen bug,

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.660
 but chased by a car.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.140
 Remember that old movie Wraith?

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.140
 What's kind of about that?

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.100
 It was about the guy who died in the car accident

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.780
 and then drove around running people over.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.940
 It was a really good movie.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.780
 Who was in it?

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.940
 Like Richard Greco or Robert Downey Jr. or somebody?

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.180
 Anyways, you did have recommends Wraith.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.580
 I saw it when I was 12, maybe it's the holds up.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.620
 The idea of a ghost taking the form of a car,

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.900
 chasing people down, this all fits with the lore.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.040
 So while the story may have been made up,

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.940
 it's possible that it was real.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.140
 And when we go back to the 1950s,

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.060
 if this was something that teenagers were reporting,

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.540
 obviously it sounds really, really dumb.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.580
 So no parent is going to take this seriously.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.740
 And actually now that I think about it,

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.140
 they wouldn't be reporting this, right?

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.380
 Like the couple in the woods would have told the authorities

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.580
 'cause they were almost killed,

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.420
 but no one's going to be like,

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.980
 "Mom, mom, you won't believe what happened

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.300
 when me and Johnny were trying to have sex last night."

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.940
 And she's like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.780
 what?

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.340
 You would, this would be spreading from teenager to teenager."

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.660
 That's how the story would be being told.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.580
 So it's possible that this poster's great uncle

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.220
 was a teenager at this time and was hearing these stories.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.180
 It wouldn't be something you would announce to the world

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.920
 'cause all of these kids are doing something

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.980
 that they shouldn't be doing, right?

00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.860
 Trying to have sex.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.260
 I mean, I'm not saying sex is bad,

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.660
 but obviously teenagers, the longer you can postpone

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.180
 having sex, the better off you're going to be.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.780
 Especially if there's a killer car on the loose.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.380
 So the point is is that you could have this phantom

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.620
 in this form of this car stalking the city of Mount Vernon,

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.540
 trying to stop teenagers from having sex.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.540
 And if we accept the story as true

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.940
 and it does fit into Ghost Lore,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.420
 it's possible the VW bug is still out there.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.780
 Roman these streets, if this is a super obscure story,

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.820
 it would be one of those things.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.180
 It's kind of the plot of Nightmare on Elm Street, right?

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.460
 They erased all knowledge of Freddie Kruger.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.540
 And that was fine for about 30 years,

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.900
 but then the kids started having dreams about this guy

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.660
 and asking, "Who's Freddie Kruger?"

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.900
 The parents were like, "Uh."

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.060
 So it's possible that this legend did happen

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.060
 and people just forgot about it.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.220
 It was whispered among teens and then they grew up

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.780
 and then they go, "Oh, maybe that wasn't real."

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.780
 I always do wonder what happened to Tiffany.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.900
 She went missing that one day, but I don't know.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.740
 Go about me.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.340
 That's the cop investigating the crime.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.860
 I don't know, someone else will figure it out.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.060
 Everyone moves on with their life,

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.260
 but this Volkswagen bug is still out there.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.580
 Looking for teenagers about to have sex,

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.260
 trying to skier them off.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:17.540
 But when that fails, trying to chase them off.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.300
 And when that fails, killing them.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.100
 So next time you're driving down the road

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.380
 on the way to your special loved one's house,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.780
 you got a box of condoms.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.340
 You're very, very optimistic.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.340
 You have a box of condoms in your glove compartment

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.700
 and you're driving over to your special lady's house.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.260
 Make sure to check in that rear view mirror.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.300
 See if you're being followed.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.500
 Look in that rear view mirror

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.940
 'cause there might be a set of headlights behind you.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.540
 But it's just the mailman.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.100
 For some reason he's delivering mail

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.260
 so you're late at night and he passes you and go, "Whew."

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.460
 And then you get to her house

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.580
 and you bring in a shopping bag full of condoms

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.900
 and you set them down on the table.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.300
 "Honey, I'm home."

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.500
 And she's like, "Ooh."

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.780
 And then you see some headlights outside your window

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.740
 and you're like, "Ugh."

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.740
 And you look out and it's old farmer John on his tractor

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.740
 just going by.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.900
 You're like, "What, that's weird."

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.420
 (imitates engine revving)

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.700
 Tractor, noises.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.620
 And then you go to the bedroom with your lovely lady

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.460
 and you're like, "Hey."

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.980
 You know what third basis I heard in a podcast

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.260
 and not entirely for sure.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.540
 And she goes, "Take me."

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.980
 And she throws herself down on the bed.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.060
 And right when you get on top of your lovely lady

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.740
 to make sweet, sweet, passionate love to her,

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.700
 you hear the closet door creak open.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.260
 (imitates door creaking)

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.020
 And you turn and the cat walks out of the closet.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.340
 You're like, "You're like,

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.780
 "I need to stop listening to this paranormal podcast

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.100
 "before I have sex with my girlfriend."

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.580
 'Cause obviously I'm very, very paranoid.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.660
 And you were able to make sweet love with your girlfriend

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.860
 and everything's great.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.500
 And you go through the bag

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.340
 and then you go to the store to buy some more condoms

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.180
 and then you run out of those.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:57.140
 And then eventually it's dawn, it's three weeks later

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.940
 and you've been late for work, you've been fired.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.340
 And you're walking out to your car

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.420
 and you're driving home with a big smile on your face.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.220
 And you see another set of headlights behind you

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.580
 and you're like, "Oh, that's probably just the mailman

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.620
 "or the tractor or the cat."

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.660
 But instead it's a bright blue Volkswagen bug.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.380
 You might not be a teenager.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.140
 You might not be having illicit sex

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.060
 with someone you shouldn't be with.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.660
 But to a vengeful spirit from beyond the grave,

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.500
 those are just trivialities.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.620
 You have now run afoul

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.980
 of the sex-hating Volkswagen bug.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.380
 There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.580
 It will get you.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.660
 It will take you away to the bad place.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:46.300
 Soon you find yourself freezing cold

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.660
 in a junkyard made out of desiccated human remains.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.660
 You're like, "Wow, this escalated fast."

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.140
 And as the compactor starts to press in on you,

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.780
 "Ugh, no, no, I wanna live longer.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.660
 "Ugh, let me get laid at least 10 more times."

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.500
 "Ugh, pfft."

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:08.020
 And as the very last thing that pops is your eyeball.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.060
 You have one eyeball and right before it pops,

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.620
 you see a Volkswagen bug.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.020
 It's like Lightning McQueen.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.260
 It's operating the gears of the compactor

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.580
 with its wheel hands.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.700
 It's like, "Gotta go fast."

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.780
 "Errrgh."

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.020
 And then the eyeball gets squished and you're totally dead.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.540
 You became the latest victim

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.820
 of the sex-hating Volkswagen bug.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:31.780
 If it existed, it still exists.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.820
 If it was a vengeful ghost

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.380
 trying to prevent people from having sex,

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.500
 it's still continuing that mission to this day.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.260
 The only question is, will you become its next victim?

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.580
 Or will you abstain from sex forever?

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.180
 The choice.

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.340
 The choice is yours.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.540

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.980
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.140
 Have a great one, guys.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.720
 (upbeat music)

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.300
 (upbeat music)

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.960
 This is the story of a daughter of handstands,

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.040
 lemonade stands, and first corsages,

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.520
 and that perfect driver's license picture.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.960
 Travelers, this is Carlos.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.760
 - Someone just hit my car.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.040
 - Is everyone okay?

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.920
 Are you safe?

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.880
 It's also the story of an insurance company

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.520
 that believes people always come first.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.800
 If it matters to you,

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.000
 traveler's insurance will help protect it.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.320
 Travelers, it's better under the umbrella.
