 British Swim School, make us flash.

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,240
 We've all heard the saying snitches get stitches,

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,500
 but in the country of Malta, snitches

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,480
 get a monument built to them.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,920
 And then we travel to Ohio to meet a haunted VW bug

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,120
 that has one mission,

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,120
 stop teenagers from having sex today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,700
 (upbeat music)

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,200
 (upbeat music)

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,940
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,100
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,180
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

24
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,020
 I'm having a great day.

25
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,300
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,340
 I've actually been having a crazy day.

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,460
 But before we get into that,

28
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,140
 let's go ahead and introduce our Thanksgiving livestream

29
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,100
 contributor coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,460
 Everyone give a big round of applause for Allison's wake.

31
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,020
 Yay, Allison's come on in.

32
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,940
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

33
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,580
 If you guys can't support the show financially,

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,060
 I totally understand, just help spread the word

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,900
 about the show.

36
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,780
 That also really, really helps out a lot.

37
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,500
 Now Allison's wake is bringing us in.

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,460
 Allie's set down this big giant box of beef jerky

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,300
 and I'm gonna eat it all.

40
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,620
 Nom, nom, nom, nom.

41
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,180
 I actually just broke fast.

42
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,580
 I took a 48 hour fast that I just broke before.

43
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,660
 Doing the podcast, I wanted to do 72 hours,

44
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,700
 but the other part of my crazy day is

45
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,820
 I got prescribed all of these steroids

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,900
 for this tooth issue I'm having.

47
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,460
 So I don't know a ton about steroids,

48
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,580
 but I do know you can't take them on an empty stomach.

49
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,580
 So I did break fast at 48 hours.

50
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,060
 And the reason why I'm telling you guys about this,

51
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,900
 I'm flexing on you guys, it's a little bit of a brag.

52
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,540
 But I would like you guys to try fasting.

53
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,620
 Now there's a lot of health benefits to it and stuff.

54
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,580
 You guys know me, I'm not a big health nut.

55
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,260
 That's probably why I constantly need steroids

56
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,580
 for my body to keep functioning.

57
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,820
 I'm not a big health nut.

58
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,420
 This is the reason why I fast.

59
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,700
 One, I figure it as personal endurance

60
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,300
 and I like being able to brag.

61
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,180
 I can go two days without eating.

62
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,060
 But secondly, that's what you brag about.

63
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,380
 You have a hit podcast.

64
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,460
 You have a hit podcast

65
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,180
 and that's what you're going around telling people.

66
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,020
 I think about it this way.

67
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,100
 Alien drop ships appear in the sky.

68
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,780
 (mimics flying)

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,260
 People are blowing up world leaders.

70
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,460
 Please, please, kill the populace, not me.

71
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,040
 I'm famous.

72
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,700
 All these alien foot soldiers

73
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,780
 are walking through the streets just blasting dudes.

74
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,260
 I will not have to eat for two days.

75
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,700
 Like I can go at least two days I was out walking.

76
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,740
 I did all my normal stuff.

77
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,580
 I was going to work.

78
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,620
 I'm walking everywhere.

79
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,700
 I walked down to the Walmart

80
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,660
 to get my prescription, all that stuff.

81
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,220
 If I would be able to go two days without eating.

82
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,140
 And I think most people wouldn't.

83
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,100
 And when I say most people,

84
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,740
 I mean most people in like the modern world.

85
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,540
 I know there's a lot of parts of the planet

86
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,580
 where they don't eat every day,

87
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,700
 but you need to be prepared.

88
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,140
 You need to be prepared

89
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,140
 when President Joe Biden begs for the aliens

90
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,980
 not to kill them.

91
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,140
 That may happen.

92
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,300
 So if you're not,

93
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
 this is actually like,

94
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,460
 I think Alex Jones is always trying to sell you supplements.

95
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,660
 I'm trying to sell you nothing.

96
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,580
 Literally don't do anything.

97
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,260
 If your diet allows it.

98
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,780
 Obviously I don't want to get accused

99
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,820
 of killing a bunch of people,

100
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,580
 a diabetes people or something.

101
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,060
 If you can't go two days without fasting medically,

102
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,260
 don't don't don't die please.

103
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,120
 But if it won't kill you, try it.

104
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,340
 I always think it's interesting to see

105
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,460
 what the human body can do.

106
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,860
 What your human body can do.

107
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,980
 There's my tummy rumbling.

108
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,780
 So I don't know if the microphone picked it up.

109
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,260
 The microphone is sensitive.

110
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
 If you hear lots of noises, that's probably what it is.

111
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,300
 But let's see if you can do it.

112
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,700
 Maybe start off with just a 24 hour fast,

113
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,860
 but dude, 'cause when those aliens start coming

114
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,060
 when the zombies invade,

115
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,540
 or maybe it'll just be something lame,

116
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,820
 like a civil war or something,

117
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,940
 and a tornado, boo.

118
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,940
 Think about it, right now,

119
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,620
 if something bad happened,

120
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,860
 I wouldn't be immediately looking for food.

121
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,500
 Which is a good thing because I've stated several times

122
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,060
 on this podcast, pretty much from like episode seven,

123
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,620
 that I'm willing to eat other humans

124
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,940
 if my back is to the wall.

125
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,140
 So now knowing that I can go at least two days,

126
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,800
 two active days, two new and my normal routine days,

127
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,260
 when no food means if you and I are ever trapped

128
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,500
 in a scenario, I will not eat you for two days.

129
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,820
 Allison's is super nervous.

130
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,580
 They're bringing in even more beef jerky.

131
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,660
 I don't know, Allison's, you're looking pretty good.

132
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,540
 Ali, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the oars

133
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,860
 to the dead rabbit robot.

134
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,500
 We're gonna leave behind dead rabbit command.

135
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,940
 We're gonna row all the way out

136
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,940
 to Malta, splash, splash, rowing all the way out there.

137
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,180
 Long time listeners of Dead Rabbit Radio know that

138
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,580
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the number one science podcast

139
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,860
 in El Salvador.

140
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,460
 From time to time, someone else,

141
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,780
 some real science podcast gets rid of us,

142
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,820
 and acts as off the top.

143
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,980
 But generally, we're at least in the top five,

144
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,140
 but a lot of times we're the number one science podcast

145
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,540
 in El Salvador, another bizarre flex, but I'll take it.

146
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,900
 Well, recently, the country of Malta has jumped up.

147
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,300
 For a while, I was the number one science podcast in Malta,

148
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,700
 so I was like, okay, I already gave my El Salvador bros

149
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,940
 some respect by doing a story about a man

150
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,820
 who had sex with a donkey, making a little donkey baby.

151
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,180
 What can I give to my Malta minions?

152
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,020
 What can I give them?

153
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,540
 Is there anything going on in Malta

154
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,460
 that fits the theme of this show?

155
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,500
 We are now in Malta, specifically,

156
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,380
 we're in the town of St. Julian's.

157
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,980
 And it's about like the mid 1700s.

158
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,340
 So get on your old timey clothes,

159
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,900
 like your pantaloons and like your big old hat,

160
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,180
 everything super rule and like itchy and stuff.

161
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,460
 And we're walking down the streets of St. Julian's.

162
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,740
 I take my shirt off 'cause I'm itching too much.

163
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,900
 We're walking around.

164
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,700
 And in between San Juan, not San Juan,

165
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,220
 San Juan and a place called Berquerara,

166
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,340
 there's, there's a two different neighborhoods.

167
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,460
 There's like this road going in between those two places.

168
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,980
 And one day there's this dude just sitting on the street,

169
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,700
 kind of just hanging out, reading a newspaper.

170
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,380
 Where a newspaper's around at 1700.

171
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,140
 And there's like wood carvings of like people

172
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,020
 like herding cows and eating wheat,

173
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,260
 whatever made the news back in the 1700s.

174
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,100
 And this dude, so this guy reading the newspaper,

175
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,760
 we're gonna call him Tommy.

176
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,260
 So Tommy's sitting there and he's reading in this newspaper

177
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,860
 and a guy comes running by.

178
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,700
 (imitates crying)

179
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,300
 Tommy's like, what in the world was that?

180
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,100
 And he sees this guy kind of running

181
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,500
 and he ducks down an alley.

182
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,300
 Tommy goes, oh, that's kind of weird.

183
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,540
 But let me go back to reading this giant wood carving.

184
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,500
 And then a couple of minutes later,

185
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,620
 this other guy's kind of like jogging,

186
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,740
 jogging down the road.

187
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,940
 And he sees Tommy reading these wood carvings

188
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,260
 and he goes, hey, pardon me, sir, pardon me.

189
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,340
 Sorry to interrupt your, your news reading,

190
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,580
 but did you happen to see some dude run by?

191
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,540
 And Tommy thinks about it and he looks down the street

192
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,980
 and he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

193
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,660
 There was some guy like just kind of like

194
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,420
 distraught, looked like he was in a lot of trouble.

195
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,900
 And the dude standing up, his eyes go from side to side.

196
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,460
 He's like, trouble, I don't know what you're talking about.

197
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,300
 Do you know where he went?

198
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,180
 Do you know where this man went?

199
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,220
 Tommy goes, yeah, yeah, he went down the street a bit

200
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,540
 and then he turned left going down that alleyway.

201
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,180
 Gentleman goes, well, thank you very much for your service,

202
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,720
 sir, I will let you get back to reading the paper.

203
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,500
 The next day, Tommy wakes up,

204
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,460
 oh, he's milking cows and eating wheat

205
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,220
 and then he gets his picture carved into the newspaper.

206
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,300
 The most exciting man in Malta that day.

207
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,220
 And he's reading the newspaper and he turns

208
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,220
 and it says, murder.

209
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,660
 He's like, ah, and it says,

210
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,500
 a man was murdered in between San Juan and Burkara

211
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,260
 down this alleyway.

212
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,820
 And he's like, oh my God, oh my God,

213
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
 I can't believe what happened and he pieces it together.

214
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,420
 He realized what you realized.

215
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,980
 He snitched the dude out.

216
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,300
 This guy was running for his life

217
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,140
 and he told this other dude where he's at

218
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,700
 and the dude got stabbed to death in this alleyway.

219
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,140
 And he's like bleeding out and stuff like that.

220
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,860
 And he's like, ah, and he died.

221
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,820
 Now, why Tommy didn't hear the man

222
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,480
 getting brutally murdered down the street?

223
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,380
 I don't know.

224
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,940
 There's some questions I have about the story,

225
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,940
 but this story is so famous in Malta

226
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,980
 that not only did they build a giant monument,

227
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,540
 you know, in America, at least when there's a car accident,

228
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,140
 they'll put like a little cross in the road,

229
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,820
 a little wooden cross and teddy bears by it

230
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,500
 and stuff like that.

231
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,820
 It's like that, but it's made of stone.

232
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,060
 It's permanent.

233
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,020
 It's about 15 feet tall at the top as a crucifix.

234
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,940
 It's this giant pillar.

235
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,180
 And even today, people put like flowers by it.

236
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,980
 People stop and use it as this monument.

237
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,860
 It's called Ratch Mock Ratch.

238
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,640
 You smash, Mock, smash.

239
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,620
 Now, if you are one of my listeners from Malta,

240
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,780
 you can go ahead and correct me

241
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,020
 'cause I can guarantee there's some weird letters in there.

242
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,980
 There's some X's in there.

243
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,580
 I don't know if the X is silent,

244
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,900
 but what this means in English,

245
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
 this pillar is called,

246
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,900
 I saw, I didn't see, and I heard, I didn't hear.

247
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,720
 So basically, keep your mouth shut.

248
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,700
 If you see something, say nothing.

249
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,980
 The story's very famous.

250
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,280
 The monument's very famous.

251
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,380
 And at one point, you kind of think,

252
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,580
 maybe this is an urban legend.

253
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,500
 Maybe this pillar was here

254
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,740
 and someone made up the story behind it.

255
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,700
 No, this is very well known in Malta culture.

256
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,540
 There's actually a pop song about it

257
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,820
 written by a dude named Tony Camilleri.

258
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,000
 And the name of the song was I Don't See, I Don't Hear.

259
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,140
 And it just basically is like,

260
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,060
 here, let me read you some of the lyrics.

261
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,620
 I live in punishment.

262
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,700
 I live because I did not control my tongue.

263
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,980
 I didn't see it.

264
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,380
 I didn't hear it.

265
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,860
 This is the warning written on the wall.

266
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,140
 I didn't see it.

267
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,500
 I didn't hear it.

268
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,260
 See what you see, hear what you hear.

269
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,180
 Don't talk to anyone.

270
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,660
 Don't talk to anyone.

271
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,980
 I don't think a rapper could write stronger snitches,

272
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,820
 get stitches there.

273
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,060
 And he didn't get the stitches.

274
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,940
 The other dude got stitches.

275
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,220
 It's weird because the moral of the story

276
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,640
 is keep your mouth shut.

277
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,780
 Which generally in societies like in America and Britain,

278
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,620
 they have that whole,

279
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,860
 if you see something, say something.

280
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,140
 This is the opposite, right?

281
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,140
 But it is ingrained into that culture.

282
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,980
 If you see something, maybe just,

283
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,580
 maybe just don't tell anyone.

284
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,060
 Really fascinating story.

285
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,740
 And it's like, I was looking up like true crime in Malta.

286
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,340
 And this was one of the ones that popped up a lot.

287
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,300
 The murder of this man.

288
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,740
 And the lesson is keep your mouth shut.

289
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,060
 For me, I grew up in bad neighborhoods, right?

290
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,980
 Snitches get stitches, wasn't just a phrase.

291
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,020
 It was an actual thing you have to worry about.

292
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,540
 And I always saw it like this.

293
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,380
 'Cause it was so funny, 'cause my friends are like,

294
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,940
 dude, we just can't tell when,

295
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,100
 we can't tell what your view is on law enforcement.

296
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,740
 My view always was, 'cause there have been time,

297
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,820
 I remember once this dude took this little girl hostage

298
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,260
 and they were doing this hostage situation.

299
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
 It was like, where was this?

300
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,020
 It was in Art and Fair, I think, out in Sacramento.

301
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,780
 And the cops had surrounded the apartment complex.

302
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,820
 They were there for two days.

303
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,380
 Everyone was watching it on the news.

304
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,300
 And I go, you know what?

305
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,980
 Those cops must be awfully thirsty.

306
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,460
 So I went and got like two or three, 24 packs of soda.

307
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,340
 I got two 24 packs of soda and a 24 pack of water.

308
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,740
 And I pulled up to the line of where all the police were.

309
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,940
 And I went to go give them the sodas.

310
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,060
 And the officer goes, oh, I appreciate that.

311
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,580
 I think he took some waters.

312
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,900
 He goes, I appreciate that, but we solved it.

313
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,740
 Everything's good.

314
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,980
 And I was like, oh, okay.

315
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,300
 And then as I'm driving home, the radio was like,

316
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,620
 the police, what they did was they got a sniper

317
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,420
 and they were able to have all the infrared stuff

318
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,340
 to see through the wall.

319
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,740
 I mean, he was holding like a three-year-old girl hostage

320
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,580
 for like two days.

321
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,860
 And the sniper shot a bullet right through the wall

322
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,540
 and blew his head off right in front of the kid.

323
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,980
 I mean, the kid was gonna be traumatized either way,

324
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,340
 but they shot him through the wall.

325
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,420
 They could see him through the wall.

326
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,780
 And so yeah, they didn't need sodas.

327
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,940
 They're all going home to their family.

328
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,740
 So on that, like nobody's pro holding

329
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,380
 three-year-old kids hostage.

330
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,740
 But there's other, I had other interactions with the police

331
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,340
 that were far less friendly overall.

332
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,620
 So my goal, my always goal was this,

333
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,540
 is that I think it's wrong to snitch.

334
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,340
 If you're part of a criminal enterprise

335
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,140
 and you get caught and snitching reduces your sentence,

336
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,660
 you're gonna get stitches.

337
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,820
 If you're part of a criminal enterprise

338
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,940
 and you're making money off of that criminal enterprise,

339
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,420
 but they start blowing you off

340
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,620
 or they start sleeping with your girlfriend

341
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,380
 or something dumb and you snitch on them,

342
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,100
 snitches get stitches, that's on you.

343
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,700
 If you're a civilian,

344
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,780
 if you're outside of an organization

345
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,100
 or you have nothing to do with the money making

346
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,300
 and you're driving home and you see a crime,

347
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,460
 that to me was never snitches get stitches.

348
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,260
 Now that depended on the,

349
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,860
 depended on the particular gangster

350
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,740
 who was involved in that situation.

351
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,580
 For me, snitches get stitches is that,

352
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,780
 where you're working with them.

353
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,340
 There are other times I've obviously dealt

354
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,660
 with law enforcement because I see someone doing this,

355
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,220
 someone doing that, what was it,

356
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,140
 probably a couple weeks ago,

357
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,540
 some dudes were beating some woman up

358
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,540
 and some dude, some random guy outside a bar.

359
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,060
 I called the cops, I'm 45 years old.

360
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,020
 I'm not gonna go out there

361
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,780
 and tussle with a bunch of 19 year olds,

362
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,300
 a bunch of drunk 19 year olds in the middle of the street.

363
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,140
 I'm not gonna do that.

364
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,620
 I walk outside, these guys are beating up this dude

365
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,740
 and this girl, the dude and the girl

366
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,220
 are holding their own honestly

367
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,820
 and I just doot doot, hello, yeah, this is,

368
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
 they know me, the cops know me, yeah, this is Jason,

369
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,900
 hey, I got a fight, oh nevermind,

370
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,180
 everyone's getting in their car,

371
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,940
 blah, blah, blah, blah,

372
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,100
 and then I talked to the girls for a bit

373
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,020
 and that was that.

374
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,460
 So I don't consider that snitches get stitches.

375
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,500
 That's something where I think you could easily say,

376
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,420
 you see something say something like that.

377
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,260
 It's always a tricky thing though.

378
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,820
 I also know, I've never been,

379
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,700
 this has never happened to me,

380
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,140
 but I also know of people who have snitched

381
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,100
 and they did not work out well for him.

382
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,540
 I actually know of people,

383
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,300
 I gotta be careful how much they talk about this,

384
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,140
 but I actually know of people whose family members snitched

385
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,620
 and they had to like quit their job and move away.

386
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,320
 Like I'm hanging out with this dude

387
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,300
 and a relative of his snitched

388
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,900
 and this dude was like, hey dude, I'll see you later

389
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,020
 or never again, like I have to leave the state.

390
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,940
 I was like, hey, what's going on?

391
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,060
 And he told me this crazy story

392
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,620
 about how his buddy, how his relative did this

393
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,380
 and then went to the police about this

394
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,620
 and then him and his family were in danger

395
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,620
 to the point that they had to leave.

396
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,460
 People were trying to actively kill them,

397
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,900
 like actively kill them 'cause something that is real.

398
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,980
 So it's always an interesting,

399
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,020
 I mean, when you're on the outside it's interesting.

400
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,660
 I hope that friend of mine is doing fine,

401
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,520
 but yeah, that was years ago, that was years ago.

402
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,140
 So yes, snitches get stitches is a famous, famous phrase

403
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,620
 and in Malta it's the opposite, keep your mouth shut.

404
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,980
 It's just an interesting story, it's keep your mouth shut

405
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,580
 and that's not what your government would want.

406
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,080
 I'm surprised this story is still around.

407
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,320
 It seems counterintuitive that the government

408
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,540
 would want to keep this story around.

409
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,540
 But, Alison's, I'm gonna give you the keys

410
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,100
 of the carbon helicopter, we're leaving behind.

411
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,900
 Malta, we're headed all the way out to Ohio.

412
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,020
 (imitates engine revving)

413
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,980
 And as we're headed out there,

414
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,540
 I wanna do a really, really quick dead rabbit recommends.

415
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,780
 Speaking of alien evasions,

416
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,980
 this is what kind of why I was thinking

417
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,380
 about alien evasions.

418
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,820
 I watched the Doughbuss movie,

419
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,420
 I've watched a lot of great movies recently.

420
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,980
 This one I just watched like two days ago

421
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,580
 and it jumped to the top of my list of movies

422
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,980
 I wanted to talk about.

423
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,680
 It's a Netflix exclusive,

424
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,740
 it's a Netflix exclusive movie starring Michael Pina,

425
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,980
 who's been in like everything.

426
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,900
 He's just this great character actor,

427
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,100
 he's been in a ton of movies.

428
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,740
 It's called Extinction.

429
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,660
 And it's, I love alien invasion movies when they're done right.

430
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,180
 Same thing I love about zombie movies or pandemic movies

431
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,420
 'cause it's about the end of the world,

432
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,820
 asteroids coming down, all this type of stuff

433
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,420
 and how people are dealing with the end of the world.

434
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,900
 And it's a great alien invasion movie with a twist.

435
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,940
 Michael Pina is kind of like a dad

436
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,820
 on the cusp of a failing marriage,

437
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,020
 his kids don't like him.

438
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,540
 He works at like some CERN type laboratory

439
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,420
 as like an engineer.

440
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,420
 And he begins to have dreams, visions of an alien invasion.

441
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,700
 He keeps seeing people just getting shot in the streets

442
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,260
 and all these drop ships coming down in the cities

443
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,140
 and people just getting gunned down.

444
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,260
 And he's at work and he has a vision of himself

445
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,940
 like beating someone to death with his hands.

446
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,620
 He's having these horrible visions about the future.

447
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,940
 And his wife is just like,

448
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,780
 "Listen, you're just going crazy.

449
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,860
 Please, please get this treated.

450
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,700
 Me and the kids can't deal with this anymore."

451
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
 So he goes to the psychiatrist's office

452
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,060
 and while he's in the office,

453
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,620
 there's another patient sitting next to him there

454
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,980
 and they're like in the waiting room.

455
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,940
 And the other dude turns to Michael Pina

456
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,220
 and goes, "You're not crazy.

457
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,740
 I see the aliens too.

458
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,780
 I've seen the visions and they're coming."

459
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,140
 And you're like, "Oh, dude, this movie's really dope."

460
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,980
 Because not only is it a really tight alien invasion movie,

461
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,780
 it goes, it's like an hour and a half long,

462
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,560
 but it moves so quickly.

463
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,780
 Not only is it a really good alien invasion movie,

464
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,740
 you have the mystery is how does he know the future?

465
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,340
 And I'll tell you right now, as I was watching,

466
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,780
 I was like, "Oh, I hope it's not that

467
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,820
 this is also a vision and he's going to wake up

468
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,580
 and he's like, "Oh, now I know what's going to happen."

469
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,540
 Like invasion from Mars or something like that.

470
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,680
 No, it's not a twist that it's all a dream.

471
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,820
 You have this really cool alien invasion movie

472
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,260
 where they are gunning people down on the streets.

473
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,340
 It is like block by block alien invasion

474
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,900
 mixed with the mystery.

475
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,180
 How does he know, how did he know this was going to happen?

476
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,340
 Really, really tight movie.

477
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,980
 It reminded me of a short science fiction story

478
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,060
 that I would have read some Saturday afternoon

479
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,980
 when I was a teenager.

480
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,820
 Like I, it's such a good sci-fi adventure.

481
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,980
 It's actually quite grim.

482
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,300
 I don't know if I'd call it an adventure,

483
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,500
 but Dead Rabbit recommends extinction on Netflix.

484
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,480
 Really, really recommend that movie.

485
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,980
 I said recently that the export's been putting out

486
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,240
 a lot of quality stuff and they have.

487
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,060
 The guy who's writing the story had an uncle.

488
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,900
 When he was growing up,

489
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,500
 he had a great uncle who would always tell him

490
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,220
 about local urban legends.

491
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,900
 And where we're at is in Buckeye Lake, Ohio.

492
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,380
 And he goes, "My uncle would tell me stuff

493
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,060
 like Crybaby Bridge.

494
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,220
 That's a very typical story.

495
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,420
 We've covered stuff like that on the show before.

496
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,260
 The Grass Man of Ohio,

497
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,060
 which is basically like a Bigfoot type of creature.

498
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,300
 All these local urban legends."

499
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,300
 And there was one story that this poster had heard

500
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,840
 that intrigued him for years.

501
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,980
 And he actually tried finding more information on it.

502
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,460
 He could never get any more info on it.

503
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,580
 He goes, "I kind of think that my great uncle

504
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,700
 might have made it up, but I don't know."

505
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,580
 He goes, "It's so weird that,

506
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,420
 and I can't find any proof of any of it,

507
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,820
 so maybe my uncle made it up."

508
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,460
 But he also knew all about all these other urban legends.

509
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,860
 Why would he make this one up

510
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,580
 if all the other ones could be traced to something?

511
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,140
 Back in the late 1950s in the town of Mount Vernon,

512
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,140
 a bright blue Volkswagen Beetle comes driving into town.

513
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,220
 (mimics engine)

514
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,220
 And inside this Beetle was a father, we'll call him Jake,

515
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,180
 and his daughter, we'll call her Alyssa,

516
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,380
 and they're driving down the road.

517
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,260
 The relationship between Jake and Alyssa

518
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,180
 was so stereotypical, is so cliche, but it is realistic.

519
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,900
 He was a devout Christian man who ruled the house, right?

520
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,580
 A man's home is his castle,

521
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,260
 and everyone has to do what he says,

522
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,540
 and he follows the one boss, the big boss in the sky.

523
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,300
 He is a devout Christian.

524
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,340
 She is a rebellious teenager.

525
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,460
 She wants to dress how she dresses

526
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,860
 and listen to the music what she wants to listen to.

527
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,740
 She's like, "I wanna listen to Chuck Berry."

528
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,100
 He's like, "Oh, that's so rebellious."

529
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,740
 And she wants to date who she wants to date.

530
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,540
 Now the one person that united this family is passed away.

531
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,140
 This is like a real life, the righteous gemstones.

532
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,500
 They no longer have this unifying force.

533
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,700
 You just have two people that are on different paths.

534
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,100
 But the rebellious girl is living with her dad

535
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,340
 and my house, my rules, Jake always said.

536
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,820
 So they would constantly fight.

537
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,100
 She wasn't gonna follow the rules,

538
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,220
 but she also couldn't afford to get her own place.

539
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,180
 They were constantly fighting.

540
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,940
 It was a house full of torment.

541
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,900
 And it came to a head when the father,

542
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,500
 one day, found out that Alyssa was dating

543
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,900
 a 20-something year old man.

544
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,220
 He flips out.

545
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,120
 Jake totally flips out because, listen,

546
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,340
 you know this is a recipe for disaster.

547
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,380
 The dude's not gonna stick around.

548
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,540
 At best, he's just gonna break your heart.

549
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,180
 At worst, he's gonna knock you up.

550
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,360
 It's gonna be this huge thing.

551
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,900
 So Jake forbids his daughter from ever seeing this guy again.

552
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,780
 And Alyssa, in the throes of teenage love, doesn't care.

553
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,700
 Doesn't listen to the dad.

554
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,540
 She needs to keep being with this dude, right?

555
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,940
 Which is the dumb decision.

556
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,960
 But again, very, very cliche

557
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,220
 because it happens all the time.

558
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,100
 Jake actually thinks that it's solved though.

559
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,160
 He think he actually got through to his daughter.

560
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,460
 But one day when he was rummaging

561
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,980
 through her room, apparently,

562
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,340
 he finds a pair of men's boxers

563
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,460
 kind of stuffed away in the back of her closet.

564
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,900
 So Alyssa's at school and Jake is enraged.

565
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,380
 He can't believe that this is a crime.

566
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,460
 Even in the 1950s, I'm pretty sure

567
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,300
 you weren't allowed to be 25 years old

568
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,340
 dating a 15-year-old.

569
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,280
 I'm not for sure, but I hope it was against the law.

570
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,420
 He decides to confront this boyfriend.

571
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,260
 So while Alyssa's at school, he jumps in his bright blue beetle

572
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,180
 and Jake is driving through town,

573
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,260
 going to this boy's house.

574
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,900
 He's going to probably kill this guy

575
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,660
 for sleeping with his teenage daughter.

576
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,420
 But he doesn't get the opportunity to.

577
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,340
 He doesn't get the sweet, sweet satisfaction

578
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,020
 of strangling a man who did you wrong.

579
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,060
 On his way to this boyfriend's house,

580
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,380
 he blows through a stoplight.

581
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:55,080
 The truck slams into him and he dies at the scene.

582
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,740
 Police show up, "Meow, meow, meow."

583
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,980
 Taking reports, ambulance shows up, "Meow, meow, meow."

584
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,180
 They're like, "What are we supposed to do?

585
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,140
 "He's dead, I don't know, we're throwing him in the gurney."

586
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,060
 So they put him in the gurney and then the tow truck shows up,

587
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,860
 "Eat, eat, eat."

588
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,980
 And they take their wreckage of the blue beetle

589
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,820
 to like a holding area and then eventually to a scrap yard

590
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,500
 where they're like, "Put it in the box thing."

591
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,100
 It's not really good people who work at the scrap yard.

592
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,540
 They don't know what anything's called.

593
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,040
 The workers are like, "What is the box thing?"

594
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,280
 They just tumble the car around

595
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,000
 till they get to the compactor.

596
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,840
 That's what I meant.

597
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,560
 They're like, "That makes more sense."

598
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,720
 (mimics car engine revving)

599
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,680
 And the blue beetle's getting crushed.

600
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,720
 Until it's now like a little cube and hoisted up.

601
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,440
 Put the cube, put the cube on the box.

602
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
 They're like, "Dude, quick, call in stuff boxes.

603
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,240
 "Everything's a box.

604
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,920
 "Stuff gets turned into boxes here.

605
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,440
 "You're fired, you can't work here anymore."

606
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,240
 So the blue beetle is crushed to bits

607
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,900
 and the story of Alyssa,

608
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,700
 we never really know what happens to her.

609
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,980
 Did she stay with her boyfriend?

610
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,660
 Was she overcome with emotion at the loss of her father?

611
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,260
 Does she decide to dedicate her life to Christ?

612
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,780
 We don't know any of this stuff

613
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,740
 because that would be an involved character development

614
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,820
 and human interest.

615
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,860
 Instead, the story goes like this.

616
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,460
 Couple weeks later, these two teenagers

617
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,260
 are making out in the woods near Mount Vernon.

618
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,460
 Mm, well, ooh, Terry, you're so sexy.

619
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,580
 Oh, thank you, Bruce.

620
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,960
 (imitates kissing)

621
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,080
 They're kissing.

622
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,880
 And they see some headlights in the distance

623
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,240
 and they're like, "Oh, maybe that's the cops

624
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,080
 "coming to break us up."

625
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,920
 And then they go, "Wait a second."

626
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,480
 No, because unless the cops

627
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,400
 started driving Volkswagen bugs,

628
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,240
 it's not the cops.

629
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,440
 And they're looking at this blue Volkswagen beetle

630
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,600
 sitting on the road and then it starts going.

631
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,680
 (imitates engine revving)

632
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,280
 And it starts driving on the road towards them.

633
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,200
 Now I used to have a Volkswagen bug.

634
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
 They're very iconic cars, they're very fuel efficient.

635
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,340
 They are not knowing for their speediness, though.

636
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,740
 But these teenagers claim that they were chased

637
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,140
 through the forest, through the forest, no paved road.

638
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,540
 The car begins to chase them through the forest.

639
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,660
 And they're like, "Ah, this Volkswagen bug."

640
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,060
 (imitates engine revving)

641
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,500
 He's like going, he's like driving over roots

642
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,860
 and it's a little goalies and stuff like that.

643
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,260
 But they report to the police, we were making out,

644
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,060
 and a car chased us through the woods.

645
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,260
 And the police are like, "Okay, that's weird.

646
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,780
 "We'll put that down on our paperwork,

647
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,960
 "but hope that doesn't happen to you again."

648
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
 I actually did probably investigate it a little bit more

649
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,600
 than that, they're like, "What?

650
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,560
 "Attempted kidnapping, we'll all write that down,

651
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,160
 "but hopefully it doesn't happen again."

652
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,640
 Stories start to spread around town

653
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,560
 of teenagers in their bedroom.

654
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,840
 Oh, my parents are out of town, Johnny.

655
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,680
 You wanna get to third base?

656
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,200
 He's like, "Well, that's really aggressive.

657
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,240
 "Do you know what third base actually means?"

658
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,080
 She's like, "I do, I do."

659
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,780
 And she starts undressing.

660
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,720
 Do you guys know what third base is?

661
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,160
 It's up there, called third base for a reason.

662
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,900
 As she begins undressing, she begins taking off her bra

663
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,660
 and then she's trying to show off her headlights,

664
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,880
 but instead headlights illuminate the room from outside.

665
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,360
 Ah, it's blinding.

666
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,300
 And the guy would look out the window

667
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,520
 and there would be a bright blue Volkswagen bug

668
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,040
 sitting in the street, it's headlights shining

669
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,880
 on the teenagers.

670
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,500
 Ah, cut it out, man, cut it out.

671
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,460
 I'm trying to have sex with this chick.

672
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,960
 It starts happening all over town.

673
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,360
 Teenagers start saying whenever I start taking my clothes off

674
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,600
 before I'm about to make some whoopee, headlights appear

675
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,000
 through the window and I look outside

676
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,920
 and there's this bright blue Volkswagen bug.

677
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
 Teenagers start reporting the blue bug

678
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,720
 following them around town,

679
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,680
 whether they're driving with their snuggle bunny

680
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,080
 or just walking down the street holding hands.

681
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,860
 Bright blue Volkswagen bug behind them.

682
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,560
 And then there are some that say that this car

683
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,420
 is not a simple voyeur, it's not just tracking down

684
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,700
 these people or slowly pursuing them through the forest

685
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,860
 as fast as a Volkswagen bug can drive through a forest.

686
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,300
 People start to realize that teens are going missing

687
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,360
 in the town of Mount Vernon.

688
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,420
 Now, some of them you could chalk up to runaway,

689
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,900
 some of them you could chalk up to them just going on,

690
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,580
 getting tired of their home, joining the military, whatever.

691
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,780
 But there are some who say that the blue beetle itself

692
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,780
 was kidnapping and killing young teenage lovers.

693
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,140
 The story is known as the sex-hating Volkswagen

694
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,840
 of Mount Vernon, Ohio.

695
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,940
 It's interesting because the way that the story

696
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,460
 was presented to us again was,

697
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
 I don't know if this story is true,

698
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,960
 but all these other stories my great uncle told me,

699
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,600
 I was able to find verification of.

700
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,060
 It would be one thing if he was like,

701
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,340
 and that was the time I stopped the leprechaun

702
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,380
 from ending World War II.

703
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,500
 If he was making stuff up,

704
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,340
 you think you'd have more made up stuff.

705
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,580
 So the legend may be true in the sense that the great uncle

706
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,420
 didn't make it up, that he had simply heard it

707
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,820
 as an urban legend himself,

708
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,540
 but even going one step further

709
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,820
 in the world of the paranormal, this makes sense.

710
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,380
 This is something that could happen

711
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,620
 in the world of the paranormal

712
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,460
 because it's really fascinating.

713
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,580
 'Cause what we have is a vengeful spirit.

714
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,820
 The father who was trying,

715
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,980
 really what he was trying to do,

716
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,740
 yeah, he was probably a little overbearing,

717
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,700
 but at the end of the day,

718
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,940
 he was trying to save his daughter.

719
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,460
 She was in a relationship with a much, much older man

720
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,540
 who was taking advantage of her, right?

721
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,980
 So despite that he might have come down a little heavy,

722
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,100
 and he wasn't gonna murder the guy,

723
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,140
 we have a man who feels like he has to do this

724
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,740
 to take care of his family,

725
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,500
 and he dies in that rage, he dies in that moment.

726
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,420
 So a vengeful spirit, a wraith,

727
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,340
 totally fits with Ghost Lore as we know it.

728
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,620
 And if the car itself,

729
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,980
 the mechanical structure of the car

730
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,620
 was possessed by a ghost, we see that as well,

731
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,980
 not necessarily with cars,

732
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,780
 but we see dolls possessed by ghost

733
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,660
 and paintings possessed by ghost.

734
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,020
 I have a friend who says that her lamp

735
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,300
 is possessed by a ghost.

736
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,180
 It's not really her lamp, she bought it from a thrift store.

737
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,300
 But the point is, is that the idea of a ghost

738
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,860
 possessing an inanimate object is very, very accepted

739
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,180
 within the Paranormal Lore.

740
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,300
 But remember this car was destroyed.

741
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,700
 This is a really interesting story

742
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,420
 'cause we have a vengeful spirit

743
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,420
 taking the form of the car.

744
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,740
 It was almost like he had infused the physical being

745
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,580
 of this vehicle with his rage.

746
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,940
 So when he returned to Earth as the spirit,

747
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,740
 it wasn't him just walking around town,

748
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,380
 which to be honest, wouldn't be super intimidating.

749
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,220
 I mean, okay, if I was trying to have sex in the woods

750
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,020
 with some hot chick and some dude starts walking towards me,

751
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,780
 I'm gonna run, I'm gonna get her,

752
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,700
 I take her, I take her and I run away.

753
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,140
 But it'd be far more scary, right?

754
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,140
 To be chased by a, maybe not chased by a Volkswagen bug,

755
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,660
 but chased by a car.

756
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,140
 Remember that old movie Wraith?

757
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,140
 What's kind of about that?

758
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,100
 It was about the guy who died in the car accident

759
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,780
 and then drove around running people over.

760
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,940
 It was a really good movie.

761
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,780
 Who was in it?

762
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,940
 Like Richard Greco or Robert Downey Jr. or somebody?

763
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,180
 Anyways, you did have recommends Wraith.

764
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,580
 I saw it when I was 12, maybe it's the holds up.

765
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,620
 The idea of a ghost taking the form of a car,

766
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,900
 chasing people down, this all fits with the lore.

767
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,040
 So while the story may have been made up,

768
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,940
 it's possible that it was real.

769
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,140
 And when we go back to the 1950s,

770
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,060
 if this was something that teenagers were reporting,

771
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,540
 obviously it sounds really, really dumb.

772
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,580
 So no parent is going to take this seriously.

773
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,740
 And actually now that I think about it,

774
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,140
 they wouldn't be reporting this, right?

775
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,380
 Like the couple in the woods would have told the authorities

776
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,580
 'cause they were almost killed,

777
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,420
 but no one's going to be like,

778
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,980
 "Mom, mom, you won't believe what happened

779
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,300
 when me and Johnny were trying to have sex last night."

780
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,940
 And she's like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

781
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,780
 what?

782
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,340
 You would, this would be spreading from teenager to teenager."

783
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,660
 That's how the story would be being told.

784
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,580
 So it's possible that this poster's great uncle

785
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,220
 was a teenager at this time and was hearing these stories.

786
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,180
 It wouldn't be something you would announce to the world

787
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,920
 'cause all of these kids are doing something

788
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,980
 that they shouldn't be doing, right?

789
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,860
 Trying to have sex.

790
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,260
 I mean, I'm not saying sex is bad,

791
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,660
 but obviously teenagers, the longer you can postpone

792
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,180
 having sex, the better off you're going to be.

793
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,780
 Especially if there's a killer car on the loose.

794
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,380
 So the point is is that you could have this phantom

795
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,620
 in this form of this car stalking the city of Mount Vernon,

796
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,540
 trying to stop teenagers from having sex.

797
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,540
 And if we accept the story as true

798
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,940
 and it does fit into Ghost Lore,

799
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,420
 it's possible the VW bug is still out there.

800
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,780
 Roman these streets, if this is a super obscure story,

801
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,820
 it would be one of those things.

802
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,180
 It's kind of the plot of Nightmare on Elm Street, right?

803
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,460
 They erased all knowledge of Freddie Kruger.

804
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,540
 And that was fine for about 30 years,

805
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,900
 but then the kids started having dreams about this guy

806
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,660
 and asking, "Who's Freddie Kruger?"

807
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,900
 The parents were like, "Uh."

808
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,060
 So it's possible that this legend did happen

809
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,060
 and people just forgot about it.

810
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,220
 It was whispered among teens and then they grew up

811
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,780
 and then they go, "Oh, maybe that wasn't real."

812
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,780
 I always do wonder what happened to Tiffany.

813
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,900
 She went missing that one day, but I don't know.

814
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,740
 Go about me.

815
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,340
 That's the cop investigating the crime.

816
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,860
 I don't know, someone else will figure it out.

817
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,060
 Everyone moves on with their life,

818
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,260
 but this Volkswagen bug is still out there.

819
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,580
 Looking for teenagers about to have sex,

820
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,260
 trying to skier them off.

821
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,540
 But when that fails, trying to chase them off.

822
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,300
 And when that fails, killing them.

823
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,100
 So next time you're driving down the road

824
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,380
 on the way to your special loved one's house,

825
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,780
 you got a box of condoms.

826
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,340
 You're very, very optimistic.

827
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,340
 You have a box of condoms in your glove compartment

828
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,700
 and you're driving over to your special lady's house.

829
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,260
 Make sure to check in that rear view mirror.

830
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,300
 See if you're being followed.

831
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,500
 Look in that rear view mirror

832
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,940
 'cause there might be a set of headlights behind you.

833
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,540
 But it's just the mailman.

834
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,100
 For some reason he's delivering mail

835
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,260
 so you're late at night and he passes you and go, "Whew."

836
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,460
 And then you get to her house

837
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,580
 and you bring in a shopping bag full of condoms

838
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,900
 and you set them down on the table.

839
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,300
 "Honey, I'm home."

840
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,500
 And she's like, "Ooh."

841
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,780
 And then you see some headlights outside your window

842
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,740
 and you're like, "Ugh."

843
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,740
 And you look out and it's old farmer John on his tractor

844
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
 just going by.

845
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,900
 You're like, "What, that's weird."

846
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,420
 (imitates engine revving)

847
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,700
 Tractor, noises.

848
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,620
 And then you go to the bedroom with your lovely lady

849
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,460
 and you're like, "Hey."

850
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,980
 You know what third basis I heard in a podcast

851
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,260
 and not entirely for sure.

852
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,540
 And she goes, "Take me."

853
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,980
 And she throws herself down on the bed.

854
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,060
 And right when you get on top of your lovely lady

855
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,740
 to make sweet, sweet, passionate love to her,

856
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,700
 you hear the closet door creak open.

857
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,260
 (imitates door creaking)

858
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,020
 And you turn and the cat walks out of the closet.

859
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,340
 You're like, "You're like,

860
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,780
 "I need to stop listening to this paranormal podcast

861
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,100
 "before I have sex with my girlfriend."

862
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,580
 'Cause obviously I'm very, very paranoid.

863
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,660
 And you were able to make sweet love with your girlfriend

864
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,860
 and everything's great.

865
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,500
 And you go through the bag

866
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,340
 and then you go to the store to buy some more condoms

867
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,180
 and then you run out of those.

868
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,140
 And then eventually it's dawn, it's three weeks later

869
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,940
 and you've been late for work, you've been fired.

870
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,340
 And you're walking out to your car

871
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,420
 and you're driving home with a big smile on your face.

872
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,220
 And you see another set of headlights behind you

873
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,580
 and you're like, "Oh, that's probably just the mailman

874
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,620
 "or the tractor or the cat."

875
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,660
 But instead it's a bright blue Volkswagen bug.

876
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,380
 You might not be a teenager.

877
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,140
 You might not be having illicit sex

878
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,060
 with someone you shouldn't be with.

879
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,660
 But to a vengeful spirit from beyond the grave,

880
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,500
 those are just trivialities.

881
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,620
 You have now run afoul

882
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,980
 of the sex-hating Volkswagen bug.

883
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,380
 There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide.

884
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,580
 It will get you.

885
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,660
 It will take you away to the bad place.

886
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,300
 Soon you find yourself freezing cold

887
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,660
 in a junkyard made out of desiccated human remains.

888
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,660
 You're like, "Wow, this escalated fast."

889
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,140
 And as the compactor starts to press in on you,

890
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,780
 "Ugh, no, no, I wanna live longer.

891
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,660
 "Ugh, let me get laid at least 10 more times."

892
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,500
 "Ugh, pfft."

893
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:08,020
 And as the very last thing that pops is your eyeball.

894
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,060
 You have one eyeball and right before it pops,

895
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,620
 you see a Volkswagen bug.

896
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,020
 It's like Lightning McQueen.

897
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,260
 It's operating the gears of the compactor

898
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,580
 with its wheel hands.

899
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,700
 It's like, "Gotta go fast."

900
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,780
 "Errrgh."

901
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,020
 And then the eyeball gets squished and you're totally dead.

902
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,540
 You became the latest victim

903
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,820
 of the sex-hating Volkswagen bug.

904
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,780
 If it existed, it still exists.

905
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,820
 If it was a vengeful ghost

906
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,380
 trying to prevent people from having sex,

907
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,500
 it's still continuing that mission to this day.

908
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,260
 The only question is, will you become its next victim?

909
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,580
 Or will you abstain from sex forever?

910
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,180
 The choice.

911
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,340
 The choice is yours.

912
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,540

919

 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

920
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,140
 Have a great one, guys.

921
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,720
 (upbeat music)

922
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,300
 (upbeat music)

923
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,960
 This is the story of a daughter of handstands,

924
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,040
 lemonade stands, and first corsages,

925
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,520
 and that perfect driver's license picture.

926
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,960
 Travelers, this is Carlos.

927
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,760
 - Someone just hit my car.

928
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
 - Is everyone okay?

929
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,920
 Are you safe?

930
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,880
 It's also the story of an insurance company

931
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,520
 that believes people always come first.

932
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,800
 If it matters to you,

933
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,000
 traveler's insurance will help protect it.

934
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,320
 Travelers, it's better under the umbrella.
