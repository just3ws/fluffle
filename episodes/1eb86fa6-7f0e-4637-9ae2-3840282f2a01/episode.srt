2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,440
 day with Honey Bunches of Oats cereal.

 to get moving, you're ready!

 With the boost you need to be your best self, it's amazing what a little me time can do!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,080
 So make Honey Bunches of Oats cereal part of your morning routine, and make a bunch happen!

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,680
 Pick up a box of Honey Bunches of Oats in the cereal aisle today!

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,400
 A young man is visited by aliens and promised an amazing future.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,400
 But what happens if it doesn't come true?

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,860
 And then we meet a man who believes that the government is out to get him, that he's being

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,040
 gangstalked, that people in the highest levels of government are using secret technology

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,280
 to try to kill him.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,560
 What makes him different than any of the other lunatics we've covered with this delusion?

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,560
 He was the very first one to have today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:12,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,760
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter, I'm having a great day.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, we've got a lot of cool stuff to cover today.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,480
 So first off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, rolling into Dead

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,120
 Rabbit Command right now in a little blanket rolling around, it's Colin A. Raymond.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,200
 Everyone give a round of applause to Colin A. Raymond.

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,440
 Thank you so much for supporting this show, you can go ahead and stand up now.

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
 You can stand up.

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,480
 Colin, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode, if you guys can't support

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,200
 the Patreon that's fine too.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,440
 Just helps spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,880
 Colin, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,840
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're going to take a nice aerial journey

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,640
 from DRC, you didn't know there was an acronym for it?

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,200
 We are headed out to Cook Inlet, Alaska.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,440
 Colin is flying us through the friendly skies towards the north, unless you live in Alaska

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,800
 and it's already around the corner and you're going to meet us there.

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:17,920
 In September of 1976 in Cook Inlet, Alaska, there was a young boy sitting at home.

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
 He's whistling to himself.

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
 Wait never mind.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,440
 I looked a sentence down on my notes.

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:38,560
 He was walking out of a semi-solid bog.

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
 I don't know what that is.

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,520
 It does not explain why he's there.

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,760
 It would have made far more sense if he was whistling in his bedroom.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,600
 I don't know what a semi-solid bog is.

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,760
 I'm assuming it's just a swamp that you don't immediately sink in.

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
 Anyways, that exists in Alaska.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,920
 If you guys don't buy the fact that that's a real thing, the rest of the story is even

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,240
 more fantabulous.

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,440
 Walking out of a semi-solid bog is David E. K. Wood.

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,640
 He's a 13 year old boy.

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,240
 He's walking out of this thing that may or may not exist in Alaska.

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,320
 Anyways, or what he was doing there, I don't know if he was burying a couple bodies.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,640
 He's like, not only will no one find you for 500 years, but when they do, you'll be perfectly

50
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
 preserved.

51
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,480
 I love my evidence to be a long lasting and never decaying.

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,240
 David E. K. Wood is walking out of this semi-solid bog and he sees two UFOs hovering over the

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
 area.

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,880
 (Dog whining)

55
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,560
 He thought the whole story was just gonna be about how weird bogs are.

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 No.

57
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,520
 He sees two UFOs hovering over the area and he's like "Golly, look at them UFOs.

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,260
 I wonder if they saw me murder those people."

59
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:51,000
 And then a blue beam of light flashes down from one of the UFOs.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,960
 And then a man walks out of the beam.

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,560
 David is looking at this man and the man's walking out of the beam.

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,420
 It's David as an adult.

63
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,680
 David sees himself as an adult walking out of the beam.

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,220
 A much older, much more muscular David.

65
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,720
 This dude's been hitting the gym, been hitting the space gym.

66
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,580
 He goes "Anti-gravity weights are all the rage in space."

67
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,460
 Even though they're anti-gravity, they're super easy to lift up.

68
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,220
 Aliens are like "Look at how strong I am."

69
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,740
 Adult David walks up to little David and he's like "He looks over the bog and he's

70
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,220
 like they'll never find those bodies.

71
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,340
 I'm from the future to let you know.

72
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,980
 Your crimes will be undiscovered."

73
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,340
 And then actually what he actually said was "Don't be afraid little David."

74
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,660
 And he begins to talk to little David.

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,660
 He started to tell him a little bit about the future because this is, it's not a clone.

76
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,320
 This is David E.K. Wood from the future.

77
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 He tells little David that soon he will quote "Be involved in the greatest adventure of

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,000
 his life."

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,720
 He says "Some day you're gonna help many, many people.

80
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,320
 One day when the time is right, you will wake up little David.

81
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,320
 You will see the world clearly for the first time.

82
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,960
 I just want you to know that you are loved.

83
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,180
 You are loved by many, many people."

84
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,620
 And with that big David turns around, walks back under the beam of light, teleports aboard.

85
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,220
 UFOs leave the area.

86
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,740
 David E.K. Wood went on to write a book called Alien Ali where he talks about his experiences

87
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,900
 and he started, this was just the beginning.

88
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,060
 He starts getting beam to board ships regularly.

89
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,540
 He's like walking home from school.

90
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,700
 He's like "Oh man, I hope a ship beams me aboard.

91
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,180
 My legs are tired and sure enough UFO beams aboard."

92
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,120
 He goes through the normal rigamarole that we see with abductees, but he doesn't like

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
 the term "abductee."

94
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,560
 He prefers the term "experiencer" because he sees it as totally consensual that he's

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,280
 getting kidnapped by these aliens.

96
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,080
 So he writes this book called Alien Ali about his experiences and like I said, it's the

97
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 normal stuff.

98
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
 He's meeting Greys.

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,000
 He has a hybrid child named Shannon.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,080
 This little girl, Shannon, somewhere up in the space.

101
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,520
 That's a dead meat dad for you, right?

102
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,620
 You have a baby and you're like "I'll take custody of it every ninth lifetime."

103
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,540
 You just fly around in space for a while.

104
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,860
 This is an interesting story.

105
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,420
 It's super run of the mill, right?

106
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,060
 Nothing, I mean he did meet a future version of himself that we don't normally see in

107
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,540
 an abductee or an experiencer story.

108
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,980
 Overall, it's just kind of he's visiting grey aliens, have the hybrid child stuff.

109
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,980
 It's pretty basic.

110
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,380
 The reason why I wanted to cover this was for a couple of reasons.

111
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,320
 There's this weird thing, we see people who have abduction experiences do this a lot of

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,840
 times they'll draw pictures of themselves in the UFO.

113
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,280
 If David E. K. was listening to this, he knows exactly what I'm getting to.

114
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
 He's like "Really?

115
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,800
 That's what you're gonna focus in on?"

116
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,680
 He draws pictures of himself aboard these UFOs.

117
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,880
 There's a lot of these pictures and they're like drawn with crayons.

118
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,440
 Apparently I can't say that word correctly because the other day I told someone there

119
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,840
 was a box of crayons in the corner and they're like "What are you talking about?"

120
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,380
 They're like a little kid coloring.

121
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,260
 Now I'm a terrible artist so I'm not gonna art shame anyone.

122
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,740
 I can't draw nothing.

123
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,860
 But even though I can't draw anything, I will not use crayons to draw because it makes

124
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,460
 it look like a kid's drawing.

125
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,900
 So if I'm gonna be like "Officer, you won't believe what happened."

126
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,700
 And I got abducted by aliens and here's a drawing and it's like a picture of a couple

127
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,300
 of stick people but it's done with crayons.

128
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,740
 It automatically makes it look childlike.

129
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,620
 I'd get a pencil or something like that.

130
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,240
 So I will art shame you for that.

131
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,800
 Secondly, the drawings are hilarious because it's always like a picture of a great alien.

132
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,200
 How you would imagine a great alien would be like skinny little arms, big head.

133
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,800
 He draws a picture of his daughter with a kind of a busted up looking head because she

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,640
 is half alien.

135
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,480
 She's not gonna win any beauty passions, right?

136
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,800
 And then she's got like little alien arms.

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,200
 He draws himself super detailed.

138
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,420
 He draws himself super detailed.

139
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,980
 Huge muscular body.

140
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,540
 There's one drawing where he's naked and it's just his bubble butt.

141
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,700
 Like there's a bunch of great aliens standing around naked David E.K. would have like this

142
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,620
 perfectly sculpted giant bubble butt on him.

143
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,860
 Like everything, like there's alien control panels in the background.

144
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,580
 Out of this world technology that scientists would love to see.

145
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,580
 He's like just drawing little dots.

146
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,820
 I don't know what that looked like.

147
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,840
 But check out my abs.

148
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,600
 Check out my calves.

149
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
 It's hilarious.

150
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
 I love it.

151
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
 Thank you, David E.K.

152
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,840
 That was so great.

153
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,960
 He draws himself in such great detail.

154
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,280
 The other reason why I wanted to cover this story because I can't really just keep talking

155
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,240
 about drawings on podcasts.

156
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,040
 The other reason why I wanted to cover this story is you don't know who David E.K. would

157
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
 be.

158
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,240
 Some of you guys may know who he is.

159
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,560
 I had no idea who he was until I saw this story.

160
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,340
 And I found this story on ThinkAbout@Docs.com which catalogs every UFO sighting.

161
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,620
 I mean it is a great resource.

162
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,620
 Think about it.

163
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,700
 Docs.com is one of the best ongoing resources we found on the show.

164
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,140
 If you're a fan of UFOs, check out that website.

165
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
 It's phenomenal.

166
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,660
 But that's where I found this on and it was catalogued with every single thing else.

167
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,140
 I never heard of this guy.

168
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,820
 And I'm not saying that I'm the Indole Beall of all paranormal UFO knowledge because I'm

169
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
 not.

170
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,600
 It's the stuff I cover on the show I'm really hearing most of it for the first time.

171
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,040
 But not everyone gets a message that they're going to be great.

172
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,200
 That they're going to change the world.

173
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,840
 That he's going to help all of these people.

174
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,600
 In the end of the day, I'm sure he's a lovely dude, right?

175
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,160
 According to his drawings, he's quite handsome.

176
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,080
 But I'm sure personality wise, I'm sure he's a pretty nice guy.

177
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,560
 I'm sure he's pretty chill.

178
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,920
 But what if a future you showed up and told you you're going to go on this greatest adventure

179
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,820
 and you, I don't want to feel like I'm knocking the guy because I'm not.

180
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,140
 But the future you comes back and tells you you're going to go on the greatest adventure

181
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,540
 and you publish a book.

182
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,260
 Which anyone can do that.

183
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
 Amazon self publishing.

184
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,820
 I actually recommend if you're a writer, just publish your own book.

185
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,820
 It's very, very easy.

186
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,220
 You can do that.

187
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,220
 And that's cool.

188
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,780
 I'm not knocking being a published author, but is that really the greatest adventure

189
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,780
 of your life?

190
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,220
 I don't know, man.

191
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,540
 And being told your, think about the disappointment you would have.

192
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,880
 If the future you told you you're going to do all this great stuff and in the end, you

193
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,400
 publish a book, it sells a couple copies, gets covered on a podcast.

194
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,880
 And that's kind of it.

195
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,440
 That's what I think is interesting.

196
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,520
 Maybe the greatest adventure is still ahead of him.

197
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,880
 I think he's around my age, honestly.

198
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,760
 This story took place, well he was 13, I can figure this out.

199
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,280
 He was 13 in 1976, so he's 13 years older than me.

200
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,400
 He would be 57.

201
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,980
 So he still has a long life ahead of him, but he's still waiting to wake up.

202
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,740
 He's still waiting for everything to make sense.

203
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,820
 Or has that already happened?

204
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,300
 Like if the future me came to me tomorrow and said, dude, things are going to be so amazing

205
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
 for you.

206
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
 You're going to go on this greatest adventure.

207
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,820
 You're going to like help all these people.

208
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,860
 And then 10 years from now, I didn't do any of that stuff.

209
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,900
 I'm still just kind of sitting here waiting for that to happen.

210
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,060
 Like did he lie to him?

211
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,300
 Was he like hyping it up?

212
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
 Was he really not?

213
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
 Was it not the greatest adventure?

214
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,320
 It was just an okay adventure?

215
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,840
 Like how would that affect your psyche?

216
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
 It would be one thing.

217
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
 See, here's the thing.

218
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,000
 It would be one thing if Shirley MacLean was a little girl walking around a semi-solid

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,880
 bog and an adult Shirley MacLean showed up and goes, you're going to revolutionize reincarnation

220
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,680
 beliefs for Americans for the 80s because she's a huge figure in that.

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,240
 You're going to have this huge career.

222
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,400
 Like someone that we can look back on and go, whoa, that was transformative for her.

223
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,840
 So that would make sense.

224
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,420
 We would see that transformative journey with David E. K. Wood.

225
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,660
 I'm sure he's a great dude, but has that happen?

226
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,660
 Has it already happened?

227
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,540
 And it wasn't as big as he thought.

228
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,500
 Like how, how disappointing it would have been to have your future self come out of

229
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,660
 a UFO tell you something great was going to happen.

230
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,340
 And in the end, it was just okay.

231
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,020
 Or does it mean that again, like maybe something great wasn't going to happen, but he took

232
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
 a misstep?

233
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
 I don't know.

234
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
 Publishing a book, that's cool.

235
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,200
 I'm not trying, I don't want this to come across that I'm not going to do.

236
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,900
 Like publishing a book is good, but that's not the greatest adventure of your life.

237
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
 So I don't know.

238
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
 It's weird.

239
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,940
 Like Jason, I think you're focused, I think you're focused more on what the guy said versus

240
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,560
 the fact that you said he met his future self.

241
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,240
 He's friends with a bunch of aliens.

242
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,740
 He has a hybrid daughter.

243
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,880
 It's like all this other stuff.

244
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,040
 It's because I researched that stuff all the time.

245
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,260
 I come across that seems, that might be it actually.

246
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,580
 I don't know anything about it.

247
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,780
 Like to me, that seems very banal, which should show that I'm getting a little jaded.

248
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,220
 That someone could be like, dude, I have a hybrid child in Alpha Centauri and I'm like,

249
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,720
 who do you do?

250
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,220
 Who cares about that?

251
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,020
 David E. K. Wood has a hybrid child.

252
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020
 I'm all walking away.

253
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,220
 They're like, don't you want to hear more?

254
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,140
 I'm like, no, no, I don't want to hear anything.

255
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,660
 Maybe I'm just getting jaded.

256
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,780
 David E. K. Wood, I hope you never skip a leg day.

257
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,020
 I hope you're still working out.

258
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,880
 Even if you haven't had the greatest adventure of your life yet, I hope it is coming soon.

259
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,520
 That sounds a little menacing.

260
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,680
 Colin, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbenter Coptor.

261
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,640
 We are leaving behind Cook Inlet Alaska.

262
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:30,720
 We are headed out to London.

263
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
 And Colin, go ahead and hit that time travel button.

264
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,440
 We're headed back to the early 1790s.

265
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,380
 Colin is flying us through the time vortex.

266
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
 It's London.

267
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
 It's the early 1790s.

268
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,700
 We're wearing our top hats and our nice little outfits.

269
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
 We're walking around.

270
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,380
 We're dressed to the nines.

271
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,140
 In London in the 1790s, there was a dude named James Tillie Matthews.

272
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,420
 He was a London tea broker.

273
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,740
 So he would buy tea and sell tea, apparently.

274
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,660
 All the research I do on UFOs, I wouldn't bother to look at what that is.

275
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,900
 I think it's like a stockbroker, but he just does tea.

276
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,300
 So he's like, sell that tea.

277
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,780
 I'm buying tea.

278
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
 And he has a bunch of tea.

279
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,480
 But he also wants to do something else.

280
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,800
 You can only have so much tea.

281
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,280
 He's trying to make sure that France and England don't go to war.

282
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,640
 Because there was a period of time, there was basically like a thousand years of world

283
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,320
 history where that was constantly happening.

284
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
 And it wasn't just him.

285
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,400
 There was a bunch of other people who didn't want to do it.

286
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,040
 But he didn't want them to go to war.

287
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,000
 So he goes to France.

288
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,320
 This guy, I'm making it sound like this guy just walked down the street yelling at people

289
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,680
 "Sell tea, buy tea."

290
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,000
 He had money.

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,400
 Like he was influential.

292
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,900
 He's able to go to France and talk to people over there.

293
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,060
 He goes to France and he's trying to talk to the leaders over there.

294
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,620
 I mean, like let's not have any more wars with England.

295
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,820
 We're doing this all the time.

296
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,660
 And while he's over there, he's making moves.

297
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
 He's having these meetings.

298
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,460
 It's a bad time to be in France because people's heads are starting to get chopped off.

299
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,340
 They're pulling leaders out of their residences, chopping their heads off.

300
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,060
 And James is visiting these people.

301
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,700
 James is going, "Oh, I'm going to go talk to this dude over here."

302
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,940
 And he sees a bunch of guys rushed in, pull that dude out and chop his head off.

303
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,200
 He's like, "Oh, I think that meeting's been postponed.

304
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,880
 I'm going to talk to someone else."

305
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,080
 But he's a guy from England.

306
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,600
 In France, meeting with all these famous people, he's considered a double agent.

307
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,760
 So they arrest him and they're going to chop his head off.

308
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,360
 And he's absolutely terrified of getting his head chopped off.

309
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,040
 He's going crazy in his cell.

310
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,080
 Even back then, it's 1796 and the French government's looking at this guy and he's

311
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,400
 obviously insane.

312
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,600
 So they go, "We're not going to chop his head off."

313
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,020
 Like, he's probably too insane to be a double agent.

314
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,820
 He's probably too insane to have been sent here by England to rile us up.

315
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,740
 They ship him back to London.

316
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,500
 Now a normal person would have just disappeared on the history books at this point.

317
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,940
 They escaped getting their head chopped off in France.

318
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,420
 I'm going to keep a low profile and just kind of go on with my life.

319
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:56,300
 But James telling Matthews after he's returned to London, begins to publicly accuse British

320
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,140
 government officials of trying to kill him.

321
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,160
 He is saying that there's this conspiracy against him.

322
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,560
 They're all after him.

323
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,320
 He would go and interrupt political events.

324
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,200
 There was a debate at the House of Commons.

325
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,920
 He busts through the doors and starts accusing everyone of trying to murder him.

326
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,560
 Nobody knows who this dude is.

327
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,440
 And he begins saying, "You guys are trying to kill me."

328
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,320
 He gets arrested, thrown into British jail, but he's nuts.

329
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,800
 They're talking to him and they go, "Listen, this guy is absolutely loony.

330
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,260
 How humane is it to have him in this jail cell?"

331
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,020
 They look at his arrest record and they go, "He just got shipped out of France for being

332
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,820
 insane now he's here."

333
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,500
 But they just can't keep playing volleyball with this dude and sending him back to France.

334
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:46,820
 On January 28th, 1797, James telling Matthews is sent to Bedlam Hospital, a notorious mental

335
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,620
 institution in London.

336
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,740
 It's funny, this is where he should be.

337
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,780
 He needed to be in a mental hospital.

338
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:01,120
 This hospital has a horrible reputation for being quite brutal.

339
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,960
 But at the time you're thinking he doesn't belong in jail with the criminals.

340
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,760
 He doesn't deserve getting his head chopped off, either.

341
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,080
 So let's put him in this mental hospital.

342
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,200
 It's not our problem, but it's such a bad place to be as well.

343
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,160
 But out of all those places, it's where he needed to be where there are doctors who could

344
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,600
 treat him.

345
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,780
 But the problem is, nobody knows what's wrong.

346
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:33,620
 He's in there from 1797 to 1810 and nobody can tell what's wrong with this guy.

347
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,700
 They can tell that something's not right, but they can't figure out exactly what it

348
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
 is.

349
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,860
 And you have a medical writer who worked at Bedlam Hospital, he's writing a book about

350
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,780
 James.

351
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,340
 The author's name is John Hoslem.

352
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,340
 He's writing this book.

353
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,340
 He's interviewing James.

354
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,720
 He's taking in everything this guy is spinning out.

355
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,120
 He writes a book called Illustrations of Madness.

356
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,760
 And the point of the book is to say, is James Tilling Matthews actually insane?

357
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,380
 Because you have different levels of insanity.

358
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,380
 We keep using that word.

359
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
 It's kind of a catch-all thing.

360
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,960
 You have people with dementia, with delirium.

361
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,200
 You can't even make sense of what they're talking about.

362
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,160
 That is like old-timey insane-ness.

363
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,300
 You're ralding out the mouth.

364
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
 You have rabies.

365
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
 You have syphilis.

366
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,980
 You have some sort of disease that's rotted holes through your brain madness.

367
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,740
 Your catatonic.

368
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,540
 Your stark, raving lunatic.

369
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,020
 James Tilling Matthews was not that.

370
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,900
 He would burst out in public and accuse people of trying to murder him.

371
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,940
 But then he could go about his business.

372
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,300
 He could make tea deals.

373
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,660
 He could live among the population.

374
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,620
 He could travel to France and try to negotiate with people.

375
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,820
 But he was saying things that people knew were not true.

376
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,700
 He was an alunatic.

377
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,900
 So what is he?

378
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,000
 They keep saying he's insane, he's insane because they can figure out something's wrong

379
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 with him.

380
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But what is he?

381
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,200
 Illustrations of Madness is a book written in 1810 to determine, is James Tilling Matthews

382
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
 actually insane?

383
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
 What is going on here?

384
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,760
 This book goes over all of the beliefs that James Tilling Matthews had.

385
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,980
 To this day, illustrations of madness, not only is it a classic medical text, not only

386
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:27,580
 is it the very first full study of a single psychiatric patient, it is considered the

387
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:33,820
 very first description of paranoid schizophrenia.

388
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,300
 Nobody knew what paranoid schizophrenia was until 1810, and James Tilling Matthews was

389
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:44,120
 the first person to be identified to have paranoid schizophrenia.

390
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,000
 This is fascinating because we've covered stories like this today.

391
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,360
 When we're talking about gang stalking, when we're talking about these paranoid beliefs,

392
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,600
 imagine being the first person to believe in these things.

393
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,080
 This is so interesting.

394
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,920
 James Tilling Matthews would be lucid most of the time, like a lot of people who believe

395
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
 in gang stalking.

396
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,060
 They're not just speaking gibberish, but their beliefs are untrue.

397
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,060
 He believed there was a thing called the heirloom gang.

398
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:20,060
 Not like heirloom, like your grandma's giving you something, heir as in the sky, loom as

399
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,780
 something to weave with.

400
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:31,580
 And they used the heirloom to shoot rays out, invisible beams that would attack people.

401
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,440
 Now we have that, dude, that is so, because people talk about that today with 5G, people

402
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,960
 talk about that now with shedding stuff from the COVID vaccine, like invisible things floating

403
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,040
 around you.

404
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,160
 It used to be the Cold War weapons, it used to be the Russians were beaming stuff into

405
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,520
 your teeth or US satellites, but none of that existed back then.

406
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,400
 I don't even think vaccines existed back then.

407
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:04,220
 I mean, no one technology, the loom, very common thing, and associating a sci-fi element to

408
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,220
 it.

409
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,500
 It's not just a loom, it's an heirloom that's shooting beams out that's giving you buzzes

410
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,580
 and pulses in your skin.

411
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,540
 Fascinating because today when you talk to gang stalkers, we've covered tons of stories

412
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,900
 like this.

413
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,780
 They feel the beams and pulses and things behind their eyes and they have to associate it with

414
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,780
 something.

415
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,560
 The man walking down the street with the dog and when it barks it's releasing some sort

416
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,240
 of infrared beam into his skull.

417
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:40,120
 The heirloom gang, it was a group of commoners, criminals, gang members, spies is what they

418
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
 were.

419
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,040
 When he was walking down the street they would give each other signals and he would realize

420
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,720
 they were gang stalking him.

421
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,280
 He said the heirloom had this thing it would quote "lopster crack him."

422
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,740
 It's a term he came up with.

423
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,380
 The feeling under his skin he called the "lopster crack."

424
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,740
 The heirloom gang would use this heirloom to make his blood stop flowing.

425
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:13,100
 It would also give him stomach issues and could inject fluids directly into his brain.

426
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,620
 So he's having these physiological, or maybe he's not, maybe the physiological things are

427
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,680
 made up as well, but he could simply be having a buzz, a pulse in him and he creates this

428
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,720
 story behind it.

429
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,680
 He believed that there were heirlooms stationed all over London.

430
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,640
 And not only was he under attack, but government figures were also under attack.

431
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,160
 It's interesting when you look at the story of Kyle Odom, which most famously believed

432
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,080
 that he was, if I remember correctly, it's been a while since I read his manifesto, but

433
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,300
 he had been raped by reptilian aliens.

434
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,260
 And so he confronted one of the people who he thought was a reptilian alien.

435
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,380
 It was a local minister and he shot him several times in the head with a handgun.

436
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
 The minister survived.

437
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,340
 He's actually a member of a Senate now or something like that, state Senate I think.

438
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,580
 But what gets lost in that story?

439
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,780
 That one's real, I haven't covered that on the show because it's so popular, but a detail

440
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:12,540
 that gets lost in that story was that Kyle Odom also believed President Obama was raped

441
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,660
 by reptilians.

442
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,440
 And he tried getting word to President Obama that we're in on this together, like you

443
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,880
 and me bro, we can take down these reptilians.

444
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
 Same thing going here.

445
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,160
 James Tilly Matthew believes not only is he being targeted by the heirloom gang, but

446
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,120
 other politicians are as well.

447
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
 So it's not just him.

448
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,520
 He's part of a broader group of resistance fighters against this heirloom gang.

449
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,800
 So that is why he's trying to meet with politicians.

450
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 He knows the truth.

451
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,420
 He can help them overcome the bad guys.

452
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,980
 Again, when someone's saying this, like nowadays when someone says like when I can immediately

453
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,460
 read this and go, oh, that's just like Kyle Odom believing that with President Obama.

454
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,220
 Back then people are like, what are you talking about?

455
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,540
 None of this is making any sense.

456
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,940
 This guy would easily be diagnosed today for having paranoid schizophrenia.

457
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,420
 But back then it had never been discovered yet.

458
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,620
 The heirloom gang was trying to take over the country, possibly the world.

459
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,720
 They had people all the way up the chain.

460
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,440
 They were attacking members of the military.

461
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,360
 They had already taken over parts of the military.

462
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,720
 This was a existential threat to the government, if not the world.

463
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,800
 He was locked in Bedelam until he died in 1815.

464
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,520
 So the book came out in 1810.

465
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,280
 He was there for another five years.

466
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:38,040
 But in 1814, one year before he died, all of the delusions went away.

467
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,480
 Stopped believing in the heirloom gang.

468
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,880
 Stopped believing in all of this nonsense.

469
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,400
 He just decided to stay in Bedelam.

470
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,040
 He really had nowhere else to go at that point.

471
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,560
 Remember he'd been locked up.

472
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,680
 He would been in and out of jail in France and in England and then he'd been locked in

473
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,680
 Bedelam at this point for about 17 years.

474
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,840
 So he's like, I'm just going to stay here.

475
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,040
 I mean, he's just like, what?

476
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
 I'm done.

477
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
 I'll probably end up dying next year.

478
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
 They're like, how do you know that?

479
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,320
 He's like, it's just a hunch.

480
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
 He just stayed there.

481
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,760
 And around the same time they were doing a competition.

482
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,600
 They, the government knew that Bedelam wasn't working out.

483
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,080
 They knew it was a really, really physically poorly designed mental institution.

484
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,720
 It looked super scary.

485
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,400
 It was super scary.

486
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,160
 They actually had a public competition to try to redesign Bedelam.

487
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,480
 And James Tilly Matthews won.

488
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,960
 I mean, he kind of knew the place inside and out.

489
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,280
 He'd been there for 17 years.

490
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,560
 He submitted a 46 page booklet of designs and he won the contest and they actually took

491
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,760
 some of those designs and used them to improve Bedelam.

492
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,240
 And while Hoslem was writing his book about James Tilly Matthews, James Tilly Matthews

493
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,760
 was writing a book about Hoslem and how Bedelam should be reformed.

494
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,400
 And after James Tilly Matthews died, because this book was a huge hit in the medical community.

495
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,680
 They'd never seen anything like it.

496
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,480
 So he had become a known figure at this time.

497
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,560
 And after he passed away, his book on how to reform Bedelam, along with his physical

498
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,960
 designs to improve Bedelam, were both put into effect.

499
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,960
 And Hoslem lost his job actually after it because they've read all this stuff that was

500
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,120
 going wrong with Bedelam from James Tilly Matthews and since Hoslem had kind of made

501
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,800
 him popular, they read all this other stuff and he was let go.

502
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
 Along with other people as well.

503
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,520
 It wasn't all Hoslem's fault.

504
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,240
 But it's a terrifying story to me.

505
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,080
 I mean, it ended up good for James Tilly Matthews.

506
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,600
 Like, I mean, he did do 17 years in Bedelam.

507
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,640
 But in the end, you know, he was cured.

508
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
 They went away.

509
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
 He became lucid again.

510
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,400
 He realized what he thought was wrong.

511
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,040
 But imagine being the first person to suffer from a mental illness.

512
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,480
 How terrifying that must be.

513
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,440
 There's already such issues with chaos, mental chaos and stuff not making sense and your

514
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,960
 loved ones not believing you.

515
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,280
 Why aren't they believing me?

516
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,320
 Why can't they see the truth?

517
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,120
 But that person can then be put in front of a couple doctors and they can observe them

518
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,240
 and take notes and say this is what they have.

519
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,520
 This is the mental illness they have.

520
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,080
 These are the treatments available.

521
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:22,440
 But what if you're the first one to have that mental illness?

522
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,840
 Now James Tilly Matthews in history probably wasn't the first person to have paranoid schizophrenia.

523
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,600
 But he was the first one identified.

524
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:37,160
 You had probably people in farm towns and villages come down with this, accused the

525
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,640
 local mayor of trying to poison the water supply, thinking that the cows are following

526
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,640
 them and they have the evil eye installed and a witch is trying to take over the town.

527
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,560
 Those people were probably considered cursed, probably killed or just locked up or exiled

528
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,400
 out of the village.

529
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,120
 But James Tilly Matthews was the first person in modern society that they could identify

530
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
 who had this.

531
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,920
 Who knows how many other, this is going to sound weird, but who knows how many other

532
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,480
 extremely rare mental illnesses are out there in the world.

533
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,720
 They pop up once every hundred years, once every thousand years they're so rare.

534
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:25,320
 But you get stricken with one of these things and you can't be treated for it.

535
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:32,000
 Their delusions are unrecognizable to any medical professional.

536
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,120
 They can't figure out what causes them, they can't figure out where they're coming from,

537
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,880
 they can't figure out how to treat it.

538
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,160
 All they can do is lock you up, keep you under observation because they don't know how it

539
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,160
 progresses, they don't know if you're going to get violent, they don't know if you're

540
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,680
 going to hurt yourself or other people.

541
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:57,600
 You become a medical freak to be studied, examined, and even then they can't figure

542
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,040
 out what's wrong with you.

543
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,040
 Somebody always has to be the unfortunate first.

544
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,440
 Whether it's a physical illness like AIDS, doctors just stood around and they go "I

545
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,160
 don't know what's killing this young man."

546
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,440
 Or it's a mental disease like paranoid schizophrenia.

547
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,400
 But who knows what else is out there?

548
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:28,040
 Who knows what other diseases are just waiting to be unlocked and unleashed on humanity?

549
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,920
 The world is resilient and eventually they'll find a cure.

550
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,160
 But what happens if you're the first person to get it?

551
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,520
 You're the first person to be locked in an isolation ward as doctors stand around you

552
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,240
 furiously writing notes.

553
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,840
 We all think our lives will end up great.

554
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,760
 We all think we are important people.

555
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:03,560
 But what if your mark on world history is to be the first human struck down with a terrible,

556
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:11,240
 unknown disease?

557
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,680
