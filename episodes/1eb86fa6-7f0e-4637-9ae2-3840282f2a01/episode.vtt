 So make Honey Bunches of Oats cereal part of your morning routine, and make a bunch happen!

 Pick up a box of Honey Bunches of Oats in the cereal aisle today!

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.400
 A young man is visited by aliens and promised an amazing future.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.400
 But what happens if it doesn't come true?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.860
 And then we meet a man who believes that the government is out to get him, that he's being

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.040
 gangstalked, that people in the highest levels of government are using secret technology

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.280
 to try to kill him.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.560
 What makes him different than any of the other lunatics we've covered with this delusion?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.560
 He was the very first one to have today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.760
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter, I'm having a great day.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, we've got a lot of cool stuff to cover today.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.480
 So first off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, rolling into Dead

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.120
 Rabbit Command right now in a little blanket rolling around, it's Colin A. Raymond.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.200
 Everyone give a round of applause to Colin A. Raymond.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.440
 Thank you so much for supporting this show, you can go ahead and stand up now.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.440
 You can stand up.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.480
 Colin, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode, if you guys can't support

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.200
 the Patreon that's fine too.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.440
 Just helps spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.880
 Colin, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.840
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're going to take a nice aerial journey

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.640
 from DRC, you didn't know there was an acronym for it?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.200
 We are headed out to Cook Inlet, Alaska.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.440
 Colin is flying us through the friendly skies towards the north, unless you live in Alaska

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.800
 and it's already around the corner and you're going to meet us there.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:17.920
 In September of 1976 in Cook Inlet, Alaska, there was a young boy sitting at home.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 He's whistling to himself.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920
 Wait never mind.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.440
 I looked a sentence down on my notes.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:38.560
 He was walking out of a semi-solid bog.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.840
 I don't know what that is.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.520
 It does not explain why he's there.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.760
 It would have made far more sense if he was whistling in his bedroom.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.600
 I don't know what a semi-solid bog is.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.760
 I'm assuming it's just a swamp that you don't immediately sink in.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.760
 Anyways, that exists in Alaska.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.920
 If you guys don't buy the fact that that's a real thing, the rest of the story is even

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.240
 more fantabulous.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.440
 Walking out of a semi-solid bog is David E. K. Wood.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.640
 He's a 13 year old boy.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.240
 He's walking out of this thing that may or may not exist in Alaska.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.320
 Anyways, or what he was doing there, I don't know if he was burying a couple bodies.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.640
 He's like, not only will no one find you for 500 years, but when they do, you'll be perfectly

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 preserved.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.480
 I love my evidence to be a long lasting and never decaying.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.240
 David E. K. Wood is walking out of this semi-solid bog and he sees two UFOs hovering over the

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.240
 area.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.880
 (Dog whining)

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.560
 He thought the whole story was just gonna be about how weird bogs are.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.560
 No.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.520
 He sees two UFOs hovering over the area and he's like "Golly, look at them UFOs.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.260
 I wonder if they saw me murder those people."

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:51.000
 And then a blue beam of light flashes down from one of the UFOs.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.960
 And then a man walks out of the beam.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.560
 David is looking at this man and the man's walking out of the beam.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.420
 It's David as an adult.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.680
 David sees himself as an adult walking out of the beam.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.220
 A much older, much more muscular David.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.720
 This dude's been hitting the gym, been hitting the space gym.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.580
 He goes "Anti-gravity weights are all the rage in space."

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.460
 Even though they're anti-gravity, they're super easy to lift up.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.220
 Aliens are like "Look at how strong I am."

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.740
 Adult David walks up to little David and he's like "He looks over the bog and he's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.220
 like they'll never find those bodies.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.340
 I'm from the future to let you know.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.980
 Your crimes will be undiscovered."

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.340
 And then actually what he actually said was "Don't be afraid little David."

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.660
 And he begins to talk to little David.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.660
 He started to tell him a little bit about the future because this is, it's not a clone.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.320
 This is David E.K. Wood from the future.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.320
 He tells little David that soon he will quote "Be involved in the greatest adventure of

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.000
 his life."

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.720
 He says "Some day you're gonna help many, many people.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.320
 One day when the time is right, you will wake up little David.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.320
 You will see the world clearly for the first time.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.960
 I just want you to know that you are loved.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.180
 You are loved by many, many people."

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.620
 And with that big David turns around, walks back under the beam of light, teleports aboard.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.220
 UFOs leave the area.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.740
 David E.K. Wood went on to write a book called Alien Ali where he talks about his experiences

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.900
 and he started, this was just the beginning.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.060
 He starts getting beam to board ships regularly.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.540
 He's like walking home from school.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.700
 He's like "Oh man, I hope a ship beams me aboard.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.180
 My legs are tired and sure enough UFO beams aboard."

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.120
 He goes through the normal rigamarole that we see with abductees, but he doesn't like

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.920
 the term "abductee."

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.560
 He prefers the term "experiencer" because he sees it as totally consensual that he's

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.280
 getting kidnapped by these aliens.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.080
 So he writes this book called Alien Ali about his experiences and like I said, it's the

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.080
 normal stuff.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.080
 He's meeting Greys.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.000
 He has a hybrid child named Shannon.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.080
 This little girl, Shannon, somewhere up in the space.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.520
 That's a dead meat dad for you, right?

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.620
 You have a baby and you're like "I'll take custody of it every ninth lifetime."

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.540
 You just fly around in space for a while.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.860
 This is an interesting story.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.420
 It's super run of the mill, right?

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.060
 Nothing, I mean he did meet a future version of himself that we don't normally see in

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.540
 an abductee or an experiencer story.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.980
 Overall, it's just kind of he's visiting grey aliens, have the hybrid child stuff.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.980
 It's pretty basic.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.380
 The reason why I wanted to cover this was for a couple of reasons.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.320
 There's this weird thing, we see people who have abduction experiences do this a lot of

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.840
 times they'll draw pictures of themselves in the UFO.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.280
 If David E. K. was listening to this, he knows exactly what I'm getting to.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.280
 He's like "Really?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.800
 That's what you're gonna focus in on?"

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.680
 He draws pictures of himself aboard these UFOs.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.880
 There's a lot of these pictures and they're like drawn with crayons.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.440
 Apparently I can't say that word correctly because the other day I told someone there

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.840
 was a box of crayons in the corner and they're like "What are you talking about?"

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.380
 They're like a little kid coloring.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.260
 Now I'm a terrible artist so I'm not gonna art shame anyone.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.740
 I can't draw nothing.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.860
 But even though I can't draw anything, I will not use crayons to draw because it makes

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.460
 it look like a kid's drawing.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.900
 So if I'm gonna be like "Officer, you won't believe what happened."

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.700
 And I got abducted by aliens and here's a drawing and it's like a picture of a couple

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.300
 of stick people but it's done with crayons.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.740
 It automatically makes it look childlike.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.620
 I'd get a pencil or something like that.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.240
 So I will art shame you for that.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.800
 Secondly, the drawings are hilarious because it's always like a picture of a great alien.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.200
 How you would imagine a great alien would be like skinny little arms, big head.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.800
 He draws a picture of his daughter with a kind of a busted up looking head because she

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.640
 is half alien.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.480
 She's not gonna win any beauty passions, right?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.800
 And then she's got like little alien arms.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.200
 He draws himself super detailed.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.420
 He draws himself super detailed.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.980
 Huge muscular body.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.540
 There's one drawing where he's naked and it's just his bubble butt.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.700
 Like there's a bunch of great aliens standing around naked David E.K. would have like this

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.620
 perfectly sculpted giant bubble butt on him.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.860
 Like everything, like there's alien control panels in the background.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.580
 Out of this world technology that scientists would love to see.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.580
 He's like just drawing little dots.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.820
 I don't know what that looked like.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.840
 But check out my abs.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.600
 Check out my calves.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.600
 It's hilarious.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600
 I love it.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.600
 Thank you, David E.K.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.840
 That was so great.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.960
 He draws himself in such great detail.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.280
 The other reason why I wanted to cover this story because I can't really just keep talking

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.240
 about drawings on podcasts.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.040
 The other reason why I wanted to cover this story is you don't know who David E.K. would

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.040
 be.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.240
 Some of you guys may know who he is.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.560
 I had no idea who he was until I saw this story.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:57.340
 And I found this story on ThinkAbout@Docs.com which catalogs every UFO sighting.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.620
 I mean it is a great resource.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.620
 Think about it.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.700
 Docs.com is one of the best ongoing resources we found on the show.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.140
 If you're a fan of UFOs, check out that website.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.140
 It's phenomenal.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.660
 But that's where I found this on and it was catalogued with every single thing else.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.140
 I never heard of this guy.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.820
 And I'm not saying that I'm the Indole Beall of all paranormal UFO knowledge because I'm

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.820
 not.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.600
 It's the stuff I cover on the show I'm really hearing most of it for the first time.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.040
 But not everyone gets a message that they're going to be great.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.200
 That they're going to change the world.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.840
 That he's going to help all of these people.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.600
 In the end of the day, I'm sure he's a lovely dude, right?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.160
 According to his drawings, he's quite handsome.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.080
 But I'm sure personality wise, I'm sure he's a pretty nice guy.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.560
 I'm sure he's pretty chill.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.920
 But what if a future you showed up and told you you're going to go on this greatest adventure

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.820
 and you, I don't want to feel like I'm knocking the guy because I'm not.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.140
 But the future you comes back and tells you you're going to go on the greatest adventure

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.540
 and you publish a book.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.260
 Which anyone can do that.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.260
 Amazon self publishing.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.820
 I actually recommend if you're a writer, just publish your own book.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.820
 It's very, very easy.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.220
 You can do that.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.220
 And that's cool.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.780
 I'm not knocking being a published author, but is that really the greatest adventure

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.780
 of your life?

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.220
 I don't know, man.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.540
 And being told your, think about the disappointment you would have.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.880
 If the future you told you you're going to do all this great stuff and in the end, you

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.400
 publish a book, it sells a couple copies, gets covered on a podcast.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.880
 And that's kind of it.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.440
 That's what I think is interesting.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.520
 Maybe the greatest adventure is still ahead of him.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.880
 I think he's around my age, honestly.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.760
 This story took place, well he was 13, I can figure this out.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.280
 He was 13 in 1976, so he's 13 years older than me.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.400
 He would be 57.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.980
 So he still has a long life ahead of him, but he's still waiting to wake up.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.740
 He's still waiting for everything to make sense.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.820
 Or has that already happened?

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:59.300
 Like if the future me came to me tomorrow and said, dude, things are going to be so amazing

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.300
 for you.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.300
 You're going to go on this greatest adventure.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.820
 You're going to like help all these people.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.860
 And then 10 years from now, I didn't do any of that stuff.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.900
 I'm still just kind of sitting here waiting for that to happen.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.060
 Like did he lie to him?

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.300
 Was he like hyping it up?

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.300
 Was he really not?

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.300
 Was it not the greatest adventure?

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.320
 It was just an okay adventure?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.840
 Like how would that affect your psyche?

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.840
 It would be one thing.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.840
 See, here's the thing.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:28.000
 It would be one thing if Shirley MacLean was a little girl walking around a semi-solid

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.880
 bog and an adult Shirley MacLean showed up and goes, you're going to revolutionize reincarnation

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.680
 beliefs for Americans for the 80s because she's a huge figure in that.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.240
 You're going to have this huge career.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.400
 Like someone that we can look back on and go, whoa, that was transformative for her.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.840
 So that would make sense.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.420
 We would see that transformative journey with David E. K. Wood.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.660
 I'm sure he's a great dude, but has that happen?

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.660
 Has it already happened?

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.540
 And it wasn't as big as he thought.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.500
 Like how, how disappointing it would have been to have your future self come out of

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.660
 a UFO tell you something great was going to happen.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:06.340
 And in the end, it was just okay.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.020
 Or does it mean that again, like maybe something great wasn't going to happen, but he took

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.020
 a misstep?

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.020
 I don't know.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.020
 Publishing a book, that's cool.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.200
 I'm not trying, I don't want this to come across that I'm not going to do.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.900
 Like publishing a book is good, but that's not the greatest adventure of your life.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.900
 So I don't know.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.900
 It's weird.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:29.940
 Like Jason, I think you're focused, I think you're focused more on what the guy said versus

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.560
 the fact that you said he met his future self.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.240
 He's friends with a bunch of aliens.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.740
 He has a hybrid daughter.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.880
 It's like all this other stuff.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.040
 It's because I researched that stuff all the time.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.260
 I come across that seems, that might be it actually.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.580
 I don't know anything about it.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.780
 Like to me, that seems very banal, which should show that I'm getting a little jaded.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.220
 That someone could be like, dude, I have a hybrid child in Alpha Centauri and I'm like,

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.720
 who do you do?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.220
 Who cares about that?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.020
 David E. K. Wood has a hybrid child.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.020
 I'm all walking away.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.220
 They're like, don't you want to hear more?

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.140
 I'm like, no, no, I don't want to hear anything.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.660
 Maybe I'm just getting jaded.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.780
 David E. K. Wood, I hope you never skip a leg day.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.020
 I hope you're still working out.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.880
 Even if you haven't had the greatest adventure of your life yet, I hope it is coming soon.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.520
 That sounds a little menacing.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.680
 Colin, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbenter Coptor.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.640
 We are leaving behind Cook Inlet Alaska.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:30.720
 We are headed out to London.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.720
 And Colin, go ahead and hit that time travel button.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.440
 We're headed back to the early 1790s.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.380
 Colin is flying us through the time vortex.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.380
 It's London.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.380
 It's the early 1790s.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.700
 We're wearing our top hats and our nice little outfits.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.700
 We're walking around.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.380
 We're dressed to the nines.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.140
 In London in the 1790s, there was a dude named James Tillie Matthews.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.420
 He was a London tea broker.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.740
 So he would buy tea and sell tea, apparently.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.660
 All the research I do on UFOs, I wouldn't bother to look at what that is.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.900
 I think it's like a stockbroker, but he just does tea.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.300
 So he's like, sell that tea.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.780
 I'm buying tea.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.780
 And he has a bunch of tea.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.480
 But he also wants to do something else.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.800
 You can only have so much tea.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.280
 He's trying to make sure that France and England don't go to war.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.640
 Because there was a period of time, there was basically like a thousand years of world

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.320
 history where that was constantly happening.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.320
 And it wasn't just him.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.400
 There was a bunch of other people who didn't want to do it.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.040
 But he didn't want them to go to war.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.000
 So he goes to France.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.320
 This guy, I'm making it sound like this guy just walked down the street yelling at people

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.680
 "Sell tea, buy tea."

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.000
 He had money.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.400
 Like he was influential.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.900
 He's able to go to France and talk to people over there.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.060
 He goes to France and he's trying to talk to the leaders over there.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.620
 I mean, like let's not have any more wars with England.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.820
 We're doing this all the time.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.660
 And while he's over there, he's making moves.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.660
 He's having these meetings.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.460
 It's a bad time to be in France because people's heads are starting to get chopped off.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.340
 They're pulling leaders out of their residences, chopping their heads off.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.060
 And James is visiting these people.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.700
 James is going, "Oh, I'm going to go talk to this dude over here."

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.940
 And he sees a bunch of guys rushed in, pull that dude out and chop his head off.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.200
 He's like, "Oh, I think that meeting's been postponed.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.880
 I'm going to talk to someone else."

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.080
 But he's a guy from England.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.600
 In France, meeting with all these famous people, he's considered a double agent.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.760
 So they arrest him and they're going to chop his head off.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.360
 And he's absolutely terrified of getting his head chopped off.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.040
 He's going crazy in his cell.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.080
 Even back then, it's 1796 and the French government's looking at this guy and he's

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.400
 obviously insane.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.600
 So they go, "We're not going to chop his head off."

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.020
 Like, he's probably too insane to be a double agent.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.820
 He's probably too insane to have been sent here by England to rile us up.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.740
 They ship him back to London.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.500
 Now a normal person would have just disappeared on the history books at this point.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.940
 They escaped getting their head chopped off in France.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.420
 I'm going to keep a low profile and just kind of go on with my life.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:56.300
 But James telling Matthews after he's returned to London, begins to publicly accuse British

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.140
 government officials of trying to kill him.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:03.160
 He is saying that there's this conspiracy against him.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.560
 They're all after him.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.320
 He would go and interrupt political events.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.200
 There was a debate at the House of Commons.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.920
 He busts through the doors and starts accusing everyone of trying to murder him.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.560
 Nobody knows who this dude is.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.440
 And he begins saying, "You guys are trying to kill me."

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.320
 He gets arrested, thrown into British jail, but he's nuts.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.800
 They're talking to him and they go, "Listen, this guy is absolutely loony.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.260
 How humane is it to have him in this jail cell?"

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.020
 They look at his arrest record and they go, "He just got shipped out of France for being

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.820
 insane now he's here."

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.500
 But they just can't keep playing volleyball with this dude and sending him back to France.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:46.820
 On January 28th, 1797, James telling Matthews is sent to Bedlam Hospital, a notorious mental

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.620
 institution in London.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.740
 It's funny, this is where he should be.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.780
 He needed to be in a mental hospital.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:01.120
 This hospital has a horrible reputation for being quite brutal.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.960
 But at the time you're thinking he doesn't belong in jail with the criminals.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.760
 He doesn't deserve getting his head chopped off, either.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.080
 So let's put him in this mental hospital.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.200
 It's not our problem, but it's such a bad place to be as well.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.160
 But out of all those places, it's where he needed to be where there are doctors who could

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.600
 treat him.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.780
 But the problem is, nobody knows what's wrong.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:33.620
 He's in there from 1797 to 1810 and nobody can tell what's wrong with this guy.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.700
 They can tell that something's not right, but they can't figure out exactly what it

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.700
 is.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.860
 And you have a medical writer who worked at Bedlam Hospital, he's writing a book about

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.780
 James.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.340
 The author's name is John Hoslem.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.340
 He's writing this book.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.340
 He's interviewing James.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.720
 He's taking in everything this guy is spinning out.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.120
 He writes a book called Illustrations of Madness.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:01.760
 And the point of the book is to say, is James Tilling Matthews actually insane?

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.380
 Because you have different levels of insanity.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.380
 We keep using that word.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.380
 It's kind of a catch-all thing.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.960
 You have people with dementia, with delirium.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.200
 You can't even make sense of what they're talking about.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.160
 That is like old-timey insane-ness.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.300
 You're ralding out the mouth.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.300
 You have rabies.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.300
 You have syphilis.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.980
 You have some sort of disease that's rotted holes through your brain madness.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.740
 Your catatonic.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.540
 Your stark, raving lunatic.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.020
 James Tilling Matthews was not that.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.900
 He would burst out in public and accuse people of trying to murder him.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.940
 But then he could go about his business.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.300
 He could make tea deals.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.660
 He could live among the population.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.620
 He could travel to France and try to negotiate with people.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.820
 But he was saying things that people knew were not true.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.700
 He was an alunatic.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.900
 So what is he?

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.000
 They keep saying he's insane, he's insane because they can figure out something's wrong

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 with him.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 But what is he?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.200
 Illustrations of Madness is a book written in 1810 to determine, is James Tilling Matthews

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.200
 actually insane?

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.200
 What is going on here?

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.760
 This book goes over all of the beliefs that James Tilling Matthews had.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:20.980
 To this day, illustrations of madness, not only is it a classic medical text, not only

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:27.580
 is it the very first full study of a single psychiatric patient, it is considered the

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:33.820
 very first description of paranoid schizophrenia.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.300
 Nobody knew what paranoid schizophrenia was until 1810, and James Tilling Matthews was

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:44.120
 the first person to be identified to have paranoid schizophrenia.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.000
 This is fascinating because we've covered stories like this today.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.360
 When we're talking about gang stalking, when we're talking about these paranoid beliefs,

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.600
 imagine being the first person to believe in these things.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.080
 This is so interesting.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.920
 James Tilling Matthews would be lucid most of the time, like a lot of people who believe

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.920
 in gang stalking.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:11.060
 They're not just speaking gibberish, but their beliefs are untrue.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.060
 He believed there was a thing called the heirloom gang.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:20.060
 Not like heirloom, like your grandma's giving you something, heir as in the sky, loom as

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.780
 something to weave with.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:31.580
 And they used the heirloom to shoot rays out, invisible beams that would attack people.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:36.440
 Now we have that, dude, that is so, because people talk about that today with 5G, people

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.960
 talk about that now with shedding stuff from the COVID vaccine, like invisible things floating

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.040
 around you.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.160
 It used to be the Cold War weapons, it used to be the Russians were beaming stuff into

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.520
 your teeth or US satellites, but none of that existed back then.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.400
 I don't even think vaccines existed back then.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:04.220
 I mean, no one technology, the loom, very common thing, and associating a sci-fi element to

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.220
 it.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.500
 It's not just a loom, it's an heirloom that's shooting beams out that's giving you buzzes

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.580
 and pulses in your skin.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.540
 Fascinating because today when you talk to gang stalkers, we've covered tons of stories

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.900
 like this.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.780
 They feel the beams and pulses and things behind their eyes and they have to associate it with

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.780
 something.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.560
 The man walking down the street with the dog and when it barks it's releasing some sort

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.240
 of infrared beam into his skull.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:40.120
 The heirloom gang, it was a group of commoners, criminals, gang members, spies is what they

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.120
 were.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.040
 When he was walking down the street they would give each other signals and he would realize

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.720
 they were gang stalking him.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.280
 He said the heirloom had this thing it would quote "lopster crack him."

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.740
 It's a term he came up with.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.380
 The feeling under his skin he called the "lopster crack."

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.740
 The heirloom gang would use this heirloom to make his blood stop flowing.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:13.100
 It would also give him stomach issues and could inject fluids directly into his brain.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.620
 So he's having these physiological, or maybe he's not, maybe the physiological things are

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:23.680
 made up as well, but he could simply be having a buzz, a pulse in him and he creates this

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.720
 story behind it.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.680
 He believed that there were heirlooms stationed all over London.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.640
 And not only was he under attack, but government figures were also under attack.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.160
 It's interesting when you look at the story of Kyle Odom, which most famously believed

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.080
 that he was, if I remember correctly, it's been a while since I read his manifesto, but

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.300
 he had been raped by reptilian aliens.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.260
 And so he confronted one of the people who he thought was a reptilian alien.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.380
 It was a local minister and he shot him several times in the head with a handgun.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.380
 The minister survived.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.340
 He's actually a member of a Senate now or something like that, state Senate I think.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.580
 But what gets lost in that story?

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.780
 That one's real, I haven't covered that on the show because it's so popular, but a detail

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:12.540
 that gets lost in that story was that Kyle Odom also believed President Obama was raped

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.660
 by reptilians.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.440
 And he tried getting word to President Obama that we're in on this together, like you

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.880
 and me bro, we can take down these reptilians.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880
 Same thing going here.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.160
 James Tilly Matthew believes not only is he being targeted by the heirloom gang, but

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.120
 other politicians are as well.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.640
 So it's not just him.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.520
 He's part of a broader group of resistance fighters against this heirloom gang.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.800
 So that is why he's trying to meet with politicians.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.800
 He knows the truth.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.420
 He can help them overcome the bad guys.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.980
 Again, when someone's saying this, like nowadays when someone says like when I can immediately

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.460
 read this and go, oh, that's just like Kyle Odom believing that with President Obama.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.220
 Back then people are like, what are you talking about?

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.540
 None of this is making any sense.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.940
 This guy would easily be diagnosed today for having paranoid schizophrenia.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.420
 But back then it had never been discovered yet.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.620
 The heirloom gang was trying to take over the country, possibly the world.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.720
 They had people all the way up the chain.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.440
 They were attacking members of the military.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.360
 They had already taken over parts of the military.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.720
 This was a existential threat to the government, if not the world.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.800
 He was locked in Bedelam until he died in 1815.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.520
 So the book came out in 1810.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.280
 He was there for another five years.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:38.040
 But in 1814, one year before he died, all of the delusions went away.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.480
 Stopped believing in the heirloom gang.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.880
 Stopped believing in all of this nonsense.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.400
 He just decided to stay in Bedelam.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.040
 He really had nowhere else to go at that point.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.560
 Remember he'd been locked up.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.680
 He would been in and out of jail in France and in England and then he'd been locked in

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.680
 Bedelam at this point for about 17 years.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.840
 So he's like, I'm just going to stay here.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.040
 I mean, he's just like, what?

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.040
 I'm done.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.040
 I'll probably end up dying next year.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.040
 They're like, how do you know that?

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.320
 He's like, it's just a hunch.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.320
 He just stayed there.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.760
 And around the same time they were doing a competition.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.600
 They, the government knew that Bedelam wasn't working out.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:18.080
 They knew it was a really, really physically poorly designed mental institution.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.720
 It looked super scary.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.400
 It was super scary.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.160
 They actually had a public competition to try to redesign Bedelam.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.480
 And James Tilly Matthews won.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.960
 I mean, he kind of knew the place inside and out.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.280
 He'd been there for 17 years.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:37.560
 He submitted a 46 page booklet of designs and he won the contest and they actually took

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.760
 some of those designs and used them to improve Bedelam.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.240
 And while Hoslem was writing his book about James Tilly Matthews, James Tilly Matthews

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.760
 was writing a book about Hoslem and how Bedelam should be reformed.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.400
 And after James Tilly Matthews died, because this book was a huge hit in the medical community.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.680
 They'd never seen anything like it.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.480
 So he had become a known figure at this time.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.560
 And after he passed away, his book on how to reform Bedelam, along with his physical

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.960
 designs to improve Bedelam, were both put into effect.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.960
 And Hoslem lost his job actually after it because they've read all this stuff that was

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.120
 going wrong with Bedelam from James Tilly Matthews and since Hoslem had kind of made

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.800
 him popular, they read all this other stuff and he was let go.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.800
 Along with other people as well.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.520
 It wasn't all Hoslem's fault.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.240
 But it's a terrifying story to me.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.080
 I mean, it ended up good for James Tilly Matthews.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.600
 Like, I mean, he did do 17 years in Bedelam.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.640
 But in the end, you know, he was cured.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.640
 They went away.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.640
 He became lucid again.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.400
 He realized what he thought was wrong.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:47.040
 But imagine being the first person to suffer from a mental illness.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.480
 How terrifying that must be.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:54.440
 There's already such issues with chaos, mental chaos and stuff not making sense and your

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.960
 loved ones not believing you.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.280
 Why aren't they believing me?

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.320
 Why can't they see the truth?

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:06.120
 But that person can then be put in front of a couple doctors and they can observe them

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.240
 and take notes and say this is what they have.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.520
 This is the mental illness they have.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.080
 These are the treatments available.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:22.440
 But what if you're the first one to have that mental illness?

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.840
 Now James Tilly Matthews in history probably wasn't the first person to have paranoid schizophrenia.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.600
 But he was the first one identified.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:37.160
 You had probably people in farm towns and villages come down with this, accused the

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.640
 local mayor of trying to poison the water supply, thinking that the cows are following

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.640
 them and they have the evil eye installed and a witch is trying to take over the town.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:55.560
 Those people were probably considered cursed, probably killed or just locked up or exiled

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.400
 out of the village.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.120
 But James Tilly Matthews was the first person in modern society that they could identify

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.120
 who had this.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.920
 Who knows how many other, this is going to sound weird, but who knows how many other

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:12.480
 extremely rare mental illnesses are out there in the world.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.720
 They pop up once every hundred years, once every thousand years they're so rare.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:25.320
 But you get stricken with one of these things and you can't be treated for it.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:32.000
 Their delusions are unrecognizable to any medical professional.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.120
 They can't figure out what causes them, they can't figure out where they're coming from,

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.880
 they can't figure out how to treat it.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.160
 All they can do is lock you up, keep you under observation because they don't know how it

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.160
 progresses, they don't know if you're going to get violent, they don't know if you're

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.680
 going to hurt yourself or other people.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:57.600
 You become a medical freak to be studied, examined, and even then they can't figure

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.040
 out what's wrong with you.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.040
 Somebody always has to be the unfortunate first.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.440
 Whether it's a physical illness like AIDS, doctors just stood around and they go "I

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.160
 don't know what's killing this young man."

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.440
 Or it's a mental disease like paranoid schizophrenia.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.400
 But who knows what else is out there?

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:28.040
 Who knows what other diseases are just waiting to be unlocked and unleashed on humanity?

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:33.920
 The world is resilient and eventually they'll find a cure.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.160
 But what happens if you're the first person to get it?

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.520
 You're the first person to be locked in an isolation ward as doctors stand around you

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.240
 furiously writing notes.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.840
 We all think our lives will end up great.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.760
 We all think we are important people.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:30:03.560
 But what if your mark on world history is to be the first human struck down with a terrible,

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:11.240
 unknown disease?

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.680
