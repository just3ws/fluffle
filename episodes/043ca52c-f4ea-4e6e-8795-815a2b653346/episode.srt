6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 A war in heaven. Demons invading our planet.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Satan's forces standing at the threshold.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 These are stories we've heard for hundreds of years.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 In the city of Miami, the boys and girls of homeless parents cuddle together for warmth.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Whether they're sleeping in a shelter or at a bus stop, they believe one thing.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 God has abandoned them all, and only they can save the world.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 [music]

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 We've got a lot of stuff to cover this episode. We're not going to do a shout out because we're not going to be flying any vehicles. That's why.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 This is actually a story I've been wanting to do for a long time, and I got to give a shout out to the journalist who compiled this entire saga.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Her name is Linda Edwards, and she wrote an article for the New Miami Times called Myths Over Miami.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Let's go ahead and get started here, guys. December 25th, 1996.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 God is sitting in his palace in heaven.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 [gunshots]

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Something is pounding on the gates of heaven. His angels are running to and fro, getting their weapons to hold off the assault, but God just sits there on his throne.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 He's been waiting for this day, but he doesn't know how to fight back.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 The gates of heaven are thrown open. The arm is of hell.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Pour over the walls. Climb the battlements. Slaughter God's angels.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And he only watches this. He can stop it at any moment, but he just watches this horror in front of him.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And then he sees her.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 God left the palace that night, and the angels are all that's left that's keeping the world from being overrun by Satan and the forces of evil.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 It was the angels who first came to Earthrealm. They decided they needed a place to mount a counterattack.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Heaven had fallen to the forces of Satan.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 The angels have the ability to simply appear on Earth.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Since God created it, it's a heavenly realm, an extension of his glory, so angels are just able to come here.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Demons, though, quickly follow. They're a little more limited on how they can move about this planet.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 They crawl out of mirrors in the darkness.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Abandoned refrigerators that litter the streets, the dumps underneath bridges.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 At night those doors open up and demons can enter our world.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 If you ever see a Jeep Cherokee sitting on the side of the road with black tinted windows, look close.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 You'll see something moving in that window. That's another way a demon can invade our planet.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Andre is an eight-year-old boy sitting outside a Salvation Army homeless shelter.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 He's talking to other homeless kids. He's telling them the story I just told you.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 They're sitting underneath a flickering neon light and Andre looks up and goes, "We're safe under the light."

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 You see angels eat light. They're always around the light. It's what gives them the ability to fly.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So you're always safe in the light. Always remember that, kids.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Andre tells the reporter. He gives this quote.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 There's a lot of killing going on in Miami.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 You want to fight? You want to learn how to live? You got to learn the secret stories.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 The children of Miami have created this entire mythology to explain their world.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 It spreads from shelter to shelter.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And because a homeless person is the definition of transient, they're moving from place to place.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 In one homeless shelter you'd have the children tell a part of the story and then they would all be separated.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Families would get kicked out of the shelter. They'd been there too long.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Maybe a job opportunity opened up on the other side of town. They move. Maybe drug abuse, alcoholism, took the parents to go somewhere else looking for those things.

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 They remove them from the shelter. You have all these reasons why kids are leaving these shelters.

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 But each time the kids would tell these stories and the mythology grew, you had ultimate evil in the city of Miami.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And they could see it with their own eyes. They'd see drive-bys.

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 They'd have friends of theirs who were killed. Little kids. 4 year olds, 8 year olds, 10 year olds, shot in the head.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 How do you explain that?

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 The adults had their own problems. The kids would get together and tell these tales.

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Not just tales of horror, but tales of survival.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 In the streets of Miami there is a figure known as the Blue Lady.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Pale white skin, beautiful blonde hair.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Arms adorned in pink and golden flowers.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 She used to live in the ocean off the coast of Miami.

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 But now she has come to save the children of Miami.

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 But with a caveat. You have to know her real name.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 If you call her name out at the time you need her the most, she will save your life.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 She's a symbol of hope.

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Here's a quote from one of these homeless children about the Blue Lady.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 "If you and your friends are on a corner, on a street, when a car comes shooting bullets, and only one child yells out her true name, all will be safe."

70
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Even if bullets are tearing your skin, the Blue Lady makes them fall to the ground.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 She can talk to us, even without her name. She says, "Hold on."

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 It lets me to girl name Maria, 7 years old.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 One day a horrible storm hit Miami.

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 She was with her father and her mother and they broke into a building.

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 The Freedom Tower is what it's known as. It's in downtown Miami.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 They broke in along with a bunch of other homeless people.

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They broke into this building to outlast this storm which was quickly becoming a hurricane.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And I have to say, I've never ever thought about what happens to homeless people during a hurricane.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I've never even considered that in my mind.

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And now I have this story. This girl is 7 years old and she's living this moment.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 It was an abandoned building. There was no electricity. The place was dark.

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 She said the only time that she could see was when lightning struck outside.

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 The room would become illuminated. She was there with a lot of other adults, a few other families.

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 But she was mostly focused on her parents.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Her father was an alcoholic and he was eating the last piece of food that that family had.

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 It was a can of sardines, lightning strikes and illuminates the room.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And she sees her mom trying to get her dad to stop eating the sardines. That's all they have left.

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 In the darkness, she hears the unmistakable sound she's heard it several times.

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Of her father hitting her mother.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Now they're around a bunch of other people. Lightning strikes.

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 She sees all the other people crowded into the floor level of this building.

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 But people are just laughing at this. They're doing nothing about it.

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Maria stands up for her mother and the father turns around and punches her in the face.

94
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Arguments over.

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 She said that her head hurt, but her stomach hurt as well. She was so hungry.

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And she's laying there in the corner of this room. She can feel the pain in her stomach.

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 She feels the pain from her father's strike.

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 She's trying to sleep as much as she can when the wind and the rain smashes a window in this building.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 She feels completely powerless.

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 She says, quote, "I was so scared. I prayed out loud. Please God, don't punish me no more."

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 A boy overheard her prayer. He knew the stories. He knew the secret stories that have been passed along the street.

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 He said, "Hurricanes ain't God. It's Blue Lady bringing rain for the flowers."

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Later that night, Maria wakes up and the Blue Lady is standing over her.

104
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 She reaches down and touches her forehead.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Maria says, "The pain went away." The Blue Lady had helped her.

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 The Blue Lady then sang Maria a song. Maria memorized the words as best as she could.

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And the Blue Lady told Maria that that song would help her be good, be a good person, not like her daddy.

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 We see this come up a lot in the secret stories in Miami.

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 We see this idea that you have kids who are powerless, but there is this great war going on around them.

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 They can't start arming themselves. Everyone else has guns in this area.

111
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 They're in gang infested area, drug infested area.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Your natural reaction would be to maybe join one of the gangs or get a gun yourself, defend yourself.

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 What we see a lot in these secret stories is what the Blue Lady was explaining to Maria.

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 You have to be good. We have a ton of these stories in this article that have this element where people are told,

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 "If you want to join God's army, do good in school, be a good person, make good moral choices."

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 That's how you will become a warrior in this angelic war, which is a very interesting component, because that's something you can control.

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 If you were to say, "If you want to join this group, this militia, this holy militia," or something like that,

118
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 or you have to train, you have to do all this stuff, you have to have these weapons, that's how we would talk about it in real life.

119
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 But a child can't do any of that stuff. They can't drop $400 on infrared gear or anything like that.

120
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 They can be good. They can study their textbooks. They can be a good person.

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 But they know that death is right around the corner.

122
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 These children live in an environment where at any moment they can be executed, they can be accidentally killed in a drive-by,

123
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 their parents could kill them. These kids are living on the edge of civilization.

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And it's one thing to be a homeless adult. It sucks. I've been homeless before. It sucks.

125
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 But I can place it in context in the story of my life.

126
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 But if you're seven years old and you're homeless, you know something's wrong.

127
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 You know this isn't a natural state of being, but you are totally powerless about this whole thing.

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 So you're seeing this violence on the street and you're being told that God has left heaven.

129
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Heaven's been overrun by satanic forces. So if I die, what is there for me if I can't go to heaven?

130
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And that's when one of the other children of the shelter would tell you the truth about life after death.

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 When you die, you become a spirit. And the children were very adamant in this article. Not a ghost.

132
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Ghost is what a Casper is. That's a kid's word. You become a spirit.

133
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And you can appear in front of people, but you can't talk. Not at first. They say it takes a while for you to be able to speak.

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 A lot of times spirits will appear, they'll just be moving their mouth.

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 They haven't mastered the ability to actually speak from beyond.

136
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 It's a spirit's job to actually be a war correspondent, to share stories about what is going on between the angels and the demons.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 So when you die, you do have a place in that world where you can deliver messages to the living, messages of support, calls for reinforcements.

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 You can become an active participant rather than just a child who's living this nightmare.

139
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 If you're good enough, you're a good enough person while you're alive, you can help the angels fight more than just deliver messages.

140
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 One of the creepiest elements to this story too, is this one, I hadn't heard this one before, is that spirits and demons, once they see your face, they can track you wherever you go.

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 You can never hide from them. This whole story I find absolutely fascinating. This is modern myth-making among a very unique subculture, locked into an age range and a geographical range.

142
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 They had older kids in the article going, "Yeah, I really don't believe that anymore." They had a 12-year-old being like, "Yeah, I don't really believe that anymore."

143
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 But you have that age range where it makes sense, it's trying to make sense of this world.

144
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 So if you're an angel or a demon or a spirit, if they ever see your face, if you ever wake up in the middle of the night and something's watching you from the darkness, you're basically,

145
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 "You better hope that's an angel or a spirit, because they'll be able to track you wherever they go."

146
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 But heaven is abandoned. Where do you go when you die?

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 You see, outside of Miami, in the swamps, there's a little place where the swamps slowly turn into a jungle, a place that's hidden from the forces of evil.

148
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 But just in case they find it, this jungle is patrolled by massive alligators that will devour those who attempt to invade the last refuge of the angelic forces on Earth.

149
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Inside this jungle is a massive palace, and that is where you go when you die.

150
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 But there is a ritual that these children have been told. You have to give the dead a fresh palm leaf.

151
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 That's the key to get into the city. Without the fresh palm leaf, you can't get into paradise.

152
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Miguel was 8 years old. I actually should say this right now, this article is from 1996, so I don't mean to throw a rain bucket on your parade or anything,

153
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 but a lot of these kids probably aren't alive anymore.

154
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 This article is 24 years old, and these kids were having a rough go of it back then.

155
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 So this article wasn't written in 2020. I don't know if there's any happy Indians to any of these guys. You can definitely hope there is, but the way they talk about...

156
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 There's a very long article, and I recommend you guys reading it. I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out, but one of the things, one of the stories was this girl was talking to the reporter

157
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 and finally earned the reporter's trust, and she was drawing pictures of these different events, of the different characters and stuff like that, of these stories.

158
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And the reporter asked, "Can you draw a self portrait?" And the girl draws a gravestone.

159
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 So, I mean, that probably brings it down a bit. This has been 24 years. This 8 year old kid, I hope everything's okay, but I wanted to include that detail.

160
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Miguel, he's an 8 year old boy. His parents were immigrants from Nicaragua.

161
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And his dad had a job at a gas station, and every night they weren't homeless at this point. They had a home. Dad had a job.

162
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Every night Miguel would walk through the street, and he'd bring a soda to his dad, and then they would sit at the gas station for a while,

163
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 and then it would be time for Miguel to go to bed, and he would make the walk back home, wait for his dad to come home.

164
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 But one night before Miguel could get there, his father was murdered at that gas station. He was brutally murdered.

165
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 He had heard, through the grapevine, that not only was his dad shot to death, before they did that, the murderers were lighting matches and putting them out on his body.

166
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 So Miguel had heard this story. Without Miguel's father's job, the mother wasn't able to keep the apartment.

167
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 She wasn't able to support Miguel, and Miguel had a younger sibling. They became homeless.

168
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 So they're sleeping on the streets. It's not easy being homeless, and I know I've said that earlier, but it's not like you're just like, "I'm homeless. I'm going to go to a shelter."

169
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 There's waiting lists, and there's all sorts of stuff. Sometimes the shelters can be more dangerous. There's all sorts of stuff.

170
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 So a lot of times there are shelters in the area, but you'll spend time sleeping on the streets. You'll spend time sleeping on bus benches.

171
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 You'll spend time sleeping at churches. But every night Miguel woke up.

172
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And there, standing over him, was his father's spirit, just staring down at Miguel.

173
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 The spirit was beaten up. He was bloodied, and Miguel saw little flames, little dots of light, all over his father's ghastly figure.

174
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 The matches that had been put out on his body had followed him into the afterlife.

175
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 At school, Miguel would often get caught trying to leave, trying to break out of school.

176
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And the teachers would chase him down, grab him, "Miguel, what are you doing? What are you doing?"

177
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And he said, "I have to find my dad's grave. I have to find my dad's grave."

178
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 What? What are you talking about? And he was holding, each time he did this, he'd be holding a handful of fresh palm leaves.

179
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 He knew he had to get his dad into that city in the jungle.

180
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 You see, the teachers don't know these stories. These stories are passed around in homeless shelters, so they're like, "What is going on?"

181
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 It sounds like gibberish. It sounds like "made up." Might as well be saying he has a lunch date with April O'Neill.

182
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 It doesn't make sense to them. But a social worker who's spending a lot of time with kids in the homeless shelters,

183
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 and talking to Miguel personally, goes, "Oh, it's this ritual he has to do."

184
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 So one of his social workers takes him to the grave site, finds out where the dad is buried, takes him to the grave site.

185
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Miguel has the palm leaf. He stands in the graveyard and puts the palm leaf on the grave.

186
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Miguel says, "I need my daddy to find the fighter angels. I'll go there when I'm killed."

187
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Here's an interesting thing with this article. Again, it's just a very, very well-written, very well-researched article.

188
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Where the reporter, Linda, is actually talking to folklorists and ethnologists, these people who really dive into how cultures are created.

189
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And one of the, I think it was the folklorists, said, "A lot of times when we look at how folklorists are created,

190
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 we can carry them back to a certain amount of time and say, 'Okay, it came out of this region and then we saw it evolve.'"

191
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 They said, "When we look at the stories, the secret stories of the homeless kids of Miami, the stories all end with, like,

192
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 when you track it back to the beginning, they go, 'Oh, a spirit told me.'" And they're like, "What?"

193
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Like, there's no start point other than, "I woke up one night and a spirit told me the story about the jungle palace."

194
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And the spirits are the dispatchers, so that wouldn't make sense in their mythology.

195
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 They go, "We can't really track it back to a patient zero. The stories are just spreading."

196
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 There's another person, I think it was a psychologist, might have been a folklorist, but they have this interesting statement.

197
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 They said, "When you have a child that is going through a rough patch, their parent comes down with cancer,

198
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 or maybe they even have come down with cancer, something, death in the family, things like that,

199
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 a child, a lot of times, thinks, 'God is up there, but he's so busy and I'm just a little tiny person.

200
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 So God loves me, but he just doesn't hear me now.'"

201
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 But if you have a child that's under constant stress, where they are homeless at any point, they can be killed,

202
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 their loved ones can be killed, they meet a friend, it's their best friend for a week, and they get killed, God is absent.

203
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 God does not exist in their world. They don't see God as a fatherly figure who's too busy with the other.

204
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 God's gone. So they go, "It is no surprise that this mythology, they have removed God.

205
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 They believe that he exists, but he's not ignoring them, he has abandoned them.

206
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 But you still have the hope, see, the angels represent the potential of hope.

207
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 There's not an absence of angelic intervention, just an absence of God. He's no longer watching over us.

208
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 It's a fascinating mythology. This whole thing, this whole story I find so awesome.

209
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And guys, we're just getting started, because I think we're about to move on to probably the most intriguing part of this story.

210
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Satan has his army, but there is a demon that even Satan fears.

211
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 It is one that we all know of. Her name is Bloody Mary.

212
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Bloody Mary is a major figure in the Miami myths. Sometimes they use the name La Lorna, sometimes they use the name Bloody Mary,

213
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 but in this mythology it's the same person. Bloody Mary is a figure that loves the death of children.

214
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Bloody Mary creeps through the streets of Miami, waiting for the sound of gunfire.

215
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Every time a child is shot, stabbed, beaten, murdered in the city of Miami, you can hear Bloody Mary cry out with joy.

216
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Another child is dead, and that's all that she wants.

217
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Oteas is a 10-year-old girl, and when she's being interviewed by Linda about these stories, she tells Linda,

218
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 "I can tell you a story, but this story is very, very dangerous."

219
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 No boys know this story, because if a girl tells a boy this story that I'm about to tell you, that girl's best friend will die.

220
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Homeless girls in shelters experience something that the boys don't.

221
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 They'll wake up in the middle of the night with burning scratches appearing across their arms.

222
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 In the darkness, Bloody Mary is grabbing at them and trying to yank them off the bed.

223
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 But it's not so much a physical yanking off the bed, because then you're off the bed, and then what does Bloody Mary do?

224
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 She just stands there, "No." She's trying to pull you into a world of slavery.

225
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 If Bloody Mary can get her claws in deep enough into you, you'll join a gang, you'll get addicted to crack.

226
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 You'll fall into the world of madness and violence and blood, and Bloody Mary loves to kill children, but she also loves to corrupt them.

227
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Not all death is immediate, but all of it pleases Bloody Mary.

228
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 However, one in one thousand homeless girls is a special one.

229
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 This is a girl who is impervious to the control of Bloody Mary.

230
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 You don't know you're a special one until she appears.

231
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 You'll wake up in the middle of the night, and Bloody Mary will be standing there at the edge of your bed.

232
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 She goes to grab your arms, but there's no scratches. There's no claws in the skin. She's powerless to attack you.

233
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 When Bloody Mary realizes that you are one of the special one, one out of one thousand homeless girls have this ability.

234
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Bloody Mary fades away into the darkness, but for a split second, where Bloody Mary used to stand, you see a glimmering blue face.

235
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Perfectly beautiful girl.

236
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 That's what Bloody Mary used to look like before she became corrupted by darkness.

237
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Bloody Mary stories are universal. We did a whole episode or a whole segment on Bloody Mary.

238
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 It's interesting because this Bloody Mary has been transformed into a very active demon.

239
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Bloody Mary started off as a parlor game.

240
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 You would look in the mirror and see what your husband would look like standing behind you.

241
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 That's how it really started off.

242
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 That became corrupted and something spooky.

243
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 This Bloody Mary is straight up OG.

244
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 She doesn't need to pop out of mirrors. That's one way you can communicate with her.

245
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 She has free reign of Miami. She can go wherever she wants.

246
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 She is not limited to a Mary. If she sees your face once, she can find you whenever.

247
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 If you're not one of the special ones and she's trying to pull you out of bed and she gets her fingers into you and you brush her off but you can't stop it.

248
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 You can do all the schoolwork you want. You can try to be the best student you can be, the best daughter you can be, the best friend you can be,

249
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 but Bloody Mary is always standing behind you and she only has to wait for you to make that one bad decision that leads you down that path.

250
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 She's relentless.

251
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 But if she's not using psychological tricks, she actually carries a rosary with her which she uses to slash kids' faces open with.

252
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 That's some brutal, that's some brutal Bloody Mary stuff.

253
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 She's always been a very passive demon, but not in this world, not in the world of the homeless children of Miami.

254
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Bloody Mary in this world will hunt you and kill you, whether or not you invoke her yourself.

255
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 If you see her, you are marked.

256
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Children also believe that they live in a world of real life violence and they live in a world of demonic forces.

257
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 When they try to explain the two, they think, "I know parents are supposed to love their children. Why don't my parents love me?"

258
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Answer simple in this situation.

259
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Bloody Mary.

260
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Bloody Mary is what causes your parents to fight.

261
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Bloody Mary is what causes your father to punch you in the face.

262
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Bloody Mary is the cause of all that household strife.

263
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 To the point that when the kids in the shelter are talking about one of their friends, who got beaten by their father, got murdered by the mom,

264
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 the kids in the homeless shelter just kind of look at each other and they know it was Bloody Mary.

265
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 It was Bloody Mary who influenced that parent to harm or kill their friend.

266
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 We see how all of this stuff is weaved together and it makes so much sense from a child's point of view.

267
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Why are things happening?

268
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And it's not even that things are just happening to them.

269
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 If this was in the middle of nowhere and they were the only bad family that they knew of, they would internalize it more.

270
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 But when you are hanging out with other homeless children, of course the myths are going to evolve to the point that they make sense.

271
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Now as an adult, we obviously know why parents abuse and murder their children.

272
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 I guess when I say we know, we can't understand it on a human level, but we can step back and we can go alcohol, drugs, psychotic delusions, anger,

273
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 and then sometimes we will even say evil.

274
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Chris Watts, who we talked about on yesterday's episode, was evil.

275
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 But it was a narcissistic evil. It was an egotistical evil.

276
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 His crime was horrible and you could say demonic.

277
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 But do I think Bloody Mary or a demon infused those events of those nights?

278
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 I mean, who knows? But we can look at it psychologically and say that guy was a narcissistic evil bastard.

279
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 But these children, they're not reading psychology textbooks and even if you don't read psychology textbooks, I've been around for 44 years.

280
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 You've been around for a good amount of time.

281
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 We can take in our experiences.

282
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Seven, seven years old, eight years old, ten years old trying to explain these dynamics.

283
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Bloody Mary did it.

284
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 See that level of violence?

285
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Bloody Mary did it.

286
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 They're not watching it on television like we are.

287
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 They're seeing it happen on the street corners.

288
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 They're seeing that empty cot in the homeless shelter.

289
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Bloody Mary did it.

290
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Let's wrap the story up like this.

291
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 We're going to finish it where we began.

292
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 God is sitting in his palace.

293
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 It's a week before Christmas, 1996.

294
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 He starts to notice things aren't right on earth.

295
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 His wall has projections of every human doing everything.

296
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 He's an omnipotent being and he's watching all of reality play out in his palace.

297
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And he hears something.

298
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 He hears that Satan has made a deal with Bloody Mary.

299
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 God has lived since before time existed, but this frowns him.

300
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Bloody Mary had made a pact with Satan.

301
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Satan actually is afraid of Bloody Mary.

302
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Satan hates Bloody Mary, but this will get the job done.

303
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Bloody Mary says I will help you take down God and I will help you take over the earth.

304
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 But I want to kill all the children.

305
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Do what you want with the adults.

306
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Do what you want with God.

307
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 But you saved the children of earth for me.

308
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Now, Satan gets a pretty bad rap about stuff, right?

309
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Well, that's cold.

310
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 That's cold.

311
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 I don't want to kill anyone over the age of 12.

312
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 That's insane.

313
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 So, Satan probably has a good reason to hate Bloody Mary and to fear Bloody Mary, but he makes the deal.

314
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 God is watching this play out and he knows it's only a matter of time.

315
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 God can't sleep.

316
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 He can't rest.

317
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Every moment he's kept awake by the chaos on earth, something is going to happen soon.

318
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 All he hears is crying and laughter, celebrations and misery, joy and horror.

319
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And it's louder than it's ever been before.

320
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 The images on the wall are becoming more chaotic.

321
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Things are happening.

322
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 The images on the wall eventually just become shadows of what's going on on earth, but the madness continues.

323
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And then BOOM BOOM BOOM!

324
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 The gates of heaven are pounded on.

325
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Bloody Mary has the legions of hell at her back.

326
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 God just waits there.

327
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 The legions of hell crawl over the walls, up the battlements, invade the mansion of God.

328
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 The front door is busted open and Bloody Mary stands there.

329
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 God looks at this invader, this woman with no eyeballs, just sockets, bleeding black blood.

330
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 She stands in front of the creator of the universe and he recognizes Bloody Mary.

331
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 He always knew who she was.

332
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 They had met before.

333
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 The night he impregnated her with his son, Jesus Christ.

334
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 It's not that he couldn't destroy Bloody Mary, it's that he didn't have the heart to.

335
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And so he fled and she took that throne for herself and the invasion of earth began.

336
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 I mean, you know, I've heard a lot of variations of the Bloody Mary story before.

337
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 I don't think I've ever heard, you guys correct me if I'm wrong, because maybe I've mentioned in past episodes,

338
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 but I don't think I've ever heard of a time that Bloody Mary has been equated with Mary, a mother of Jesus.

339
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 But you see how that mythology is, it's perfectly weaved together.

340
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Actually, the article is purchased for film rights.

341
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I think Clive Barker had it at one point.

342
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 They're going to turn.

343
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 On the one hand, I can imagine this being an amazing movie, but I could also imagine it being like a 1990s New Line Cinema movie, just really trashy.

344
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 So, I mean, you've got the podcast version, but there's so much stuff you can dissect with this.

345
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 The one, just the narrative alone of God leaving us, of Bloody Mary being an active participant in murders.

346
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 And then Plot Twist, Plot Twist, right? No one saw that coming.

347
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 That's actually Jesus' mom.

348
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 The story of the blue lady being like one of the forces that you can fight for you, but you have to know her name.

349
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 It's an interesting thing that way. You can't call out for the blue lady.

350
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 She doesn't come to you, and then you tell the other kids of the shelter, "That's fake! She doesn't come!"

351
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Like, I've called for her multiple times.

352
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 She didn't show up. People go, "That's because you don't know her real name."

353
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 So, there's kind of like that safety lock on that part of the myth.

354
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Bloody Mary's always looking for you.

355
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 The special ones, very interesting detail.

356
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 It's one out of a thousand homeless girls, see?

357
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 It's an entire mythology, basically in one city, among a subculture of a subculture, homeless children.

358
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Absolutely fascinating.

359
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I almost feel like it would be bastardized if they turned it into a movie,

360
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 because I could just imagine a bunch of kids running around being like,

361
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 "Stop, Bloody Mary!" and they're using slingshots to stop her.

362
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 She's like, "No, my only weakness! Stones you can find on the road!"

363
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 When in reality, this story was crafted on the bodies of dead homeless children.

364
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Kids actually suffered and died, and this story was created to make sense of that.

365
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 So, you know, there's really not any other way to wrap this up.

366
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 I will say this, I mean, obviously it's very cinematic,

367
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 but you guys know how I feel about a lot of this secret war?

368
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Maybe you guys don't. I talk about it a lot, I think in real life.

369
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 They can talk about it more in real life than I do on the show,

370
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 but I've always had a fascination with the secret war, with something going on just out of view.

371
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 The abandoned warehouse that you're driving by, you're driven by a hundred times.

372
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Inside there, there's some secret arms deal going down between Shredder and the Purple Dragons.

373
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Like, I love stuff like that.

374
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 I love the idea that we live our lives blind to a whole other war going on around us.

375
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 I think that's what always attracted me to shows like Angel and things like that, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

376
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 But getting back into the world of reality, this article, I think I'm very fascinated by the idea that

377
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Angels and Demons are duking it out on the streets of Miami.

378
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Obviously, I hope it's not true, because it's quite bloody, but I love the narrative to it.

379
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I love the idea that somewhere out there that the Angels are fighting a good war.

380
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And I love the lesson to the kids. It's the one thing you can control.

381
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 If you're a good person, you can be a part of this war.

382
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Which is, again, like, they can't control anything else, but how they interact with each other.

383
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 So amazing lessons coming out of these myths.

384
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Like I said, this article, I said earlier, is 1996. It came out in 1997,

385
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 but I think it's fascinating to see if someone else would go down there and investigate these stories more, how they've evolved.

386
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Now I think the myth would actually spread quicker, but it's still very, very unique to a population of homeless children

387
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 who have to tell themselves stories to make sense of a violent and chaotic world.

388
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 But really, I guess even adults still do that.
