  <description><![CDATA[<p>Victory To The Light! Today we get trapped on a plane with a rotting man, go on a journey with the Resistance of Light to their underground bunker, and we got something very cool in the mail!</p> <p>Patreon<br /> <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/user?u=18482113">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=18482113</a></p> <p>MERCH STORE!!!<br /> <a href= "https://tinyurl.com/y8zam4o2">https://tinyurl.com/y8zam4o2</a></p> <p>First off, we discuss an unfortunate incident of a Russian rock star, Andrey Suchilin, who was infected with a flesh rotting disease and hopped on a place to head home. But once his skin began to rot on the plane, the passengers had no escape from the putrid smell. They even tried locking him in the restroom but the scent still lingered in the air.</p> <p>Then we take another look at the Resistance of Light and their “Entry Protocols.” Want to join them in their fight against otherworldly space demons? Be prepared at any time to disappear from the face of the Earth and down a secret passage into the underground where you will be asked to take off your clothes if you want to join them. No, not kidding.</p> <p>And finally, I got my copy of the “Stephen King Shot John Lennon” newsletter from Steve Lightfoot!
