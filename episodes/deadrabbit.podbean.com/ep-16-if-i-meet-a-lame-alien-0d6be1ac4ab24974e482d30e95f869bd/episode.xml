  <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we talk about time warps, the coming civil war, and spooooooooky ghosts!</p> <p>Unfortunately today, a man named Jarrod Ramos went crazy and shot up a newspaper. Why? Because he was mad at them for writing an article about him. Please, people, please if you are having thoughts of harming yourself or others talk to someone! </p> <p><a href= "https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org">https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a> helps with anger issues too. Please, just think things through.</p> <p>Let’s move on to Las Vegas, that tiny little town in the desert where Joshua Warren claims to have found a time warp. Actually, it’s not nearly as cool at it would seem. Where’s all the dinosaurs?</p> <p>Then we take on the topic of the Second American Civil war. Is it really coming? “The View” seems to think so! So do 31% of Americans. Do you? Are you prepared? Well, don’t put on your war paint just yet. </p> <p>And finally, we go to Illinois and learn the history of Hickory Hill and the slave ghosts that still haunt the property. Would you be able to spend the night in the spoooooky house? The first man who tried to stay the night in the haunted attic ran out of the house and died only a few hours later. A reported 200 people tried to stay the night at Hickory Hill but they were all run out one by one by chilling voices and phantoms hands. Only one man, a journalist named David Rodgers stayed the whole night, back in 1978, and since then the house has been under 24 hour guard. Why?
