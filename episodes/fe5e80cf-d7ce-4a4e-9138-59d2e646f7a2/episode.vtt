WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.600
 Today we go back to the conspiracy iceberg to take a look at what was in the laundry

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480
 room.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.100
 And then we travel to Berkshire, Massachusetts.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.040
 For an interactive adventure, CAN YOU SURVIVE?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.960
 The Husak Tunnel, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 I'm having a great day.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.960
 This episode is a little different.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.920
 This episode I'm wearing a hat.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.960
 You can't see it, but I have it on my head.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.680
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Bjorn S. Bjorn.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.400
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.120
 Delayed clap there, but thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120
 Really really helps out a lot.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.720
 Now if you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.040
 Just help get the word out about the show.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.360
 That really really helps out a lot.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.960
 We also have a merch store.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.400
 And guys, if you're a Patreon supporter, I'm still sending out stickers.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.480
 So if I haven't got your address yet, send it to me via Patreon or Gmail or Instagram.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.840
 However you guys want to get it to me, send me your email.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.200
 I will send you out a sticker.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 The stickers are really cool.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.240
 I'm starting to get emails from people and photos from people.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.840
 You guys seem to really like them.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.920
 So I'm glad I was able to share that with you guys.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.400
 Bjorn, we're going to toss you the keys of the carbonicopter.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.040
 You'll be getting your stickers soon enough.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.160
 But right now you just have to settle for these keys.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 Catch them in your hand.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.960
 Bjorn, we are headed out to Bremerton, Washington.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.720
 We're flying over the wooded area.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.600
 They're normally called forests.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 Holding onto my hat.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.400
 Got to keep this hat on.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 It's a straw fedora.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 I think it's a fedora.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 I don't know.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.480
 We're flying, holding onto my hat.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.240
 We're flying to Bremerton, Washington.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.720
 Now this is actually from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.200
 Now this is what a conspiracy theory iceberg, 90% of it is stuff like this.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.520
 People see the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.520
 They normally think of stuff like golf rumors or ageless travel.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.920
 Most of the stories are just very, very unknown phenomenon.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.960
 We're landing in Bremerton, Washington.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.840
 And it's a good thing I wore this hat because it's actually the year 1948.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.040
 We're walking through the streets of Bremerton, Washington.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.680
 It's 1948.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.800
 And we walk up to a house and we're looking through like the window.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.080
 Like a bunch of crepes.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.840
 Like a bunch of perverts.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.480
 And inside the basement washroom we see Virginia staples.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.760
 Now Virginia lives in this old apartment building.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.280
 It's super old and actually it's where the apartment building is.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.760
 There's a bunch of other apartment buildings like close to it.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.000
 It's almost like just nothing but buildings.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Nothing but buildings.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Like a city.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.280
 Normally described as a city.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.280
 But she's in there.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 She's in the washroom.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.280
 She's doing her laundry.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280
 Now it's 1948 so we're not talking.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.760
 What noise is that?

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.160
 You just hire people to stand in the corner going.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
 It's supposed to be a dryer or washer.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160
 It doesn't matter.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.280
 They don't exist at this time period.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.960
 When she's doing her washing she actually has a tub of water and like a washboard.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.120
 That's her scrubbing something on the washboard.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.920
 And a clothesline up in the washroom.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.640
 It's basically where you go to do your wash.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.480
 So she's washing stuff in the basement.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.800
 Now in the basement there are these like holes.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.200
 Like where it's starting to crumble.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.000
 This is not the Hilton.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.440
 This isn't even a Motel 6.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.880
 This is just an old timey 1948 apartment complex with big giant holes in the basement.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.840
 The last place you want holes is the structural integrity is all jacked up.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.120
 Now we're staring through this window.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.000
 And we're watching Virginia.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.280
 She's rubbing stuff together.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.120
 She's doing laundry.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.880
 And she gets the feeling that someone's watching her.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.800
 Other than us who actually are watching her.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.560
 She's washing her clothes and she feels something staring at her.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.040
 She's rubbing her clothes.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.400
 She can't knock the feeling.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.600
 That's something staring at her.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.160
 And she slowly turns around.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.800
 And in the whole of the building where there's a bunch of bricks knocked down and stuff like

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.400
 that she sees a giant monster dude.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.480
 Like it's not making any noise though.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.120
 Just standing there looking at her.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.120
 She's freaking out.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.600
 And then the monster starts walking towards her and she screams and she runs upstairs and

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.400
 she packs all of her stuff and she moves it.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 Now she has no idea what she saw.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.800
 She described it as 5 feet tall which is how tall she was.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.120
 It was bright orange in color.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.280
 Had thin legs like a spider and had antennae on its head.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.120
 She's like what?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120
 She runs away.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.720
 It wouldn't matter if it was dark blue in color and normal sized arms.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.720
 It's still a monster right?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.960
 But anyways that's how she described it and she couldn't sleep.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.800
 She couldn't figure out what it was that night.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800
 "I can't sleep.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.440
 My clothes are still dirty.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.400
 I need to finish doing clothes but I'm so afraid."

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.560
 Now she eventually realizes that she's not down in the basement anymore.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.360
 So she doesn't have to be super scared.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.000
 She thinks about what she saw and she goes, "It was huge.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.720
 It looked like a marine creature.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720
 Looked like a sea creature."

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.560
 Now where Bremerton, Washington, where these buildings were, the landlord said, "Yeah,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.960
 those tunnels, they go out.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.960
 They go out far.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.560
 You actually get sea access."

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.200
 Like I said that earlier right?

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.520
 Landlords like, "Sorry I'm showing up later in the narrative."

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.640
 But those tunnels that, you know, the bricks are falling apart and the buildings, how much

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.160
 to take care of that?

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.840
 Not me, I'm just the landlord.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.600
 But those tunnels, they go out to the sea.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.600
 She really should have said that detail earlier.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.080
 You walks away.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.800
 So she's thinking, "It looked like a sea creature.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.880
 I found out retroactively that these tunnels go to the sea."

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.880
 So she goes to the aquarium to see if she sees anything that is relatable.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.640
 She's like, "If I go there and I see five foot tall monsters floating around, then either

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.280
 I've gone to the wrong aquarium.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.880
 I'm in an alternate universe or maybe there really are five foot sea monsters floating

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.320
 around and I was dumb for being panicked."

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.560
 She goes and she's looking at all the stuff in the aquarium and she's like, "Not you,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.160
 not you, not you."

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.240
 And then she sees it.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:26.560
 But it was tiny, it was a little shrimp floating by, a little shrimpy man.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.560
 That's the sound of a shrimp.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560
 Floats away.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.360
 Now, that's that story, right?

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.600
 Now that is from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.640
 It's known as the giant shrimp in the laundry room.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.640
 It's an interesting story.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.320
 It's a very short, interesting story.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.160
 Because eventually she goes back to the area.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.560
 She was like, "I'm never going back there, but you know, never's a long time."

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.840
 After a couple years, she goes back to that area.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.600
 Everything is gone.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.840
 That area is now part of a naval base.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.840
 This story was reported in Strange Magazine.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.600
 It was published in Strange Issue Number 6.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.480
 So they seem to be defunct now.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.000
 I think they still have a web presence, but they don't have their old print magazines.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.200
 If they're print magazines, you can order back copies of it.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.960
 They seem to be pretty expensive, but it definitely predates the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.240
 And that's where this story comes from.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.360
 It's just an obscure story of a weird cryptid.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.440
 But because it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg, it may have another hidden meaning,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:36.160
 but it does seem to be just a one-off cryptid sighting, a giant shrimp that's walking around

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160
 laundry rooms.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.920
 And it is an interesting detail that eventually the naval base expanded to include that building.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.080
 It was knocked down, and now she can't go there.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.600
 So was a cryptid really spotted there?

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.720
 Was it a naval experiment gone wrong?

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.060
 Was it the newest seaman?

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.960
 Was it a new recruit?

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960
 Private shrimp?

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.960
 Wait, they don't call him privates over there.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.400
 What do they call starter sailor men?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400
 It doesn't matter.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.920
 Sailor man shrimp?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.400
 Maybe he was working for the navy.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.160
 Maybe he was an experiment.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.520
 Maybe he was a new life form, and the navy took over his property, his home, so they

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.680
 could contain him.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.680
 Maybe they ate him.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.680
 I don't know.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.960
 Maybe all of the above.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.680
 But maybe he was the first shrimp to enter the US Navy, and he was eaten.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.840
 Who knows?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.420
 But Bjorn, let's wave goodbye to the shrimp.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.100
 We're giving him a high five.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.100
 He seems pretty cool.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.420
 He didn't actually do enough, and he's just walking through tunnels.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.420
 Bye shrimp.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.420
 We'll see you later.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.140
 I'm sure my neighbors just yell out bye shrimp.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.100
 I'm sure they hear me yell out a lot of stuff.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.180
 But today I'm doing it in a hat.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.980
 Bjorn, let's hop in that carbonicopter.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.260
 We're leaving behind Brummerton, Washington.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.740
 We are headed out to Berkshire, Massachusetts.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.180
 Now this is a recommendation from Lerpato.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.160
 Lerpato from YouTube.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.680
 I recently did a story about the Phantom Bugler, and I said it's very, very rare to come across

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.360
 stories where ghosts who kill.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.400
 I said I think I could probably only think of two or three off the top of my head.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.080
 And Lerpato goes, "Oh, I have one.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.000
 Some people believe that ghosts kill people in the Husak Tunnel."

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.200
 And I go, "Huh?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.560
 I hadn't heard of this story, so I appreciate it, so I tip a hat to you."

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560
 Lerpato.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.440
 We're headed out to the Husak Tunnel in Berkshire, Massachusetts.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.020
 Now, pick a number between one and six.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.020
 They're back, baby.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.560
 We're doing another interactive adventure.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.020
 Pick a number between one and six.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.100
 And while you're picking that number, let's do a little bit of background here.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.840
 Husak is supposedly the Mohawk word for forbidden.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.860
 That was a native tribe in the area.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.140
 They hated this mountain.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.580
 They're like, "Thumbs down.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.580
 This mountain totally sucks.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.660
 Don't go there."

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.740
 So of course, not a lot of people went there, but when they were laying down railroad tracks,

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.500
 you used to have to take a railroad all around, do a bunch of stuff.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.200
 So someone goes, "Tell you what, you know that tunnel that supposedly cursed that people

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.060
 who have lived here longer than we've ever been around told us to stay away from?"

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.160
 Let's put a hole through it.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.320
 Let's cut a four-mile-long hole through it so we can open up Massachusetts.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.480
 First off, we have to make sure we're able to renounce that.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.600
 But then, we're going to open up that state to the west.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.840
 This will be one of our most traveled tunnels.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.640
 The very first time nitroglycerin was ever used in America was in this tunnel.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.020
 There's a little... if you're ever on Jeopardy!

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.580
 There you go, there's that one.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.140
 It was over four miles long.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:28.220
 They started building in 1851, and in the end, 180 men would lose their lives.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.740
 The instruction of this building, "Do you have your number between one and six?

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.380
 Be on, bring us down low in that helicopter."

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.860
 Now we're going to repel out, because we've never done that yet, have we?

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.620
 We're going to hop out on ropes.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.620
 We're going to land it.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.620
 Now we're hanging out on this railroad track.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.960
 March 20th, 1865.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.680
 There's three explosive experts getting ready to do what they do best.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.600
 Blow stuff up.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.240
 Ned Brinkman, Billy Nash, and Ringo Jelly.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.640
 These are real people, by the way.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.440
 These are not three made-up names.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.640
 No, Ned Brinkman, Billy Nash, and Ringo Jelly.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.360
 They're walking into the tunnel and they're like, "Okay, we're about two miles in, boys.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.400
 This is where we're going to put this bomb."

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.060
 I don't think they had a spy versus spy bomb with a little fuse, but anyways, they put

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.100
 an explosive device down there and they're like, "Okay, this is what we're going to do.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.580
 We're going to set the charge and then we're going to run super far back into this bunker

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.940
 and then wait for it to blow up."

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.220
 The other two people are like, "Why did you explain it?

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.220
 We do this all the time."

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.780
 He's like, "Yeah, I just have a feeling someone in a hat might be listening to me."

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.220
 So they put the charges down.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.220
 They're like, "Okay, squeeze them in there."

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.260
 And then they start running back to the bunker.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.600
 Now they've just placed the charges.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.280
 They haven't activated them yet.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.600
 But for whatever reason, Ringo-- wait, sorry.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.760
 His name wasn't Ringo Jelly.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.680
 It was Ringo Kelly.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.400
 So that wasn't made up name.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.720
 Ringo Kelly says real name.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.840
 Ringo Kelly, his doppelganger, his twin brother is setting the charges.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:09.360
 Ringo Kelly gets to the control panel first while Ned and Billy are still running down

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.360
 the tunnel.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.640
 For whatever reason, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640
 sets off the explosion.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.980
 He wanted to kill-- he was jelly of his brother.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.580
 He wanted to kill him, too.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.520
 So Ringo Kelly accidentally kills Ned Brinkman and Billy Nash.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.020
 So if you pick the number five, if you pick the number five, you are Ringo Jelly.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.780
 You are a fictional character who was created.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.780
 What?

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.380
 I don't have any memory before this event.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.380
 What am I doing here?

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.940
 And you're in the middle of a pitch black tunnel and you see Ned and Billy start running

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.940
 and you're like, what?

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.940
 What?

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.940
 And then you're running.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.640
 And then you feel explosion behind you.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.640
 You turn around.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.840
 You're like, aah!

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.560
 And then you're like in a big old fireball.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.560
 So you died.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.200
 If you pick number five, you were a guy with a typoed name.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.880
 You had no family.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.440
 It didn't exist until this very moment.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.200
 You blew up in a fireball.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.520
 Shut the podcast off now.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520
 I'll see you tomorrow.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.520
 That's the new rule.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.140
 If you die, you got to stop listening to it.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.180
 But you're not dead yet actually.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:19.240
 So I hope you didn't shut it off because what happens is Ringo, the real Ringo, Ringo Kelly,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.900
 if you pick number one, you're Ringo Kelly.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.340
 So Ringo Kelly is like, uh oh.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.780
 That wasn't supposed to do that.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.860
 Body parts are raining down on him.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.940
 So if you pick number one, you're kind of dusting off your shoulder, getting rid of

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.900
 some body parts and you're like, I'm going to go home.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.520
 I think I deserve the rest of the day off.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.520
 Thank you gentlemen.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.020
 You tip your hat to them, you go home.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:48.120
 Now, shortly afterwards, you go missing because on March 30th, 1865, he'd been missing for

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.720
 a couple of days.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.200
 Construction workers are going into the tunnel.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.160
 They still got to keep working on stuff just because a couple of people blew.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.760
 180 people died working.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.120
 I don't think this is the first time people died.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.040
 This might have been the first time they blew up.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.840
 But they're going in and they find Ringo in the tunnel, two miles into the tunnel.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.860
 Here's the point where Ned and Billy died.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:13.380
 They found Ringo strangled.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.060
 His body lay in there in the pitch darkness.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.460
 For how long?

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.460
 Who knows?

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.540
 But if you pick number one, let's say Ringo was out dancing to the honky tonk.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.020
 He's like, that's how I dance my blues away?

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.660
 I blew up a couple of people.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.660
 Now I've got to blow up dance floor and he's dancing.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.700
 He's doing the boot scoot and boogie and all that stuff.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.560
 And then he sees this hot girl, sees these two hot girls at the bar and they're making

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.560
 kissy faces at him.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.000
 He thinks it's a little weird because they seem to be wearing wigs and they seem slightly

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 translucent.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.680
 But their clothes seem normal, right?

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.240
 He's like, man, just the way I love my women.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.240
 Curvy and see-through.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.440
 And he's walking up to him.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.040
 He's like, hey girls, what's up?

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.440
 And they're like, hi, I'm Ned Dean.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.440
 And this is Billy.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.320
 How would you like to go back to our place?

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.320
 And Ringo's like, oh dude, that sounds awesome.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.320
 And he goes back.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.900
 And their place is two miles into Hoosack Tunnel.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900
 He's walking through the tunnel.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.060
 It's super dark and he's like, man, these girls are super fine.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.500
 It's kind of weird how their feet don't touch the ground and they're floating.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.020
 And then he's making out with Ned Dean and Billy's like, no, we're supposed to kill

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.020
 him.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.020
 And Ned Dean's like, oh yeah, I forgot, I forgot.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.300
 And they strangle him.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.620
 So if you're number one, you get killed by ghosts, which again is incredibly rare.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.620
 So you can kind of consider that a treat.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.480
 And everyone has to die sometime, but you actually get killed by ghosts.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.000
 So that's super rare.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.600
 And if you pick number five, Ringo Jelly.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.320
 If you wore Ringo Jelly, you got to watch the whole thing.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.360
 You're just kind of floating there like a little Casper ghost being like, yeah, get

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.680
 revenge and then you fade away.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.040
 So now you guys have to shut off the podcast.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.160
 Now, so that happened in 1865.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.720
 In 1868, they have to build, I learned more about tunnels.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.960
 I didn't retain any of the information.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.920
 You have to build a vent into a tunnel because there's, it's a train tunnel.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.420
 So otherwise it's full of fumes whenever someone would be like, well, on a train, you, it's

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.420
 a four mile long tunnel.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.940
 You don't want everyone falling asleep, carbon monoxide poisoning through the tunnel.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.420
 So they had to drill a vent in it.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.620
 And they had like water pumps and all sorts of stuff.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.980
 They're drilling into this mountain.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.460
 And these dudes are like floating around.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.820
 They're not floating, they're not ghosts yet, but they're like hanging down and they're

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.140
 like on like work platforms and stuff like that.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.140
 1868, they're building this giant hole to vent the tunnel.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.660
 So if you pick number three, you're doing an honest day's work, right?

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:32.400
 I'm just a minor man doing whatever a minor can.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.640
 I'd like to take a pickaxe and put it in a rock.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.040
 And then I go do something that rhymes with the rock.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.040
 That's the theme song.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.040
 You didn't know that?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.960
 I learned that when I was researching tunnels too.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.280
 Boom, boom, there's a massive explosion.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.280
 But if you pick number three, you hear the explosion.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.400
 You're in like this big giant tunnel.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.740
 You're in this big giant shaft.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.060
 It's a straight down hole.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.060
 You hear the explosion.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.380
 You look around, you think you're blowing up, right?

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.300
 And then you see like a piece of wood.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.540
 Chink, chink, land by your feet.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.300
 And then a hammer.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.540
 Land by your feet.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.540
 And then you look up and you realize where the explosion came from.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.540
 It was above you.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:21.540
 So all the worst part, when you're in a giant shaft, there's two terrible places and explosion

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.540
 can happen.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.980
 The bottom of the shaft or above you.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.920
 So there was like a big gas, there was a pumping station.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:34.560
 There was all this stuff up above and there was a gas leak and it annihilated this platform

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.060
 above these workers.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.200
 So you just had tons of stuff falling down.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.440
 Just squishing dudes, right?

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.760
 You're like, ah, you're dodging.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.200
 You're able to dodge a couple things.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.520
 Trust me, you're going to wish you got squished if you pick number three.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.560
 The pumping station breaks and giant boulders are falling on you too.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.160
 So you're like, ah, and you're able to dodge everything.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.940
 You're straight up Neo down here.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.300
 But what happens is, because there's no, the pumping station was pumping out the water

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.620
 that kept filling the hole.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.580
 Well now the hole slowly filling up with water and it's sealed at the top with all this debris.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.540
 The people on the top are like, uh oh, this is not, this wasn't supposed to happen until

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.540
 the Sunday.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.900
 This happened before, ahead of schedule.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.740
 So they start sending rescue crews down and they put a dude in a bucket.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.120
 Tell me if this isn't a garbage job.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.120
 This isn't a number.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.120
 I should have made this a number.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.740
 If you picked number seven, you're in the bucket.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.720
 They put a guy in a bucket and they're like, okay, we're going to lower you down just to

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.720
 see what's going on down there.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.920
 And they lower him down, they lower him down.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.280
 He's down there for a while and then they're like, okay, let's bring him back up and see

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.280
 what he has to say.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.280
 He's all unconscious.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.080
 He's all, and they bring him up and they're like slapping on the face.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.080
 What happened?

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.080
 What happened?

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.880
 He's like, dude, there's no, he goes, you dropped me down there.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.680
 I was down there for like 45 seconds.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.680
 I passed out.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.280
 There is no hope getting these dudes out.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.760
 They had water rising and they had bricks laying over them, like a bunch of debris over

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.760
 them.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.420
 So if you picked number three, I hope you're not claustrophobic because you survived the

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.300
 downpour and water's pumping in.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.300
 This one's grim.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.860
 I should probably shouldn't have included this one as a number.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.540
 What they found afterwards was that people did whatever they could to survive.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:14.340
 So you and a couple of the other survivors, water's rising, the ceilings collapsed on

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:19.100
 you, you're running out of oxygen, but your hope is stay alive long enough, you'll get

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.340
 rescued.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.160
 So you build a raft out of all this debris that's rained down.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.840
 You're like lifting it off of your friends who are dead and you're strapping it together.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.040
 You're using their shoelaces to make rafts.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040
 You don't do their pockets.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.360
 You're like, oh dude, I love beef jerky.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.840
 You're eating all their stuff.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.400
 The guys are like, I'm not dead yet.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.560
 I'm one of the guys on the raft.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.800
 You're like, you push them off, take your shoelaces.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.880
 You make the raft, you get on the raft, the raft is floating up, the water's getting up,

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.600
 the roof's getting closer.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.600
 It's pitch black in there.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.600
 It's super hot.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.980
 That guy is still complaining about you taking his shoelaces.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:58.020
 And then you reach the top and you're floating in the darkness on this raft.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.060
 Over the next year, bodies would float to the surface.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.600
 The whole thing ended up filling full of water.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.380
 Bodies would end up floating to the surface.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.840
 13 people died in this accident.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.780
 Bodies would float to the surface.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.520
 And then in the end, they did end up, because they had to finish the vent.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.100
 They did end up moving those bricks away.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.440
 That's when they found some people had built a raft to stay above the water, but they just

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.120
 died of oxygen deprivation.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.880
 So pick number three.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.000
 You did not have a good afternoon, but you did become a ghost because what was interesting

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.040
 was in this vent area, people would see ghosts walking around being like, oh, this sucks,

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.040
 dude.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.040
 I totally wish I wasn't a ghost.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.680
 And if I wasn't a ghost, I wish I had died in a casino or someplace cool.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.920
 This sucks.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.300
 Unless the 13th body was uncovered, once all the bodies were pulled out of the vent, the

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.300
 ghost sightings went away.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.300
 They found peace.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.220
 So if you pick number three, at least you found peace.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.180
 It's October 16th, 1874.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.300
 If you pick number two, you are a man named Frank Webster.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.820
 Hunter, today, my hunting has taken me towards Husak Tunnel.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.660
 Now at this point, everyone in the area kind of knows the ghost stories.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.380
 It's not a place you want to go.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.140
 Trains are going through it.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.440
 It's not a huge issue.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.000
 But I mean, just because trains go through it at 60 miles an hour, one, doesn't mean

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.600
 that you should hang out there.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.840
 You probably shouldn't.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.520
 Two, it also doesn't mean that it's not super spooky.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.360
 Because trains can be going by and there could be like ghosts trying to catch up, ghost hobos,

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.360
 gobos.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.160
 But you don't have to worry about them.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.880
 You're in a train and you probably have a ghost tick and ticker who's like pushing

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.880
 them off the train.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.240
 But if you're walking around with a gun, probably not a good idea to hang out at the

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.920
 no unhaunted tunnel.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.740
 Anyways, if you pick number two, you don't have a lot of street smarts or tunnel smarts

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.140
 in this case.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.740
 Couple days later, Frank Webster is walking around this river and he's like, "Ahhh, ahhh,

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.740
 ahhh."

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.820
 He's not a ghost yet.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.820
 He's not a ghost.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.900
 But he's making ghost noises.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.220
 He's falling down.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.020
 He seems to be in a state of shock and some other hunters are like, "Yo, Frankie, what's

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.020
 going on?"

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.220
 He's like, "Ahhh, ahhh."

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.620
 And so they take him back to civilization.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.660
 They take him to the nearest town and they're like, "Frank, what's going on?

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.660
 What happened to you?"

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.500
 And he goes, "You won't believe what happened.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.500
 I was walking...

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.840
 I picked number two and I was walking by a Husak tunnel and I heard a voice.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.040
 Frankie, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.040
 Come in the tunnel."

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.040
 It sounds like a game show.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.400
 "Come in the tunnel, Frank."

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.400
 He's like, "What?

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.400
 I've won?"

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.800
 Now, I don't know much about the Husak area, but I do know a lot about ghostly voices calling

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800
 out from beyond.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.480
 I don't care if they were calling me to walk into it.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.480
 Walmart.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.280
 I'm not following the ghost voices, right?

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.420
 I'm not following them into a dark tunnel where ghosts have murdered people.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.420
 He does.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.420
 He goes in there.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.420
 He feels compelled.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.460
 "Come into the tunnel, Frank."

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.460
 And he walks in.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.460
 He's in the pitch dark of the tunnel.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.620
 And then his gun floats away from him.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.500
 Imagine the gun is on a fishing line from a Don Knott's horror movie.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.500
 He's like, "What?

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.500
 What's going on?"

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.780
 And the rifle's floating around him in the darkness.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.580
 He's trying to grab onto it.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.440
 And then he can't grab onto the rifle.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.560
 It's just kind of floating away.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.400
 It's like slowly bobbing away, again, like a fishing line.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.880
 And then the rifle spins around and starts beating him up.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.720
 It doesn't grow arms since punching him.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.880
 Someone's hitting him with the rifle.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.360
 He's like, "Ah, this was unexpected."

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.160
 And he gets totally beat up by the rifle.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.000
 And then, next thing you notice, he's walking by the river.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.400
 So the cops realize two things.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.520
 One, the dude was beat up.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.080
 And two, his rifle was missing.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.320
 So if you pick number two, that's all that happened to you.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.940
 That's all-- you should feel lucky.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.980
 All you did was get tricked into going into a dark tunnel and got beat up by a rifle from

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.660
 special effects from an old '50s movie.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.340
 So that's pretty good, right?

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.020
 You got out good on that one.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.740
 Unless your fear is being beaten up by rifles then, I'm sorry.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.420
 Now let's jump to the fall of 1875.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.340
 There's a guy named Harlan Mulvaney.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.100
 He's a fire tender.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:06.680
 So that's a dude who brings wood in and sets it on fire or something like that.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.680
 He brings fuel, maybe?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680
 I don't know.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680
 I could have looked it up.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680
 I could have looked it up, too.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.640
 Now I'm looking at my notes.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.720
 He's a fire tender.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720
 You guys know what that is.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.960
 I shouldn't have to explain it to you.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.280
 I mean, come on, guys.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.280
 You know what that is.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.560
 Disappointed that you would even ask.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.400
 We're gonna have this episode, by the way.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.000
 Harlan Mulvaney, fire tender.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.880
 If you pick number four, you're this dude.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.760
 So you're riding your cart in and he has a load of wood on his cart.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.740
 There's a bunch of horses and stuff and he's walking into the tunnel and all that stuff.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:38.340
 And he's like, "I'm about to do my highly detailed and very important job without me.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.180
 The rail system wouldn't even exist."

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.580
 And anyway, so everyone is outside of the tunnel.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.540
 There's still breaking rocks and doing stuff.

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:54.380
 And all of a sudden, that's not an old lady laughing.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.340
 That's a bunch of horses.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.980
 That's not even more like an old lady laughing.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.240
 Guys, a bunch of horses naeing.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.800
 Now, the cart is running out of the tunnel.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800
 He didn't even go that far in.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.200
 He didn't hit the two mile mark.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.880
 The people working the construction outside of the tunnel, all of a sudden, see these

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.040
 horses?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.880
 The crib keepers there as well now.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.800
 See these horses run out of the tunnel and Harlan's holding on the reins.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.280
 He's super scared, dude.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.960
 They can tell that it was off.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.320
 He's probably super scared because of those spooky noises that he just heard that definitely

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.300
 weren't horse noises.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.220
 That's probably the first thing that scared him.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.860
 Second thing that scared him was he's leaving a tunnel at high speed.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.580
 The third thing, the construction workers were like, "That weird.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.380
 He looks scared about three things."

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.500
 The two I mentioned and the fact that he's seen something in that tunnel.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:50.020
 The horses run off into the woods, cart attached.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.420
 The whole cart goes off into the woods and people start chasing the cart.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.340
 And then a few days later, because they lose track, or they get bored, they have your loose

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.080
 track and they're like, "Oh, he'll come back."

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.360
 He's having a bad day or you got possessed by ghosts either or he'll come back.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.680
 A couple days later, they find the cart deep in the woods.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.680
 He is never seen again.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.680
 So if you pick number four, we're going to have to do a little more detail here.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.560
 If you pick number four, you walk into the...

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.760
 Dude, this is actually trippy.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.760
 I just thought of this.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.680
 What if you're in the cart and you're walking into the tunnel and then all of a sudden you

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.900
 are like, "Oh, it's super dark in here and I'm kind of spooked."

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.300
 I'm going to jump off of the cart.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.300
 So now you're walking around in the darkness and you're like, "What?

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.620
 This is super nerve-racking in the tunnel before.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.620
 I didn't expect these places to get so black."

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:44.380
 And so if you pick number four, you're walking around in the dark and you see a ghostly figure

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.500
 in front of you and you're like, "What?

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.300
 Must be one of them ghosts I heard so much about in this tunnel."

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.620
 And you notice he's kind of standing there and then you're like, "Uh-oh.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.000
 He has a rifle.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.960
 I better take that from him before he ghost shoots me."

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.120
 So you grab the rifle and then the ghost turns around.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.520
 He looks all weird and stuff and he's like, "Uh-oh.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.520
 Give me back my rifle."

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.320
 And you get scared and you start beating the ghost with the rifle.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.320
 Right?

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.920
 You see where I'm going with this?

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.920
 Uh-uh.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.120
 And the way you're holding it looks like fishing line for some weird reason too.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.040
 You're like making it float and then you beat them up and then you take the rifle because

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.180
 you're super scared and you get on your fire tender cart and you run out.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.260
 Like the implication was you were the dude who took the gun from number two.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:34.780
 Because even though that took place a year earlier, maybe, even though the story's all

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:39.540
 about ghosts, maybe there's some sort of time dimension thing, right?

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:44.940
 So if you pick number four, you actually beat up number two and then you took the rifle

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.540
 and then you just kind of evaporated, right?

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.540
 Your story's over.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.540
 Like you just kind of disappeared.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.880
 I wonder if they found the horses.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.240
 That would be weird or two.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.380
 They just found the cart.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.380
 No horses, no guy.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.960
 So if you pick number four, you beat up number two.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.760
 Now all of this, there's another ghost story about this guy that I didn't even give it

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.760
 a number.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.240
 I'm acting like I did into a purpose but I forgot to give it a number.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.560
 There was this guy named Joseph.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.720
 If you picked any number, if you didn't pick a number, this is you.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.120
 There's a guy named Joseph in Poco.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120
 He believed in the ghost.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.120
 He believed in all that stuff.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:21.320
 One day he was breaking ice off the tracks and he hears a voice going, "Run Joe, run!"

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.320
 He's like, "What?"

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.840
 And he looks up and there's a train coming right at him and he jumps out of the way.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.160
 "Oh my God, the ghost saved my life."

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.160
 Which when I read that I thought, "You didn't hear the train, you heard the ghost?"

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.440
 But you didn't hear the train in the tunnel?

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.440
 But whatever.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.440
 That's the story, right?

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.340
 But then that's not all because six weeks later he's working on the tracks.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.960
 This time he has to break one of the freight cars, his frozen to the tracks, which makes

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.160
 me realize he didn't do his job the first time.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.400
 First time he was trying to break ice off the tracks.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.880
 Obviously now if there was enough ice that a rail car freezes to the track, he didn't

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.880
 do your job, dude.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.160
 But anyways, he's now breaking ice off the tracks and he hears a voice in his head warning

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.160
 him.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:10.440
 First off, how strong is this man that they hire him to pry a rail car loose with a crowbar?

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:15.200
 The freight cars frozen on the tracks, they give him a crowbar to then help get the rail

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.200
 car free.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.400
 So who is this Joseph and Poco?

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.800
 But somehow they got him to do the job.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.080
 Now, he's about to get electrocuted.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.800
 So a voice is warning him of this and in the nick of time he doesn't get electrocuted.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:35.440
 But I'm giving away the ending here because what the ghost says to him seems like he's

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.040
 wasting precious seconds.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.960
 Let's say that you see a dude about to get electrocuted.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.960
 What would you say?

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.400
 I want you to say it out loud so your neighbors hear it.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.400
 If you see someone about to get electrocuted, you see a good friend, not someone you don't

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.400
 like.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.680
 It's not Cobra Commander about to get electrocuted.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.440
 But you see someone who you like about to get electrocuted by using a crowbar on a train

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440
 track.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.760
 You're going to go, "Drop it!

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.760
 Look out!"

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.240
 Look out's a little vague, right?

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.000
 Because then they're like, "Oh, is there a baseball coming?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.920
 Is someone hitting a golf ball?"

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920
 Drop it, works.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.920
 Drop it!

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.920
 Utterity!

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.480
 So I guess now you're just naming off elements.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.360
 But you would warn them in the quickest...

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.480
 They're fighting something that's literally going the speed of light, right?

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.560
 Electricity is lightning fast.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.360
 The ghost voice goes, "Joe!

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.000
 Joe!

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.880
 Drop it, Joe!"

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:30.320
 He immediately lets go of the crowbar and the crowbar flies away because the electrical

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320
 arc would...

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.320
 That's...

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.320
 I mean, that ghost...

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.680
 I mean, I guess it was aficion, right?

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.040
 If you heard the voice in your head, it doesn't need to go, "Jason!

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.840
 My name's two syllables, which would be even worse because it'd be like, "Jason!

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.840
 Jason!"

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840
 And by that time, I'm electrocuted.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.320
 And then the voice would be like, "Ugh!

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.200
 Sorry, I should have just yelled out, 'Electricity!'"

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.320
 But they didn't do that.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.800
 So I didn't want to assign that one a number again.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.840
 I actually forgot to assign that one a number.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.120
 So but we do have number six here.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.040
 Number six brings us to the present day.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:07.180
 So if you pick number six, you are intrepid journalist Steve Jacob, who adds a new wrinkle

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.520
 to this story.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.600
 We have all of these hauntings, all these old, timey haunties.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:17.000
 But Steve Jacob is a journalist who wrote an article, a freelance article for the website

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 medium.com.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.240
 And in it, he actually interviews this woman named Jeannie, who's talking about history

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.240
 of the Housaq tunnel.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.680
 And we have this interesting interaction.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.360
 So if you're number six, you're sitting down with this woman named Jeannie, and you're doing

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.880
 this interview.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.280
 So you, number six says, "Now tell me about the video you took.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.000
 What was that noise in the background?"

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 Jeannie shifts uncomfortably in her chair.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.640
 She's like, "What are you talking about?"

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.080
 Her actual answer is, "What video?"

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.080
 You furrow your brow.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.080
 You're like, "What?"

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.440
 "I know I saw a video."

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.640
 Quote, "The video I found on YouTube, you went into the tunnel on Wednesday, right?

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.720
 The video was posted around 6pm."

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.240
 Jeannie, her eyes dart from side to side.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.920
 I'm giving her suspicious intent.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.960
 Her eyes dart from side to side.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.480
 She goes, "Quote, oh no, Steve.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.200
 I went in at nine.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.960
 I couldn't go until the girls were in bed."

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.000
 So Steve Jaco pulls up on YouTube.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.680
 Click, click, click, click.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.800
 Pulls up a video.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.800
 Here's this quote.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.640
 "I showed her the video and she hadn't seen it.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.480
 I have no idea where it came from, but I'm attaching it to this article in the hopes

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.080
 that one of you knows where it came from.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:32.040
 Thank you so much to Jeannie for meeting with me, and thank you to everyone for reading.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.920
 I'll never stop reporting on the stories that matter to this community."

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.200
 This was the only article he had written on Medium.com.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:46.780
 So if you pick number six, let me play this video for you, this video he's referencing.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:51.120
 If you pick number six, you have a real life consequence to that number.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:57.880
 You are intrepid journalist Steve Jaco trying to share the stories that matter to the community.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.240
 If you pick number six, I'm going to play this audio clip for you guys, but if you pick

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:07.600
 number six, are you going to listen to this audio clip at 3 a.m.?

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.360
 Now technically if you want, you could say 3 a.m. Eastern Standard Time and listen to

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.360
 it in the middle afternoon.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.880
 That's up to you, but if you pick number six, you should find the spookiest time to listen

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.880
 to this.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.360
 Trust me, the video itself is spooky enough if you're listening to this right now in

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.000
 broad daylight.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.200
 Time to clench your butthole, because this might be cursed.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.280
 Who would propose the1002?

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.600
 I'm here to quantify the rooms that you wish to see for yourself.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.600
 Wow...

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:44.600
 *phone ringing*

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:49.600
 *door opening*

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.600
 *static*

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.600
 *static*

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.600
 I wanna die!

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.600
 *static*

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.600
 It's interesting, it is a clip on YouTube.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.600
 It sounds like it's from three different sources. The first one has that weird muttering.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.600
 And then there's like a bizarre tone, and then it sounds like...

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.600
 It's supposed to be in a tunnel and you're hearing ghostly voices.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.600
 The link will obviously be in the show notes if you wanna watch the video, but that's a disturbing little sound clip.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.600
 And Steve Jaco has not written an article since.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.600
 Well, at least not from Medium.com, not that I could tell.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.600
 So it's possible that if you pick number six, you did listen to that late at night.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.600
 Maybe you took it into a HUSAC tunnel yourself.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.600
 Sat down with a pair of headphones.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.600
 Turned on this podcast fast-forwarded to that very moment.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:50.600
 And in the darkness of HUSAC tunnel, illuminated only by the blue light of your phone.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.600
 The specters of all that passed away creep up behind you,

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.600
 ready to add a new member to the body count.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.600
 Of the bloody pit.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.600
 Did I mention earlier in the episode the nickname of the place was "Bloody Pit"?

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.600
 Well, if I didn't, I just did.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.600
 And now, you're in the bloody pit. That should have mentioned earlier.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.600
 You're there. You're one of these ghosts.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.600

 Gmail.com is gonna be your email address.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.600
 The landlord shows up and goes, "Oh, I forgot to tell you.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.600
 This place, it's called the Bloody Pit."

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.600
 Should have mentioned that. Should have mentioned that much earlier.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.600
 Totally forgot.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.600
