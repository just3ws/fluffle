1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,600
 Today we go back to the conspiracy iceberg to take a look at what was in the laundry

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,480
 room.

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,100
 And then we travel to Berkshire, Massachusetts.

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,040
 For an interactive adventure, CAN YOU SURVIVE?

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,960
 The Husak Tunnel, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:44,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,960
 This episode is a little different.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,920
 This episode I'm wearing a hat.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,960
 You can't see it, but I have it on my head.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,680
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Bjorn S. Bjorn.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,400
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,120
 Delayed clap there, but thank you so much for supporting the show.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
 Really really helps out a lot.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,720
 Now if you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,040
 Just help get the word out about the show.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,360
 That really really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,960
 We also have a merch store.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,400
 And guys, if you're a Patreon supporter, I'm still sending out stickers.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,480
 So if I haven't got your address yet, send it to me via Patreon or Gmail or Instagram.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,840
 However you guys want to get it to me, send me your email.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,200
 I will send you out a sticker.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
 The stickers are really cool.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,240
 I'm starting to get emails from people and photos from people.

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,840
 You guys seem to really like them.

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,920
 So I'm glad I was able to share that with you guys.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,400
 Bjorn, we're going to toss you the keys of the carbonicopter.

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,040
 You'll be getting your stickers soon enough.

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,160
 But right now you just have to settle for these keys.

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
 Catch them in your hand.

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,960
 Bjorn, we are headed out to Bremerton, Washington.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,720
 We're flying over the wooded area.

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,600
 They're normally called forests.

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
 Holding onto my hat.

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,400
 Got to keep this hat on.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
 It's a straw fedora.

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
 I think it's a fedora.

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
 I don't know.

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,480
 We're flying, holding onto my hat.

42
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,240
 We're flying to Bremerton, Washington.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,720
 Now this is actually from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,200
 Now this is what a conspiracy theory iceberg, 90% of it is stuff like this.

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,520
 People see the conspiracy theory iceberg.

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
 They normally think of stuff like golf rumors or ageless travel.

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,920
 Most of the stories are just very, very unknown phenomenon.

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,960
 We're landing in Bremerton, Washington.

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,840
 And it's a good thing I wore this hat because it's actually the year 1948.

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,040
 We're walking through the streets of Bremerton, Washington.

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,680
 It's 1948.

52
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,800
 And we walk up to a house and we're looking through like the window.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,080
 Like a bunch of crepes.

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,840
 Like a bunch of perverts.

55
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,480
 And inside the basement washroom we see Virginia staples.

56
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,760
 Now Virginia lives in this old apartment building.

57
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,280
 It's super old and actually it's where the apartment building is.

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,760
 There's a bunch of other apartment buildings like close to it.

59
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
 It's almost like just nothing but buildings.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Nothing but buildings.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Like a city.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,280
 Normally described as a city.

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 But she's in there.

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
 She's in the washroom.

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
 She's doing her laundry.

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
 Now it's 1948 so we're not talking.

67
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,760
 What noise is that?

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,160
 You just hire people to stand in the corner going.

69
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,160
 It's supposed to be a dryer or washer.

70
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
 It doesn't matter.

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,280
 They don't exist at this time period.

72
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,960
 When she's doing her washing she actually has a tub of water and like a washboard.

73
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,120
 That's her scrubbing something on the washboard.

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,920
 And a clothesline up in the washroom.

75
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
 It's basically where you go to do your wash.

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,480
 So she's washing stuff in the basement.

77
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,800
 Now in the basement there are these like holes.

78
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,200
 Like where it's starting to crumble.

79
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
 This is not the Hilton.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,440
 This isn't even a Motel 6.

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,880
 This is just an old timey 1948 apartment complex with big giant holes in the basement.

82
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,840
 The last place you want holes is the structural integrity is all jacked up.

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
 Now we're staring through this window.

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,000
 And we're watching Virginia.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,280
 She's rubbing stuff together.

86
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,120
 She's doing laundry.

87
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,880
 And she gets the feeling that someone's watching her.

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,800
 Other than us who actually are watching her.

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
 She's washing her clothes and she feels something staring at her.

90
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,040
 She's rubbing her clothes.

91
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,400
 She can't knock the feeling.

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
 That's something staring at her.

93
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,160
 And she slowly turns around.

94
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,800
 And in the whole of the building where there's a bunch of bricks knocked down and stuff like

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,400
 that she sees a giant monster dude.

96
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,480
 Like it's not making any noise though.

97
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,120
 Just standing there looking at her.

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
 She's freaking out.

99
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,600
 And then the monster starts walking towards her and she screams and she runs upstairs and

100
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,400
 she packs all of her stuff and she moves it.

101
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
 Now she has no idea what she saw.

102
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,800
 She described it as 5 feet tall which is how tall she was.

103
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,120
 It was bright orange in color.

104
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,280
 Had thin legs like a spider and had antennae on its head.

105
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,120
 She's like what?

106
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
 She runs away.

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
 It wouldn't matter if it was dark blue in color and normal sized arms.

108
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
 It's still a monster right?

109
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,960
 But anyways that's how she described it and she couldn't sleep.

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
 She couldn't figure out what it was that night.

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
 "I can't sleep.

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,440
 My clothes are still dirty.

113
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,400
 I need to finish doing clothes but I'm so afraid."

114
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,560
 Now she eventually realizes that she's not down in the basement anymore.

115
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,360
 So she doesn't have to be super scared.

116
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,000
 She thinks about what she saw and she goes, "It was huge.

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,720
 It looked like a marine creature.

118
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
 Looked like a sea creature."

119
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,560
 Now where Bremerton, Washington, where these buildings were, the landlord said, "Yeah,

120
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,960
 those tunnels, they go out.

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
 They go out far.

122
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,560
 You actually get sea access."

123
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,200
 Like I said that earlier right?

124
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,520
 Landlords like, "Sorry I'm showing up later in the narrative."

125
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,640
 But those tunnels that, you know, the bricks are falling apart and the buildings, how much

126
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,160
 to take care of that?

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
 Not me, I'm just the landlord.

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,600
 But those tunnels, they go out to the sea.

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
 She really should have said that detail earlier.

130
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,080
 You walks away.

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,800
 So she's thinking, "It looked like a sea creature.

132
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,880
 I found out retroactively that these tunnels go to the sea."

133
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,880
 So she goes to the aquarium to see if she sees anything that is relatable.

134
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,640
 She's like, "If I go there and I see five foot tall monsters floating around, then either

135
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,280
 I've gone to the wrong aquarium.

136
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,880
 I'm in an alternate universe or maybe there really are five foot sea monsters floating

137
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,320
 around and I was dumb for being panicked."

138
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,560
 She goes and she's looking at all the stuff in the aquarium and she's like, "Not you,

139
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,160
 not you, not you."

140
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,240
 And then she sees it.

141
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:26,560
 But it was tiny, it was a little shrimp floating by, a little shrimpy man.

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,560
 That's the sound of a shrimp.

143
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
 Floats away.

144
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,360
 Now, that's that story, right?

145
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,600
 Now that is from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

146
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,640
 It's known as the giant shrimp in the laundry room.

147
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
 It's an interesting story.

148
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,320
 It's a very short, interesting story.

149
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,160
 Because eventually she goes back to the area.

150
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,560
 She was like, "I'm never going back there, but you know, never's a long time."

151
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,840
 After a couple years, she goes back to that area.

152
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,600
 Everything is gone.

153
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,840
 That area is now part of a naval base.

154
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,840
 This story was reported in Strange Magazine.

155
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,600
 It was published in Strange Issue Number 6.

156
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,480
 So they seem to be defunct now.

157
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,000
 I think they still have a web presence, but they don't have their old print magazines.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
 If they're print magazines, you can order back copies of it.

159
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,960
 They seem to be pretty expensive, but it definitely predates the conspiracy theory iceberg.

160
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
 And that's where this story comes from.

161
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,360
 It's just an obscure story of a weird cryptid.

162
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,440
 But because it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg, it may have another hidden meaning,

163
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,160
 but it does seem to be just a one-off cryptid sighting, a giant shrimp that's walking around

164
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
 laundry rooms.

165
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,920
 And it is an interesting detail that eventually the naval base expanded to include that building.

166
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,080
 It was knocked down, and now she can't go there.

167
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,600
 So was a cryptid really spotted there?

168
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,720
 Was it a naval experiment gone wrong?

169
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,060
 Was it the newest seaman?

170
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,960
 Was it a new recruit?

171
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
 Private shrimp?

172
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
 Wait, they don't call him privates over there.

173
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,400
 What do they call starter sailor men?

174
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 It doesn't matter.

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,920
 Sailor man shrimp?

176
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,400
 Maybe he was working for the navy.

177
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,160
 Maybe he was an experiment.

178
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,520
 Maybe he was a new life form, and the navy took over his property, his home, so they

179
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,680
 could contain him.

180
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
 Maybe they ate him.

181
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
 I don't know.

182
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,960
 Maybe all of the above.

183
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,680
 But maybe he was the first shrimp to enter the US Navy, and he was eaten.

184
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,840
 Who knows?

185
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,420
 But Bjorn, let's wave goodbye to the shrimp.

186
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,100
 We're giving him a high five.

187
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
 He seems pretty cool.

188
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,420
 He didn't actually do enough, and he's just walking through tunnels.

189
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
 Bye shrimp.

190
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
 We'll see you later.

191
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,140
 I'm sure my neighbors just yell out bye shrimp.

192
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,100
 I'm sure they hear me yell out a lot of stuff.

193
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,180
 But today I'm doing it in a hat.

194
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,980
 Bjorn, let's hop in that carbonicopter.

195
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,260
 We're leaving behind Brummerton, Washington.

196
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,740
 We are headed out to Berkshire, Massachusetts.

197
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,180
 Now this is a recommendation from Lerpato.

198
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,160
 Lerpato from YouTube.

199
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,680
 I recently did a story about the Phantom Bugler, and I said it's very, very rare to come across

200
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
 stories where ghosts who kill.

201
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,400
 I said I think I could probably only think of two or three off the top of my head.

202
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,080
 And Lerpato goes, "Oh, I have one.

203
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,000
 Some people believe that ghosts kill people in the Husak Tunnel."

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
 And I go, "Huh?

205
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,560
 I hadn't heard of this story, so I appreciate it, so I tip a hat to you."

206
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
 Lerpato.

207
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,440
 We're headed out to the Husak Tunnel in Berkshire, Massachusetts.

208
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,020
 Now, pick a number between one and six.

209
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
 They're back, baby.

210
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,560
 We're doing another interactive adventure.

211
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,020
 Pick a number between one and six.

212
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,100
 And while you're picking that number, let's do a little bit of background here.

213
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,840
 Husak is supposedly the Mohawk word for forbidden.

214
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,860
 That was a native tribe in the area.

215
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,140
 They hated this mountain.

216
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,580
 They're like, "Thumbs down.

217
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,580
 This mountain totally sucks.

218
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,660
 Don't go there."

219
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,740
 So of course, not a lot of people went there, but when they were laying down railroad tracks,

220
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,500
 you used to have to take a railroad all around, do a bunch of stuff.

221
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,200
 So someone goes, "Tell you what, you know that tunnel that supposedly cursed that people

222
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,060
 who have lived here longer than we've ever been around told us to stay away from?"

223
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,160
 Let's put a hole through it.

224
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,320
 Let's cut a four-mile-long hole through it so we can open up Massachusetts.

225
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,480
 First off, we have to make sure we're able to renounce that.

226
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,600
 But then, we're going to open up that state to the west.

227
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,840
 This will be one of our most traveled tunnels.

228
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,640
 The very first time nitroglycerin was ever used in America was in this tunnel.

229
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,020
 There's a little... if you're ever on Jeopardy!

230
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,580
 There you go, there's that one.

231
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,140
 It was over four miles long.

232
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:28,220
 They started building in 1851, and in the end, 180 men would lose their lives.

233
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,740
 The instruction of this building, "Do you have your number between one and six?

234
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,380
 Be on, bring us down low in that helicopter."

235
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,860
 Now we're going to repel out, because we've never done that yet, have we?

236
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,620
 We're going to hop out on ropes.

237
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,620
 We're going to land it.

238
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,620
 Now we're hanging out on this railroad track.

239
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,960
 March 20th, 1865.

240
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,680
 There's three explosive experts getting ready to do what they do best.

241
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,600
 Blow stuff up.

242
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,240
 Ned Brinkman, Billy Nash, and Ringo Jelly.

243
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
 These are real people, by the way.

244
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,440
 These are not three made-up names.

245
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,640
 No, Ned Brinkman, Billy Nash, and Ringo Jelly.

246
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,360
 They're walking into the tunnel and they're like, "Okay, we're about two miles in, boys.

247
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,400
 This is where we're going to put this bomb."

248
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,060
 I don't think they had a spy versus spy bomb with a little fuse, but anyways, they put

249
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,100
 an explosive device down there and they're like, "Okay, this is what we're going to do.

250
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,580
 We're going to set the charge and then we're going to run super far back into this bunker

251
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,940
 and then wait for it to blow up."

252
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,220
 The other two people are like, "Why did you explain it?

253
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,220
 We do this all the time."

254
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,780
 He's like, "Yeah, I just have a feeling someone in a hat might be listening to me."

255
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,220
 So they put the charges down.

256
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,220
 They're like, "Okay, squeeze them in there."

257
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,260
 And then they start running back to the bunker.

258
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,600
 Now they've just placed the charges.

259
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,280
 They haven't activated them yet.

260
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,600
 But for whatever reason, Ringo-- wait, sorry.

261
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,760
 His name wasn't Ringo Jelly.

262
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,680
 It was Ringo Kelly.

263
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,400
 So that wasn't made up name.

264
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,720
 Ringo Kelly says real name.

265
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,840
 Ringo Kelly, his doppelganger, his twin brother is setting the charges.

266
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,360
 Ringo Kelly gets to the control panel first while Ned and Billy are still running down

267
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
 the tunnel.

268
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,640
 For whatever reason, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,

269
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
 sets off the explosion.

270
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,980
 He wanted to kill-- he was jelly of his brother.

271
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,580
 He wanted to kill him, too.

272
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,520
 So Ringo Kelly accidentally kills Ned Brinkman and Billy Nash.

273
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,020
 So if you pick the number five, if you pick the number five, you are Ringo Jelly.

274
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,780
 You are a fictional character who was created.

275
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
 What?

276
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,380
 I don't have any memory before this event.

277
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
 What am I doing here?

278
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,940
 And you're in the middle of a pitch black tunnel and you see Ned and Billy start running

279
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,940
 and you're like, what?

280
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,940
 What?

281
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
 And then you're running.

282
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,640
 And then you feel explosion behind you.

283
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
 You turn around.

284
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,840
 You're like, aah!

285
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,560
 And then you're like in a big old fireball.

286
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
 So you died.

287
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,200
 If you pick number five, you were a guy with a typoed name.

288
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,880
 You had no family.

289
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,440
 It didn't exist until this very moment.

290
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
 You blew up in a fireball.

291
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,520
 Shut the podcast off now.

292
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
 I'll see you tomorrow.

293
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
 That's the new rule.

294
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,140
 If you die, you got to stop listening to it.

295
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,180
 But you're not dead yet actually.

296
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:19,240
 So I hope you didn't shut it off because what happens is Ringo, the real Ringo, Ringo Kelly,

297
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,900
 if you pick number one, you're Ringo Kelly.

298
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,340
 So Ringo Kelly is like, uh oh.

299
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,780
 That wasn't supposed to do that.

300
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,860
 Body parts are raining down on him.

301
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,940
 So if you pick number one, you're kind of dusting off your shoulder, getting rid of

302
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,900
 some body parts and you're like, I'm going to go home.

303
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,520
 I think I deserve the rest of the day off.

304
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
 Thank you gentlemen.

305
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,020
 You tip your hat to them, you go home.

306
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:48,120
 Now, shortly afterwards, you go missing because on March 30th, 1865, he'd been missing for

307
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,720
 a couple of days.

308
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,200
 Construction workers are going into the tunnel.

309
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,160
 They still got to keep working on stuff just because a couple of people blew.

310
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,760
 180 people died working.

311
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
 I don't think this is the first time people died.

312
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,040
 This might have been the first time they blew up.

313
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,840
 But they're going in and they find Ringo in the tunnel, two miles into the tunnel.

314
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,860
 Here's the point where Ned and Billy died.

315
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,380
 They found Ringo strangled.

316
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,060
 His body lay in there in the pitch darkness.

317
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,460
 For how long?

318
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,460
 Who knows?

319
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,540
 But if you pick number one, let's say Ringo was out dancing to the honky tonk.

320
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,020
 He's like, that's how I dance my blues away?

321
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,660
 I blew up a couple of people.

322
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
 Now I've got to blow up dance floor and he's dancing.

323
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,700
 He's doing the boot scoot and boogie and all that stuff.

324
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,560
 And then he sees this hot girl, sees these two hot girls at the bar and they're making

325
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
 kissy faces at him.

326
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,000
 He thinks it's a little weird because they seem to be wearing wigs and they seem slightly

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 translucent.

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,680
 But their clothes seem normal, right?

329
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,240
 He's like, man, just the way I love my women.

330
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
 Curvy and see-through.

331
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,440
 And he's walking up to him.

332
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,040
 He's like, hey girls, what's up?

333
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,440
 And they're like, hi, I'm Ned Dean.

334
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
 And this is Billy.

335
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,320
 How would you like to go back to our place?

336
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
 And Ringo's like, oh dude, that sounds awesome.

337
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
 And he goes back.

338
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,900
 And their place is two miles into Hoosack Tunnel.

339
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
 He's walking through the tunnel.

340
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,060
 It's super dark and he's like, man, these girls are super fine.

341
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,500
 It's kind of weird how their feet don't touch the ground and they're floating.

342
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,020
 And then he's making out with Ned Dean and Billy's like, no, we're supposed to kill

343
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,020
 him.

344
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
 And Ned Dean's like, oh yeah, I forgot, I forgot.

345
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,300
 And they strangle him.

346
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,620
 So if you're number one, you get killed by ghosts, which again is incredibly rare.

347
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,620
 So you can kind of consider that a treat.

348
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,480
 And everyone has to die sometime, but you actually get killed by ghosts.

349
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,000
 So that's super rare.

350
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
 And if you pick number five, Ringo Jelly.

351
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,320
 If you wore Ringo Jelly, you got to watch the whole thing.

352
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,360
 You're just kind of floating there like a little Casper ghost being like, yeah, get

353
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,680
 revenge and then you fade away.

354
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,040
 So now you guys have to shut off the podcast.

355
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,160
 Now, so that happened in 1865.

356
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,720
 In 1868, they have to build, I learned more about tunnels.

357
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,960
 I didn't retain any of the information.

358
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,920
 You have to build a vent into a tunnel because there's, it's a train tunnel.

359
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,420
 So otherwise it's full of fumes whenever someone would be like, well, on a train, you, it's

360
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
 a four mile long tunnel.

361
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,940
 You don't want everyone falling asleep, carbon monoxide poisoning through the tunnel.

362
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,420
 So they had to drill a vent in it.

363
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,620
 And they had like water pumps and all sorts of stuff.

364
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,980
 They're drilling into this mountain.

365
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,460
 And these dudes are like floating around.

366
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,820
 They're not floating, they're not ghosts yet, but they're like hanging down and they're

367
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,140
 like on like work platforms and stuff like that.

368
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,140
 1868, they're building this giant hole to vent the tunnel.

369
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,660
 So if you pick number three, you're doing an honest day's work, right?

370
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,400
 I'm just a minor man doing whatever a minor can.

371
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,640
 I'd like to take a pickaxe and put it in a rock.

372
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,040
 And then I go do something that rhymes with the rock.

373
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
 That's the theme song.

374
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
 You didn't know that?

375
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,960
 I learned that when I was researching tunnels too.

376
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,280
 Boom, boom, there's a massive explosion.

377
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,280
 But if you pick number three, you hear the explosion.

378
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,400
 You're in like this big giant tunnel.

379
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,740
 You're in this big giant shaft.

380
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,060
 It's a straight down hole.

381
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
 You hear the explosion.

382
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,380
 You look around, you think you're blowing up, right?

383
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,300
 And then you see like a piece of wood.

384
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,540
 Chink, chink, land by your feet.

385
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,300
 And then a hammer.

386
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,540
 Land by your feet.

387
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,540
 And then you look up and you realize where the explosion came from.

388
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
 It was above you.

389
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,540
 So all the worst part, when you're in a giant shaft, there's two terrible places and explosion

390
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
 can happen.

391
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,980
 The bottom of the shaft or above you.

392
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,920
 So there was like a big gas, there was a pumping station.

393
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,560
 There was all this stuff up above and there was a gas leak and it annihilated this platform

394
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,060
 above these workers.

395
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,200
 So you just had tons of stuff falling down.

396
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,440
 Just squishing dudes, right?

397
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,760
 You're like, ah, you're dodging.

398
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,200
 You're able to dodge a couple things.

399
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,520
 Trust me, you're going to wish you got squished if you pick number three.

400
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,560
 The pumping station breaks and giant boulders are falling on you too.

401
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,160
 So you're like, ah, and you're able to dodge everything.

402
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,940
 You're straight up Neo down here.

403
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,300
 But what happens is, because there's no, the pumping station was pumping out the water

404
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,620
 that kept filling the hole.

405
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,580
 Well now the hole slowly filling up with water and it's sealed at the top with all this debris.

406
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,540
 The people on the top are like, uh oh, this is not, this wasn't supposed to happen until

407
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
 the Sunday.

408
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,900
 This happened before, ahead of schedule.

409
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,740
 So they start sending rescue crews down and they put a dude in a bucket.

410
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,120
 Tell me if this isn't a garbage job.

411
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
 This isn't a number.

412
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
 I should have made this a number.

413
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,740
 If you picked number seven, you're in the bucket.

414
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,720
 They put a guy in a bucket and they're like, okay, we're going to lower you down just to

415
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 see what's going on down there.

416
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,920
 And they lower him down, they lower him down.

417
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,280
 He's down there for a while and then they're like, okay, let's bring him back up and see

418
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
 what he has to say.

419
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
 He's all unconscious.

420
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,080
 He's all, and they bring him up and they're like slapping on the face.

421
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
 What happened?

422
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
 What happened?

423
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,880
 He's like, dude, there's no, he goes, you dropped me down there.

424
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,680
 I was down there for like 45 seconds.

425
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
 I passed out.

426
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,280
 There is no hope getting these dudes out.

427
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,760
 They had water rising and they had bricks laying over them, like a bunch of debris over

428
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
 them.

429
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,420
 So if you picked number three, I hope you're not claustrophobic because you survived the

430
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,300
 downpour and water's pumping in.

431
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
 This one's grim.

432
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,860
 I should probably shouldn't have included this one as a number.

433
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,540
 What they found afterwards was that people did whatever they could to survive.

434
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:14,340
 So you and a couple of the other survivors, water's rising, the ceilings collapsed on

435
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,100
 you, you're running out of oxygen, but your hope is stay alive long enough, you'll get

436
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,340
 rescued.

437
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,160
 So you build a raft out of all this debris that's rained down.

438
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,840
 You're like lifting it off of your friends who are dead and you're strapping it together.

439
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,040
 You're using their shoelaces to make rafts.

440
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
 You don't do their pockets.

441
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,360
 You're like, oh dude, I love beef jerky.

442
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,840
 You're eating all their stuff.

443
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,400
 The guys are like, I'm not dead yet.

444
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,560
 I'm one of the guys on the raft.

445
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,800
 You're like, you push them off, take your shoelaces.

446
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,880
 You make the raft, you get on the raft, the raft is floating up, the water's getting up,

447
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,600
 the roof's getting closer.

448
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
 It's pitch black in there.

449
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
 It's super hot.

450
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,980
 That guy is still complaining about you taking his shoelaces.

451
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,020
 And then you reach the top and you're floating in the darkness on this raft.

452
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,060
 Over the next year, bodies would float to the surface.

453
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,600
 The whole thing ended up filling full of water.

454
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,380
 Bodies would end up floating to the surface.

455
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,840
 13 people died in this accident.

456
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,780
 Bodies would float to the surface.

457
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,520
 And then in the end, they did end up, because they had to finish the vent.

458
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,100
 They did end up moving those bricks away.

459
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:21,440
 That's when they found some people had built a raft to stay above the water, but they just

460
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,120
 died of oxygen deprivation.

461
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,880
 So pick number three.

462
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,000
 You did not have a good afternoon, but you did become a ghost because what was interesting

463
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,040
 was in this vent area, people would see ghosts walking around being like, oh, this sucks,

464
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
 dude.

465
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
 I totally wish I wasn't a ghost.

466
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,680
 And if I wasn't a ghost, I wish I had died in a casino or someplace cool.

467
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,920
 This sucks.

468
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,300
 Unless the 13th body was uncovered, once all the bodies were pulled out of the vent, the

469
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
 ghost sightings went away.

470
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
 They found peace.

471
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,220
 So if you pick number three, at least you found peace.

472
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,180
 It's October 16th, 1874.

473
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,300
 If you pick number two, you are a man named Frank Webster.

474
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,820
 Hunter, today, my hunting has taken me towards Husak Tunnel.

475
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,660
 Now at this point, everyone in the area kind of knows the ghost stories.

476
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,380
 It's not a place you want to go.

477
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,140
 Trains are going through it.

478
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,440
 It's not a huge issue.

479
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,000
 But I mean, just because trains go through it at 60 miles an hour, one, doesn't mean

480
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,600
 that you should hang out there.

481
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,840
 You probably shouldn't.

482
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,520
 Two, it also doesn't mean that it's not super spooky.

483
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,360
 Because trains can be going by and there could be like ghosts trying to catch up, ghost hobos,

484
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
 gobos.

485
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,160
 But you don't have to worry about them.

486
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,880
 You're in a train and you probably have a ghost tick and ticker who's like pushing

487
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 them off the train.

488
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,240
 But if you're walking around with a gun, probably not a good idea to hang out at the

489
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,920
 no unhaunted tunnel.

490
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,740
 Anyways, if you pick number two, you don't have a lot of street smarts or tunnel smarts

491
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,140
 in this case.

492
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,740
 Couple days later, Frank Webster is walking around this river and he's like, "Ahhh, ahhh,

493
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,740
 ahhh."

494
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,820
 He's not a ghost yet.

495
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
 He's not a ghost.

496
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,900
 But he's making ghost noises.

497
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,220
 He's falling down.

498
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,020
 He seems to be in a state of shock and some other hunters are like, "Yo, Frankie, what's

499
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
 going on?"

500
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,220
 He's like, "Ahhh, ahhh."

501
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,620
 And so they take him back to civilization.

502
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,660
 They take him to the nearest town and they're like, "Frank, what's going on?

503
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
 What happened to you?"

504
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,500
 And he goes, "You won't believe what happened.

505
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
 I was walking...

506
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,840
 I picked number two and I was walking by a Husak tunnel and I heard a voice.

507
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,040
 Frankie, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.

508
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
 Come in the tunnel."

509
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
 It sounds like a game show.

510
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,400
 "Come in the tunnel, Frank."

511
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
 He's like, "What?

512
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
 I've won?"

513
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,800
 Now, I don't know much about the Husak area, but I do know a lot about ghostly voices calling

514
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 out from beyond.

515
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,480
 I don't care if they were calling me to walk into it.

516
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
 Walmart.

517
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,280
 I'm not following the ghost voices, right?

518
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,420
 I'm not following them into a dark tunnel where ghosts have murdered people.

519
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
 He does.

520
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
 He goes in there.

521
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
 He feels compelled.

522
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,460
 "Come into the tunnel, Frank."

523
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
 And he walks in.

524
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,460
 He's in the pitch dark of the tunnel.

525
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,620
 And then his gun floats away from him.

526
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,500
 Imagine the gun is on a fishing line from a Don Knott's horror movie.

527
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
 He's like, "What?

528
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 What's going on?"

529
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,780
 And the rifle's floating around him in the darkness.

530
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,580
 He's trying to grab onto it.

531
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,440
 And then he can't grab onto the rifle.

532
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,560
 It's just kind of floating away.

533
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,400
 It's like slowly bobbing away, again, like a fishing line.

534
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,880
 And then the rifle spins around and starts beating him up.

535
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,720
 It doesn't grow arms since punching him.

536
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,880
 Someone's hitting him with the rifle.

537
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,360
 He's like, "Ah, this was unexpected."

538
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,160
 And he gets totally beat up by the rifle.

539
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,000
 And then, next thing you notice, he's walking by the river.

540
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,400
 So the cops realize two things.

541
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,520
 One, the dude was beat up.

542
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,080
 And two, his rifle was missing.

543
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,320
 So if you pick number two, that's all that happened to you.

544
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,940
 That's all-- you should feel lucky.

545
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,980
 All you did was get tricked into going into a dark tunnel and got beat up by a rifle from

546
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,660
 special effects from an old '50s movie.

547
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,340
 So that's pretty good, right?

548
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,020
 You got out good on that one.

549
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,740
 Unless your fear is being beaten up by rifles then, I'm sorry.

550
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,420
 Now let's jump to the fall of 1875.

551
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,340
 There's a guy named Harlan Mulvaney.

552
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,100
 He's a fire tender.

553
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,680
 So that's a dude who brings wood in and sets it on fire or something like that.

554
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
 He brings fuel, maybe?

555
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
 I don't know.

556
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
 I could have looked it up.

557
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
 I could have looked it up, too.

558
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,640
 Now I'm looking at my notes.

559
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,720
 He's a fire tender.

560
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
 You guys know what that is.

561
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,960
 I shouldn't have to explain it to you.

562
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,280
 I mean, come on, guys.

563
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
 You know what that is.

564
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,560
 Disappointed that you would even ask.

565
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,400
 We're gonna have this episode, by the way.

566
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
 Harlan Mulvaney, fire tender.

567
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,880
 If you pick number four, you're this dude.

568
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,760
 So you're riding your cart in and he has a load of wood on his cart.

569
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,740
 There's a bunch of horses and stuff and he's walking into the tunnel and all that stuff.

570
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:38,340
 And he's like, "I'm about to do my highly detailed and very important job without me.

571
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,180
 The rail system wouldn't even exist."

572
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,580
 And anyway, so everyone is outside of the tunnel.

573
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,540
 There's still breaking rocks and doing stuff.

574
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:54,380
 And all of a sudden, that's not an old lady laughing.

575
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,340
 That's a bunch of horses.

576
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,980
 That's not even more like an old lady laughing.

577
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,240
 Guys, a bunch of horses naeing.

578
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,800
 Now, the cart is running out of the tunnel.

579
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 He didn't even go that far in.

580
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,200
 He didn't hit the two mile mark.

581
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,880
 The people working the construction outside of the tunnel, all of a sudden, see these

582
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,040
 horses?

583
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,880
 The crib keepers there as well now.

584
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,800
 See these horses run out of the tunnel and Harlan's holding on the reins.

585
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,280
 He's super scared, dude.

586
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,960
 They can tell that it was off.

587
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,320
 He's probably super scared because of those spooky noises that he just heard that definitely

588
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,300
 weren't horse noises.

589
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,220
 That's probably the first thing that scared him.

590
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,860
 Second thing that scared him was he's leaving a tunnel at high speed.

591
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,580
 The third thing, the construction workers were like, "That weird.

592
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,380
 He looks scared about three things."

593
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,500
 The two I mentioned and the fact that he's seen something in that tunnel.

594
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:50,020
 The horses run off into the woods, cart attached.

595
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,420
 The whole cart goes off into the woods and people start chasing the cart.

596
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,340
 And then a few days later, because they lose track, or they get bored, they have your loose

597
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,080
 track and they're like, "Oh, he'll come back."

598
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,360
 He's having a bad day or you got possessed by ghosts either or he'll come back.

599
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,680
 A couple days later, they find the cart deep in the woods.

600
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
 He is never seen again.

601
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,680
 So if you pick number four, we're going to have to do a little more detail here.

602
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,560
 If you pick number four, you walk into the...

603
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,760
 Dude, this is actually trippy.

604
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
 I just thought of this.

605
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,680
 What if you're in the cart and you're walking into the tunnel and then all of a sudden you

606
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,900
 are like, "Oh, it's super dark in here and I'm kind of spooked."

607
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,300
 I'm going to jump off of the cart.

608
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
 So now you're walking around in the darkness and you're like, "What?

609
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,620
 This is super nerve-racking in the tunnel before.

610
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,620
 I didn't expect these places to get so black."

611
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,380
 And so if you pick number four, you're walking around in the dark and you see a ghostly figure

612
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,500
 in front of you and you're like, "What?

613
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,300
 Must be one of them ghosts I heard so much about in this tunnel."

614
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,620
 And you notice he's kind of standing there and then you're like, "Uh-oh.

615
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,000
 He has a rifle.

616
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,960
 I better take that from him before he ghost shoots me."

617
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,120
 So you grab the rifle and then the ghost turns around.

618
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,520
 He looks all weird and stuff and he's like, "Uh-oh.

619
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
 Give me back my rifle."

620
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,320
 And you get scared and you start beating the ghost with the rifle.

621
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
 Right?

622
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,920
 You see where I'm going with this?

623
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
 Uh-uh.

624
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,120
 And the way you're holding it looks like fishing line for some weird reason too.

625
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,040
 You're like making it float and then you beat them up and then you take the rifle because

626
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,180
 you're super scared and you get on your fire tender cart and you run out.

627
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,260
 Like the implication was you were the dude who took the gun from number two.

628
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:34,780
 Because even though that took place a year earlier, maybe, even though the story's all

629
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,540
 about ghosts, maybe there's some sort of time dimension thing, right?

630
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,940
 So if you pick number four, you actually beat up number two and then you took the rifle

631
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,540
 and then you just kind of evaporated, right?

632
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
 Your story's over.

633
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,540
 Like you just kind of disappeared.

634
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,880
 I wonder if they found the horses.

635
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,240
 That would be weird or two.

636
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,380
 They just found the cart.

637
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,380
 No horses, no guy.

638
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,960
 So if you pick number four, you beat up number two.

639
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,760
 Now all of this, there's another ghost story about this guy that I didn't even give it

640
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
 a number.

641
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,240
 I'm acting like I did into a purpose but I forgot to give it a number.

642
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,560
 There was this guy named Joseph.

643
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,720
 If you picked any number, if you didn't pick a number, this is you.

644
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,120
 There's a guy named Joseph in Poco.

645
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
 He believed in the ghost.

646
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
 He believed in all that stuff.

647
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,320
 One day he was breaking ice off the tracks and he hears a voice going, "Run Joe, run!"

648
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
 He's like, "What?"

649
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,840
 And he looks up and there's a train coming right at him and he jumps out of the way.

650
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,160
 "Oh my God, the ghost saved my life."

651
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,160
 Which when I read that I thought, "You didn't hear the train, you heard the ghost?"

652
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,440
 But you didn't hear the train in the tunnel?

653
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
 But whatever.

654
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
 That's the story, right?

655
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,340
 But then that's not all because six weeks later he's working on the tracks.

656
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,960
 This time he has to break one of the freight cars, his frozen to the tracks, which makes

657
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,160
 me realize he didn't do his job the first time.

658
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,400
 First time he was trying to break ice off the tracks.

659
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,880
 Obviously now if there was enough ice that a rail car freezes to the track, he didn't

660
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
 do your job, dude.

661
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,160
 But anyways, he's now breaking ice off the tracks and he hears a voice in his head warning

662
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
 him.

663
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:10,440
 First off, how strong is this man that they hire him to pry a rail car loose with a crowbar?

664
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,200
 The freight cars frozen on the tracks, they give him a crowbar to then help get the rail

665
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
 car free.

666
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,400
 So who is this Joseph and Poco?

667
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,800
 But somehow they got him to do the job.

668
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,080
 Now, he's about to get electrocuted.

669
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,800
 So a voice is warning him of this and in the nick of time he doesn't get electrocuted.

670
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,440
 But I'm giving away the ending here because what the ghost says to him seems like he's

671
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,040
 wasting precious seconds.

672
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,960
 Let's say that you see a dude about to get electrocuted.

673
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
 What would you say?

674
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,400
 I want you to say it out loud so your neighbors hear it.

675
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
 If you see someone about to get electrocuted, you see a good friend, not someone you don't

676
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
 like.

677
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,680
 It's not Cobra Commander about to get electrocuted.

678
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,440
 But you see someone who you like about to get electrocuted by using a crowbar on a train

679
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
 track.

680
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,760
 You're going to go, "Drop it!

681
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
 Look out!"

682
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,240
 Look out's a little vague, right?

683
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,000
 Because then they're like, "Oh, is there a baseball coming?

684
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,920
 Is someone hitting a golf ball?"

685
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
 Drop it, works.

686
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
 Drop it!

687
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
 Utterity!

688
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,480
 So I guess now you're just naming off elements.

689
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,360
 But you would warn them in the quickest...

690
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,480
 They're fighting something that's literally going the speed of light, right?

691
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,560
 Electricity is lightning fast.

692
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,360
 The ghost voice goes, "Joe!

693
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,000
 Joe!

694
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,880
 Drop it, Joe!"

695
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,320
 He immediately lets go of the crowbar and the crowbar flies away because the electrical

696
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
 arc would...

697
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
 That's...

698
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
 I mean, that ghost...

699
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,680
 I mean, I guess it was aficion, right?

700
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,040
 If you heard the voice in your head, it doesn't need to go, "Jason!

701
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,840
 My name's two syllables, which would be even worse because it'd be like, "Jason!

702
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
 Jason!"

703
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
 And by that time, I'm electrocuted.

704
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,320
 And then the voice would be like, "Ugh!

705
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,200
 Sorry, I should have just yelled out, 'Electricity!'"

706
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,320
 But they didn't do that.

707
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,800
 So I didn't want to assign that one a number again.

708
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,840
 I actually forgot to assign that one a number.

709
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,120
 So but we do have number six here.

710
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,040
 Number six brings us to the present day.

711
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:07,180
 So if you pick number six, you are intrepid journalist Steve Jacob, who adds a new wrinkle

712
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,520
 to this story.

713
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,600
 We have all of these hauntings, all these old, timey haunties.

714
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,000
 But Steve Jacob is a journalist who wrote an article, a freelance article for the website

715
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 medium.com.

716
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,240
 And in it, he actually interviews this woman named Jeannie, who's talking about history

717
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
 of the Housaq tunnel.

718
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,680
 And we have this interesting interaction.

719
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,360
 So if you're number six, you're sitting down with this woman named Jeannie, and you're doing

720
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,880
 this interview.

721
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,280
 So you, number six says, "Now tell me about the video you took.

722
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,000
 What was that noise in the background?"

723
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Jeannie shifts uncomfortably in her chair.

724
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,640
 She's like, "What are you talking about?"

725
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,080
 Her actual answer is, "What video?"

726
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
 You furrow your brow.

727
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
 You're like, "What?"

728
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,440
 "I know I saw a video."

729
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,640
 Quote, "The video I found on YouTube, you went into the tunnel on Wednesday, right?

730
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,720
 The video was posted around 6pm."

731
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,240
 Jeannie, her eyes dart from side to side.

732
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,920
 I'm giving her suspicious intent.

733
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,960
 Her eyes dart from side to side.

734
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,480
 She goes, "Quote, oh no, Steve.

735
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,200
 I went in at nine.

736
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,960
 I couldn't go until the girls were in bed."

737
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,000
 So Steve Jaco pulls up on YouTube.

738
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,680
 Click, click, click, click.

739
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,800
 Pulls up a video.

740
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
 Here's this quote.

741
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,640
 "I showed her the video and she hadn't seen it.

742
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,480
 I have no idea where it came from, but I'm attaching it to this article in the hopes

743
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,080
 that one of you knows where it came from.

744
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,040
 Thank you so much to Jeannie for meeting with me, and thank you to everyone for reading.

745
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,920
 I'll never stop reporting on the stories that matter to this community."

746
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,200
 This was the only article he had written on Medium.com.

747
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,780
 So if you pick number six, let me play this video for you, this video he's referencing.

748
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,120
 If you pick number six, you have a real life consequence to that number.

749
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,880
 You are intrepid journalist Steve Jaco trying to share the stories that matter to the community.

750
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,240
 If you pick number six, I'm going to play this audio clip for you guys, but if you pick

751
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,600
 number six, are you going to listen to this audio clip at 3 a.m.?

752
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,360
 Now technically if you want, you could say 3 a.m. Eastern Standard Time and listen to

753
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,360
 it in the middle afternoon.

754
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,880
 That's up to you, but if you pick number six, you should find the spookiest time to listen

755
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
 to this.

756
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,360
 Trust me, the video itself is spooky enough if you're listening to this right now in

757
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,000
 broad daylight.

758
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,200
 Time to clench your butthole, because this might be cursed.

759
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,280
 Who would propose the1002?

760
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,600
 I'm here to quantify the rooms that you wish to see for yourself.

761
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 Wow...

762
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,600
 *phone ringing*

763
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 *door opening*

764
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,600
 *static*

765
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,600
 *static*

766
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,600
 I wanna die!

767
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
 *static*

768
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,600
 It's interesting, it is a clip on YouTube.

769
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,600
 It sounds like it's from three different sources. The first one has that weird muttering.

770
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 And then there's like a bizarre tone, and then it sounds like...

771
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,600
 It's supposed to be in a tunnel and you're hearing ghostly voices.

772
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,600
 The link will obviously be in the show notes if you wanna watch the video, but that's a disturbing little sound clip.

773
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
 And Steve Jaco has not written an article since.

774
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
 Well, at least not from Medium.com, not that I could tell.

775
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,600
 So it's possible that if you pick number six, you did listen to that late at night.

776
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,600
 Maybe you took it into a HUSAC tunnel yourself.

777
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
 Sat down with a pair of headphones.

778
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
 Turned on this podcast fast-forwarded to that very moment.

779
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,600
 And in the darkness of HUSAC tunnel, illuminated only by the blue light of your phone.

780
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,600
 The specters of all that passed away creep up behind you,

781
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,600
 ready to add a new member to the body count.

782
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,600
 Of the bloody pit.

783
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,600
 Did I mention earlier in the episode the nickname of the place was "Bloody Pit"?

784
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,600
 Well, if I didn't, I just did.

785
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,600
 And now, you're in the bloody pit. That should have mentioned earlier.

786
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,600
 You're there. You're one of these ghosts.

787
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
 Dead Wrap of Radio.

788
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
 Gmail.com is gonna be your email address.

789
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
 The landlord shows up and goes, "Oh, I forgot to tell you.

790
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
 This place, it's called the Bloody Pit."

791
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,600
 Should have mentioned that. Should have mentioned that much earlier.

792
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
 Totally forgot.

793
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,600
