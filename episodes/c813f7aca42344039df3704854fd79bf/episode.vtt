00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.600
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.600
 A body found in the desert, another mystery.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 But this one involves one of the most famous people in the world.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.600
 And then we take a look at a true crime case that was so bad,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.600
 it caused people to change their last name,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 I am your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 I hope you're having a great day, too.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so we're going to jump right into it now.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 A little warning.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 A warning.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 This episode's a little grim.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 Try to keep it lay-hearted, but it's pretty grim.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 Okay, so I don't recommend listening to this episode if you're depressed.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 I don't know.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 The year is 2012.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 Massive icebergs crashing against the West Coast.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 People barely escaping earthquakes in their planes.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 In the movies that we all went and saw, but in real life in 2012.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 It's June 26th.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 There's a dark SUV driving through the desert of East LA.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 Here's the spot.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600
 [imitates car horn]

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 You didn't have to skid.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 You got to driven and stop normally, but okay.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 Everyone gets out of the SUV.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 [imitates car horn]

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 Four doors shutting.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 Anyways, have to open up the back.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 [imitates car horn]

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 You get the point.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 There's an SUV in the middle of East LA.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.600
 It's dark outside, and there is a small black canvas bag.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600
 Maybe Lycra.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
 I don't know.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.600
 But it had...

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600
 There was a body in there.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 [laughs]

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 Get to the point.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600
 There was a body in the bag.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 One guy starts digging the hole.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 Should I pre-dug it?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 That's a tip.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.600
 Take the canvas bag or Lycra and throw it into the hole and bury it.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.600
 Now, that unfortunately happens all the time.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.600
 Not all the time like it's happening right now, but bodies get buried in the desert.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 People disappear.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 But this body was supposedly different.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 The girl in the bag is supposedly Miley Cyrus.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.600
 This was a request from Matthew T via email.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.600
 This is a very famous conspiracy theory.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 The first time I saw it was on 4chan years ago.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 Years and years and years and years ago.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 It's been going around 4chan for quite a while, and it's kind of bubbled up to the surface internet.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 I mean, 4chan's surface internet, but you know what I mean?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.600
 It's gotten a little bit of mainstream play, but that was the first place I saw it.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.600
 It was bizarre because the theory that...

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 Okay, so let me get into the conspiracy theory real quick.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.600
 The conspiracy theory is that Miley Cyrus...

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.600
 This is so ridiculous.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.600
 Okay, so Miley Cyrus was supposed to have an orgy.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.600
 This was after Hannah Montana, by the way.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.600
 This was when she was older, so it's not super icky, but Miley Cyrus was supposed to have an orgy with a bunch of Disney executives.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.600
 And she refused.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.600
 She said, "No, I'm not going to do that."

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.600
 So they beat her to death and threw her in a bag and drove her out to East LA and buried her in the dirt.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.600
 And the thing was is that her body was found.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 Her body was eventually found.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 People were like, "Oh my God, look, it's Miley Cyrus. She's been beaten to death."

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 And a local radio station reported that they had found her body.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.600
 And actually taking a double look at my notes, they didn't find her in a duffel bag.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.600
 But that's not the point, because the whole story is made up, by the way.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 The news station reported that her body was found, like on the side of the road in East LA,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600
 and she looked like she was dehydrated and beaten to death.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.600
 I had always heard that she was buried and they just never found the body, so the story has varied.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
 I guess I always heard that she was left on the side of the road as well,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 but I later version I heard was that she just disappeared.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.600
 She was buried in the desert of East LA.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.600
 So, first thing we have to address is, Miley Cyrus is not dead.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600
 Miley Cyrus is alive.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.600
 Okay? That's the first thing we have to address, but let's get into why this conspiracy theory takes off.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.600
 It's one of those things that, and we see this a lot, we actually see it a lot with school shooting things now,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 but we see it mostly with celebrities.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 They'll take a picture of a younger photo of a celebrity,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.600
 and then they'll take a photo of that celebrity when they're older,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.600
 and they'll circle different parts of their body and go see the nose,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.600
 remember she used to have a child-like nose, and now her nose is more adult-like?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.600
 She must have been replaced, and obviously with celebrities, you're going to have things like plastic surgery taking place as well.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.600
 Fake celebrity deaths stories have been around forever.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 What we're getting a lot of now is celebrities murdered and replaced by body devils.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 So that's the conspiracy theory here.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:45.600
 And what's funny is that out of the, in the original 4chan posts where they explained the story behind Miley Cyrus being murdered,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.600
 there was a bunch of other stupid, like, rumors on there, one of them.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.600
 Remember that movie Home Alone? I reference it all the time, I've never seen it.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:01.600
 Apparently in the same paragraph, or in the same post that says Miley Cyrus was brought out to the desert, beaten to death,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.600
 for not being in an orgy with Disney executives,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.600
 Macaulay Culkin was molested by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci on the set of Home Alone for the whole shoot of the film.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.600
 That never took off.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.600
 That conspiracy theory never gained any legs. I think it's interesting that the Miley Cyrus one did.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.600
 And I do have to say, if you go, "Well, how do you know Miley Cyrus?"

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:30.600
 I will, this is my, it's funny, I will talk about ghosts, and I will talk about, "Oh, here's my experience with the Haunted Department."

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 There's one thing I almost never tell anyone about, because the story is so ridiculous, nobody believes me, and I have to spend like a half hour convincing them.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.600
 I know Miley Cyrus. Well, I guess I should say I did, as in a few years ago.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.600
 But, it's not like, whenever I tell people that, they're like, "How do you know?" And I was like, "Ugh."

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.600
 Like, it's a long drawn out story, but we talked for a while, we talked for a couple months.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 And I was like, "Yes, yes, she exists, she's still alive, so I know that as a fact."

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:09.600
 But, again, I'll tell you all of my ghost stories before I try convincing another person that I know Miley Cyrus.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.600
 Because of that, for some reason, they'll believe me when I tell them there's a purple man in my apartment.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.600
 But when I tell them I know Miley Cyrus, it's, a fight starts.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:32.600
 So anyways, she's not dead. But what's interesting is we have all of these rumors about celebrities dying and being killed by the Illuminati, being replaced.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 There's tons of them. That spunky dunk sent me through email an actual fun death conspiracy.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.600
 I thought this was interesting. I thought this was an interesting take on the dead celebrity.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.600
 So, George Burns was this famous comedian, this is very brief, but George Burns was this famous comedian.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.600
 The old man, he was in all those movies like, "Oh God, you devil."

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 I mean, he had a long stand-up career, long career in film.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:14.600
 And his thing would be like, "I'm gonna live till I'm 100, I'm gonna live to be 100 years old, and I'm gonna walk on stage to the Las Vegas Resort, and I'm gonna do my routine."

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 He actually signed a contract saying he would perform when he turned 100 at this casino.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:29.600
 And he would go on The Carson Show, and he would just, that was, that's not all he talked about, he also actually had a comedy routine he did.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 That was one of his things, like, "I'm so old, and I'm gonna live to be 100, and I'll still be doing this show."

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.600
 So in January 1996, he had already not been seen for a while.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:46.600
 He's 99 years old in 1996, and his 100th birthday rolls around.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.600
 But he makes no live appearances, and people go, "Yeah, that, I mean, yeah, it was probably a joke, he signed that contract, like..."

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.600
 But he did it, he made it to 100.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.600
 And then in February, his publicist is saying, "Oh yeah, no, he's doing great."

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.600
 He actually went out to go play poker with some guys the other day.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.600
 His old buddies came over, and they all played poker.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.600
 The end.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.600
 There's no photos, there was no names of the people who supposedly went to play poker with him, it was just something the publicist released.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.600
 And then in March, they announced that he had passed away.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.600
 But really, nobody had seen him publicly for a while before that.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:31.600
 So the conspiracy theory is, is that he died earlier, and they were able to cover it up.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.600
 So he lived to be 100, like he always said he would.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.600
 Is that possible? I mean, obviously you're gonna have things like death certificates and things like that.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:47.600
 But it's, it's not, it's more likely than Miley Cyrus being replaced by a body double.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.600
 But I think it's always interesting when you can get a conspiracy theory that actually is uplifting.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:04.600
 Like the family and the publicist watch their friend for decades, and family member for their lifetime die, and say, "You know what, let's try to make his dream come true."

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.600
 "Let's let him live to be 100. Let's put that in the record books. The oldest living comedian."

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.600
 So conspiracies can go both ways. I thought that was a very interesting celebrity death conspiracy as well.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:24.600
 But again, it's a conspiracy, there's absolutely no proof, it's just all assumptions and stuff like that, but it's still kind of a sweet story.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.600
 Okay, so that was the lighthearted part of the episode.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.600
 Miley Cyrus sitting in the duffel bag on the side of the road.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.600
 Now, oh, and I guess I should say, they're, what that didn't exist either.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.600
 It's not like they found a body and it looked like Miley Cyrus. They was just all made up.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.600
 And I don't think the home alone thing happened either, honestly.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.600
 But now we're going to Belgium.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.600
 We're going to Belgium and we're gonna look at this guy. Let's take the carboner copter,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.600
 because I think this is gonna be the last bit of levity we have for this episode, unless an inappropriate joke pops up.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:02.600
 But as we're flying over to Belgium, we're listening to "Can't Be Tamed" Miley Cyrus' hit album.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.600
 We're flying over to Belgium. I know I've already said that.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.600
 And as we're flying over there, I tell you this, listen, this story's gonna get a little dark,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.600
 but at the same time, this guy is such a weird idiot.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.600
 This guy is such an idiot that you're gonna keep thinking, how in the world has this guy not gotten caught?

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.600
 How is this guy just not really faced any charges for it?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.600
 And it's going to, I mean, it's weird, because he almost seems to have this weird sort of luck to him.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.600
 And who we're talking about is Mark Dutroux.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.600
 Dutroux? I think it's Dutroux.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:46.600
 And it doesn't matter, because that name doesn't really exist in that country anymore,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.600
 because this case was so bad that people changed their last name over it.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.600
 They just wanted nothing to do with this name.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.600
 And you're gonna, every time I say something, you're gonna be like, "That's not bad."

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.600
 Yeah, well, okay, so, Billy, Mark was a career criminal.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:11.600
 He looks like an accountant. He looks like a skinnier version of the red staple guy from the office space.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.600
 He looks like a big old nerd, but he was actually a career criminal.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:22.600
 And he was, like, his main thing was kind of robbing cars and raping and kidnapping girls.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.600
 So a very odd choice of, like, that's a weird spread to have.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.600
 One is all about money making.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.600
 The other one is kind of about self-gratification.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 But again, wait till the end how this plays out.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 He actually was a very, very successful criminal to the point where he owned seven houses.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.600
 Now I'm assuming that, you know, Belgium doesn't have the highest, I don't know how much houses cost in Belgium,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.600
 especially this was back in, like, this span of the 1980s to, like, the 1990s.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.600
 So I'm sure he was, you know, $10,000 a house.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.600
 I'm getting hung up on the wrong point.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:06.600
 He owned seven houses, three of them, were specifically to torture and rape people.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.600
 He owned three houses specifically to torture people.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.600
 So he ends up in 1986, though, so early, early on he pops up on the radar.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.600
 I mean, he'd done petty crimes and stuff like that.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:25.600
 In 1986, him and his wife, Michelle Martin, I don't know why she has a different last name, but,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 him and his wife in 1986 are caught and convicted of raping five young girls.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.600
 Sentenced to 13 and a half years for five.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 Five young girls, he got sentenced to 13 and a half years and you're thinking, oh my God, that's no time at all for five rapes.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.600
 He only served three because the judge said, he's a really good guy.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.600
 He's really good in prison.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.600
 Three years for raping five different girls.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:06.600
 His grandma sees that mark as getting, his grandma sees that mark as getting paroled out three years later.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 She writes a letter to the judge saying, I don't think that's a good idea.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.600
 I think he's up to something.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.600
 Judge doesn't care, lets him go.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:21.600
 So the next time we start to really see Mark engaging in this, at least that we have records of,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.600
 1995, two eight-year-old girls are kidnapped and taken to his dungeon.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.600
 Now, his dungeon, you know, you have his living houses, he has his torture houses,

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:41.600
 but in his main house that he lived in, he built a dungeon underneath the house, or like in the basement.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.600
 It was seven feet long, three feet wide, five feet high.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.600
 So imagine how comfortable you would be in that.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 Five feet high automatically would be a no-go for me.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.600
 But seven feet long and three feet wide, that's basically just one person,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.600
 he starts kidnapping women, multiple women and forcing them in here.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:12.600
 First off, two eight-year-old girls are kidnapped right off the street by him and his wife, throwing in the basement.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:20.600
 Two months later, so he's kidnapped, they don't find the girl, the little girls are in the basement,

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.600
 and he keeps them for two months.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:30.600
 Two months after that, he finds two teenage girls and kidnaps them and throws them in the basement.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:36.600
 So now he has four women underneath his house, and his wife, it totally knows about it.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.600
 She's totally sicko too.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.600
 And there's a friend that's kind of floating around in the periphery who ends up becoming a accomplice.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 So he has four girls in his basement.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.600
 Eventually, two of the teenage girls, either they rebel too much or he gets tired of them,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.600
 he takes the teenage girls out of the basement, buries them alive.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.600
 He ends up, so his auto-theft ring is about to be exposed.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:10.600
 And he knows that one of the guys that's working for him has been, he basically has been holding a bunch of money,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.600
 holding a bunch of the profits of the cars, and is also being tailed by the police.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:22.600
 So what Mark does, he invites them over to his house, which do not go over to a dude's house,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.600
 because it was pretty well known among his gang, I believe, that he was also doing this side thing with women.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:34.600
 But anyways, this idiot goes over to his house and gets roofied by Mark.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:43.600
 And when the drugs wear off, you know those hose clamps that they're basically the metal circle that have the little screw on it,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.600
 and you can just kind of like put it around a hose and it gets tighter and tighter and tighter,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.600
 and then you turn the screw and it's locked.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.600
 It's just basically a metal ring that you can tighten.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:59.600
 The guy, the accomplice with the car ring, wakes up to find one of those clamped around his nut sack,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:06.600
 and Mark screaming at him, saying, "Where's the money? Where's the money? The cops are after you. Give me the money. Give me the money."

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.600
 That sounds, that's the worst way to wake up.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.600
 I can't imagine, I would, I think it would be better to wake up with an ax coming at you,

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.600
 about to bust your head open than to wake up with a hose clamp on your balls.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.600
 Because then you don't know what's going to happen, at least you know the ax is going to be over soon.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:31.600
 The guy, the friend, the previous accomplice in this business together with his balls just being crushed,

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.600
 tells Mark, "Yes, yes, I will tell you where the money is."

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.600
 Mark then buries him alive, with the ball clamp still locked on.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.600
 And I think he probably had bigger things to worry about as the sand entered his airway,

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.600
 but still he could have made it a little more comfortable.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:55.600
 So, Mark's like, "Awesome, I got the money. The guy, the police were investigating for the auto theft ring.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:02.600
 Is gone? The police will never find out that it was me behind the auto theft ring. He gets arrested."

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:09.600
 He gets arrested for stealing cars. They already had enough evidence on Mark to get him for stealing cars.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.600
 They sent him to jail. This time they don't know about any of the murders.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.600
 They send him to jail for a year.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.600
 Now, a lot of times when you go to jail, you have to make arrangements.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:28.600
 You may have an employer and say, "You know, I work construction and I was wondering, I'm going to jail for this auto theft thing.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.600
 Do you think I'll still have a job when I come back?"

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.600
 And now, you know, we'll talk about it.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.600
 Make arrangements about, you know, who's going to move your stuff, where's it going to stay, stuff like that.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.600
 His arrangement was, he told his wife, "Don't forget to feed the girls in the basement."

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.600
 Because remember, they're still going to be in there. Now that I'm not, wife's like, "Yeah, I'll feed them."

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:54.600
 So he goes to jail for a year. When he comes out of jail, he comes home, he goes in the basement.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.600
 Both girls have starved to death.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.600
 And the wife, Michelle, was like, "I was too scared to go down there. They were making a lot of noise and they were banging on the wall.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.600
 So I just let them starve to death."

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.600
 So what do you do now that you have a bunch of dead kids in your basement?

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.600
 And your mark, I guess I should add that one, you go out and grab somebody else.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.600
 So they got rid of those bodies in 1996.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:27.600
 So he just gets out of jail. He's driving on the road, finds a 12-year-old girl, throws her in the car, takes her home.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.600
 Later, he's driving around the town.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.600
 So he's a 14-year-old girl, grabs her off the road, puts her in the car.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:40.600
 And this is where they see the wife helping him and an accomplice because at this point, people are reporting,

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.600
 "Hey, this van just came by and picked up this 14-year-old girl."

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.600
 The police follow it. They ID it. They arrest them. And they free the girls.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.600
 The end, right?

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.600
 So that's the story of Mark Dutroul.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:02.600
 And you're thinking, "Okay, he just seemed to be fairly lucky. He's able to kidnap all these girls and not get caught.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.600
 He's able to pay for all these houses, some even specifically built for torturing people.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.600
 He gets arrested for auto theft, sure, but he only does a year and then he comes out and he finds this stuff.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:20.600
 Like, he seems to be fairly lucky, but his luck, actually, we haven't even scraped the surface of that because what happens is after he gets arrested,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.600
 a bunch of stuff comes out.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.600
 And the biggest thing is Mark says to the police,

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:37.600
 "I am the number one provider of child and teenage sex slaves to people in high positions in this country.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.600
 I have provided women and girls to judges and politicians and police officers.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.600
 They come to me when they want something that is illegal."

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:55.600
 Now, of course, this causes a big, big issue.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.600
 Some of the police officers absolutely don't believe it right off the bat.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.600
 They're like, "That's not true. He's just trying to make it into this big thing.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.600
 This is a psychological thing that killers do where they try to turn themselves into some sort of killing god.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.600
 They're not just some lone weirdo. They're a part of some organization."

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:19.600
 And other people are like, "That actually makes a lot of sense because this is what started coming out as they started investigating this."

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:26.600
 Because when he was being investigated for other crimes, car theft, other petty stuff,

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.600
 he offered money to a police informant to buy girls.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:38.600
 Police informant, someone working with the police, knew that he was in the market for young girls.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:45.600
 He told the same police informant that he had built a cell, so you figure that could just be, that's just hearsay.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:52.600
 His mom wrote a letter to the police saying, "I think he has girls locked up in his basement."

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.600
 When the police were investigating him for car theft, they went to his house,

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:04.600
 and they had a locksmith going around opening locks, and when they were in the basement, the locksmith said,

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.600
 "I thought I heard people crying out for help."

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.600
 And the police were like, "No, no, no, no, no, that's no big deal. That's no big deal."

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:22.600
 And then there apparently was a videocassette in Mark's house that showed him building the dungeon.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.600
 It would have showed exactly in the house where the dungeon was, and the police were like,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.600
 during the trial, during the investigation into the police, they go,

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.600
 "How come you didn't watch this tape?" and they said, "We didn't have a VCR."

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:40.600
 So again, all of that stuff is just, can be chalked up to incompetence on the part of police.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:46.600
 So he says that he is protected by powerful people, and the police let him do what he did

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:52.600
 because he was providing young women to powerful people, and they start investigating it,

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.600
 and they come up, I mean, all of this stuff could just be incompetence.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:02.600
 But then we get into the weird stuff, the stuff that isn't chalked up to incompetence,

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.600
 the stuff that's chalked up to, he might be telling the truth.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:14.600
 This was actually before Mark's trial, they now opened an investigation into these allegations.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.600
 Is it possible that Mark was providing girls to high-powered people?

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.600
 They had to open an investigation into that.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.600
 They got a seasoned judge, a guy not like Bacon seasoning,

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:32.600
 but a judge who had been around for years, they get him to oversee this investigation from the legal side of it.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.600
 Like, basically, it's not like out there with a magnifying glass, but you know what I mean?

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:42.600
 Like, he's the guy who's basically going to look at all the evidence and decide whether or not they can go forward with this investigation charge.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:50.600
 So it's not Mark's trial, it's a look into whether or not these things are true about what he's saying.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:57.600
 The judge attends a charity dinner for one of his victims, and people go, "How can you be unbiased?

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:03.600
 How can you be unbiased if you're going to a charity dinner to raise money for a family of a girl who was raped and murdered?

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.600
 You can't be part of this investigation."

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.600
 The judge is like, "Whatever, like that's stupid, but whatever.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:15.600
 I'm sure they will replace me with somebody just as diligent as is and intelligent as myself."

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:22.600
 The new judge who was taken over to investigate powerful people and find out what if these allegations are true?

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.600
 First time, first time judge.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:31.600
 Never handled anything like this before, handpicked almost to be incompetent.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:38.600
 And immediately says, "I don't want any more evidence, I want us to go through the evidence that we have right now to see if these allegations are true.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.600
 I don't want people to keep running around and investigating this stuff.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:47.600
 Let's just go over all the stuff we have so far and decide whether or not to go forward."

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:54.600
 So really just quashed the investigation and just looked at any evidence, preliminary evidence that they had gathered.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.600
 Huge protests in Brussels over this.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:06.600
 Because this was a big story, you had all these young girls killed, you had this guy who took them 10, 15 years to catch.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.600
 The victims that I've listed, like the girls that we know, those are the ones we know about.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.600
 He's saying there was a huge network of girls being kidnapped, raped and murdered.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:21.600
 It definitely seems like he did more, whether or not he was selling them to other people is the question, is where the conspiracy comes into.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:31.600
 The people of Brussels, the people of Belgium were pissed, 300,000 people marched on the Capitol after that judge was removed and the new judge put in.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.600
 People were furious because they saw this as government cover-up.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 The former judge, the judge who got canned for going to the charity dinner, was now brought back to testify during the investigation phase over whether or not this was a conspiracy theory.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:59.600
 And he said, "We were told by police that murder contracts had been taken out against magistrates."

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:11.600
 So the police said, "Listen, somebody is trying to kill judges over this. We cannot guarantee your safety if you remain a part of this investigation."

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:18.600
 So long story short, the conspiracy investigation, after 17 months long, said there was no conspiracy at all.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:30.600
 We've fully investigated ourselves. We did nothing wrong. There was some corruption, there was some incompetence, but we were not in any way dealing with that man and getting girls from him.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.600
 We have fully investigated ourselves and that is not true.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 Case closed. People were furious, obviously, because they didn't believe it.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:44.600
 They then moved to the trial of Mark, Mark Dutrou, got it done fairly quickly.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:51.600
 He got sentenced to life because they eliminated the death penalty. His wife got, I believe, 17 years.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:58.600
 She's out now and she has her own place that is owned by a judge.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.600
 She's living in a judge's house, a house that a judge owns.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:14.600
 This woman who was part of a ring that was suspected of dealing pedophilia and kidnapped girls to powerful people lives in a house owned by a judge.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.600
 He goes, "Oh, everyone deserves a second chance."

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.600
 And to wrap it all up, you have the death threats against the people.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:31.600
 That's the weird thing about this, is that you had the actual crimes, which is bizarre enough, but this whole conspiracy angle is what really threw it off.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.600
 Now, Mark says that he was dealing young girls and women to powerful people.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.600
 Powerful people are saying that's not true.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:45.600
 Every piece of evidence that you found is just a sign of our ineptness, our corruption, and our sloppy work.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.600
 And yes, we should have caught him earlier.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.600
 But we are never part of this.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.600
 It was him and two or three people and that was it.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.600
 That was the only people involved in this. They've all been arrested. They've all been punished.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:07.600
 During the course of the investigation into the allegations of the powerful people, 20 witnesses died.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:15.600
 What's terrifying about that is I'm sure you had a lot of innocent people swept up in that.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:25.600
 People, delivery drivers who just happened to turn their head at the wrong time, saw Mark talking to a police officer in a friendly manner, in uniform.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.600
 Maybe there was a young girl in the back of the squad car.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:43.600
 The delivery driver just looks a little too long and goes from being someone dropping off a Domino's Pizza to being a witness of a conspiracy and then eventually a body in the woods.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:53.600
 20 deaths over a single court trial and they were involved in the court trial is a pattern of, obviously, that's a lot.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:29:09.600
 I'm sure some of them were corrupt police officers or, you know, like local officials who were starting to really sweat over having to be investigated for their connections to Mark Dutrault and were being killed.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.600
 But again, I'm sure a lot of them were people just like you and me.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:27.600
 People who just looked a little too long at an otherwise normal situation and saw a monster of a man staring back at you.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.600
 You didn't end up in his dungeon, but he still got you.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:30:00.600
