WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.600
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 A mishmash of Thanksgiving-based conspiracies, maybe?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.240
 And is Donald Trump a time traveler?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.160
 The evidence may surprise you today on Dead Rabbit...

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 Today on the Thanksgiving episode of Dead Rabbit Rating.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.740
 (upbeat music)

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.760
 - Hey, everyone. Welcome back to Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.880
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.720
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.360
 It is the Thanksgiving special of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.640
 I'm actually recording this five in the morning

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.000
 the day before Thanksgiving.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.840
 I can't sleep.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.440
 My ear woke me up.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.360
 Plus, I got an email from a listener named Shakira Shakira,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.480
 cracking a joke.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.800
 And the email woke me up.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.280
 I had the alert on my phone.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.440
 But Shakira Shakira, who has given us great stories

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.400
 in the past, has also given me some great resources

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.360
 for an upcoming story.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.880
 So despite the fact that your email woke me up,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.360
 thank you for the information.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.760
 But that's neither in or there.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.360
 So it is our Thanksgiving episode now.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.480
 I was bemoaning the fact that there weren't

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.480
 any Thanksgiving stories or like,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.360
 Thanksgiving is the middle child of the winter holidays.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.700
 We have Halloween, we have Christmas.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.600
 And Thanksgiving kind of gets the short shift.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.960
 There's no "Shrift."

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.360
 There's no Thanksgiving songs.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.400
 There's really no Thanksgiving movies.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.880
 I guess like, "Plain Strings and Automobiles" might be.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.320
 That might take place during Christmas though,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.200
 I'm not for sure.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.040
 But I was like,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.080
 there has to be some Thanksgiving conspiracies out there.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.780
 Now, I did find a story about a Thanksgiving ghost

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.160
 about a young woman.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.680
 This, it was so bizarre.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.040
 This woman, it's like, she killed herself over love.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.600
 And then her ghost is haunting this hotel.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.360
 And then I read a little bit more in the article

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.440
 and they're like, she was married,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.560
 but she was having an affair.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.800
 And I was like, okay, well, whatever.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.240
 So that story, and anyways,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.720
 the ghost just floated down the hallway.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.000
 Like those aren't really compelling ghost stories.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.560
 And then I was like, well, maybe there was some good murders.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.760
 And we're true crime podcast.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.200
 Maybe there's some good murders on Thanksgiving.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.560
 Come on, give me a horrible tragedy for my episode.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.800
 And I looked and there was a couple of family slaughtered,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.480
 but surprise, surprise,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.580
 most family slaughter stories take place during Christmas.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.560
 And there was one interesting story on Thanksgiving

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.640
 where there was this guy,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.880
 his house kept getting burglarized.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.640
 And he was like, I'm tired of my house getting broken into.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.320
 So he, this doesn't deserve a whole segment,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.840
 but it's definitely worth talking about

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.900
 for a moment or two.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.720
 So there was this guy, and it's super vague,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.800
 but it's in the show notes.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.720
 So there was this guy, it was Thanksgiving.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.240
 This is like in the nineties, I think.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.160
 I should have been more prepared for this segment,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.720
 but he's sitting in his basement

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.720
 and he got tired of his house getting broken into

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.560
 all the time.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.280
 And these two teenage people who had been breaking

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.880
 into his house came in

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.080
 and one of them started walking into the basement

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.960
 and he shot him with his rifle

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.440
 and the body tumbles down the stairs

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.360
 and he finished him off.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.480
 And then at that point,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.480
 the burglar's cohort slash cousin,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.920
 a young woman came to the top of the stairs

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.560
 and the homeowner shot her too.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.800
 And she tumbled down the stairs

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.520
 and then he put the gun underneath her chin,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.560
 blew her brains out.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.200
 Now this is notable for two reasons.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.000
 One, the entire thing was recorded

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.040
 because his house was getting burglarized,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.440
 though, you know, for a long time.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.840
 He had cameras everywhere.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.960
 He had audio recording, video recording.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.200
 So the police were able to watch

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.840
 from the moment that people were outside the house

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.440
 to the point where he was shooting them.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.480
 And because it was recording the whole time,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.400
 they had video footage and audio footage

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.520
 of him kind of muttering to himself.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.600
 He waited in the basement all day long.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.520
 It was like six hours, he was just in the basement.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.240
 He knew they were gonna try to break in.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.640
 And so he argued that he had the right to shoot them

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.520
 because they were in his house.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.120
 The castle doctrine is a thing

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.520
 in a lot of states in America.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.800
 You can defend your home.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.880
 The police argued that he was lying in wait.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.720
 He was down there for too long

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.840
 with his rifles ready to go, which is different.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.160
 And the fact that he was, well,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.320
 and the fact that he was kind of muttering in the darkness,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.760
 like practicing what he was gonna say afterwards,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.520
 and the fact that he finished them off.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.600
 Like he shot them and then he like,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.640
 as they were laying on the ground,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.000
 he shot them more times.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.240
 That's Thanksgiving related

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.440
 because he did it on Thanksgiving

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.160
 and he didn't call the police till the next day.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.040
 He goes, "I didn't wanna ruin your Thanksgiving.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.400
 I wanted you guys to have a good meal."

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.720
 He was eventually found guilty of two counts.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.720
 I think it was first degree

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.320
 'cause he was lying in wait,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.800
 which is a special circumstance.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.400
 He got life in prison for that.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.680
 But yeah, even that was,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.000
 that I kind of stumbled across that.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.240
 I was expecting more family massacres.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.520
 There were a few, I'm not disappointed

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.240
 that didn't happen, but there were a few,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.360
 nothing notable though.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.040
 Okay, so I found a couple of tidbits of Thanksgiving trivia

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.920
 that you can share with your family.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.800
 Okay, so here's some Thanksgiving based,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.320
 interesting facts and not like how much a turkey weighs

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.080
 when it dies or stupid stuff like that.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.640
 So we know the traditional story of Thanksgiving

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.360
 was the pilgrims were like,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.680
 "Oh, I don't have nothing to eat."

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.920
 And then the Native America showed up

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.840
 and was like, "Here's some food."

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.360
 And they ate and they had a good time.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.480
 And then there was like other stuff,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.440
 you know, like people started slaughtering each other

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.800
 afterwards, the original family massacre.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.120
 But you had a long period of time

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.160
 where that was just kind of a nice story to tell.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.040
 The idea of actually like Thanksgiving being a holiday

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.560
 didn't really pop up until like the mid 1800s.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.320
 There was an author named Sarah Joseph Beul Hale.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.800
 I'll just call her Mrs. Hale.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.000
 Anyway, so, or we'll just call her Sarah

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.840
 'cause I like that name.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.880
 So Sarah wanted to really like,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.040
 she thought Thanksgiving needed to be this time

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.760
 where people get together and celebrate family.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.840
 And she was an author and she would write scenes

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.400
 in her books where everyone's like,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.200
 "Isn't Thanksgiving great?"

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.040
 And the holiday didn't even exist,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.640
 but she was putting it into her books

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.360
 and it was like people eating all this food,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.120
 having a great time and readers were like,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.360
 "Oh, that would be really awesome if this was real."

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.120
 She was the equivalent of,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.160
 it'd be the equivalent of watching stars

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.240
 and being like, "Man, I wish I had a lightsaber."

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.840
 But she did that with Thanksgiving.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.560
 So she was really pushing for Thanksgiving

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.520
 to be this holiday.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.520
 Now, during the Civil War,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.040
 Lincoln was thinking,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.280
 "You know what, this actually might be a good way

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.800
 "to bring the people together."

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.800
 Like both sides, if we had this time

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.120
 where people were like, "Let's appreciate what we have."

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.680
 And everybody knew that Sarah was doing this big.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.080
 So Lincoln didn't just like,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.280
 come up with this out of the blue,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.520
 but people were talking that this could be a good moment

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.640
 for people to just take things for what they have.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.720
 You know, it was national tragedy,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.680
 everyone's dying, all sorts of stuff.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.000
 And so Sarah wrote Lincoln a letter saying,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.280
 "I think Thanksgiving would be a great idea.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.200
 "Like we could use this to help bridge the gap

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.680
 "between the North and the South."

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.440
 She was just, that's all she cared about

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.920
 was getting Thanksgiving made.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.480
 Well, anyway, so Lincoln,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.080
 before he even got that letter,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.040
 thought, "You know what, we need to have this national day

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.120
 "that brings the country together."

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.760
 And this was Abraham Lincoln's version of Thanksgiving.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.400
 This is what he had in mind

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.600
 for a day of giving thanks.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.360
 He wanted it to be a day, this is in his words,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.360
 "a day of public humiliation, prayer, and fasting."

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.880
 So you would basically, you wouldn't eat,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.840
 it's the opposite of Thanksgiving.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.680
 You wouldn't eat,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.400
 and you would publicly humiliate yourself.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.960
 And it would start with the people

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.360
 acknowledging the supreme government of God

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.080
 and bowing in humble submission to his chastisements.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.160
 They were then to publicly confess

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.520
 and deplore their sins and transgressions

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.160
 and beg for forgiveness.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.160
 I don't see that holiday ever really taking any,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.120
 that wouldn't work.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.480
 I don't wanna know your public sins, man,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.560
 because people are weird.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.880
 I don't wanna know, I mean,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.800
 if obviously if a friend came to me and said,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.600
 "Hey listen, I'm going through some trouble,"

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.800
 that's fine.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.240
 But I don't want to like,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.400
 I don't wanna be walking on the street

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.440
 and seeing people publicly humiliate themselves.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.280
 And actually, that's interesting.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.080
 Why do you want people to publicly humiliate themselves

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.080
 and publicly confess their sins

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.920
 because really it's kind of the same thing?

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.720
 'Cause people are going to confess stuff

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.080
 that is quite humiliating.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.040
 That's why they kept it secret in the first place.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.400
 Could you, Jesus, can you imagine the town,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.360
 like we have town,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.640
 everyone comes out into the town for Halloween

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.360
 and everyone comes out into town for Christmas.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.680
 I don't wanna walk down the street

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.960
 while people are being like,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.320
 "Oh, I'm so bad, I ate all that food.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.640
 "Oh, I'm so bad at cheating on my wife, please God."

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.560
 That would be horrifying.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.160
 But that was Abraham Lincoln's vision

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.400
 for the original Thanksgiving.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.320
 So while you're eating that turkey,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.400
 we're doing whatever you do on Thanksgiving.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.680
 It's probably eating turkey.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.640
 Imagine, imagine, it could be far worse.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.400
 Abraham Lincoln got his way.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.880
 Oh, and, fun note, I found this out too.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.460
 Abraham Lincoln was the first president to pardon a turkey.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.760
 This is conspiracy.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.600
 Abraham Lincoln was the first president to pardon a turkey.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.440
 So,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.040
 so, and then nobody else pardoned,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.960
 no other president pardoned the turkey

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.880
 until John F. Kennedy.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.640
 No joke, no joke, John F. Kennedy,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.540
 first president since Lincoln to pardon a turkey.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.680
 Three days later, he was shot in the...

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.760
 (laughs)

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.640
 Oh, okay, but one more Thanksgiving related tidbit.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.680
 I found this absolutely hilarious.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.600
 So Thanksgiving always kinda gets brushed under the rug.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.480
 If this was a part of Thanksgiving today,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.080
 it would be the most popular holiday on the planet.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.040
 So, so,

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.400
 okay, so on Thanksgiving day,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.940
 they had this thing basically called ragamuffin day.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.360
 So what do you would do?

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.420
 This was in New York.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.340
 This is in New York.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.120
 But you would get people in New York

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.240
 would get frying pans.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.240
 Let me stop laughing here.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.880
 They'd, 'cause it's very serious.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.420
 This is a very, very serious topic.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.400
 People in New York on Thanksgiving day,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.160
 they would take their frying pans

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.360
 and they would throw pennies in the frying pan

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.080
 and heat 'em up, make 'em really, really hot, right?

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.240
 People were poor back then.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.920
 So if you saw a penny on the ground, you pick it up.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.760
 Especially...

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.480
 (coyote howls)

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.060
 Especially children,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.800
 because pennies are worth more back then.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.040
 A child sees a penny on the ground and you pick it up.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.840
 You have good luck, isn't that what they say?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.080
 It's money.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.320
 Kids love money.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.920
 So they would take the frying pan

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.720
 and heat up the pennies.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.360
 Then they would call them red pennies.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.360
 They'd throw 'em onto the street.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.880
 They would throw 'em out their window

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.600
 and they'd rain down on the street.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.440
 (laughs)

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.080
 And kids would pick 'em up.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.600
 Like you would literally watch.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.640
 Kids would dress up for Rag 'Em Up in Dave.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.240
 It was part of Thanksgiving day.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.080
 The kids would walk down the street

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.920
 in their costumes.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.640
 You would see 'em coming and you'd be like,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.640
 "Hurry up, Martha.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.480
 Hurry up."

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.480
 "I'm trying, Eddie.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.400
 I'm trying to get 'em hotter."

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.560
 And then as the kids were coming closer,

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.760
 you throw the pennies out the window.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.120
 Now, I don't know why the kids didn't catch on

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.200
 after the third or fourth year

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.040
 that when pennies are falling down from window,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.840
 they're probably red hot.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.880
 But anyways,

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.160
 the kids would reach down and pick 'em up.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.960
 Horribly burned their hands.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.360
 Why don't we do stuff like that anymore?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.920
 Wouldn't that be, I mean, yeah, I get it.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.120
 It would get sued and little kids would burn hands,

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.760
 but you'd get those calluses.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.480
 It would be good for working in the mines

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.720
 or in the smelting pits back then.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.880
 So red hot penny day, Rag 'Em Up in Dave.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.760
 Rag 'Em Up in Dave.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.680
 We should bring that back.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.720
 I just found that.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.560
 So, okay.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.320
 Kids got horribly hurt.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.480
 It's still kind of funny.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.600
 Actually, they get horribly hurt.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.960
 You blister your finger.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.320
 I mean, unless I guess you picked it up,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.200
 put it in your pocket and you were in gasoline in your pants.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.160
 But that's it.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.520
 That's really all I could find

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.640
 that was conspiracy related for Thanksgiving.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.840
 But it's a couple little facts

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.960
 you can tell your relatives.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.440
 Clip your nephew a penny.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.920
 Just be like, "Uncle, why are you wearing those oven mitts

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.760
 and have that bag of pennies?"

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.840
 You're like, "You'll see.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.720
 You'll see."

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.840
 Now, I do want to say this.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.240
 One of the main things that people have problem with

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.920
 when they get together for Thanksgiving is

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.880
 people talk politics.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.920
 So people come, your family's coming

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.960
 from all over the country.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.600
 They're all in different geographical areas.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.680
 You travel there.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.440
 They're gonna have different political view than you.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.840
 You guys live in different areas.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.120
 You guys have different education.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.760
 You guys consume different levels of media.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.840
 So on and so forth.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.400
 And of course, it's been what?

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.800
 Two years since the Trump election.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.920
 So there's gonna be a lot of that still.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.040
 People are still talking Trump.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.840
 Now, depending on where you're at,

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.280
 one of your relatives is gonna show up

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.760
 and be like, "Trump, oh my God.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.600
 He's a fascist.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.920
 He's the next Hitler, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.560
 And you're just gonna try to roll your eyes.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.200
 Or they're gonna show up and be like,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.920
 "Magga, yes, build the wall.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.740
 Lock her up."

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.560
 And you're just gonna be like,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.400
 "You're gonna roll your eyes."

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.440
 Depending where you're out in the political scale.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.520
 But I have an antidote for wherever you're at there.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.840
 That whenever your relative is talking about Trump,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.520
 pro or against, you can look him in the eye and say,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.680
 "Did you know Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.960
 Make sure to tell him you listened to it on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.240
 You know, get the word out.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.200
 But you'll be able to look at that person and go,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.840
 "Did you know that there is actually possible proof

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.520
 that Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.760
 And then just sit back.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.040
 And they're gonna look at you.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.160
 And they're gonna say, "Teach me what you know.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.160
 Teach me.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.200
 Teach me these things."

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.480
 Okay, so let's get into this.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.320
 This was really bizarre.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.160
 Now it's funny.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.360
 So I got an email from a listener a couple of days ago

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.080
 and they asked me if I had ever looked into this before.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.680
 And it was from Andrew.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.240
 Andrew emailed me.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.440
 And I said, "This was originally the first episode

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.600
 of the podcast.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.800
 Before I knew what type of format I was going to do,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.600
 I did a test run of the show.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.840
 And it was, is Donald Trump a time traveler?"

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.440
 And it was funny because then I had completely forgotten

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.920
 about it because technically I had covered it.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.080
 Like in my mind, it was a story that I'd already done.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.040
 I recorded a whole like 10 minute segment.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.680
 I think it's lost to time now,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.680
 but then I went on and did episode one.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.880
 So I kind of had covered it in my mind.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.320
 He brought it back to my attention.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.480
 So you're thinking, Jason, is Donald,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.720
 what possible proof do you have

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.400
 that Donald Trump is a time traveler?

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.200
 My first answer to that would be like,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.640
 what proof do I need?

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.040
 I mean, he's defied all odds, but there is proof.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.040
 Or a series of coincidences that seem very, very odd.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.720
 So let's go back.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.160
 Let's visit the city of New York.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.280
 It's November.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.880
 A highly unpopular outsider candidate

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.320
 wins the presidency of the United States.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.480
 And the city's on fire.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.560
 Not literally, but with people riding.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.480
 The entire East side is in a state of uproar.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.920
 Police officers are moving through the street,

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.920
 warning people to stay off the streets

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.640
 as these riots go on.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.400
 Mobs of vast sizes are organizing

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.080
 under the lead of anarchists and socialists.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.200
 And they threaten to plunder and to spoil

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.000
 the houses of the rich who have wronged

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.360
 and oppressed them for so many years.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.840
 The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.240
 to feel the fury of the mob.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.660
 Would the troops be in time to save it?

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.000
 Now that's not my opinion.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.600
 That's not from a news report.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.640
 That is from a book that was published in 1900

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.600
 called The Last President.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.480
 The book The Last President is the third

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.400
 in a series of books about a little boy

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.020
 named Baron Trump.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.280
 There was an author back in the 1800s

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.120
 named Ingersoll Lockwood.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.620
 He wrote a lot of children's books,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.280
 but these three books have come to attention recently.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.620
 The first book was The Travels and Adventures

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.420
 of Little Baron Trump and his wonderful dog, Bulger.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.660
 Oh, no puppy.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.660
 1893, he wrote the sequel,

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.840
 Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.060
 So these were basically like Jules Verne type stories,

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.420
 Alice in Wonderland type stories.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.760
 And then the third book was 1900

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.660
 or The Last President was the name of that book.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.540
 So Baron Trump is this little boy.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.460
 So the, we're gonna go, don't worry,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.140
 this gets even weirder.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.380
 The character of Baron Trump in the book,

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.020
 his name is like William Trump.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.580
 Baron is his title.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.100
 And I guess I should say in case you don't know,

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.060
 Donald Trump's son is named Baron Trump.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.380
 Donald Trump, that is the name of,

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.020
 in real life, Donald Trump's son.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.400
 And in the book, the character is named Baron Trump.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.940
 I guess I should have said that.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.940
 Not everybody knows the name of Donald Trump's family,

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.060
 but yeah, so that's, in the 1800s,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.820
 there was a book series called

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.240
 about a kid named Baron Trump.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.900
 Today, Donald Trump has a real kid named Baron Trump.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.340
 And you're like, maybe he read the book.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.980
 Maybe he just named this kid after the book.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.340
 And that's fair.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.900
 It's far more reasonable than what we're going to get into,

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.220
 but this character, Baron Trump,

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.920
 lives with the Trump family.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.460
 They live on Fifth Avenue in New York City in Trump Castle.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.740
 Donald Trump in real life,

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.660
 originally lived in Fifth Avenue in Trump Tower.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.660
 Baron Trump has a buddy, a mystical guy named Don Fum.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.500
 Now Don is like a signatory.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.300
 It's like a sir.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.740
 He's a Spaniard, so it's not like his name's Donald.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.820
 There's this mystic guy named Don Fum,

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.060
 who helps open these portals for Baron Trump

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.220
 and his dog, Bolger, to go on these adventures.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.700
 No joke.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.740
 He opens these portals and leads them to Russia.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.820
 Okay.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.740
 Again, just coincidence, coincidence, coincidence.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.460
 Okay, so in real life,

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.660
 Baron Trump does not have a dog named Bolger.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.460
 They actually didn't even have a dog

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.300
 until Trump got elected president.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.540
 They did get a dog to when they moved to the White House.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.100
 And Baron Trump loves this dog.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.740
 The dog's name is Patton, like General Patton.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.140
 Now this is a bit of a stretch,

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.020
 but again, it's just odd.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.340
 General Patton was a general during World War II

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.740
 and he was instrumental in one of the greatest

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.220
 allied victories of World War II,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.140
 Battle of the Bulge, Bulge, Bolger.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.420
 Now to be fair, before you guys shut off the podcast,

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.020
 I didn't make that connection.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.060
 I didn't make that connection.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.140
 I read it on a website.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.100
 So don't blame me for that ridiculousness.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.140
 And you're gonna say, Jason, is that all you're gonna do

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.020
 is you're going to read us coincidences

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.340
 between a children's book series and Donald Trump.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.260
 And I'm not, because that is honestly

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.060
 not even the weird stuff.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.420
 Now we're gonna get weird.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.660
 This theory first came to my attention

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.340
 before I even heard about the kids' books.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.580
 This theory that Donald Trump is a time traveler

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.580
 has predated his election.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.920
 It was back in like the summer of 2016,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.620
 maybe even a little bit earlier,

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.540
 was when this theory started popping up.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.300
 And there's some, again, some weird stuff behind it.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.140
 Nikolai Nikola, I just called him Nikolai.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.020
 Nikolai Tesla is a famous inventor

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.260
 for inventing weird stuff.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.700
 He was a contemporary of, believe it was Edison.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.700
 Tesla was always working like he was working on free energy.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.420
 He was working on wireless energy

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.380
 so nothing would have to be plugged in.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.260
 He was working on remote control.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.340
 He invented a remote control boat

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.420
 and I mean, we're talking like way back in the day.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.780
 He died like in '43 and he had a long career.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.100
 So we're talking like 1910s, 1920s, '30s.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.180
 He was working on all this stuff.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.380
 During World War II, he was talking about

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.380
 inventing a death array,

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.380
 a thing that could just blow stuff up.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.700
 So he was always working on all this crazy stuff

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.700
 and there's been a ton.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.340
 He's like the Tesla coil, you know,

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.940
 the electrical coil thing.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.420
 Very, very fringe and connected to things

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.020
 like the Philadelphia experiment

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.100
 that made the boat disappear.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.580
 Just a lot of fringe science.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.260
 The guy definitely was ahead of his time

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.620
 and he wasn't a crackpot.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.180
 Not all of his theories panned out

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.040
 but he definitely knew his stuff.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.540
 But he ends up dying

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.580
 and the government really wanted his research.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.940
 So they had this group back then

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.300
 called the Office of Alien Property.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.820
 So if you died in America,

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.100
 but you weren't an American citizen,

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.080
 these guys would go take your stuff.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.140
 They went in, they took all of his notes,

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.180
 all of his notes.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.460
 To this day, we don't even have access

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.060
 to a lot of the stuff that they took.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.340
 There's a lot of his research that we know is missing

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.780
 'cause it was mentioned in other places

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.940
 but we have no record of it.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.460
 Office of Alien Property then takes all of,

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.540
 they don't understand it.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.660
 They're like, this is just high level math,

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.220
 high level science, we don't get this.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.420
 Let's go to MIT.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.780
 They can read this nerd stuff.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.660
 So they give it to a guy at MIT named John Trump.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.940
 Donald Trump's uncle.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.860
 Donald Trump's uncle, John.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.260
 Donald Trump's uncle, John now has access

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.420
 to some of the most fringe scientific theories of the time

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.640
 and honestly, probably even in our time.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.460
 We have nothing even close approaching wireless energy.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.020
 He said, John Trump said,

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.620
 ah, there's nothing in these documents.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.100
 Like there's some, he didn't say that.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.260
 John Trump basically said,

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.860
 there's a lot of great things in these documents

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.700
 but you know, it's a lot of it's fringe stuff.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.260
 I'm paraphrasing but the question is this,

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.940
 this guy who was just outside the box,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.660
 100 years ahead of his time or more as a scientist dies.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.740
 All of the stuff that he came up with

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.820
 but he didn't have the means to do,

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.500
 gets given to this other guy.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.860
 He goes through, it takes out a couple pages,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.540
 turns it over to the government, says yeah,

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.700
 I mean, here's what it means but it's a bunch of stuff.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.140
 And like I said, we know documents are missing

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.100
 from Tesla's work.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.620
 John Trump's favorite, I guess it goes without saying.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.860
 I don't know why I'm pausing like this.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.820
 John Trump loved his nephew Donald.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.780
 So here's the theory.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.420
 This is where the theory started.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.440
 That John Trump discovered the secret of time travel

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.340
 through Tesla's work.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.540
 And then gave those documents to his nephew Donald.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.780
 Donald then uses those documents to build a time machine

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.060
 and go into the future and into the past.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.100
 So the books were inspired by his adventures

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.220
 or possibly even, it gets weird when we talk about time travel

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.500
 or even possibly that in the future,

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.340
 his son will go back in time and the books are inspired

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.140
 by the life of the actual Baron Trump.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.100
 Could be very likely.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.980
 Or maybe Baron Trump goes back in time

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.260
 and writes them himself.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.540
 Oh my God, time travel.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.460
 But anyway, so let's get back to Donald Trump.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.540
 So this is the theory that came out during the election.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.140
 Donald Trump has access to this time machine.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.360
 And again, this theory popped up before the books

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.900
 were even on anyone's radars.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.900
 The theory is, now this is where the theory splits

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.460
 'cause there's a couple different ideas of what happens.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.300
 I'll tell you what, if I buy into this theory

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.980
 that Donald Trump is a time traveler,

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.380
 this is what I think happened.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.180
 Donald Trump goes into the future, everything's awesome.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.700
 He uses his knowledge of the future to come back in time

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.020
 and make a bunch of money.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:14.400
 But there's one thing that happens in our timeline

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.540
 that didn't happen when he first visited the future.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.620
 And that was 9/11.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.620
 Donald Trump lost a lot of friends in the attacks on 9/11.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.940
 And that's when the Playboy mindset

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.140
 had to kind of flip for him

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.300
 because he saw what the world could be.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.700
 And this event happened that he didn't foresee

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.380
 and he lost a lot of people because of it.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.140
 So it started to kind of change his mindset.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.160
 Now you're thinking, okay, we have that aspect of it.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.380
 Now you're thinking, okay, Donald Trump, fine,

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.140
 built the time machine, goes to the future, 9/11,

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.700
 da-da-da-da-da-da, does all that stuff.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.540
 Now what?

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.060
 Well, like I said, it gets weirder.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.540
 Pence, Vice President Pence is also a time traveler.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.860
 Did you know that?

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.540
 Make sure to tell your relatives that too.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.200
 Not only is he also a time traveler,

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.600
 he's not from our timeline, he's from the future.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.100
 He's from a future where everybody--

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.500
 (laughs)

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.740
 I'm not making, okay, when I say I'm not making this up,

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.740
 I hope you know that there's people who believe this.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.940
 I'm not sold on this idea,

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.140
 but the photographic evidence is a little weird.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.060
 Mike Pence comes from a future

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.820
 where everybody looks like Mike Pence.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.580
 That's what people are gonna look like in the future.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.620
 Now I will say this.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.700
 Mike Pence, he's a big dude.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.060
 Like, I saw a picture of him, he is like a yoked up,

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.660
 or he's just a broad-shouldered guy,

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.540
 but anyway, so I don't know what that has to do with anything.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.900
 So Mike Pence, in the future, everyone looks like Mike Pence.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.300
 That's what humans are gonna look like,

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.260
 and he's like from far in the future.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:43.260
 He traveled back with Donald Trump to say, okay,

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.820
 to avoid a terrible future, I have to become president,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.100
 but they aren't gonna vote for me

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.300
 because I'm a big old weirdo-looking tank dude.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.060
 So Donald Trump, you run for president,

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.460
 use your knowledge of the future

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.660
 so you'll know what other people are gonna do,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.380
 and then I'll be your vice president,

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.840
 and then when you leave, I'll take over,

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.420
 and we'll have this utopian world

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.340
 where everyone looks like Mike Pence.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.820
 And so, again, this is a legit theory if you believe.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.540
 Donald Trump goes, okay, great.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.540
 So Mike Pence, his time machine's better

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.740
 than Donald Trump's time machine

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.020
 'cause it was actually built in the future.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.060
 So Mike Pence can actually send,

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.660
 like he can go back, say, five minutes

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.660
 to talk to himself five minutes before

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.140
 and send that Mike Pence back

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.740
 while Mike Pence still exists in the future.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.400
 It's this weird causality loop.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.160
 So there's multiple Mike Penses.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.260
 Everyone looks like Mike Pence in the future,

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.780
 but also there's multiple Mike Penses in our timeline,

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.380
 and it's the same Mike Pence, and...

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.300
 (birds chirping)

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.500
 For whatever reason, Tim Cain's wife is a Mike Pence.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.220
 Tim Cain's wife, Tim Cain was

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.980
 Hillary Clinton's vice presidential candidate.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.260
 Tim Cain's wife is a Mike Pence.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.980
 Now, they do look an awful lot alike.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.020
 They really do.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.620
 It's super bizarre.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.140
 Now, again, I was reading this conspiracy theory

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.340
 before the election, and people were like,

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.380
 there's no way Trump is going to lose.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.460
 There's absolutely no way he's going to lose

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.100
 because he's from the future.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.500
 Okay, the Mike Pence, the planet of Mike Penses, whatever.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.420
 The Baron Trump book, that's weird coincidences

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.540
 and things like that.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.740
 But I got two more pieces of info for you.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:31.140
 One, the day that Donald Trump won the Illinois primary

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.820
 during the election, lightning struck Trump Tower.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.500
 Was that a moment where he was going to correct

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.220
 the time screen where he didn't win Illinois?

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.060
 Probably not.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.060
 He actually kind of had the nomination sewed up

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.180
 by the time he won Illinois.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.080
 But it is an interesting coincidence.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.140
 However, Donald Trump famously said about his daughter,

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.980
 Ivanka, she wasn't my daughter.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.500
 I'd be dating her.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.060
 Well, one theory is that in an alternate timeline,

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.620
 Ivanka was born to another man and another woman.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:10.540
 And they were dating, but because Donald Trump

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.700
 has been going back and forth so much in time,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.420
 he ended up marrying the mother of Ivanka.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.900
 Now it's his daughter.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.300
 So now he can't date her.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.940
 And you know what's so funny?

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.460
 I'm gonna close the episode out like this.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.060
 'Cause I have really no other way to wrap this up.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.260
 I've complained about other conspiracies in the past,

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.500
 like World War II was fake.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.340
 I'm like, this is total nonsense, nuclear bombs or whatever.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.260
 Nuclear bombs don't exist, yeah, whatever.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.380
 So there are certain conspiracies that I view

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.220
 as when I cover them, I'm almost discouraged

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.300
 from researching more conspiracy theories

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.780
 because I look at how misinformed some people can be

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.020
 to really think World War II never happened.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.060
 This conspiracy fills me with a childlike joy.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.780
 I just find it so amusing.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.820
 And I think it's amusing because one,

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.020
 it's a conspiracy theory that's fairly lighthearted.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.900
 Like again, love and reheat them.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.260
 It's an entertaining theory.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.140
 It doesn't have to involve holocaust not happening.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.620
 It doesn't have to involve, you know,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.260
 9/11 was an inside job.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.500
 It's not like this horrible,

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.180
 it doesn't have this huge death toll.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.020
 A lot of the conspiracies are fairly like dark.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.500
 This one's kind of lovey-dovey and cute in a way.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.620
 It's a conspiracy theory that we're basically living

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.780
 through right now because again,

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.380
 if he's a time traveler, it's going on.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.580
 I have to admit, I read this conspiracy theory,

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.180
 like I said back in 2016.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.380
 I can't look at Mike Pence without thinking

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.220
 there's a planet of them somewhere in our near future.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.180
 I think it's just a fairly fun one.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.060
 And again, the next time someone starts talking

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.340
 about politics and you'd rather not just be bothered.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.940
 You'd rather just do something else.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.020
 Just turn around, look him in the eyes and say,

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.860
 "Did you know Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.700
 And then say nothing.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.860
 And to make it even funnier, when they go,

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.140
 "What did you say?"

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.860
 Just turn back around.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.580
 Just don't acknowledge them.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.420
 So we did it.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.740
 Thanksgiving episode.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.700
 There we go.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.900
 Hope I gave you some good topics to talk about

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.260
 over your Thanksgiving meal.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.900
 Everyone have fun.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.300
 Enjoy everything that you're doing,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.980
 whether you're with your friends and your family,

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.780
 whether you're just hanging out by yourself,

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.100
 which is what I'm doing,

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.980
 whether you're doing stuff online, whatever.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.100
 Just have fun for the day, be safe.

 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.860
 Have a great one guys and have a happy Thanksgiving.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.440
 (upbeat music)

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.100
 Meet Zack.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.180
 His work life balance is anything but balanced.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:53.180
 But when he gets on the bike, he becomes Zenzack.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.860
 Zenzack exists outside of time.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.020
 His heartbeat sounds like a mellow drum circle.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.380
 - It's cool, right?

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.580
 - The only notification he hears is the sound of the ocean.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.740
 So if you want to reach him, talk to the ocean.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.180
