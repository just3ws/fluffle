1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,320
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,240
 A mishmash of Thanksgiving-based conspiracies, maybe?

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:42,240
 And is Donald Trump a time traveler?

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,160
 The evidence may surprise you today on Dead Rabbit...

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,160
 Today on the Thanksgiving episode of Dead Rabbit Rating.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,740
 (upbeat music)

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,760
 - Hey, everyone. Welcome back to Dead Rabbit Radio.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,880
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
 I'm having a great day.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,360
 It is the Thanksgiving special of Dead Rabbit Radio.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,640
 I'm actually recording this five in the morning

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,000
 the day before Thanksgiving.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,840
 I can't sleep.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,440
 My ear woke me up.

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,360
 Plus, I got an email from a listener named Shakira Shakira,

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,480
 cracking a joke.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,800
 And the email woke me up.

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,280
 I had the alert on my phone.

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,440
 But Shakira Shakira, who has given us great stories

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,400
 in the past, has also given me some great resources

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,360
 for an upcoming story.

35
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,880
 So despite the fact that your email woke me up,

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,360
 thank you for the information.

37
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,760
 But that's neither in or there.

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,360
 So it is our Thanksgiving episode now.

39
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,480
 I was bemoaning the fact that there weren't

40
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,480
 any Thanksgiving stories or like,

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,360
 Thanksgiving is the middle child of the winter holidays.

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,700
 We have Halloween, we have Christmas.

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,600
 And Thanksgiving kind of gets the short shift.

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,960
 There's no "Shrift."

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
 There's no Thanksgiving songs.

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,400
 There's really no Thanksgiving movies.

47
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,880
 I guess like, "Plain Strings and Automobiles" might be.

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,320
 That might take place during Christmas though,

49
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,200
 I'm not for sure.

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
 But I was like,

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,080
 there has to be some Thanksgiving conspiracies out there.

52
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,780
 Now, I did find a story about a Thanksgiving ghost

53
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,160
 about a young woman.

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,680
 This, it was so bizarre.

55
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,040
 This woman, it's like, she killed herself over love.

56
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,600
 And then her ghost is haunting this hotel.

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,360
 And then I read a little bit more in the article

58
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,440
 and they're like, she was married,

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,560
 but she was having an affair.

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
 And I was like, okay, well, whatever.

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,240
 So that story, and anyways,

62
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,720
 the ghost just floated down the hallway.

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,000
 Like those aren't really compelling ghost stories.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,560
 And then I was like, well, maybe there was some good murders.

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,760
 And we're true crime podcast.

66
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,200
 Maybe there's some good murders on Thanksgiving.

67
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,560
 Come on, give me a horrible tragedy for my episode.

68
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,800
 And I looked and there was a couple of family slaughtered,

69
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,480
 but surprise, surprise,

70
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,580
 most family slaughter stories take place during Christmas.

71
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,560
 And there was one interesting story on Thanksgiving

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
 where there was this guy,

73
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,880
 his house kept getting burglarized.

74
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,640
 And he was like, I'm tired of my house getting broken into.

75
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,320
 So he, this doesn't deserve a whole segment,

76
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,840
 but it's definitely worth talking about

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,900
 for a moment or two.

78
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,720
 So there was this guy, and it's super vague,

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,800
 but it's in the show notes.

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
 So there was this guy, it was Thanksgiving.

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,240
 This is like in the nineties, I think.

82
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,160
 I should have been more prepared for this segment,

83
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,720
 but he's sitting in his basement

84
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,720
 and he got tired of his house getting broken into

85
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
 all the time.

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,280
 And these two teenage people who had been breaking

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,880
 into his house came in

88
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,080
 and one of them started walking into the basement

89
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,960
 and he shot him with his rifle

90
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,440
 and the body tumbles down the stairs

91
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,360
 and he finished him off.

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,480
 And then at that point,

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,480
 the burglar's cohort slash cousin,

94
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,920
 a young woman came to the top of the stairs

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,560
 and the homeowner shot her too.

96
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
 And she tumbled down the stairs

97
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,520
 and then he put the gun underneath her chin,

98
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,560
 blew her brains out.

99
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,200
 Now this is notable for two reasons.

100
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,000
 One, the entire thing was recorded

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,040
 because his house was getting burglarized,

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
 though, you know, for a long time.

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,840
 He had cameras everywhere.

104
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,960
 He had audio recording, video recording.

105
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,200
 So the police were able to watch

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
 from the moment that people were outside the house

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,440
 to the point where he was shooting them.

108
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,480
 And because it was recording the whole time,

109
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,400
 they had video footage and audio footage

110
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,520
 of him kind of muttering to himself.

111
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,600
 He waited in the basement all day long.

112
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,520
 It was like six hours, he was just in the basement.

113
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,240
 He knew they were gonna try to break in.

114
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,640
 And so he argued that he had the right to shoot them

115
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,520
 because they were in his house.

116
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,120
 The castle doctrine is a thing

117
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,520
 in a lot of states in America.

118
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,800
 You can defend your home.

119
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,880
 The police argued that he was lying in wait.

120
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
 He was down there for too long

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,840
 with his rifles ready to go, which is different.

122
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,160
 And the fact that he was, well,

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,320
 and the fact that he was kind of muttering in the darkness,

124
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,760
 like practicing what he was gonna say afterwards,

125
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,520
 and the fact that he finished them off.

126
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,600
 Like he shot them and then he like,

127
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,640
 as they were laying on the ground,

128
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,000
 he shot them more times.

129
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,240
 That's Thanksgiving related

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,440
 because he did it on Thanksgiving

131
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,160
 and he didn't call the police till the next day.

132
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,040
 He goes, "I didn't wanna ruin your Thanksgiving.

133
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,400
 I wanted you guys to have a good meal."

134
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,720
 He was eventually found guilty of two counts.

135
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
 I think it was first degree

136
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,320
 'cause he was lying in wait,

137
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,800
 which is a special circumstance.

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
 He got life in prison for that.

139
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,680
 But yeah, even that was,

140
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,000
 that I kind of stumbled across that.

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,240
 I was expecting more family massacres.

142
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,520
 There were a few, I'm not disappointed

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,240
 that didn't happen, but there were a few,

144
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,360
 nothing notable though.

145
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,040
 Okay, so I found a couple of tidbits of Thanksgiving trivia

146
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,920
 that you can share with your family.

147
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,800
 Okay, so here's some Thanksgiving based,

148
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,320
 interesting facts and not like how much a turkey weighs

149
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
 when it dies or stupid stuff like that.

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,640
 So we know the traditional story of Thanksgiving

151
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,360
 was the pilgrims were like,

152
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,680
 "Oh, I don't have nothing to eat."

153
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,920
 And then the Native America showed up

154
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
 and was like, "Here's some food."

155
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
 And they ate and they had a good time.

156
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,480
 And then there was like other stuff,

157
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,440
 you know, like people started slaughtering each other

158
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,800
 afterwards, the original family massacre.

159
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,120
 But you had a long period of time

160
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
 where that was just kind of a nice story to tell.

161
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,040
 The idea of actually like Thanksgiving being a holiday

162
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,560
 didn't really pop up until like the mid 1800s.

163
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,320
 There was an author named Sarah Joseph Beul Hale.

164
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,800
 I'll just call her Mrs. Hale.

165
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,000
 Anyway, so, or we'll just call her Sarah

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,840
 'cause I like that name.

167
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,880
 So Sarah wanted to really like,

168
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,040
 she thought Thanksgiving needed to be this time

169
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,760
 where people get together and celebrate family.

170
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,840
 And she was an author and she would write scenes

171
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,400
 in her books where everyone's like,

172
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
 "Isn't Thanksgiving great?"

173
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,040
 And the holiday didn't even exist,

174
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,640
 but she was putting it into her books

175
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,360
 and it was like people eating all this food,

176
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,120
 having a great time and readers were like,

177
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,360
 "Oh, that would be really awesome if this was real."

178
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,120
 She was the equivalent of,

179
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,160
 it'd be the equivalent of watching stars

180
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
 and being like, "Man, I wish I had a lightsaber."

181
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
 But she did that with Thanksgiving.

182
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,560
 So she was really pushing for Thanksgiving

183
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,520
 to be this holiday.

184
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
 Now, during the Civil War,

185
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,040
 Lincoln was thinking,

186
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,280
 "You know what, this actually might be a good way

187
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,800
 "to bring the people together."

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
 Like both sides, if we had this time

189
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,120
 where people were like, "Let's appreciate what we have."

190
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,680
 And everybody knew that Sarah was doing this big.

191
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,080
 So Lincoln didn't just like,

192
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
 come up with this out of the blue,

193
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,520
 but people were talking that this could be a good moment

194
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,640
 for people to just take things for what they have.

195
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,720
 You know, it was national tragedy,

196
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,680
 everyone's dying, all sorts of stuff.

197
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
 And so Sarah wrote Lincoln a letter saying,

198
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,280
 "I think Thanksgiving would be a great idea.

199
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,200
 "Like we could use this to help bridge the gap

200
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,680
 "between the North and the South."

201
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,440
 She was just, that's all she cared about

202
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,920
 was getting Thanksgiving made.

203
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,480
 Well, anyway, so Lincoln,

204
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
 before he even got that letter,

205
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,040
 thought, "You know what, we need to have this national day

206
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,120
 "that brings the country together."

207
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,760
 And this was Abraham Lincoln's version of Thanksgiving.

208
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,400
 This is what he had in mind

209
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,600
 for a day of giving thanks.

210
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,360
 He wanted it to be a day, this is in his words,

211
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,360
 "a day of public humiliation, prayer, and fasting."

212
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,880
 So you would basically, you wouldn't eat,

213
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,840
 it's the opposite of Thanksgiving.

214
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,680
 You wouldn't eat,

215
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,400
 and you would publicly humiliate yourself.

216
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,960
 And it would start with the people

217
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,360
 acknowledging the supreme government of God

218
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,080
 and bowing in humble submission to his chastisements.

219
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,160
 They were then to publicly confess

220
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,520
 and deplore their sins and transgressions

221
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,160
 and beg for forgiveness.

222
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,160
 I don't see that holiday ever really taking any,

223
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,120
 that wouldn't work.

224
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,480
 I don't wanna know your public sins, man,

225
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,560
 because people are weird.

226
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,880
 I don't wanna know, I mean,

227
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,800
 if obviously if a friend came to me and said,

228
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,600
 "Hey listen, I'm going through some trouble,"

229
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,800
 that's fine.

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,240
 But I don't want to like,

231
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,400
 I don't wanna be walking on the street

232
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,440
 and seeing people publicly humiliate themselves.

233
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,280
 And actually, that's interesting.

234
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,080
 Why do you want people to publicly humiliate themselves

235
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,080
 and publicly confess their sins

236
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,920
 because really it's kind of the same thing?

237
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,720
 'Cause people are going to confess stuff

238
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,080
 that is quite humiliating.

239
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,040
 That's why they kept it secret in the first place.

240
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,400
 Could you, Jesus, can you imagine the town,

241
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,360
 like we have town,

242
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,640
 everyone comes out into the town for Halloween

243
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,360
 and everyone comes out into town for Christmas.

244
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,680
 I don't wanna walk down the street

245
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,960
 while people are being like,

246
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,320
 "Oh, I'm so bad, I ate all that food.

247
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,640
 "Oh, I'm so bad at cheating on my wife, please God."

248
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,560
 That would be horrifying.

249
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,160
 But that was Abraham Lincoln's vision

250
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,400
 for the original Thanksgiving.

251
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,320
 So while you're eating that turkey,

252
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,400
 we're doing whatever you do on Thanksgiving.

253
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,680
 It's probably eating turkey.

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,640
 Imagine, imagine, it could be far worse.

255
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,400
 Abraham Lincoln got his way.

256
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,880
 Oh, and, fun note, I found this out too.

257
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,460
 Abraham Lincoln was the first president to pardon a turkey.

258
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,760
 This is conspiracy.

259
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,600
 Abraham Lincoln was the first president to pardon a turkey.

260
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
 So,

261
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,040
 so, and then nobody else pardoned,

262
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,960
 no other president pardoned the turkey

263
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,880
 until John F. Kennedy.

264
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,640
 No joke, no joke, John F. Kennedy,

265
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,540
 first president since Lincoln to pardon a turkey.

266
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,680
 Three days later, he was shot in the...

267
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,760
 (laughs)

268
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,640
 Oh, okay, but one more Thanksgiving related tidbit.

269
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,680
 I found this absolutely hilarious.

270
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,600
 So Thanksgiving always kinda gets brushed under the rug.

271
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,480
 If this was a part of Thanksgiving today,

272
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,080
 it would be the most popular holiday on the planet.

273
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,040
 So, so,

274
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,400
 okay, so on Thanksgiving day,

275
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,940
 they had this thing basically called ragamuffin day.

276
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,360
 So what do you would do?

277
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,420
 This was in New York.

278
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,340
 This is in New York.

279
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,120
 But you would get people in New York

280
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
 would get frying pans.

281
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
 Let me stop laughing here.

282
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,880
 They'd, 'cause it's very serious.

283
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,420
 This is a very, very serious topic.

284
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,400
 People in New York on Thanksgiving day,

285
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,160
 they would take their frying pans

286
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,360
 and they would throw pennies in the frying pan

287
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,080
 and heat 'em up, make 'em really, really hot, right?

288
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,240
 People were poor back then.

289
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,920
 So if you saw a penny on the ground, you pick it up.

290
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,760
 Especially...

291
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,480
 (coyote howls)

292
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,060
 Especially children,

293
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,800
 because pennies are worth more back then.

294
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,040
 A child sees a penny on the ground and you pick it up.

295
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,840
 You have good luck, isn't that what they say?

296
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,080
 It's money.

297
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,320
 Kids love money.

298
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,920
 So they would take the frying pan

299
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,720
 and heat up the pennies.

300
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,360
 Then they would call them red pennies.

301
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
 They'd throw 'em onto the street.

302
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,880
 They would throw 'em out their window

303
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,600
 and they'd rain down on the street.

304
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,440
 (laughs)

305
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,080
 And kids would pick 'em up.

306
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,600
 Like you would literally watch.

307
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,640
 Kids would dress up for Rag 'Em Up in Dave.

308
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,240
 It was part of Thanksgiving day.

309
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,080
 The kids would walk down the street

310
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,920
 in their costumes.

311
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,640
 You would see 'em coming and you'd be like,

312
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
 "Hurry up, Martha.

313
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,480
 Hurry up."

314
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
 "I'm trying, Eddie.

315
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,400
 I'm trying to get 'em hotter."

316
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,560
 And then as the kids were coming closer,

317
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,760
 you throw the pennies out the window.

318
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,120
 Now, I don't know why the kids didn't catch on

319
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,200
 after the third or fourth year

320
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,040
 that when pennies are falling down from window,

321
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,840
 they're probably red hot.

322
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,880
 But anyways,

323
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,160
 the kids would reach down and pick 'em up.

324
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
 Horribly burned their hands.

325
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,360
 Why don't we do stuff like that anymore?

326
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,920
 Wouldn't that be, I mean, yeah, I get it.

327
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,120
 It would get sued and little kids would burn hands,

328
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,760
 but you'd get those calluses.

329
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,480
 It would be good for working in the mines

330
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,720
 or in the smelting pits back then.

331
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,880
 So red hot penny day, Rag 'Em Up in Dave.

332
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,760
 Rag 'Em Up in Dave.

333
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,680
 We should bring that back.

334
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,720
 I just found that.

335
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
 So, okay.

336
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
 Kids got horribly hurt.

337
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
 It's still kind of funny.

338
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
 Actually, they get horribly hurt.

339
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,960
 You blister your finger.

340
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,320
 I mean, unless I guess you picked it up,

341
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,200
 put it in your pocket and you were in gasoline in your pants.

342
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,160
 But that's it.

343
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,520
 That's really all I could find

344
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,640
 that was conspiracy related for Thanksgiving.

345
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,840
 But it's a couple little facts

346
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,960
 you can tell your relatives.

347
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,440
 Clip your nephew a penny.

348
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,920
 Just be like, "Uncle, why are you wearing those oven mitts

349
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,760
 and have that bag of pennies?"

350
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,840
 You're like, "You'll see.

351
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,720
 You'll see."

352
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,840
 Now, I do want to say this.

353
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,240
 One of the main things that people have problem with

354
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,920
 when they get together for Thanksgiving is

355
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,880
 people talk politics.

356
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,920
 So people come, your family's coming

357
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,960
 from all over the country.

358
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,600
 They're all in different geographical areas.

359
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,680
 You travel there.

360
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,440
 They're gonna have different political view than you.

361
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,840
 You guys live in different areas.

362
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,120
 You guys have different education.

363
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,760
 You guys consume different levels of media.

364
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,840
 So on and so forth.

365
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,400
 And of course, it's been what?

366
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,800
 Two years since the Trump election.

367
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,920
 So there's gonna be a lot of that still.

368
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,040
 People are still talking Trump.

369
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,840
 Now, depending on where you're at,

370
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,280
 one of your relatives is gonna show up

371
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,760
 and be like, "Trump, oh my God.

372
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,600
 He's a fascist.

373
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
 He's the next Hitler, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

374
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,560
 And you're just gonna try to roll your eyes.

375
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,200
 Or they're gonna show up and be like,

376
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,920
 "Magga, yes, build the wall.

377
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,740
 Lock her up."

378
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,560
 And you're just gonna be like,

379
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,400
 "You're gonna roll your eyes."

380
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,440
 Depending where you're out in the political scale.

381
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,520
 But I have an antidote for wherever you're at there.

382
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,840
 That whenever your relative is talking about Trump,

383
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,520
 pro or against, you can look him in the eye and say,

384
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,680
 "Did you know Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

385
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,960
 Make sure to tell him you listened to it on Dead Rabbit Radio.

386
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,240
 You know, get the word out.

387
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,200
 But you'll be able to look at that person and go,

388
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,840
 "Did you know that there is actually possible proof

389
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,520
 that Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

390
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,760
 And then just sit back.

391
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,040
 And they're gonna look at you.

392
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,160
 And they're gonna say, "Teach me what you know.

393
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
 Teach me.

394
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,200
 Teach me these things."

395
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,480
 Okay, so let's get into this.

396
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,320
 This was really bizarre.

397
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,160
 Now it's funny.

398
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,360
 So I got an email from a listener a couple of days ago

399
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,080
 and they asked me if I had ever looked into this before.

400
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,680
 And it was from Andrew.

401
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,240
 Andrew emailed me.

402
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,440
 And I said, "This was originally the first episode

403
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,600
 of the podcast.

404
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
 Before I knew what type of format I was going to do,

405
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,600
 I did a test run of the show.

406
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,840
 And it was, is Donald Trump a time traveler?"

407
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,440
 And it was funny because then I had completely forgotten

408
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,920
 about it because technically I had covered it.

409
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,080
 Like in my mind, it was a story that I'd already done.

410
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,040
 I recorded a whole like 10 minute segment.

411
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,680
 I think it's lost to time now,

412
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,680
 but then I went on and did episode one.

413
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,880
 So I kind of had covered it in my mind.

414
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,320
 He brought it back to my attention.

415
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,480
 So you're thinking, Jason, is Donald,

416
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
 what possible proof do you have

417
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,400
 that Donald Trump is a time traveler?

418
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,200
 My first answer to that would be like,

419
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,640
 what proof do I need?

420
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,040
 I mean, he's defied all odds, but there is proof.

421
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,040
 Or a series of coincidences that seem very, very odd.

422
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,720
 So let's go back.

423
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,160
 Let's visit the city of New York.

424
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,280
 It's November.

425
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,880
 A highly unpopular outsider candidate

426
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,320
 wins the presidency of the United States.

427
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
 And the city's on fire.

428
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,560
 Not literally, but with people riding.

429
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,480
 The entire East side is in a state of uproar.

430
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,920
 Police officers are moving through the street,

431
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
 warning people to stay off the streets

432
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,640
 as these riots go on.

433
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,400
 Mobs of vast sizes are organizing

434
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,080
 under the lead of anarchists and socialists.

435
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,200
 And they threaten to plunder and to spoil

436
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
 the houses of the rich who have wronged

437
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,360
 and oppressed them for so many years.

438
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,840
 The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first

439
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,240
 to feel the fury of the mob.

440
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,660
 Would the troops be in time to save it?

441
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,000
 Now that's not my opinion.

442
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,600
 That's not from a news report.

443
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,640
 That is from a book that was published in 1900

444
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,600
 called The Last President.

445
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,480
 The book The Last President is the third

446
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,400
 in a series of books about a little boy

447
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,020
 named Baron Trump.

448
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,280
 There was an author back in the 1800s

449
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,120
 named Ingersoll Lockwood.

450
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,620
 He wrote a lot of children's books,

451
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,280
 but these three books have come to attention recently.

452
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,620
 The first book was The Travels and Adventures

453
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,420
 of Little Baron Trump and his wonderful dog, Bulger.

454
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,660
 Oh, no puppy.

455
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
 1893, he wrote the sequel,

456
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,840
 Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey.

457
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,060
 So these were basically like Jules Verne type stories,

458
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,420
 Alice in Wonderland type stories.

459
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,760
 And then the third book was 1900

460
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,660
 or The Last President was the name of that book.

461
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,540
 So Baron Trump is this little boy.

462
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,460
 So the, we're gonna go, don't worry,

463
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,140
 this gets even weirder.

464
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,380
 The character of Baron Trump in the book,

465
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,020
 his name is like William Trump.

466
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,580
 Baron is his title.

467
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,100
 And I guess I should say in case you don't know,

468
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,060
 Donald Trump's son is named Baron Trump.

469
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,380
 Donald Trump, that is the name of,

470
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,020
 in real life, Donald Trump's son.

471
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,400
 And in the book, the character is named Baron Trump.

472
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,940
 I guess I should have said that.

473
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
 Not everybody knows the name of Donald Trump's family,

474
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,060
 but yeah, so that's, in the 1800s,

475
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,820
 there was a book series called

476
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,240
 about a kid named Baron Trump.

477
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,900
 Today, Donald Trump has a real kid named Baron Trump.

478
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,340
 And you're like, maybe he read the book.

479
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,980
 Maybe he just named this kid after the book.

480
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,340
 And that's fair.

481
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,900
 It's far more reasonable than what we're going to get into,

482
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,220
 but this character, Baron Trump,

483
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,920
 lives with the Trump family.

484
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,460
 They live on Fifth Avenue in New York City in Trump Castle.

485
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,740
 Donald Trump in real life,

486
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,660
 originally lived in Fifth Avenue in Trump Tower.

487
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,660
 Baron Trump has a buddy, a mystical guy named Don Fum.

488
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,500
 Now Don is like a signatory.

489
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,300
 It's like a sir.

490
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,740
 He's a Spaniard, so it's not like his name's Donald.

491
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,820
 There's this mystic guy named Don Fum,

492
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,060
 who helps open these portals for Baron Trump

493
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,220
 and his dog, Bolger, to go on these adventures.

494
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,700
 No joke.

495
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,740
 He opens these portals and leads them to Russia.

496
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,820
 Okay.

497
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,740
 Again, just coincidence, coincidence, coincidence.

498
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,460
 Okay, so in real life,

499
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,660
 Baron Trump does not have a dog named Bolger.

500
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,460
 They actually didn't even have a dog

501
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,300
 until Trump got elected president.

502
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,540
 They did get a dog to when they moved to the White House.

503
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,100
 And Baron Trump loves this dog.

504
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,740
 The dog's name is Patton, like General Patton.

505
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,140
 Now this is a bit of a stretch,

506
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,020
 but again, it's just odd.

507
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,340
 General Patton was a general during World War II

508
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,740
 and he was instrumental in one of the greatest

509
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,220
 allied victories of World War II,

510
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,140
 Battle of the Bulge, Bulge, Bolger.

511
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,420
 Now to be fair, before you guys shut off the podcast,

512
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,020
 I didn't make that connection.

513
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,060
 I didn't make that connection.

514
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,140
 I read it on a website.

515
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,100
 So don't blame me for that ridiculousness.

516
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,140
 And you're gonna say, Jason, is that all you're gonna do

517
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,020
 is you're going to read us coincidences

518
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,340
 between a children's book series and Donald Trump.

519
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,260
 And I'm not, because that is honestly

520
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,060
 not even the weird stuff.

521
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,420
 Now we're gonna get weird.

522
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,660
 This theory first came to my attention

523
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,340
 before I even heard about the kids' books.

524
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,580
 This theory that Donald Trump is a time traveler

525
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,580
 has predated his election.

526
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,920
 It was back in like the summer of 2016,

527
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,620
 maybe even a little bit earlier,

528
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,540
 was when this theory started popping up.

529
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,300
 And there's some, again, some weird stuff behind it.

530
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,140
 Nikolai Nikola, I just called him Nikolai.

531
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,020
 Nikolai Tesla is a famous inventor

532
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,260
 for inventing weird stuff.

533
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,700
 He was a contemporary of, believe it was Edison.

534
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,700
 Tesla was always working like he was working on free energy.

535
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,420
 He was working on wireless energy

536
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,380
 so nothing would have to be plugged in.

537
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,260
 He was working on remote control.

538
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,340
 He invented a remote control boat

539
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,420
 and I mean, we're talking like way back in the day.

540
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,780
 He died like in '43 and he had a long career.

541
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,100
 So we're talking like 1910s, 1920s, '30s.

542
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,180
 He was working on all this stuff.

543
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,380
 During World War II, he was talking about

544
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
 inventing a death array,

545
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
 a thing that could just blow stuff up.

546
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,700
 So he was always working on all this crazy stuff

547
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
 and there's been a ton.

548
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,340
 He's like the Tesla coil, you know,

549
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,940
 the electrical coil thing.

550
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,420
 Very, very fringe and connected to things

551
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,020
 like the Philadelphia experiment

552
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,100
 that made the boat disappear.

553
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,580
 Just a lot of fringe science.

554
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,260
 The guy definitely was ahead of his time

555
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,620
 and he wasn't a crackpot.

556
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,180
 Not all of his theories panned out

557
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,040
 but he definitely knew his stuff.

558
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,540
 But he ends up dying

559
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,580
 and the government really wanted his research.

560
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,940
 So they had this group back then

561
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,300
 called the Office of Alien Property.

562
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,820
 So if you died in America,

563
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,100
 but you weren't an American citizen,

564
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,080
 these guys would go take your stuff.

565
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,140
 They went in, they took all of his notes,

566
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,180
 all of his notes.

567
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,460
 To this day, we don't even have access

568
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,060
 to a lot of the stuff that they took.

569
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,340
 There's a lot of his research that we know is missing

570
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,780
 'cause it was mentioned in other places

571
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,940
 but we have no record of it.

572
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,460
 Office of Alien Property then takes all of,

573
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,540
 they don't understand it.

574
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,660
 They're like, this is just high level math,

575
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,220
 high level science, we don't get this.

576
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,420
 Let's go to MIT.

577
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,780
 They can read this nerd stuff.

578
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,660
 So they give it to a guy at MIT named John Trump.

579
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,940
 Donald Trump's uncle.

580
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,860
 Donald Trump's uncle, John.

581
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,260
 Donald Trump's uncle, John now has access

582
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,420
 to some of the most fringe scientific theories of the time

583
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,640
 and honestly, probably even in our time.

584
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,460
 We have nothing even close approaching wireless energy.

585
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,020
 He said, John Trump said,

586
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,620
 ah, there's nothing in these documents.

587
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,100
 Like there's some, he didn't say that.

588
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,260
 John Trump basically said,

589
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,860
 there's a lot of great things in these documents

590
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,700
 but you know, it's a lot of it's fringe stuff.

591
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,260
 I'm paraphrasing but the question is this,

592
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,940
 this guy who was just outside the box,

593
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,660
 100 years ahead of his time or more as a scientist dies.

594
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,740
 All of the stuff that he came up with

595
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,820
 but he didn't have the means to do,

596
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,500
 gets given to this other guy.

597
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,860
 He goes through, it takes out a couple pages,

598
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,540
 turns it over to the government, says yeah,

599
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,700
 I mean, here's what it means but it's a bunch of stuff.

600
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,140
 And like I said, we know documents are missing

601
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,100
 from Tesla's work.

602
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,620
 John Trump's favorite, I guess it goes without saying.

603
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,860
 I don't know why I'm pausing like this.

604
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,820
 John Trump loved his nephew Donald.

605
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,780
 So here's the theory.

606
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,420
 This is where the theory started.

607
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,440
 That John Trump discovered the secret of time travel

608
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,340
 through Tesla's work.

609
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,540
 And then gave those documents to his nephew Donald.

610
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,780
 Donald then uses those documents to build a time machine

611
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,060
 and go into the future and into the past.

612
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,100
 So the books were inspired by his adventures

613
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,220
 or possibly even, it gets weird when we talk about time travel

614
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,500
 or even possibly that in the future,

615
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,340
 his son will go back in time and the books are inspired

616
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,140
 by the life of the actual Baron Trump.

617
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,100
 Could be very likely.

618
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,980
 Or maybe Baron Trump goes back in time

619
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,260
 and writes them himself.

620
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,540
 Oh my God, time travel.

621
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,460
 But anyway, so let's get back to Donald Trump.

622
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,540
 So this is the theory that came out during the election.

623
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,140
 Donald Trump has access to this time machine.

624
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,360
 And again, this theory popped up before the books

625
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,900
 were even on anyone's radars.

626
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,900
 The theory is, now this is where the theory splits

627
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,460
 'cause there's a couple different ideas of what happens.

628
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,300
 I'll tell you what, if I buy into this theory

629
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,980
 that Donald Trump is a time traveler,

630
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,380
 this is what I think happened.

631
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,180
 Donald Trump goes into the future, everything's awesome.

632
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,700
 He uses his knowledge of the future to come back in time

633
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,020
 and make a bunch of money.

634
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,400
 But there's one thing that happens in our timeline

635
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,540
 that didn't happen when he first visited the future.

636
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,620
 And that was 9/11.

637
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,620
 Donald Trump lost a lot of friends in the attacks on 9/11.

638
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,940
 And that's when the Playboy mindset

639
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,140
 had to kind of flip for him

640
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,300
 because he saw what the world could be.

641
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,700
 And this event happened that he didn't foresee

642
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,380
 and he lost a lot of people because of it.

643
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,140
 So it started to kind of change his mindset.

644
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,160
 Now you're thinking, okay, we have that aspect of it.

645
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,380
 Now you're thinking, okay, Donald Trump, fine,

646
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,140
 built the time machine, goes to the future, 9/11,

647
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,700
 da-da-da-da-da-da, does all that stuff.

648
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,540
 Now what?

649
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,060
 Well, like I said, it gets weirder.

650
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,540
 Pence, Vice President Pence is also a time traveler.

651
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,860
 Did you know that?

652
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,540
 Make sure to tell your relatives that too.

653
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,200
 Not only is he also a time traveler,

654
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,600
 he's not from our timeline, he's from the future.

655
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,100
 He's from a future where everybody--

656
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,500
 (laughs)

657
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,740
 I'm not making, okay, when I say I'm not making this up,

658
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,740
 I hope you know that there's people who believe this.

659
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,940
 I'm not sold on this idea,

660
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,140
 but the photographic evidence is a little weird.

661
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,060
 Mike Pence comes from a future

662
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,820
 where everybody looks like Mike Pence.

663
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,580
 That's what people are gonna look like in the future.

664
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,620
 Now I will say this.

665
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,700
 Mike Pence, he's a big dude.

666
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,060
 Like, I saw a picture of him, he is like a yoked up,

667
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,660
 or he's just a broad-shouldered guy,

668
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,540
 but anyway, so I don't know what that has to do with anything.

669
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,900
 So Mike Pence, in the future, everyone looks like Mike Pence.

670
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,300
 That's what humans are gonna look like,

671
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,260
 and he's like from far in the future.

672
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,260
 He traveled back with Donald Trump to say, okay,

673
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,820
 to avoid a terrible future, I have to become president,

674
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,100
 but they aren't gonna vote for me

675
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,300
 because I'm a big old weirdo-looking tank dude.

676
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,060
 So Donald Trump, you run for president,

677
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,460
 use your knowledge of the future

678
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,660
 so you'll know what other people are gonna do,

679
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,380
 and then I'll be your vice president,

680
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,840
 and then when you leave, I'll take over,

681
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,420
 and we'll have this utopian world

682
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,340
 where everyone looks like Mike Pence.

683
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,820
 And so, again, this is a legit theory if you believe.

684
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,540
 Donald Trump goes, okay, great.

685
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,540
 So Mike Pence, his time machine's better

686
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,740
 than Donald Trump's time machine

687
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,020
 'cause it was actually built in the future.

688
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,060
 So Mike Pence can actually send,

689
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,660
 like he can go back, say, five minutes

690
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
 to talk to himself five minutes before

691
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,140
 and send that Mike Pence back

692
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,740
 while Mike Pence still exists in the future.

693
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,400
 It's this weird causality loop.

694
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,160
 So there's multiple Mike Penses.

695
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,260
 Everyone looks like Mike Pence in the future,

696
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,780
 but also there's multiple Mike Penses in our timeline,

697
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,380
 and it's the same Mike Pence, and...

698
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,300
 (birds chirping)

699
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,500
 For whatever reason, Tim Cain's wife is a Mike Pence.

700
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,220
 Tim Cain's wife, Tim Cain was

701
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,980
 Hillary Clinton's vice presidential candidate.

702
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,260
 Tim Cain's wife is a Mike Pence.

703
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,980
 Now, they do look an awful lot alike.

704
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,020
 They really do.

705
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,620
 It's super bizarre.

706
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,140
 Now, again, I was reading this conspiracy theory

707
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,340
 before the election, and people were like,

708
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,380
 there's no way Trump is going to lose.

709
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,460
 There's absolutely no way he's going to lose

710
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,100
 because he's from the future.

711
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,500
 Okay, the Mike Pence, the planet of Mike Penses, whatever.

712
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,420
 The Baron Trump book, that's weird coincidences

713
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,540
 and things like that.

714
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,740
 But I got two more pieces of info for you.

715
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,140
 One, the day that Donald Trump won the Illinois primary

716
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,820
 during the election, lightning struck Trump Tower.

717
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,500
 Was that a moment where he was going to correct

718
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,220
 the time screen where he didn't win Illinois?

719
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,060
 Probably not.

720
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,060
 He actually kind of had the nomination sewed up

721
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,180
 by the time he won Illinois.

722
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,080
 But it is an interesting coincidence.

723
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,140
 However, Donald Trump famously said about his daughter,

724
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,980
 Ivanka, she wasn't my daughter.

725
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,500
 I'd be dating her.

726
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,060
 Well, one theory is that in an alternate timeline,

727
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,620
 Ivanka was born to another man and another woman.

728
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:10,540
 And they were dating, but because Donald Trump

729
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,700
 has been going back and forth so much in time,

730
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,420
 he ended up marrying the mother of Ivanka.

731
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,900
 Now it's his daughter.

732
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,300
 So now he can't date her.

733
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,940
 And you know what's so funny?

734
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,460
 I'm gonna close the episode out like this.

735
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,060
 'Cause I have really no other way to wrap this up.

736
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,260
 I've complained about other conspiracies in the past,

737
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,500
 like World War II was fake.

738
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,340
 I'm like, this is total nonsense, nuclear bombs or whatever.

739
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,260
 Nuclear bombs don't exist, yeah, whatever.

740
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,380
 So there are certain conspiracies that I view

741
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,220
 as when I cover them, I'm almost discouraged

742
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,300
 from researching more conspiracy theories

743
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,780
 because I look at how misinformed some people can be

744
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,020
 to really think World War II never happened.

745
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,060
 This conspiracy fills me with a childlike joy.

746
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,780
 I just find it so amusing.

747
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,820
 And I think it's amusing because one,

748
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,020
 it's a conspiracy theory that's fairly lighthearted.

749
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,900
 Like again, love and reheat them.

750
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,260
 It's an entertaining theory.

751
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,140
 It doesn't have to involve holocaust not happening.

752
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,620
 It doesn't have to involve, you know,

753
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,260
 9/11 was an inside job.

754
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,500
 It's not like this horrible,

755
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,180
 it doesn't have this huge death toll.

756
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,020
 A lot of the conspiracies are fairly like dark.

757
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,500
 This one's kind of lovey-dovey and cute in a way.

758
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,620
 It's a conspiracy theory that we're basically living

759
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,780
 through right now because again,

760
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,380
 if he's a time traveler, it's going on.

761
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,580
 I have to admit, I read this conspiracy theory,

762
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,180
 like I said back in 2016.

763
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,380
 I can't look at Mike Pence without thinking

764
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,220
 there's a planet of them somewhere in our near future.

765
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,180
 I think it's just a fairly fun one.

766
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,060
 And again, the next time someone starts talking

767
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,340
 about politics and you'd rather not just be bothered.

768
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,940
 You'd rather just do something else.

769
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,020
 Just turn around, look him in the eyes and say,

770
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,860
 "Did you know Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

771
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,700
 And then say nothing.

772
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,860
 And to make it even funnier, when they go,

773
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,140
 "What did you say?"

774
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,860
 Just turn back around.

775
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,580
 Just don't acknowledge them.

776
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,420
 So we did it.

777
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,740
 Thanksgiving episode.

778
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,700
 There we go.

779
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,900
 Hope I gave you some good topics to talk about

780
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,260
 over your Thanksgiving meal.

781
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,900
 Everyone have fun.

782
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,300
 Enjoy everything that you're doing,

783
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,980
 whether you're with your friends and your family,

784
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,780
 whether you're just hanging out by yourself,

785
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,100
 which is what I'm doing,

786
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,980
 whether you're doing stuff online, whatever.

787
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,100
 Just have fun for the day, be safe.

 (upbeat music)

797
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,100
 Meet Zack.

798
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,180
 His work life balance is anything but balanced.

799
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,180
 But when he gets on the bike, he becomes Zenzack.

800
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,860
 Zenzack exists outside of time.

801
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,020
 His heartbeat sounds like a mellow drum circle.

802
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,380
 - It's cool, right?

803
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,580
 - The only notification he hears is the sound of the ocean.

804
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,740
 So if you want to reach him, talk to the ocean.

805
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,180
 - Zenzack is so zen because he has 24/7
