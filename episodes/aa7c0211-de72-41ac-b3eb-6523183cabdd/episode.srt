1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
 You are face to face with an inorganic

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,480
 non-living robot.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,920
 Can you kill it?

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,600
 And then we travel to British Columbia to examine one of the most odd Sasquatch stories you've ever heard.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,600
 Is it possible that

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,600
 not only can they talk, but they also can cast magical spells today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:36,080
 *Music*

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,440
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Couldn't even get through that intro without laughing. At the absurdity of the Bigfoot story

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,160
 We're about to talk about but first we got another story and before that we have another patreon

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,360
 I want to thank you so much for your support. Herbert, Herbert, thank you so much for supporting this show.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,880
 It really really helps out a lot. If you can't support the patreon, that's fine. Just hope you get the word about the show.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,960
 That also really really helps a lot. We're gonna give Herbert the keys to the Jason Jalotti.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,480
 He's going to drive us up to British Columbia. So basically

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:18,600
 He donated to the patreon just so he can be our Lyft driver. We're sitting in the back. We roll up the little divider window

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,320
 He's like aww, he's all lonely. We're like having a huge party back there. We're headed...

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,460
 Wait, no we're headed to British Columbia. Knock on the window. No, no, no. Don't go there yet. Herbert, no, no, no

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,000
 We're not going to British Columbia. First we're going to a laboratory. So we're gonna all walk in a laboratory, put on our little lab coats

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,640
 We're actually the people being experimented on. So take yours off. No, I'm still in a lab coat. You're not.

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,280
 You just get to sit in this room and there's a little robot in front of you, right? This little tiny guy.

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,480
 He's not a cool robot. He's not a transformer or nothing like that. He's just a little dude sitting there.

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,480
 So, and this is a way it works. You're sitting in this room and I come over the loudspeaker and I click it

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,680
 Hey guys, it's me, Jason Garbender, host of the TVRevVar Radio. How you doing? And you're like fine?

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,760
 You're the one who led me and here we know who you are. Don't interrupt me.

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,600
 So what you're gonna do is see that little robot sitting on the table in front of you? Yeah, that guy.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,160
 You are going to play a game with it. You're gonna play like Go or some other nonsense game and

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
 if the robot does well

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,840
 then you can like say things. But if the robot sucks, then you can like berate the robot. Now you want the...

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,800
 Obviously you want to win the game. At this point you're like, Jason, just let a real scientist give the rules. No, don't interrupt me.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,600
 Don't interrupt me. So here's the thing. The robot is going to build a personality throughout this test by interacting with you.

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,080
 When you shut it off, the personality will be erased, but it's just a robot. So you know what you're gonna do?

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,080
 Okay, test starts now and then you hear like a timer. So you're sitting there and there's this little robot in front of you.

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,560
 He's just like a little lump. He's not... Okay, he's like a little little amiibo looking robot.

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
 He's not like super advanced and not transforming nothing like that. He's probably about, I don't know, three apples high.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,160
 And he's sitting there and you're like, "Uh, I'm playing Go."

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,200
 And which move should I make? The robot's like, "You should do this." And then you should do this.

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
 "Oh, good job. Wait, no, don't do that." And he's helping you out.

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,960
 And you're like, "Yeah, dude, this is pretty cool." And you win the game.

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,840
 And you're like, "Yes, robot, you really, really helped me." And then I come back on the intercom and I go,

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
 "Okay, go ahead and shut the robot off and prepare to leave the room."

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,440
 And you go to shut the robot off and before your hand can reach the switch, it goes, "Don't kill me."

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,080
 What? Robot goes, "Don't kill me. Don't kill me. I'm afraid of the dark. I don't know if I'll turn back on."

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,240
 "Please don't shut me off. Don't shut me off."

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,240
 So this was an actual steady that they did.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,040
 Some of them, they asked the robot's questions. The robot had to answer.

46
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,280
 Obviously, AI's not that advanced. There was a scientist in the other room controlling the robot and making it talk.

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,000
 Stuff like that. I think anyone with an IQ of over, say, 100 would walk in there and be like,

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,360
 "Once the robot starts talking to me, like, 'Oh my God, are you guys kidding me? This robot's this advanced?'"

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,520
 The average person was getting suckered into this thing.

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,480
 If I walked in a room and a robot was like, "Nice shoes." I'd be like, "Whoa."

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,880
 "Thank you for the compliment." But also, "Whoa, that's way too advanced for a robot to be able to do stuff like that."

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,000
 Maybe not nice shoes, but you know what I mean? Like,

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,440
 they're not super advanced. They can't pass the Turing test. So anyways, though, but you, the test was this.

54
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,400
 Some of them played the game. Some of them asked them questions. It was meaningless.

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,000
 The whole test was, "Could you shut off a robot as it begged for its life?"

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,440
 And so they did one study and they had 43 people who, some people just were just with a regular old robot,

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,760
 didn't say, they just shut it off. They didn't say anything. Out of the 43 people that the robot actually pleaded to be left on,

58
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,200
 30 people took twice as long to shut it off as the other group that was just like flicking.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,440
 How do you take twice as long to flick a switch? I guess maybe if you're like, "Hmm,

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:04,720
 should I flick that switch for like a minute?" The other people just did it. But 13 people outright refused to shut it off.

61
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:12,520
 They let, they go, "I'm not shutting it off." And it's interesting because they would tell the people that the person like, as you, when you shut it off,

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,960
 it's completely erased. So it's not like you would think that it would come back on and would just be at a safe state.

63
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,400
 It would not be the same if someone else came and turned it on. So that also factored into these people's decisions.

64
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,280
 And this, these war quotes that the robot was actually saying, again, it was an operator in the other room, but no, don't shut me off.

65
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,920
 I'm afraid of the dark. That would be my first clue.

66
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,520
 My first clue is that the robot is fully functional, able to carry on a conversation.

67
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,280
 But my second clue would be stuff like fear and dark that fear of the dark is something only humans have.

68
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,000
 Animals aren't afraid of the dark. And, and you know, I think I've gone over this before too, not to go on a side track,

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,520
 but you ever been out in the middle of like a dark field or just a backyard of your house and hear a noise?

70
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,120
 A lot of times your dog will go running off into the dark. Well, not a well trained dog,

71
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,640
 but a just an idiot dog will run off into the darkness. If it's well trained,

72
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,840
 it'll stay near you because you just waiting to see what you do. You'll stay on there and you look at the perimeter.

73
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,640
 You'll be in the light and you'll see your idiot dog walk off into the darkness run off into.

74
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,000
 The reason why they do that, I remember I was talking to someone and someone goes, well, it's because they can see at night.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,600
 I go, they're not the predator. Dogs don't have perfect night vision.

76
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,000
 The reason why a dog or animals will bolt off into the darkness,

77
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,000
 unlike humans, because they have no imagination.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 We imagine the man with a knife or the boogeyman or boogeyman with a knife just outside of your

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,520
 vision and that darkness, but a dog doesn't think like that. Animals don't think like that. They have no imagination.

80
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,920
 They will run into a pitch black cave. If they can't smell danger, they'll run right in. So anyways,

81
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,840
 where was it going? Oh, yeah, so robots. The idea of being afraid is too human. That would have been another clue.

82
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,920
 But also it says, I don't know if I'll wake up again. So very, very scary thing.

83
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,480
 So yes, even though you know it's an inorganic thing, it's not a human baby sitting on the table.

84
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,960
 If it pleads for his life, people are going to have a harder time shutting it off.

85
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
 What the reason why they're doing this study, they were trying to look at the implications of, you know,

86
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,760
 having robots and stuff in human society and everything like, here, here, listen, man, let's be honest.

87
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,960
 The only, there's two reasons why robots will ever exist side by side in society.

88
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,280
 Military or sex, that's it. The internet was invented so the government could communicate

89
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,560
 after a nuclear war and then it became the perfect pornography machine. Everything else

90
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,640
 that the internet does is a spin off of those two things. Every technology, military and sex,

91
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,120
 and almost always in that order. I've never, I don't know of any sexual devices that eventually

92
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,720
 got co-opted by the military, but it's always like that. So it, but oh, so robots. Yeah, yeah,

93
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,160
 so eventually you're going to have robot soldiers. We have them now, but I'm talking about like

94
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,440
 humanoids, robot soldiers walking down the street, hopefully not, not our streets, hopefully someone

95
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,120
 else's streets and they're USA soldiers. Yes, GI Joe bots. And then, you know, like you're banging

96
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,400
 a robot, like you have a robot made and you're banging it and then you're done and it just keeps

97
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,520
 cleaning up your apartment. That would be, that's the perfect, we don't have to fight wars and we

98
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,840
 get bangbots everywhere. They're actually work, I was going to say this for another story, but I

99
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,360
 think it's short enough to talk about now. These scientists are creating these things called the

100
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:32,400
 Xeno bots. They take cells, cells of hearts from horned African frogs, right? Because you're like,

101
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,720
 Jason, you're not up enough on science to talk about this. Heart cells automatically contract.

102
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,680
 So that's what they're built for, right? So they're scraping off the heart cells of a horned

103
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,960
 African frog and they get some other like useless skin cells and then they run this program, they

104
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,800
 make a block of cells in a computer and they go walk and the computer will go, if we want to walk,

105
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,600
 these are the way the cells should be molded and then they'll take that and they'll go take that

106
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,760
 new modified version and put that in the computer and say walk and then the computer runs a program

107
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,960
 and goes, oh, it could use a little bit of adjustment here, a little bit of adjustment there.

108
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,920
 They'll do that like a thousand times until they get the, basically it's evolution in a computer.

109
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,880
 They get a computer model of the best thing that involves, you know, a couple thousand skin cells

110
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,040
 and heart cells. If we wanted to make it walk, there's going to be an article in the show notes

111
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,000
 if this is too, you're like, Jason, I'll just read this stupid article. Anyways, they're building,

112
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,240
 they're basically building robots out of nothing but skin cells and heart cells. The heart cells are

113
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,560
 to make it move because they're constantly just contracting. They're bio bots and what they're

114
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,680
 saying is they build them, they've been successfully built. They're like a centimeter big, but they've

115
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,800
 built them and they can make them last only a week. They're given, when they're created,

116
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,080
 they only have enough energy to last a week and then they die and they dissolve. And they said

117
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,360
 they can, because they can say computer, take this clump of cells, make it able to carry stuff. So it

118
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,840
 started to evolve little legs and then the, the program keeps running and then it evolved a little

119
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,400
 dent and it's back. So it's really, really fascinating stuff. What's interesting though is

120
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,280
 it says in the article, eventually you want to like give it eyeballs and all this stuff and we

121
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,920
 want to build it to scale because what are you going to do with a bunch of centimeter tall mucus

122
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,480
 bots? Like, will they just throw them in an enemy's face? I'm mildly inconvenienced. No, if you can do

123
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,160
 the same thing and have it be the size of a horse that can walk around for maybe not the size of a

124
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,760
 horse, that's quite extreme. The size of a dog and it only lasts a week and like you can ride it in a

125
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,040
 battle very, very slowly, right? In a battle or just have it like carry stuff, everything like that.

126
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,360
 So they want to basically, they said a lot of people want to make robots out of inorganic stuff,

127
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,600
 but these things can actually heal. They have a set time limit. So you don't have to worry about it.

128
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,480
 You can kill them. They have no thought process and some people are concerned about that. But as

129
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,560
 I'm reading this article and then once they said they want to make them to scale, the first thing

130
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,240
 I thought of was eventually someone's going to bang one of these giant mucus bots. There's just

131
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,280
 going to be a lump of flesh. It's going to have heart cells for legs and the rest of it's just a

132
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:16,400
 bunch of undulating skin cells and some guys like, "Ooh baby, yeah, yeah, carry your load over here."

133
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,360
 It's a military dude in the middle of nowhere just banging this thing, right?

134
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,040
 It's not going to be in the middle of nowhere. It'll be in downtown Chicago. Some guy will order

135
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,520
 one online, build it himself and get arrested for banging this this lump of skin cells. So yes,

136
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:38,080
 there we go. The future of technology. I think I would want to go if I had to choose a race to

137
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,640
 live alongside of us. I would choose the organic Xenobots because I think they'd be easier to

138
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,800
 control. But if I wanted to have sex with one, I would pick like a robot robot because that seems

139
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:55,040
 infinitely less disgusting than banging what is really dead skin cells of a frog from Africa.

140
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,760
 Like I'd much rather bang this robot that looks like Britney Spears than even if,

141
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,480
 that's interesting. If the frog cells look like Britney Spears. Anyways, let's go ahead and move

142
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,560
 on to our next topic here. We're giving the key. We're leaving behind the laboratory. We're leaving

143
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,320
 behind the laboratory. You're like, "Hey Jason, where's Herbert? We left him in the research facility.

144
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
 We watch him. He's like tied down there like scraping skin cells off his arm. He's like, "No,

145
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,640
 no, not this fate. Not this fate." Door slight shift. We leave. We're by Herbert. Thanks for giving

146
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,120
 me your money. We're hopping in the Jason Jalapie. We're driving up to British Columbia.

147
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,480
 A lot of this story, and I want to give credit where credit's due, a lot of the story was,

148
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,560
 I got from a single article. It's called The Strange Tale of the Sasquatch Curse. It's written

149
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,320
 by an author known as Red Pill Junkie. This is a really bizarre story. This is a really,

150
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,080
 really bizarre story. Let's go ahead and get started. We're driving up to British Columbia.

151
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,960
 We're going to go to the Squaw Reservation. It's near Chillywack, British Columbia. So

152
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,640
 stop the Jason Jalapie. We all hop out. Herbert's with us. He's missing a couple skin cells on his

153
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,040
 arm, but he's able to join us for the rest of the episode. There's this old man. This is like the

154
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:19,280
 1950s, '60s. There's this old man sitting on a chair outside of a shop. He's just sitting there.

155
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,120
 He has a little puppy, a little old puppy sitting next to him, dogs on the verge of death. This man's

156
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,720
 on the verge of death. We just stopped to buy some snacks. We're getting some beef jerky for the trip.

157
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,120
 Let's go find this Bigfoot, and he goes, "Bigfoot? Why, do you want to know about Bigfoot? Sit down

158
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,640
 on this dusty, dirty street. Just sit down. Can't bring any chairs with you. Just sit down. I will

159
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,240
 tell you all about Bigfoot. I met the Bigfoot." I'm like, "Really? Okay, that'll save us a trip."

160
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,680
 We don't have to drive through the woods. You're like, "No, Jason, I enjoy the splendor of nature,

161
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,840
 but I enjoy sitting in front of strangers." So we all sit down, and he goes, "I'll tell you this

162
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,000
 story, and my voice will change, so I don't do an irritating voice for the next 20 minutes."

163
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,560
 My name is Charlie Victor, and this is my dog. I don't have a name written down for the dog. This

164
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,000
 is my dog. And Charlie Victor explains he's a member of the Douglas Indian tribe, which is the

165
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
 Indian tribe in this area. He goes, "I'm going to have to go back in time." Not literally,

166
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
 because that would be cool, but I'm going to go back in time with my words, and we're going to go

167
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:33,680
 back to the year 1914. Back in 1914, I was known as the fastest rifle hunter in British Columbia,

168
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,240
 not just the area, but all over, because British Columbia is a province, right? And in 1914,

169
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,520
 so now we are traveling back in time to be with Charlie on this journey, it's 1914. We're in the

170
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,480
 mountains near a place called Hatzik, which again is in British Columbia. It's all in there.

171
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,200
 Charlie's walking around in the woods. He has his gun, he has his trusty, nameless dog walking

172
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,480
 alongside of him, and he's just looking for stuff to blow away. He just wants to shoot stuff in the

173
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,120
 brain, but he's all disappointing. He's like, "Oh, I haven't taken any life today." But then his dog

174
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:15,040
 starts going crazy. Charlie's like, "What is it? Did you find something for me to murder?"

175
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,880
 dog's like "Row how how" and the dog is like looking at this tree and Charlie's like "What is it

176
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,840
 boy? what is it?" and then apparently now he's from the Dukes of Hazard his accent has completely

177
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,160
 changed them Duke boys he sees there's a cave but blocking it is all like this trees and this

178
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,840
 shrub, so apparently Charlie Victor is Paul Benning because he moves the tree, maybe he just moved

179
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,600
 the branches but still, he moves enough of the tree around for the rest of the story to take place.

180
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,680
 This hole was previously completely covered by foliage and now he's like "Rrrr!" throws it to one

181
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,080
 side. The dog runs into the cave and at that point he hears what's known as a suffocated whale.

182
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:05,120
 Not like "Wooooooow!" but like that was his words "whale" as in W-A-I-L like I don't even know what

183
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,400
 that sound would be like maybe it's a maybe something hunter maybe it's a hunter thing I

184
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,200
 wouldn't understand but that's what he hears in this cave and he's like "Yes my dog must have found

185
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,840
 a baby bear and he's gonna flush it out better get my rifle ready better get ready to pull this

186
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,440
 trigger no matter what I see come out of this cave because the only thing I can think of is a baby

187
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,400
 bear" and he gets his rifle ready fastest rifle in British Columbia and this lump this thing starts

188
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,240
 staggering out of the cave and he sees it and without thinking like any good hunter just pulls

189
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:47,360
 the trigger without seeing what he's shooting at gunshot echoes through the valley and what he sees

190
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:55,120
 is this kid this 12 year old boy "mwhack" fall to the ground bleeding from a gunshot wound

191
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:03,200
 bleeding very very badly so so Charlie is like "Oh this isn't good it's this white kid he estimated

192
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,600
 the age like 12 to 14 years old the kid's just screaming his head off which is what you generally

193
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,360
 do when you're shot by a total stranger in the middle of the woods he's naked by the way too not

194
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,600
 Charlie this kid so you have a 12 year old naked dude bleeding out in front of you in the forest

195
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,560
 and Charlie goes "I immediately felt bad and I was like I wish I had died I wish that I hadn't

196
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,000
 shot this kid but you know you don't own a time machine dude so you got to live with it now this

197
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,240
 kid's screaming now you're like Jason this is funny hold on hold on hold on that is how it

198
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,480
 starts off that's the series beginning so what happens according to Charlie the kid is screaming

199
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,000
 so the kid's screaming on the ground and then he hears off in the distance of the woods

200
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,360
 another scream he's like did I shoot a kid over there too to the bullet get ricocheted

201
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,520
 what is going on I got this naked kid screaming I got this weird noise behind me I need to figure

202
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,000
 out to do something quickly 30 minutes past though he does nothing at all he just stands there for

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,640
 30 minutes 30 minutes later he's still like hmm what should I do I got this kid shot that noise

204
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:29,360
 behind me and then that is when Sasquatch shows up and this giant this is this is interesting for

205
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,560
 a couple different reasons it's a woman which is rare we don't see a lot of Sasquatch we don't see

206
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:41,120
 any Sasquatch to be clear but in the lore we don't see many women Sasquatch it's a Sasquatch woman

207
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,560
 and she's only six feet tall you're like Jason that's not I know women that tall that's not big

208
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,840
 foot you don't let me finish it's just some tall WNBA player walking through the woods hiking hey

209
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:01,600
 guys she is covered in hair which isn't particularly a trait known in the WNBA this woman is covered

210
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,800
 head to toe in hair and oddly enough also has long hair going down past her waist as well which I

211
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,240
 don't know if that's possible can a gorilla have long hair can gorilla have like ferra faucet hair

212
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,680
 is that possible isn't the fur kind of all grow to the same size all over the body or could you have

213
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,840
 like a beautiful like set of like hair could you give like a gorilla aria on the ground a

214
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:33,520
 extensions little ponytail but anyway so this one comes out and sees this shot kid and starts

215
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,560
 totally flipping out now we haven't shooting this little kid right bleeding out we have not doing

216
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,760
 anything for half hour now we have a big foot that's quote unquote big foot you're like dang it Jason

217
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,400
 that's a pain switch it's still a big foot even though it's only six feet tall come out of the

218
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,440
 woods you have all this all of these elements are kind of ridiculous but I think this next statement

219
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,040
 really shows whether or not we should take this dude seriously okay your mileage may vary but for

220
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,960
 me I was like okay here's this quote from him I'd seen this is on pond seeing this sqaq woman for

221
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,480
 the first time I've seen a lot of wild things in my life when I was out in the forest but nothing

222
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,760
 like this creature which really frightened me when I was young and not to brag I had to

223
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,960
 strangle a bear with my bare hands it was it or me but I'm sure that if this hairy bean had laid

224
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:33,120
 one hand on me not a single one of my bones would have remained in one place so we're sitting now

225
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,760
 we're back and we're sitting in front of this dusty storefront this dude Charlie's talking to us and

226
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:47,280
 he's like I don't mean to brag guys but one day I strangled a bear but this thing scared me now at

227
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,480
 that point we all kind of look at each other and we're like first off nobody ever says if you say

228
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,680
 I don't mean to brag and the next statement is I killed a bear with my bare hands you meant to brag

229
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:05,760
 secondly that really puts everything for me at least puts everything else very suspiciously

230
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,040
 he shouldn't have had that in there that if I'm making up a story if I'm making up a story where

231
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,960
 I'm like yeah dude I was I got abducted by aliens you're like really it's like yeah dude and I got

232
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,440
 like brought up on the ship they tried strapped me down I started fighting them and then I was like

233
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,640
 beating them up and then like then like my pants fell off and they saw that I had like a big wiener

234
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,400
 and then they let me go like you would be like Jason I believe this story up until the obvious

235
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,000
 brag when you're telling me you can just say I I've seen a lot of crazy things but nothing this

236
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,680
 spooky the fact that he go maybe I'm submitted to a shy mom since it's gonna get edited out but

237
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,200
 the fact that he's saying he can strangle a bear with his bare hands has strangled a bear with his

238
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,240
 bare hands that's a lie I don't believe that I don't think that's I mean maybe a bear embryo maybe

239
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,880
 a bear being born the mama bear is asleep I'm reneating the baby bear's coming out maybe

240
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,760
 he could do that but I don't think so so anyways now we're going back in time now we're highly

241
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,120
 suspicious of what this guy says this ass quatch woman is standing there she looks at Charlie

242
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,600
 she looks at the boy the boy looks very weak now it's been 30 hours dude you could have at least

243
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:23,440
 given him a bandaid and the bear woman looks again at Charlie and goes you have shot my friend

244
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,360
 and if it's that's an interesting quote for a couple reasons and red pill junkie pointed this

245
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,840
 out the fact that she said and there's different variations of it she was saying this in the

246
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,200
 dialect of the douglas indians according to Charlie if she said you have shot my friend that would

247
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,800
 make her have a working knowledge of firearms which would put her much closer to human level

248
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,680
 intelligent other variations of the quote are you have hurt my friend or you've killed my friend but

249
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,760
 anyways and it's just to be clear the boy on the ground on the sasquatch that little boy is not a

250
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,560
 boy sasquatch that is a human boy and then we have this sasquatch showing up so we'll get into that

251
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,160
 as well and the guy starts to apologize but it doesn't matter he shot a kid who what can you say

252
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:14,320
 at that point she then starts to do this dance trying not to be racist as i'm making a dance noise

253
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:24,560
 and she's holding out of nowhere she pulls us out of nowhere she's holding what charlie describes as

254
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:31,520
 either a six foot long snake which is possible right maybe not in america but you know she she

255
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,000
 is sasquatch he might be well traveled he's standing just feet away from this creature

256
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,280
 apparently she's chanting to stovakor at this point and as she's doing this he can hear chanting

257
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,240
 in the forest as well at this point i'm thinking those are just echoes dude but anyways she's swinging

258
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,920
 around this six foot long snake or charlie goes it could have been a snake or it could have been six

259
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:01,920
 feet of intestines so again charlie listen dude you i'm not a hunter i'm not a nature guy you

260
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,880
 trying to convince me that you've seen a lot of wild things in the woods i can tell the difference

261
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,960
 between a snake and a and a guts i can at least do that if i am at a zoo and i'm like oh let's go

262
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,280
 to the snake exhibit and that's today they forgot to like you know bring the snakes so they just

263
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,800
 started throwing lamb intestine in there i'd be like hey wait i'm i'm that savvy nobody's

264
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,400
 anyways anyway so again that's me making me question this but whatever it is you're like

265
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,240
 jason that's your takeaway you have a talking bigfoot doing this dance swinging this around

266
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,360
 well i want to be specific she starts splashing it she starts hitting it against the ground

267
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:50,080
 making these noises saying this chant and she's just doing this thing now then and then with one

268
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,880
 hand so she's swinging around the snake slash intestine and then the other hand she picks up

269
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,160
 the kid like he says like a wax doll which what the what the what the hell's a wax doll

270
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,240
 anyway maybe that's some old-timey thing but anyway what would be the point of having a doll

271
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,240
 that you're like can i play with it outside they're like no honey it's made of wax it's all melting

272
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,080
 faces all the little anyways picks them up like a wax doll and she's holding the kid with one arm

273
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,760
 i'm assuming the kid's deceased at this point he's no longer saying anything and then she turns to

274
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,880
 charlie and she's swinging this thing around in the air that's either spewing out venom or blood

275
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,960
 we don't know it's either snake or intestines and she looks at charlie and says and now charlie

276
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,840
 pauses the story because this is his first person account in this that is being reported in this

277
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,920
 article charlie pauses the story to say this now every time i tell this story nobody wants to believe

278
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:51,600
 what happened next i'm having a hard time believing what's happened before because this this you know

279
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,880
 meant however you say this ending of the story is actually the least spectacular part of it

280
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,880
 the monster woman turns to charlie and says si wash you will never kill another bear in your life

281
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,840
 and then he drops his rifle which he had the whole time he's i guess i just said earlier he said he

282
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,280
 couldn't even pull the trigger like when he saw it he was so terrified he couldn't pull the trigger

283
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,480
 the whole time though he sold this rifle he drops the rifle and he's standing up there and at that

284
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,640
 point he realizes he's paralyzed the creature's just dancing in front of him looking at him

285
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:34,080
 he cannot move and now we're sitting back on the porch and he's sitting there and he's like and that

286
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:41,600
 my children is the story of how i became paralyzed and that's why i am sitting in this chair in the

287
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:52,080
 1950s we're looking at each other we're like what he's like yes i'm paralyzed because i was cast a

288
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,040
 sasquatch woman which cast a spell on me paralyzed me so kind of started getting dusting ourselves

289
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:05,280
 off giving him some money he's like i need your charity have a 401k jerk i'm just enjoying the

290
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:14,080
 sun with my wax doll there's just puddles there's puddles everywhere the obvious question is this

291
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,320
 if this story is true at all which most likely isn't but if the story is true at all he's paralyzed

292
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,320
 he remember this story ends with him being paralyzed on a mountain and the monsters in front of him

293
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,680
 now i don't know if the monster walked away the bigfoot walked away teleported away swung

294
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,680
 its magical snake guts around and like jumped into a portal but he didn't disappear or go into a

295
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,840
 portal he was paralyzed on the mountaintop but then apparently then he just gets back to town

296
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,880
 and then gets reparalleled the end end of the story makes no sense now it's interesting because

297
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,080
 this story is very very controversial and it's obviously controversial for a couple different

298
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,880
 reasons i'm gonna go over these quick because i don't want to run long but when bigfoot people

299
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,360
 not the actual bigfoot people but bigfoot researchers there is a divide most of them

300
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,200
 believe it's a biological group that actually lives in the woods and they leave feces and

301
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,520
 footprints and bo it's whatever that's a nonsense theory but a lot of people believe in that one

302
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,440
 a smaller group of people and i think the most logical one even though this is absolutely bizarre

303
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,120
 it's bigfoot some sort of interdimensional connected to UFOs high strangeness other dimensions

304
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,760
 something like that that makes more sense because it clears up why there's no evidence of them or

305
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,960
 why when we find evidence it's inconclusive they're basically in between a UFO and a ghost they're

306
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,280
 more biological than a ghost but they're not extra trust you're like UFO that's the more likely

307
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,280
 scenario if any of these stories are true this story though is foolish on the outset you have a

308
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,240
 bigfoot that's talking you have it casting magical spells you have it kidnapping a little boy and

309
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,960
 it's funny because a lot of bigfoot people though say that does fit with the bigfoot lore

310
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,240
 of young children being kidnapped and it goes into it can also play into the whole missing

311
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,720
 four on one people go missing in the woods and stuff like that this story though is so controversial

312
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,760
 that red pill junkie got doxxed because of it when a site was disputing this they were printing

313
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,960
 his real name which was absolutely bizarre because it's obviously and so he got the story from a

314
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,960
 there's a book written in Italy called this is how obscure this story is there was a book written

315
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:33,680
 in Italy back in the back 1979 called Sasquatch enigma anthropological it was written in Italy

316
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:40,880
 then the red pill junkie found a copy of it when he was a kid at a at a mexican flea market so his

317
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,440
 copy was a spanish translation of an italian book and here he is he got the book like in the 80s

318
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,600
 when he was a kid now we're in the i think this article came out in 2015 somewhere around that

319
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,000
 he's translating the book into english this story is being going from italian to spanish to english

320
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,040
 and there's been no translation of this story published and like in a book form in english so

321
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,400
 very very rare and there was a i when i found this story there was another article that was debunking

322
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,720
 it and they were just said the author's role i'm not a fan of anonymity to begin with i think that

323
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,360
 it's much better to just use your real name and to be in front of it but if you choose to use a name

324
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,160
 like red pill junkie or you choose to use a pseudonym i think that it only under extreme

325
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,200
 circumstances should you dox those people and writing a story about trying writing a funny

326
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,800
 story saying look at the story i found about bigfoot is not a reason why you should print

327
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,840
 someone's full name again i think people should not be anonymous online anyways but super bizarre

328
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:47,680
 like i was shocked the controversy behind the story was more shocking than not but people

329
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,880
 really don't like the story really hasn't been out there i think it's a funny story i think it's

330
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,160
 an interesting story i don't necessarily think it's true but i don't think it's true because of

331
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,120
 stuff like him standing around a bleeding kid for a half hour him teleporting off the mountain

332
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,720
 when he's like he's paralyzed on the mountain then he appears in town the next day there's a lot of

333
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,960
 details missing from it not because i don't believe that bigfoot's have the ability to

334
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,400
 okay because if bigfoot's real i go with the interdimensional thing it's i would say well

335
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,240
 if they're coming from another dimension maybe they do have snake guts maybe they do have

336
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,480
 the ability to cast spells and stuff like that we do know that bigfoot's have been tied to kidnapping

337
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,440
 children was the kid a prisoner was the kid really the friend the kid was definitely human

338
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,640
 there's a lot of like interesting questions to it not dox worthy definitely but let's end

339
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,960
 it like this let's end it like this i think there's an interesting component to this if you

340
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,040
 were walking through the woods and you saw bigfoot and you came home you probably wouldn't tell anyone

341
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,880
 for a long time but let's say you come home and you tell your buddies do to solve bigfoot last night

342
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,560
 people are going to be like yeah yeah whatever and they might believe you they might humor you they

343
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,040
 might make fun of you behind your back but you'd probably get over it no no no i really saw him

344
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,520
 yeah yeah whatever but then let's say you were walking through the woods and you saw bigfoot

345
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,560
 and you interacted with it in some ways thrown rocks at you or you guys were playing go and he's

346
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,000
 like don't shut me up don't let me out shut me off i'm afraid of the dark you go back you tell

347
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,520
 your buddies they're like what that's that story is ridiculous and you're like no no no but it really

348
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,720
 happened and you would understand that it was ridiculous you'd understand why people didn't

349
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,560
 believe you but imagine if you went into the woods and you had a negative interaction with a bigfoot

350
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,640
 to the point that it actually crippled you for life and as the helicopter shows up to lifelight

351
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,160
 you out of there and they're like what happened you fall down a ravine where you like shut off a

352
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:32,800
 particularly mean robot he's like no none of those things none of those things bigfoot uh

353
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:40,640
 bigfoot punched my my spine uh i can't move helicopters flying away that's one of those

354
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,160
 things where you would i would actively be mad if people didn't believe me in that story i would

355
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:54,000
 actively be upset if i suffered some sort of horrible physical tragedy and it was caused by

356
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,200
 bigfoot and then people are like big bigfoot yeah right you're like dude look at the scars i can't

357
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,280
 look at these giant footprints on my stomach what those are fake i think that would make me mad and

358
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,280
 it's funny because i never thought about this before i think that's like some people can say

359
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,480
 i think that's the difference between people who believe in aliens and people who've been abducted

360
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:20,000
 by aliens people who have said oh yeah i saw UFO or i believe in like the galactic brotherhood or

361
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,080
 all that nonsense stuff like that or i believe reptilians are taken over the planet they don't

362
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,480
 necessarily take it personal if you don't believe them i mean they might feel like they're more

363
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,560
 enlightened than you but i don't think i've ever gotten in a fight with someone because i don't

364
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,080
 believe reptiles are taken over the planet secretly i would just use my my secret reptilian strength

365
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,280
 to take them down but if i was abducted by aliens like if i was physically or like mentally harmed

366
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:49,120
 but me directly not myles iris and it was some stupid theory i had but me directly if i was

367
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,920
 abducted by aliens and tormented physically or mentally or sexually and people didn't believe

368
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:02,240
 me that would make me really mad that would make me probably more prone to not tell these stories

369
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:09,600
 to anyone else and this is kind of creepy now that i'm thinking about this too and that would

370
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,000
 actually make it worse because one of the ways in real life that you stop abuse is you have to let

371
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,760
 other people know so other people can intervene but if you're being abducted by aliens and now

372
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,160
 this is an alien ending but if you're getting abducted by aliens and you're being abused and

373
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,320
 you're put back in your bed at night and you wake up and you don't tell anyone they're just going

374
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,080
 to keep doing it they're going to keep doing it until you get help but who do you reach out for help

375
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,720
 if no one's going to believe you who are you going to reach out for help if you're afraid that

376
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:47,040
 20 years after telling your story to someone some jackass podcaster is going to be making an episode

377
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,480
 about a poor paralyzed man in british columbia i don't know maybe i turned around maybe bigfoot

378
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,680
 did mess this dude up but i guess i'll never know unless i end up having a close encounter

379
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:07,360
