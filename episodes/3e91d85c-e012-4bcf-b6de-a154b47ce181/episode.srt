1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 A warning to all you animal lovers/hippie-dippy people out there.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:15,280
 A man- no sorry, the star of the Matrix films has a bone to pick with the world.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,160
 And then we travel across America.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:26,440
 In the late 1890s, a series of airships, mysterious ships in the sky, were seen all over the country.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,440
 We're gonna take a look at some of the most interesting ones, and yes, it's an interactive adventure.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,960
 [Music]

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,640
 Happy New Year's, this is the official New Year's episode.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,160
 It is January 1st on the west coast of the United States.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,360
 Doesn't matter where you live, this is all that matters.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,680
 It's January 1st here, so happy New Year's people.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,920
 We made it, we got a lot of stuff to cover today.

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,960
 Actually, before we get started, I've been pitching my Minecraft server for a while,

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,440
 and a while back I said there was a secret hidden civilization out in the wilderness.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,200
 And it's been found by Flashman7870, so congratulations on that.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,760
 If you guys want to join the Minecraft server, it's totally awesome.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,040
 You can chat, you can have fun.

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,280
 I am thinking though, of starting everything over again, and no protection.

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,840
 So basically be anarchy.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
 But we'll see.

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
 I won't be anarchy.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,320
 I'm going to be your god, your floating creative god over the field, building whatever I want.

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,400
 But I'm thinking about it.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,440
 So hit me up in the comments, email, whatever.

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,080
 But I really like the Minecraft server.

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,520
 I think it's the closest we're going to come to having some sort of discord-esque thing

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,720
 for a while, because this is far easier for me to mod than discord.

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,760
 So that's just where we're at right now.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,000
 Let's go ahead and get started now with our first story.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,080
 Our first story is going to be really short, but it's important.

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,440
 This vet is sitting there in his doctor's office doing some paperwork and stuff.

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,600
 He's like, "I love my job.

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 I love saving animals."

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,440
 Then all of a sudden his door gets kicked in.

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,200
 And a dude comes in carrying a German Shepherd.

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,280
 He throws it on the table and he goes, "Save my dog."

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
 The dog's like, "Oooh."

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,000
 Okay, just so the dog lives.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Just cut to the chase.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
 Anyways, you don't know that yet.

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
 The doctor's like, "Uh-oh.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,000
 We don't have time to get in the operating room.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Bring me my stuff here."

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,280
 And they cut them open on the desk and they look.

48
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,760
 The vet's like, "There was an easier way to do this, but the dramatic way is for me to

49
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,080
 cut this dog open and look."

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,880
 You're like, "I don't want to listen to this horrible podcast."

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
 The dog lives.

52
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
 The dog lives.

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,760
 You're building the narrative of the world's most intense veterinarian.

54
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
 The point, okay.

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,520
 So let's forget that topic where a dog gets cut.

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,360
 I don't know why I started with that.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
 Forget it.

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 Forget it.

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
 This is the point of the story.

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,120
 Dogs totally fine, but a bunch of dogs aren't.

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,160
 So apparently, dogs, this is where it gets depressing.

62
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,100
 Guys, you have to have the jokes before you get it.

63
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,560
 You have to give the sugar before you give the salt, right?

64
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,480
 Dogs are dying all over the United States.

65
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
 Some cats too.

66
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,580
 But it's not really the focus of this.

67
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,580
 It's dying everywhere.

68
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,160
 I'm sure you've seen it on the news.

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,440
 Streets are littered with them.

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,440
 The reason why they're dying is actually very, very stupid.

71
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,440
 Listen, if you want to be a vegetarian, vegan, whatever weirdo diet you want to be on, fine.

72
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:37,320
 But when it comes to babies and animals, just feed them what they would eat in the wild.

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,180
 I.e., great value dog food from Walmart.

74
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,180
 Just feed them garbage.

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,180
 Not the kids.

76
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,880
 Don't feed the kids that.

77
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,540
 But don't go out of your way to buy fancy, dancy foods for your pets.

78
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,420
 Because what has happened is that the FDA has said, "Listen, dogs are having heart attacks."

79
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,380
 And we, this is the reason why.

80
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,580
 We don't know exactly which brands are causing this, but it's what they call "beg foods."

81
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,980
 Which is kind of ironic because that's what dogs do, to eat beg foods.

82
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,020
 Boutique, exotic ingredients, or grain-free foods.

83
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,600
 So when you go and you spend $14 for a can of dog food, you feel like, "Oh yeah, dude,

84
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,720
 this is totally awesome.

85
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,080
 This was made by like Sherpas and the Himalayas and Carbon Footprints -5 producing this stuff.

86
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,640
 It has these exotic ingredients, but it's killing animals.

87
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,640
 What happens is, there's an ingredient or a lack of ingredients in these foods that

88
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,880
 are making the heart wall of the dogs get thinner.

89
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,960
 And again, some cats, but they have tiny hearts anyways.

90
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,440
 I think they start off thin.

91
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,340
 The dog hearts get thinner and thinner and thinner, and then they die.

92
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,860
 It's the reverse of the Grinch.

93
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,220
 So the point of the story is, don't feed your dogs that stuff.

94
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,540
 Don't feed your dogs that stuff.

95
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,980
 The FDA is saying, "This is their working theory.

96
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,060
 The dogs have a lack of taurine, you know, that stuff in energy drinks.

97
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,220
 Dogs need that.

98
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,220
 Humans might.

99
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,300
 That's why it gives you wings, but it gives hearts to dogs.

100
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,300
 Don't do, okay.

101
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,140
 Do not feed your dog a Red Bull.

102
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,160
 And apparently, I'm sure the taurine is different.

103
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,800
 But they know that these types of foods don't have this.

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,680
 When they started treating these animals with taurine, their hearts got better.

105
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,160
 And they said, "Listen, we know in big breeds of dogs they have this heart disease thing.

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,000
 It's called DCM or dilated cardiomathpathy.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,360
 Well, I'm not a veterinarian.

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
 Also, I think they do operations on their desk.

109
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
 That's another reason why I'm not a veterinarian.

110
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,000
 This is the genetic disease, and sometimes big dogs have it, but now like little Chihuahuas

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,040
 are having it.

112
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,540
 Little dudes and they're saying there's no specific timeline.

113
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,420
 So some dogs may be eating this food for years and years and years, and their heart gets

114
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,420
 thin.

115
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,020
 And they go, "We've seen dogs die in as soon as six months."

116
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,500
 You're like, "Jason, this is a terrible way to start today's episode."

117
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
 And you're right.

118
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,860
 So we're going to move on to the next topic.

119
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,300
 I just wanted to let you guys be aware of that.

120
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,820
 If you are some homeopathic voodoo weirdo out there who's not feeding their dogs great

121
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,800
 value food from Walmart or just buying it at the dollar store, I'm not saying that's

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,480
 healthier, but it honestly probably is.

123
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,760
 Because it's full of just pig scrapings and horse nostrils and all sorts of stuff that

124
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,760
 a dog needs to eat, apparently.

125
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
 They need grains.

126
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,960
 They don't need exotic ingredients or boutique foods.

127
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,400
 And I would argue humans don't either.

128
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,440
 Just eat stuff off the ground like a normal American human.

129
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,940
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.

130
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,820
 Now this one is weird, and I don't really even know how to dig into it without giving

131
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:48,860
 -- because this is halfway a Dead Rabbit recommends and halfway a look into the mind of a troubled

132
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,360
 man.

133
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,100
 Now we all remember the movie The Matrix.

134
00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:00,040
 We all remember the American classic and in The Matrix you had your star and then you

135
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,640
 had the supporting cast obviously.

136
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,360
 The star of that movie really was in Keanu who?

137
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
 Kean who?

138
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,440
 Would have been a better joke.

139
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,920
 But I didn't tell that one.

140
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,600
 Carrie O'Haraway boo.

141
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,720
 Lawrence Fishburn more like Lawrence Fishsmell pewee.

142
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:32,260
 The main star of that movie was Marcus Chong aka Tank, the dude on the Nebuchadnezzar,

143
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:37,000
 actually one of the only 4 remaining surviving characters from The Matrix.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,520
 Now I remember when you saw Reloaded because I was peeking through the bushes you were

145
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,940
 watching the living room and I was like "Yes, enjoy the movie!"

146
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,020
 I remember looking at you and seeing the disappointment on your face when you found

147
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:57,160
 out that Marcus Chong was killed off screen there would be no tank in Reloaded or Revolutions.

148
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,600
 Humanity rose up and said "M cat, M cat" that means Marcus Chong is Tank, M cat.

149
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
 I didn't make that up.

150
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 Well can you stand a second?

151
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
 M cat.

152
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,400
 The movies did not do as well financially.

153
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:18,400
 This all is the reality that is presented to you in the short documentary must see the

154
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
 Marcus Chong story.

155
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,440
 It's on YouTube and this is the part that's a dead rabbit recommends I really recommend

156
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,280
 you guys watching it.

157
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
 But why?

158
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,560
 Why am I asking you to spend 40 minutes of your time watching a self made documentary

159
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,400
 about Marcus Chong not getting cast in the movie The Matrix?

160
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,820
 Because it is flat out bizarre.

161
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
 Here is the story.

162
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,420
 I'm going to keep this brief because I would like you guys to watch the documentary.

163
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
 It's fascinating.

164
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,920
 Marcus Chong was a young actor who did roles in like Roots, The Next Generation that was

165
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,300
 a miniseries, it was a sequel to the seminal miniseries Roots starring LeVar Burton.

166
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,120
 He was in like some Broadway plays.

167
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
 He had done I think like Little House on the Prairie something like that.

168
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,400
 He had done some television work right?

169
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:14,040
 And then he gets cast to do the role of Tank in The Matrix and he according to him only

170
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,580
 got paid a couple hundred thousand dollars.

171
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,380
 And I know what you're thinking because I often think the same thing.

172
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,780
 That's fine a couple hundred thousand dollars.

173
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,220
 But in the world of Hollywood it's really not a lot of money.

174
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,780
 He finds out on the set that Joey Pants the guy who played Cypher the villain got paid

175
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,460
 like a million or a couple million dollars and he went to the producers, the directors,

176
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,460
 the Walkowskis.

177
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,420
 He goes up and says hey you know how come he's getting millions I'm just getting a couple

178
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,420
 hundred thousand dollars.

179
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,700
 They didn't give him a car he had to walk to the set each day.

180
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,420
 They gave him a hotel room like it really makes it seem like they were torturing Marcus

181
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
 Chong.

182
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,040
 And he has this idea too.

183
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:57,360
 So back after, right after The Matrix was released, he begins filming a documentary about how the

184
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,160
 world is against him.

185
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,800
 Specifically the producers of The Matrix and the directors, the Walkowskis.

186
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:12,440
 So imagine having a bone to pick for 18 years and that bone starting then and recording phone

187
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,300
 calls, recording phone calls with people to the point where you're talking on the phone

188
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,700
 and then you're holding your tape recorder up.

189
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,780
 That's how long ago this was people just were using tape recorders up to the phone so you

190
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,740
 could get the other point of the conversation and then talking and then holding.

191
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,740
 So every, which is illegal in the state of California, the other person needs to know

192
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,180
 that they're being recorded.

193
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,740
 Because I used to be a journalist I had a look and all that stuff.

194
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:44,240
 It's so amateurish that this person's trying to provide proof that he's being screwed over

195
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,440
 but you miss the first five words of everything the other person's saying.

196
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:57,440
 Must see the Marcus Chong story is a bizarre descent into the world of one man who believes

197
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
 to this day that he was completely ripped off.

198
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,760
 But again, that's not the point of the story.

199
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,180
 That's not the point of the segment because that's just a guy, that's just a guy who

200
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,740
 has a business beef.

201
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:16,540
 What makes the story weirder is that it's basically in the end because the Wachowski

202
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:23,340
 brothers ended up transitioning to the Wachowski siblings, they're two trans women now.

203
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:29,260
 Then the documentary basically, I don't want to say says that that's some sort of curse

204
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,440
 or some sort of madness that's been inflicted against the enemies of Marcus Chong.

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,480
 But the last five minutes of this documentary are jaw-droppingly weird.

206
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,800
 I think it was with MythW on the Minecraft server.

207
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,280
 I was hanging out on there and I was talking to him and I'm sorry if this is the wrong

208
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,080
 person but I said you got to watch this documentary and they watched it too and when they got

209
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,500
 to the ending they were like what was up with that ending and I'm like it's weird.

210
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,700
 It's totally a bizarre little documentary because it's one man's point of view on this

211
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,540
 battle that you can go and look up any of this information really.

212
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,420
 So maybe it did just turn out to be a dead rabbit or recommends a very long one but it

213
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,780
 does start to border in some really weird things at the end where he's like a sexy,

214
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,740
 virile, young male and cannery's dated a trans woman and that's some sort of bizarre

215
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,740
 curse.

216
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,000
 But if you think that I'm reaching too much on that he made a second little film that's

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,880
 also in the show notes that's set to the Twilight Zone music and it's like everyone who wronged

218
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,040
 me will be trapped on the Nebuchadnezzar which is not how you pronounce it, it's Nebuchadnezzar

219
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,320
 but all the souls who wronged me like cannery's will be trapped on the Nebuchadnezzar floating

220
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,680
 through October 18th, 2000, forever.

221
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
 There's souls are trapped.

222
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,180
 So it's definitely some weird stuff going on here but I really recommend watching that

223
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,180
 movie.

224
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,480
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last topic.

225
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,540
 I talked way too long about Marcus Chong.

226
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,820
 Hey that rhymed.

227
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,060
 Let's go ahead and get your numbers ready.

228
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,140
 We're going to do an interactive adventure on airships and I'm going to tell you right

229
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,300
 now this episode is probably going to run a little long but that's okay.

230
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,220
 It's our New Year's Day special.

231
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,940
 We're going back to the year 1896.

232
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,060
 We had a ton of airship sightings back then.

233
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,880
 They're basically the old timey version of a UFO sighting.

234
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,840
 We see metallic discs, lights shining, little grays walking around.

235
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,880
 They saw big ol' blimps which is a curious thing.

236
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,200
 Now some of them it did appear that they saw some sort of like metallic objects as well

237
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,240
 but they never really go into the saucer thing.

238
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,800
 A lot of times these things are like big cigars or blimps with people on them.

239
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,720
 Literal boats with blimps that are flying around.

240
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,620
 Now I don't want to get into, we can do a totally different episode on that.

241
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,180
 I'm actually going to write that down as to why people saw blimps.

242
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,220
 I actually have a pretty good theory on that but we're not going to talk about that.

243
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,740
 We're not going to talk about my interesting theory.

244
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,460
 We're going to talk about airships.

245
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,580
 So pick a number between one and five.

246
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,980
 Okay got it?

247
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,940
 Okay let's go.

248
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,860
 First off we're going back to the year 1896.

249
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:18,600
 This was actually the very first big airship sighting in America was on November 17th,

250
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
 1896.

251
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,840
 It was in Sacramento, my hometown, Sacktown.

252
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,560
 Now it's a couple days later.

253
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,600
 It's November 19th, 1896.

254
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,760
 We're going to the city of Stockton, murder capital of the world.

255
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,840
 Even back then old timey people just getting shot doing old timey meth.

256
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,640
 We're going to meet a guy named Colonel H.G. Shaw.

257
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,300
 He's riding in a buggy.

258
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,500
 Which I'm pretty sure was a car.

259
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,260
 I mean did it have horses?

260
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,500
 Did they have cars?

261
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,020
 I guess I probably should have looked that up.

262
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,180
 Anyways it doesn't matter.

263
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,620
 He's in some sort of wheeled vehicle.

264
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
 Right?

265
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,260
 He could have just been running on the log for all I care.

266
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,500
 The point is he's going down the road.

267
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,860
 I'm assuming that's a car because there's no horses mentioned in the story.

268
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:11,280
 And then 150 foot long airship comes flying by.

269
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,120
 Whoa log.

270
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,800
 He steps off the log and it just moves a little bit more.

271
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
 That's how you break the log.

272
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,040
 He gets off and the ship descends down.

273
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,200
 Now it's not like today when you're like oh no UFO hit it and you're like going 90 miles

274
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,080
 an hour and the spacecraft's going 120 and you're like uh?

275
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,620
 This is like you get off whatever vehicle you're in and then the ship, I mean it's a

276
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,020
 blimp right?

277
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,420
 It's a big ol' blimp.

278
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,260
 It's eeeeeeer it's gonna go slow right?

279
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,340
 He's checking his watch.

280
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,060
 He's like oh better invent a watch.

281
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,580
 Invents it and he's like oh yeah still got a while.

282
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,580
 Lanes.

283
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,740
 Three seven foot tall slender aliens jump out.

284
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,140
 That's a bad combination.

285
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,400
 Like seven feet tall and slender you're gonna have a real hard time wrestling those guys.

286
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,400
 And that's what happens because the aliens come out and they start checking out his buggy.

287
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,560
 They're like looking under the hood.

288
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,600
 They're like hmm look at the exhaust man.

289
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,280
 Well there they're all total car nerds.

290
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,840
 And he's just watching these giant dudes kind of mess around with this car and then they

291
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,320
 look at him and they grab him.

292
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,480
 And this is considered the first published account of an alien abduction.

293
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,120
 And he starts wrestling these guys and they're like trying to pull him on the ship and then

294
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,940
 finally he breaks free and that scares the aliens and they take off running.

295
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,900
 And you can imagine as they're running they're like you know it's a self build a tractor

296
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,060
 beam or figure out a way to paralyze these guys.

297
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,340
 And then their descendants later were three foot tall slender dudes and they were like

298
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,020
 shooting dudes with paralyzing rays which is the grays we have today.

299
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:55,700
 Now if you picked number five you are driving down a road in Stockton.

300
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,400
 And you have a big old timey mustache and mutton chops.

301
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,800
 Doesn't matter male or female you're totally ducked out in the old timey facial hair.

302
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,120
 And you see a giant ship slowly come down in front of you.

303
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
 Aliens jump out.

304
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
 It's the same ones.

305
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,740
 They all got like fingerprint bruises on their arms from their last battle.

306
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,120
 They're ready this time though.

307
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,720
 They just totally overpower you.

308
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
 They bring a fourth one.

309
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,160
 That's all they needed was one more.

310
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,460
 You're like no no.

311
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:27,600
 If you picked number five you are carried aboard the alien starship and I'll give you

312
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
 something.

313
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,000
 Whatever item is directly to your left you're able to grab that before they throw you on

314
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 the ship.

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,400
 So now you spend the rest of your possibly short life wrestling seven foot tall aliens

316
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,480
 in a giant gladiator somewhere in space.

317
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,540
 It's a carved out asteroid full of old timey aliens.

318
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,100
 They all have like barber poles and like canes and stuff like that.

319
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,220
 Because even the aliens would be old timey because it's 1896.

320
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,860
 And you get to fight aliens and maybe win.

321
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,700
 Maybe you are plucky enough.

322
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,180
 Maybe you're fit enough.

323
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,500
 Maybe you just happen to have a shotgun to the left of you.

324
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,140
 Aliens we've never seen such technology.

325
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,100
 We've only built hyperdrive.

326
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,720
 We don't know what a firearm is.

327
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,040
 So if you picked number five that is your fate.

328
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,720
 A fate of glorious combat in the alien arena.

329
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,720
 Trust me I think that's the best fate.

330
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
 I would love to fight aliens.

331
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,400
 I would just do it for free in real life.

332
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,200
 I would box aliens dude.

333
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,360
 And I think that's why I've never seen one.

334
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,840
 I've seen tons of ghosts.

335
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,400
 Seen a couple demons.

336
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,800
 Seen some weird stuff.

337
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
 Never seen an alien.

338
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,700
 I think it's because even a good one I'm just going to town.

339
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
 I'm going to town.

340
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,980
 Speaking of abductions I just got abducted to go to work.

341
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,540
 I'm finished recording this episode a couple hours later.

342
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,060
 It's 9, about 9.30 at night.

343
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,020
 Huge storm going on.

344
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,300
 Nice and spooky for the rest of our episode.

345
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,180
 Let's go back to my notes.

346
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,500
 Let's go grab those first before we continue our adventure.

347
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,340
 So we leave behind Stockton California.

348
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,180
 And we leave all the number fives there.

349
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,480
 You have to shut off the episodes.

350
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,240
 You can't listen to anything.

351
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,960
 You can't until you defeat 10 alien warlords.

352
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
 You can't listen to the rest of the episode.

353
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,960
 But for the rest of us, we're leaving behind Stockton California.

354
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,600
 We're headed to somewhere in Texas.

355
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,920
 This is your 1896, 1897 Supervague I know.

356
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,400
 But that's the least of the problems with this story that we're about to go.

357
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,360
 We're somewhere in Texas.

358
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
 Bing!

359
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
 We're standing around.

360
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,580
 We're in the middle of nowhere, which is pretty much describes most of Texas.

361
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,260
 Especially back in the year 1896.

362
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,140
 And this is the story with this one.

363
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,060
 There are these three dudes hanging out in a field.

364
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,500
 And they see an airship.

365
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
 Flying overhead.

366
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
 And they're like, "Oh, look at this.

367
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,700
 One of those new fangled devices we've read about in the newspaper."

368
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,420
 They're pointing up in the sky.

369
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,860
 And it goes...

370
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,700
 And it starts to crash towards them.

371
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,040
 They're like, "Ahh!"

372
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
 And it's like coming closer and closer.

373
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,320
 And they're like, "Oh, run!

374
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
 Where do we run to?

375
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
 We're in the middle of nowhere.

376
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,280
 That's a giant ship flying towards us."

377
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,840
 So they scatter.

378
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,360
 But really they don't.

379
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
 Because of that...

380
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,640
 Okay, so my narrative version...

381
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
 Let's go back.

382
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,240
 Let's say what actually happened.

383
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,080
 I started making it all dramatic.

384
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,600
 One guy's like running his sweat and the other guy's like saving a baby that's just standing

385
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 there.

386
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 "Run, run, run!"

387
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 Picks the baby up, keeps going.

388
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
 That's not what happened.

389
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,260
 The usual version of the report is...

390
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,700
 Okay, what is this?

391
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,420
 I got my notes mixed up.

392
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,660
 I got my notes mixed up.

393
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,700
 The crashing story comes later.

394
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,180
 This is what actually happened.

395
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,820
 Now this one's going to be even funnier.

396
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,580
 Because of what I just built up.

397
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,700
 That's not what happens.

398
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,940
 In Texas in 1896, three witnesses are standing around and the ship goes...

399
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,800
 It just lands and doesn't impact the ground at all.

400
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,680
 And the three men are kind of standing there.

401
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,680
 Now if you picked number one, you're one of those three men.

402
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,800
 You're just standing there and you're looking around at this spacecraft.

403
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,280
 This vehicle from another world has landed in front of you.

404
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,600
 And you're like, "Well golly, look at that thing!"

405
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,360
 And some aliens get off of it.

406
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
 But they're not.

407
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,180
 Well technically they're aliens, but they look like humans.

408
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,900
 There's five of them.

409
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,120
 So five humans depart from this airship.

410
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,340
 They're described as particularly dressed men.

411
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,120
 So these five dudes get off the ship.

412
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,580
 And you figure in, "Okay, there's three of us.

413
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,580
 There's five of them."

414
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,020
 If this becomes a fight, odds are not in our favor.

415
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,100
 However, I did hear about a guy in Stockton who beat up three giant dudes.

416
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,340
 I think we could take these five dudes.

417
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,240
 But really you're not really thinking about beating these guys up, because you're not

418
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,480
 insane like I am.

419
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,400
 You're thinking, "This is first contact."

420
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,000
 I'm going to be one of the first humans to ever talk to someone from another planet.

421
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,240
 These aliens walk up to you and begin speaking perfect English.

422
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,360
 How do you know English?

423
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,120
 And they say, "Well, that's a good question."

424
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:29,100
 You see, back in 1553, one of your so-called explorers came to the North Pole.

425
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,460
 He spoke English.

426
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,180
 And he taught us we're from there.

427
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,180
 And you're thinking, "Santa?"

428
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,780
 And you're like, "No, no, no, not Santa."

429
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,220
 Even more intriguing than Santa.

430
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:46,700
 These five men then go on to tell you that they're actually the descendants of the lost

431
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,300
 tribe of Israel.

432
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:54,240
 So when Israel was split up, when they were just getting demolished back in olden times,

433
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,600
 and the 12 tribes separated across the planet, apparently one of the tribes went to the North

434
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,280
 Pole and built spaceships.

435
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,360
 So if you pick number one, you meet these dudes, these guys who say they're from Israel

436
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,080
 like thousands of years ago.

437
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
 Now they have a spaceship.

438
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,640
 And you're like, "That's interesting.

439
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,520
 Okay, but that is as interesting as it gets.

440
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
 I'm going to leave."

441
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,660
 And as you go to leave, they use their tractor beam technology, what we call a rope, and

442
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,860
 they throw it over you.

443
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,700
 The last so-you, they pull you into the ship.

444
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,140
 You're like, "No, no, no."

445
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,700
 For the rest of your short life, no, they're going to give you injections.

446
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,420
 So they're going to make you a cyborg.

447
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,300
 So you live hundreds of years.

448
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,140
 You are going to travel the universe with them.

449
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,580
 You're like, "Jason, that's awesome."

450
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,300
 But you're basically the space age equivalent of a Jehovah's Witness where you just have

451
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,720
 to fly through space and then like, you get in a space suit and you're knocking on the

452
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
 doors of other spaceships.

453
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,160
 And you're like, "Can I tell you about the good word?"

454
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,960
 And they're like, "No, no one's here.

455
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,640
 No one's spiraling in the ship now.

456
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,200
 This is AI controlled.

457
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,880
 This is the voice of a robot.

458
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,120
 Everyone's in cryogenic sleep."

459
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,600
 And you're like, "Aww."

460
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,760
 And then you're like floating back to your ship and you turn around and you see aliens

461
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
 looking through the portholes.

462
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
 Is he gone yet?

463
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
 Is he gone?

464
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
 That is your fate.

465
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,500
 Your fate is to join these five men travel through the galaxy trying to missionary to

466
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,100
 people about you being the lost tribe of Israel.

467
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,860
 For the next one, we're going to an unknown location.

468
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,340
 Year unknown as well.

469
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,660
 Now it's not because my notes are bad.

470
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,260
 It's because this just appeared in an old-timey newspaper.

471
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:35,140
 But we're going to assume the story's legit as we travel to unnamed city USA.

472
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,140
 Population, what?

473
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,820
 It's just the picture is population.

474
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,880
 Just a picture of a guy just dragging his shoulders.

475
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,560
 Two dudes are hanging out in a field.

476
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,680
 You're like, "Jesus, seriously?

477
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,240
 How big are these stories?"

478
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,360
 Two dudes, don't interrupt me.

479
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,440
 Two dudes are hanging out in a field and they see an airship.

480
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,680
 Yeah, basically at this point I think I can just cut that part out.

481
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,120
 It's always going to be the same.

482
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
 Anyways, but this airship, this is the one I got mixed up.

483
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:15,300
 This airship, it's crashing, it's exciting, isn't it?

484
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:27,060
 Whoa, we got to run, look out.

485
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,720
 The ship was about to crash in front of these two dudes and then there's just a guy standing

486
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,080
 in a field in front of him.

487
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,280
 And the guy goes, "Well, he's an alien.

488
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,080
 He looks like a normal human, but the assumption is he's some sort of alien, not from around

489
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
 here.

490
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
 He's like Italian."

491
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,000
 So the people go, "Dude, what happened?

492
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,560
 Your ship just crashed and then you're standing there?"

493
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,720
 And he goes, "No, no, no, no, no.

494
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,160
 The ship didn't crash."

495
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,880
 And they're like, "But we saw it coming towards the earth."

496
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
 He goes, "Yeah, yeah, that was all true."

497
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,040
 But what happened was right before it impacted the ground.

498
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:06,540
 I pulled out a shrink ray, shot the ship I was piloting, and then put it in my pocket.

499
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,300
 Now I swear I didn't make that story up.

500
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,900
 Somebody probably did, but I didn't.

501
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,420
 That wasn't some old-timey newspaper.

502
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,380
 Two guys said that they saw a ship and right before it crashed, there was a guy standing

503
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,380
 there and he says he had a shrink ray.

504
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,660
 That might honestly be the dumbest story I've ever told over the course of 300 and what,

505
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
 63?

506
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,120
 There are 64 episodes on this show.

507
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,400
 There's so many things wrong with that story.

508
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,560
 The main thing being, and I'm not a big science guy, but if a ship is crashing and then you

509
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,520
 shrink it, you put it in your pocket.

510
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,480
 One, let's say the ship is traveling 20 miles an hour and then you shrink it and put it

511
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,680
 in your pocket.

512
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,320
 It's going to go 20 miles per hour through your pocket.

513
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,000
 So it's basically going to destroy your pants.

514
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,940
 But really, the thing is, is that as it's coming down and you shrink it, now you're

515
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,820
 falling still at 20 miles per hour and you're putting something in your pocket that's 20

516
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,100
 miles an hour, which is a combined force of 40 miles per hour.

517
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,700
 It would be like a slow train crash happening in your pocket.

518
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,540
 And you're like, "Jason, you're getting really hung up on this shrinking ray thing."

519
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,900
 I am because there's another problem I have with this story.

520
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,560
 And it's really how it ends.

521
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
 That way.

522
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,360
 Imagine you're standing out in the fields and you see a spaceship, imagine it's today,

523
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,000
 and you see a spaceship crash in front of you.

524
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,880
 All of a sudden there's an alien standing there with his arms crossed in some boy band

525
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,840
 pose and he's like, "I bet you're wondering what happened to my spaceship."

526
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,400
 And you're like, "Yes, I'm a little curious about that."

527
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,560
 He goes, "Well, I shrunk it and I put it in my pocket."

528
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,440
 Then what happens?

529
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,560
 Like that's what's so bizarre to me about this story.

530
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,660
 One, the physics of it, but two, okay, and?

531
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,780
 If somebody told me the story, and I've had people tell me some weird stories like face

532
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,940
 to face and email even weirder stories.

533
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:03,540
 If someone told me the story in my first question, I wouldn't be talking about pocket physics.

534
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,820
 I'd be going and then what happened?

535
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,380
 Did he just turn and walk away?

536
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,740
 Did he blow the ship back up?

537
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,020
 Like what, then what happened?

538
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:19,240
 He's probably the most puzzling thing because there's no acceptable ending because he either

539
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,040
 goes, "Oh, I just wanted to show off my new technology."

540
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,780
 Makes the ship grow back up and flies away in front of these two dudes.

541
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,960
 Or doesn't, which is even weirder because then he's just walking around with a spaceship

542
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
 in his pocket.

543
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,920
 Oh, I'm just headed to the saloon.

544
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
 What?

545
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,000
 Why did you flay into the middle of a field?

546
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Why did you?

547
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
 You didn't even have to do that.

548
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
 So bizarre.

549
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,940
 If you picked number two, your best friend is an alien.

550
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,500
 Whoa, that's cool.

551
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,860
 And he has the shrink ray spaceship.

552
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,020
 But he's constantly like, "Hey, you want to go to Taco Bell?"

553
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
 You're like, "Yeah, sure.

554
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
 You want me to drive?"

555
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
 He's like, "No, no, no, I'll drive."

556
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
 Oh, dang it.

557
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,220
 He flies around in a blimp, a super slow blimp.

558
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,380
 And then right where he goes or he wants to go, he dive bombs the parking lot.

559
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,760
 And then right before you hit the ground, he shoots the shrink ray and throws the ship

560
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
 in your pocket.

561
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,760
 So basically whenever you want to go somewhere, you take a 40 mile per hour punch in your

562
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
 thigh.

563
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,640
 He's like, "Oh, I forgot my wallet at home.

564
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,280
 Let's get back in the vehicle."

565
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,760
 You're like, "No, no, no."

566
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
 Flying around.

567
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,320
 So I guess that's not a bad fate.

568
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,960
 You just get punched a lot.

569
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,160
 What else did we have earlier?

570
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,520
 Oh, intergalactic missionary and gladiator.

571
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,740
 So there you go.

572
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,140
 You get punched in the leg all the time.

573
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,820
 And you can't take the ship.

574
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,980
 Can't steal a ship.

575
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,180
 Can't steal a shrink ray.

576
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,780
 You can't be like, "So there you go.

577
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,980
 Get punched."

578
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,780
 I honestly think, I'm sure there's at least one physicist who listens to this show.

579
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,740
 I honestly think it would do more than a 40 mile per hour punch.

580
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:01,460
 I think reducing a giant airship and throwing it into your pocket, just the mass of the

581
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,700
 airship alone will probably rip your leg off.

582
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,200
 But until I get a comment or an email from a physicist, you just walk around with the

583
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
 bruise.

584
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,880
 I will update this podcast.

585
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,520
 If I later find out, it will shred meat and bone.

586
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,800
 If you get hit with a miniature airship, it goes into your pocket.

587
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,600
 Let me know, people at NASA or MIT.

588
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,640
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next one.

589
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,600
 So we've left behind the ones and the twos.

590
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,880
 Number one is they're out doing their whole mission in space.

591
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,780
 Number two, rubbing their leg.

592
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,780
 Oh my leg.

593
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
 We've got a charlie, permanent charlie horse.

594
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,500
 Because it's like, let's go on a road trip and we're going to stop at every diner we

595
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
 see.

596
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 No.

597
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,220
 The rest of us were going to Springfield, Missouri.

598
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,340
 April 10th, 1897.

599
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,540
 We got an actual place and a date for this one.

600
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
 So that's good.

601
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:59,140
 WH Hopkins is hanging out on the ground and he sees a landed airship.

602
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,780
 So it's not floating around.

603
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,460
 So you're like, isn't it just the ship?

604
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,460
 Isn't that just a land ship?

605
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,920
 Well, it had like the blimp thing.

606
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,160
 Had these giant propellers and he's walking up to the ship and he's like, curiouser and

607
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
 curiouser.

608
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
 Hmm.

609
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,120
 Going to take a look at one of these airships that I've read about in the news.

610
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,680
 So he's walking up the ship and then he sees the crew.

611
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:28,080
 He sees a beautiful naked woman walking along the ship.

612
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,940
 She looks at him, kind of gives him a heads up like, hmm, yeah.

613
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,140
 Doesn't blush, doesn't run away.

614
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,660
 And then another beautiful naked woman appears walking along the ship.

615
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,660
 And then there's more.

616
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,020
 There's just a bunch of beautiful naked women on the ship.

617
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,420
 And at this point, he has like the equivalent of an old timey erection.

618
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,660
 I'm sure they were the same, but they just like would also be accompanied with like the

619
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,780
 whiff of sasperilla.

620
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,620
 And he's walking along and he's seeing all these beautiful women.

621
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,840
 And then he sees a naked dude with a beard show up and he's kind of like, whoa, like

622
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
 it didn't do.

623
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,520
 He's not into that.

624
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,800
 He starts asking them questions.

625
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,960
 He goes, where are you from?

626
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,040
 Now that's stupid.

627
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,560
 Like obviously I get it.

628
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,240
 Maybe he's hoping they'll take him home to a place of more beautiful women with their

629
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
 own airships.

630
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,440
 But if I saw, but there's two different things here.

631
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,600
 Obviously like if I saw a UFO in the middle of nowhere, I'd be like, oh my God, like is

632
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,800
 this from an alien planet?

633
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 Like where are these guys from?

634
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,520
 If I saw a UFO and was surrounded by beautiful naked women, I'm not worried about where

635
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,380
 the aircraft is from.

636
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,380
 That's the least of my worries.

637
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,820
 My question is, hey, what's your name?

638
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,820
 You have a phone number?

639
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
 Snapchat?

640
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,620
 Like I'm not, and you guys may think, oh Jason's just doing a bit.

641
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:44,220
 I challenge you that if you walk in the middle of the spooky, spooky woods and you saw a

642
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:51,100
 UFO in a clearing and it was surrounded by the most beautiful women, what are your eyes

643
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,220
 going to be drawn to?

644
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:58,080
 Is it going to be drawn to the craft that can cut through space and time like an angel's

645
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
 whisper?

646
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,960
 Or are you going to be checking out all the hot chicks?

647
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,800
 That's completely, I would not ignore the UFO, but I'd be focused on the girls.

648
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,280
 But anyways, this guy apparently goes, where are you from?

649
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,160
 And they can't really talk English.

650
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,120
 They weren't hanging out of the North Pole.

651
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:24,500
 They just pointed up and said a word that Hopkins said sounded like Mars.

652
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,340
 Now that's the end of his story.

653
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:32,940
 And unlike the shrinking story, I think the shrinking story just kind of ended and then

654
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,740
 everyone just kind of stood there awkwardly for a couple of minutes and then they just

655
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,260
 turned around and walked in different directions.

656
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,620
 This story, I think he probably stuck on board the ship.

657
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,600
 He knocks out a guard and then has to imitate him, but instead of putting on his uniform,

658
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,400
 he just takes off all of his clothes and he's just walking around.

659
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,440
 And he's like drilling holes in the side of the ship and looking through it like it's

660
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
 a porkies movie.

661
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,160
 They're like, no, no, you've depressurized the room.

662
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
 People are blowing up as they leave orbit.

663
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:07,000
 They're like, ah, they find all these peepholes that he made in it and the ship just decompresses.

664
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,440
 But anyways, so they never make it back to Mars.

665
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,880
 Anyways, that's the story of Hopkins.

666
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:17,220
 So if you picked the number three, you get a pair of binoculars, right?

667
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:22,180
 And you are a hundred miles away from all this and you get to look through the binoculars

668
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,180
 and you see a ship laying in the middle of nowhere.

669
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,260
 You see a bunch of sexy, sexy women walking on the ship and you're like, oh man, I totally

670
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,780
 wish I could get on that ship.

671
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,780
 You're looking through your binoculars.

672
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,060
 You're like, oh man, this sucks.

673
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,500
 And then you feel a hand, a tentacle on your shoulder.

674
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,640
 And it says, oh yes, if you want to get close, I am friends with the captain.

675
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,680
 I'm also an alien, hence the tentacle.

676
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,440
 I am friends with the captain of that ship.

677
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,600
 You come with me and I will let you walk around on the naked boat, right?

678
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,080
 And so you go with the tentacle.

679
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,960
 It's just a giant tentacle.

680
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,520
 You turn around, it's just a tentacle.

681
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,000
 There's nothing else with a mouth, tentacle with a mouth.

682
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,080
 And so you go with the tentacle.

683
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,000
 But you realize you're going in the opposite direction.

684
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,860
 You also realize that the tentacle is driving like a 1988 Dotson.

685
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,660
 And you're like, this is weird.

686
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,660
 Where's your spaceship?

687
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,420
 The tentacle is like, it's in the shop.

688
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,180
 My real spaceship is in the shop and it's like driving.

689
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,060
 You're trying to figure out how a tentacle, just one tentacle can drive and both hit the

690
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,220
 gas, but it's working.

691
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,260
 And the car is just driving farther and farther away from the ship and you're like, oh, it's

692
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,820
 getting kind of sketchy.

693
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,740
 And then the tentacle drives you out to the middle of the woods and you're like, what?

694
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,740
 This is not good.

695
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,780
 And the tentacle is like, no, no, no, it's fine.

696
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,400
 And so it takes you into a cave and you're like, huh?

697
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,160
 Takes you to a cave and you go into the cave and then the tentacle is like, no, deeper,

698
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,160
 deeper into the cave.

699
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,120
 And so you go deeper into the cave and then you get knocked on the back of the head with

700
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
 like a mallet.

701
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
 It's holding him.

702
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,440
 He was holding a mallet the whole time.

703
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,120
 You were never suspicious until now.

704
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,400
 It was like a giant Donkey Kong mallet.

705
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,960
 You never questioned it.

706
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,500
 Knock and then when you wake up, you are on the naked ship.

707
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,220
 He told you the truth.

708
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,540
 He told you the truth.

709
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:19,260
 You're on the naked ship, but you're a space missionary.

710
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,180
 So you're in a little business suit on the ship.

711
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
 You don't even get to be naked.

712
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,740
 And everyone else is walking around you naked and they're like, you are going to travel.

713
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,880
 We've teamed up with these guys from the North Pole.

714
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,360
 We've all converted, but we're naked.

715
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
 That's our species.

716
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,920
 We're just beautiful naked people.

717
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,920
 You are just some space ministry guy.

718
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,000
 We're going to travel the galaxy and you're going to deliver the good word.

719
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,680
 You're going to knock on spaceships and deliver the good word that glip glop is your savior.

720
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,040
 You're like, I don't even believe in glip glop.

721
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,560
 And that's when you get your first electric shock.

722
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,360
 And actually, no, it's an electric shock.

723
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:02,700
 It feels like a tentacle goes down your throat and expands a white hot tentacle.

724
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:08,020
 And that's when you realize that every time you look at one of these beautiful women,

725
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,620
 or if you're into it, the beautiful dude, and you start to like feel like you're in

726
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,380
 love with them, this tentacle, this white hot tentacle explodes in your throat and it

727
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,820
 hurts really, really bad.

728
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,580
 So that is what happens if you pick number three.

729
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:28,760
 That's also what happens when you don't pre-play out what happens to if you pick number three.

730
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,960
 That was all just kind of off the top of my head.

731
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,480
 I didn't even know where I was going with it when they walked into the cave.

732
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,080
 I was thinking, uh-oh, where's this going?

733
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,840
 Am I just going to edit all this out?

734
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
 No, I'm not.

735
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
 You know what?

736
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,920
 Actually, that's not fair.

737
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,640
 That's not fair.

738
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,520
 After about a couple of days, the tentacle leaves your throat and you can bang one of

739
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,320
 the hot people on the ship.

740
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,860
 You're still a minister, you're still going to knock on spaceships because that's funny.

741
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:02,260
 But eventually, the tentacle releases you from the tentacle curse and you can find true love

742
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,740
 as opposed to those boring people who picked number one.

743
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,420
 So I figured, there we go, there we go.

744
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,180
 I should plan these out better.

745
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,900
 Now we're headed to probably one of the most famous airship stories.

746
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,220
 I was actually talking to Flashman7870, you know, he was the Minecraft guy.

747
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:25,520
 But I was talking to him about this episode and he's like, "I really don't like that story."

748
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
 Because he goes, "It's kind of famous.

749
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,920
 I'm pretty sure it's been debunked."

750
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,360
 It's actually quite a fascinating story and it really hasn't been debunked.

751
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,120
 So you're wrong, Flashman, you're wrong.

752
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
 No.

753
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,480
 So if you picked one, if you picked any number other than four, your fate has been sealed.

754
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,640
 Shut the podcast off now.

755
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,120
 I never want you guys to listen to it again.

756
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,440
 However, number four, come with me.

757
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
 Come over here.

758
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
 It's you and me, buddy.

759
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,200
 It's you and me, at least until the end of this segment.

760
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,140
 And then you are banished from the podcast as well.

761
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,500
 It's April 17th, 1897.

762
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,120
 We're in the city of Aurora, Texas.

763
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,100
 It's a sleepy little town.

764
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,900
 But it's 6 a.m. and oddly enough, everyone's awake.

765
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,100
 And in the town square, everyone's just kind of going about doing their thing.

766
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,180
 There's some chick talking about reading books and wanting to have a better life than she

767
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,180
 has.

768
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,340
 Everybody, everyone's ignoring her.

769
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,580
 She's just being a weirdo.

770
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,060
 Everyone else is just carrying eggs around or making bread and stuff like that.

771
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,800
 And up in the sky, you see this...

772
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,200
 This airship coming down, right?

773
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,720
 And it's a bunch of smoke is spewing out of it.

774
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,920
 Now, I like it.

775
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,960
 This story has the most detail of all.

776
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:41,320
 This airship was described as going the impossibly fast speeds of 10 to 20 miles per hour.

777
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,000
 Which is funny because that is not-- that would be nothing nowadays.

778
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,920
 Like, obviously, if someone was throwing a brick at you going 20 miles an hour, it's

779
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,980
 a lot.

780
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,420
 But that's nothing.

781
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,780
 But back then, to see something go 10 to 20 miles per hour, you'd be like, "What in

782
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,300
 the world is that?"

783
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,260
 Because you didn't go that fast unless you were on a particularly fast train.

784
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,700
 Or maybe like, you were the lone ranger or something.

785
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,740
 For the most part, people didn't go that fast.

786
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,700
 So they're watching this ship come down 10 to 20 miles per hour.

787
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,020
 They're like, "Whoa, dude, look out!

788
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
 It might break the sound barrier!

789
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,020
 What's the sound barrier?"

790
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,860
 I don't know, but it's so fast!

791
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,860
 It's-- [explosion]

792
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,780
 It just smashes into a windmill.

793
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,780
 [explosion]

794
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,100
 Hits the ground, just starts to disintegrate.

795
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,460
 Pieces are going everywhere.

796
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,040
 Everyone's running out of the town, running towards this debris pile.

797
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,020
 And there they find a little alien dude.

798
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,020
 An actual alien, supposedly.

799
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,020
 Not a man.

800
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,140
 Like, they were looking and they said he was not of this world.

801
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,140
 He's like, "Hmmm...

802
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,140
 [sigh]

803
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,140
 [sigh]

804
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,380
 "Have you accepted our Lord and saved your glip glop?"

805
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,020
 No, he didn't say anything.

806
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,020
 He didn't say anything.

807
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,180
 They come across a dead alien.

808
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,500
 They did, though, say, "Well, this guy's obviously like toast.

809
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,580
 He's all chopped up.

810
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,820
 Let's put him in a grave and let's give him a Christian funeral."

811
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,180
 Because that's what we would hope if we crash landed on another planet.

812
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,820
 I don't know if you actually-- I don't think you were thinking that far ahead.

813
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,980
 I think they just saw a dead thing, a dead humanoid, and said, "Let's give it a funeral."

814
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,900
 "We'll do a Christian funeral."

815
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,140
 So they bury it, they give it a little tombstone.

816
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,580
 They bury some of the debris of the ship in his grave.

817
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,180
 And the rest of it, they're like, "What do we do with this stuff?"

818
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,140
 And they go, "I just throw it in the well."

819
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,780
 So they started throwing this space-aged metal in a well.

820
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,780
 People are like, "Yeah, it's fine.

821
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,260
 It's not going to affect our drink and water at all, right?"

822
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,820
 That story came out.

823
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,940
 And that happened in April 17th, 1897.

824
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,460
 It was reported in the Dallas Morning Star, I believe, or the Dallas Morning Times, or

825
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
 whatever.

826
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,460
 Two days later.

827
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,740
 And it was a big hit.

828
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,300
 People in the area were like, "Whoa, dude, UFO crashed."

829
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
 But it-- what?

830
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,580
 I mean, we were having the-- as we've already shown, we were having these airship sightings

831
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,740
 all over the United States.

832
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,940
 So it didn't get a lot of publicity outside of the area.

833
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,380
 We'll jump ahead to the year 1935.

834
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,740
 And there was a guy named Brawley Oates who bought the property that the spaceship landed

835
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,740
 on.

836
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,220
 He didn't buy it because there was a spaceship on it.

837
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,900
 It's just good land.

838
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
 And he goes, "You know what?

839
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,620
 I want to start using that well.

840
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,020
 I want to start using that well."

841
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,700
 So he hauls up all the metal, gets rid of it, and gets terrible arthritis, which he

842
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:26,540
 always blamed was caused by the spaceship debris.

843
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,780
 Now a lot of people say that this story is debunked.

844
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,460
 Like I said, Flash Man was saying that it was debunked.

845
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,380
 And the reason why they say it was because Time Magazine ran an article on it saying

846
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,660
 this story wasn't happened.

847
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:44,740
 What happened was the author of the original article, there was a disease going through

848
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,260
 town like spotted fever or something like that.

849
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,820
 And a bunch of residents were getting killed.

850
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,820
 And there was supposed to be a train track that was built by the town.

851
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,220
 It didn't get built.

852
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,340
 So all of the resources, commerce was getting diverted to other towns, plus they were having

853
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,340
 this horrible illness.

854
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:05,820
 And he wanted to build publicity for people to come to visit Aurora, Texas, and live there.

855
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,580
 And they would come there if there was a spaceship crash.

856
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,700
 Now there's a couple things that we have to look at in the story.

857
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,460
 One, there's only one source for that story.

858
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,660
 It's an 86 year old woman named Edda Peggs.

859
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,300
 She said, the author of the article was Essie Hayden, and the newspaper was the Dallas Morning

860
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,300
 News.

861
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,580
 And she said, he made it up.

862
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,260
 He made it up because he wanted to get people to come to the town.

863
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,460
 So the whole debunking thing is based on that one person story.

864
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:41,900
 So you have to be a special type of jerk to know that a horrible disease is sweeping your

865
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,300
 town and then tricking people to come to your town.

866
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:51,300
 Like I can understand a disease is ravaging your town and you're trying to like do a straight

867
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,620
 return of the living dead, send more doctors moment to get medical personnel.

868
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,820
 But if there's people, back in the day, people who studied this, because you know today we

869
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,620
 have UFOologists.

870
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,980
 Back then they were called airshipologists, which is hilarious.

871
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,900
 Imagine you're an airshipologist.

872
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,820
 You have your monocle and you're drinking your tea and you see in the newspaper, hey look

873
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,540
 at the UFO crash at Aurora.

874
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:18,740
 I can't wait to go find it and you go out there and there's just a bunch of people dying

875
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,740
 on the streets.

876
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,380
 You're like, oh no, the aliens have caused this biological weapon.

877
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,740
 But that's kind of a jerk move because you're really not going to get a bunch of people

878
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,940
 to come and the people that come, you know, they're just there to investigate aliens.

879
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,980
 They're not there to cure your horrible diseases.

880
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,260
 But anyways, a bunch of people didn't come to the town.

881
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,460
 It didn't really start to take effect until after Roswell.

882
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,740
 That's when Aurora, people were digging up this old story back from 1897.

883
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:49,420
 The other thing about the debunking of it is that other people have investigated it

884
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,420
 since.

885
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:55,420
 Now this next part of the story happens from MUFON, which is the mutual UFO network.

886
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,180
 They basically are doing all these investigations.

887
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:04,220
 They teamed up with a television show called UFO Files and they go out to Aurora, Texas.

888
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,700
 They interview people and people who are still alive, they were kids back then, they're like,

889
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,820
 "Oh, I didn't directly see it but my parents, they talked about it all the time."

890
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,380
 This one person says, "I remember seeing the crash but I wasn't allowed to go to the debris,

891
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,940
 but my parents did and they said they saw the alien."

892
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,460
 Secondhand stories from much 80 year olds.

893
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,340
 People are still saying it's true.

894
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,620
 Now there's a plaque in town which says it's a legend, but the towns people were saying

895
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,980
 it was true.

896
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,580
 And MUFON and UFO Files, they found a gravestone marker that's all worn out.

897
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,260
 It's from 1897.

898
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,460
 Their investigation was in 2005, so this is more than 100 years.

899
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:45,180
 They find a gravestone marker that appears to have a picture of what looks like a flying

900
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,620
 saucer, but they can't be sure.

901
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,820
 It's just a weird image on this gravestone marker.

902
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:55,260
 And they have a metal detector and they detect metal in the grave.

903
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,980
 So they go to the people who run the cemetery and said, "Hey, we're from this UFO show.

904
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,260
 We think there's an alien in there.

905
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,260
 Can we dig up the grave?"

906
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,260
 And the cemetery people go, "Brains, brains."

907
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,580
 But the cemetery officials, the cemetery people, they're rotting underground.

908
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,740
 Cemetery officials say, "No, you can't do that."

909
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:18,620
 And then apparently or supposedly, whatever word we want to use here, when the MUFON crew

910
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:25,020
 went back to that site, the gravestone marker with the UFO symbol was gone.

911
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,380
 But they knew the general location.

912
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:33,660
 They said that they broke out their metal detector and it picked up nothing.

913
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,380
 They said that they ended up being like a little screw, like a little three inch pipe

914
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,220
 there, but it was picking up nothing.

915
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:45,660
 So the idea is that this alien was underground there.

916
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,700
 It was picking up the debris and then when they went back, the body was moved.

917
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,140
 The plaque was moved, the body was moved.

918
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,660
 That could be, it could also be that they are now at the wrong grave.

919
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,940
 They basically just showed up at a different location in the graveyard and they're like,

920
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,940
 "Oh no, where did it go?"

921
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,260
 And the real grave's over there.

922
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,220
 I mean, I don't think they're that stupid, but you've got to look at all these different

923
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,220
 options.

924
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,740
 They did, this was another thing, they did go test the well water.

925
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,420
 And the well water had high traces of aluminum.

926
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,740
 And when the ship crashed, they said, "You know, we don't know what material this is.

927
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,700
 It looks kind of space agey."

928
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,780
 But they figured it was some sort of aluminum alloy.

929
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:29,260
 So you know, you have these weird, all of this stuff can be explained away legit.

930
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:35,580
 Like you have old people basically arguing over what the truth is, but they're all 80

931
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,540
 years old or more.

932
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,540
 So how much are they actually remembering?

933
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:44,740
 I'm 43 and I keep forgetting whether or not I've taken my medicine for the day.

934
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:49,100
 So when I'm 86, I don't know if I'll remember whether or not an alien crash landed in my

935
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,260
 town.

936
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,900
 So we have all that stuff.

937
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,060
 So did an alien really crash in Aurora?

938
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,420
 Are these airships actually a legit phenomenon?

939
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,900
 Was it something that people were actually seeing or was it some sort of mass panic where

940
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,620
 people were looking up at the skies, they were concerned about the upcoming century?

941
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,340
 They were already hearing in the news about all these amazing technological advancements

942
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:18,540
 around the world and every cloud or misshaped object in the sky, that fat bird who was eating

943
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,500
 too many sardines flying around.

944
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,660
 Ah, so you have all that stuff that's going on.

945
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,980
 Was it that?

946
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:31,580
 Or was there a legitimate phenomenon of airships back in 1896, 1890?

947
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,100
 Why those two years as well?

948
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,340
 They kind of tapered off for quite a while.

949
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,540
 And if you picked the number four, you know the answer.

950
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:48,220
 Because you were that alien that crash landed in Aurora, Texas.

951
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,860
 And you all chopped up, your body's all mangled up.

952
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,620
 And then they bury you underground.

953
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,340
 And then they don't know that you have a healing factor.

954
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,020
 And then you wake up.

955
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,020
 Pitch darkness.

956
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,020
 You're like, what?

957
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,020
 This isn't my spaceship.

958
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,700
 And you start clawing at the wood.

959
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:15,060
 Ah, what is this space age material that have been surrounded in?

960
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,420
 Then you realize it's wood and you're like, oh, maybe I can dig my way out.

961
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,860
 And it also sucks because I'm an alien and I don't need oxygen to breathe.

962
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:27,740
 So I'm convening this box forever and you're like banging on the box.

963
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:31,420
 And then you also, you don't need food or water.

964
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:39,420
 So basically from 1897 to 2005, you're just underneath six feet of dirt.

965
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,220
 You're just like, let me out.

966
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,740
 It's been over 100 years.

967
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,820
 This sucks.

968
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,100
 Actually, you don't even know how long it's been because you don't have a watch.

969
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,660
 And maybe you have a good sense of internal time.

970
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,580
 But for over 100 years, you've just been clawing at wood.

971
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,380
 Also you don't have fingernails.

972
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,540
 So it's basically like nubs just rubbing on wood.

973
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,540
 You can never get out.

974
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,980
 There's too much dirt.

975
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,740
 And then you hear a bunch of nerds above you shuffling around.

976
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,500
 They're like, well, maybe with the coordinates.

977
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,740
 This looks like some sort of UFO.

978
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,020
 I wonder, let's break out the metal detector.

979
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,500
 You're like, yes, yes, nerds.

980
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,500
 Find me.

981
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,540
 Find me and release me from my dark grave.

982
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,540
 You're putting metal.

983
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,500
 You're like moving metal on top of you.

984
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,500
 Detect this.

985
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,500
 Hurry up.

986
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
 Detect this.

987
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,220
 You're the metal detector detecting stuff.

988
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,220
 And then you hear some cemetery officials come out and they're like, get off of here,

989
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,220
 nerds.

990
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,220
 Go away.

991
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,220
 Go away.

992
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,220
 Go away.

993
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,900
 And you're like, no, that was my only hope.

994
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:35,980
 And then a couple of days later, like these FBI agents show up and they're like, this

995
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,980
 is going on way too long.

996
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,980
 And they dig you up.

997
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:38,980
 They dig you up.

998
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,300
 You're like, huh, thank you.

999
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,780
 And you crawl out of the grave.

1000
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,140
 And then you're like, thank you, law enforcement officers.

1001
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,980
 I really appreciate it.

1002
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:54,260
 And then the moon hits your alien skin and you're immediately invigorated.

1003
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,260
 Yes.

1004
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,260
 Yes.

1005
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,740
 And then you got the FBI agents.

1006
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,140
 And you pull their guts out and they're like, what do we ever do to you?

1007
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,060
 We were your buddies.

1008
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,780
 We were going to put you in a cloning facility and cut your organs out, but now we're not

1009
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,940
 going to because you ripped our guts out.

1010
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,300
 We're going home and they leave and die.

1011
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,700
 And then you run off into the woods.

1012
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:24,540
 So if you pick number four, you are an alien hiding in the woods looking for revenge against

1013
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,300
 the humans who gave you proper burial.

1014
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,220
 They thought you were dead, but you weren't.

1015
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,980
 And they tormented you unknowingly in a dark grave.

1016
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,380
 So if you pick number four now, you travel America.

1017
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:44,860
 You're a backpacker who wears human flesh over your giant, giant gray alien head.

1018
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,740
 But nobody notices it.

1019
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:53,300
 You just have like human flesh and you accept rides from people and then you murder them.

1020
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,300
 And then that's it.

1021
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:01,900
 That's, that's, you're just a serial killer alien is what you become.

1022
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:07,340
 Which to be fair would be the best kind of serial killer there is.

1023
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,820
 Because think about it.

1024
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,140
 You, you want to leave fingerprints.

1025
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,660
 Anytime someone saw you doing something, they'd be like, yeah, I saw this guy was like dating

1026
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,820
 this chick for like three months and then she got like stabbed to death.

1027
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,940
 But he was also a three foot tall alien.

1028
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,420
 The cops would be like, what?

1029
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,620
 That's insane.

1030
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,140
 So it would be the perfect alibi because you'd be an alien.

1031
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,420
 You just take your skin off every time like the dude was looking at you and then you put

1032
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,420
 it back on for your girlfriend and turn it back around.

1033
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,220
 You could get away with so much amazing stuff.

1034
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,100
 I mean, not saying that being a serial killer is amazing.

1035
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,940
 But if you were a serial, if you had to be a serial killer, you might as well be an alien

1036
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,300
 serial killer and think about it.

1037
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,700
 Let's say they do catch you and they arrest you.

1038
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,260
 And you go to trial, you're found guilty.

1039
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:56,060
 They go to electrocute you in the electric chair right as they're strapping you down.

1040
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,460
 You pull out your little shrink, right?

1041
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,100
 Shrink the electric chair, put it in your pocket and then you just stand there.

1042
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,100
 And they're like, what happened to the electric chair?

1043
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,100
 And you're like, oh no.

1044
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,100
 I don't know.

1045
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,100
 I don't know.

1046
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,100
 It was like this when I came in here.

1047
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,180
 There was no electric chair.

1048
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:15,860
 So that is today's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

1049
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,460
 Very, very well played episode.

1050
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,660
 I'm sure you could tell.

1051
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:23,300
 But I really love doing this show and I hope you guys enjoy listening to it.

1052
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,660
 Actually all of you guys aren't listening to it anymore because you picked a number

1053
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,980
 and your fate has been sealed.

1054
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,660
 But to the people who didn't pick a number, I really, really appreciate it.

1055
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,660
 I hope you guys had fun.

1056
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,380
 I have so much fun doing this show and I really hope you guys do have a great day.

1057
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,420
 When I intro this show like that, 100% authentic.

1058
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,380
 I want you guys to have a great day.

1059
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,580

1062
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,460
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

1063
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,940
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

1064
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,740
 But I'm glad you listened to it today.

1065
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,740
 Have a great one, guys.

1066
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,740
 [music]

1067
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:08,900
 The ghost pepper has a reputation.

1068
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,500
 So does a ghost pepper wing that doesn't send you into tears make any sense?

1069
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,500
 Does to us.

1070
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,340
 That's why Popeye's ghost pepper wings are the perfect balance of flavor and fire.

1071
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:21,460
 Popeye starts with intensely cravable flavor, adds the right amount of kick to keep things

1072
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:27,260
 interesting, not inferno-ing, and then offers them at only $5 for six pieces.

1073
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,620
 Because in New Orleans, we like to taste our food.

1074
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,620
 Not cry over it.

1075
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,620
 Call us crazy.

1076
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,140
 Love that chicken from Popeye's.

1077
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,100
