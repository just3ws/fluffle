00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.780
 Somewhere in the vast wasteland of Alaska, a creature is waiting for you with

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.380
 an evil grin. And in the continental United States, is there a cryptid that

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.500
 defies all known physics? And then we travel to Cisco Grove, California, where a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 bow hunter had a unique experience with two aliens, a robot and a whole lot of

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 smoke. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.140
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's Friday.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.740
 It is the Friday episode. This week the episodes have been kind of coming out a

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.580
 little bit late. It's just a bit of anomaly. I've just been working doing a

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.220
 lot of stuff. So next week we should be coming out earlier. Let's go ahead and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.420
 think some of our newest patrons. Our newest patrons we have, took me a while to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 get the joke on this one actually, Chris P. Bacon. Chris, the middle initial P.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.900
 Bacon. Not his real name, but took me a second. Thank you Chris P. Bacon for

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.620
 supporting the show. We have CJ from the UK. Always like hearing from people with

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.820
 initials. So thank you CJ. CJ from San Andreas. Maybe this is actually that guy.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.700
 Dimensional merge. And then we have Al Marival. Al Marival. I don't know if Al

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.940
 is like a title like Alamein. Isn't that like a place in the Middle East? So you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.100
 might be the Marvel or your name could just be Al. I don't know, but either way

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.980
 Al, CJ and Chris, thank you so much for supporting the show. So let's go ahead and

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.020
 get started with the episode now. So the episode, we got these two little quick

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.380
 little bites, little nibbles of cryptids for you, because there's not a lot of

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.860
 info on them. But I kind of wanted to get them in there for the Friday show. In

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.380
 October, we're gonna have some spooky stuff, man. If you've noticed I haven't

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.340
 been doing a lot of ghost stories lately. Mm-hmm. Saving them up for Halloween

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.140
 month. And I also plan on doing some more Dead Rabbit Recommends, too, for

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.500
 spooky movies you can watch. You're like, "I'm waiting with bated breath and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.940
 telling me what type of garbage you want me to watch." He told me to watch. What was

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.940
 that one movie I recommended a long time ago about the haunted RV starring

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.740
 Denise Richards and Misha Barton? It wasn't called Creep Van. That was a

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.020
 different movie. Creep Van was good. Creep Van was about a creep van, you know,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.460
 those vans with no windows that murdered you. Not someone in the van

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.700
 murdered you, but if you got in the van, it ate you. And then it ended with a guy

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.700
 killing the guy who was driving the van or something like that, and then he gets

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.180
 possessed by the van. Trust me, it's actually a pretty good movie. You don't

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.060
 have to see it now because it told you the end of it. Yeah, it's called Creep Van.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.300
 It's a van that ate people or something like that. I don't remember. Anyways,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.900
 Dead Rabbit mildly recommends Creep Van. Okay, let's get started the story here.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.780
 Muah-ha-ha. I saw me laughing. That is the name of this cryptid, the Muah-ha-ha.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.100
 It's an Inuit legend. He's really kind of a creepy guy. He's a little, I don't know

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.260
 if he's a little, he's a normal sized blue-skinned dude. He's described as a

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.020
 starving native. So you imagine Eskimos as being, is that the actual term? Is that

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.820
 like a term someone made up? Inuit? They're basically like, you know, they're

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.700
 kind of like puffy people. They're a little chubby because they're up in the

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.380
 cold all the time. This is a starving version of that. So I guess just a man,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.620
 they're still humans. They're not Ewoks. I don't, okay, imagine a starving

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.500
 human. I should have said not, oh, you know one of those Inuits, one of those

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.740
 puffy people. Starving human, but blue-skinned, which would make sense because,

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.500
 you know, you're out in the cold and you're starving. The Muah-ha-ha will walk

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.500
 around. Obviously, he doesn't just, he wouldn't be a cool cryptid if he just

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.660
 laid in the corner. He walks around and his clothing is all like rotted and stuff

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.580
 like that. So he's like, I have to get to the gap. They have two for one for men's

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.620
 sweaters, but there's no gaps in Alaska. Except for the giant ice gaps that you

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.380
 fall through. And they refer to generally as chasms. And he has a huge evil grin on

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.900
 his face. So imagine you're in the middle of a snowstorm up in Alaska and you're

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.740
 just chilling, drinking some cocoa, drinking some hot chocolate. You're like,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.100
 this sucks. I hate the snow. I can't believe I came up here. My life is horrible.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.500
 But you're up there for whatever reason. You're on a business trip. You're trying

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.700
 to buy and sell snow. You're trying to find the purest snow in the, go to Columbia

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.900
 for that. But okay, whatever, whatever. So you're drinking your hot cocoa, you're in

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.940
 a ski lodge, and then you hear your dog barking outside. And then you go, that's

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.540
 weird. I didn't know I had a dog. But for the sake of the narrative, you do all

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.820
 of a sudden, Mandela effect. You go outside and you go to get your dog. And you

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.500
 see a blue-skinned, starving human in the darkness with an evil, evil grin. And

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.300
 then you turn and you look and you realize you can't run back to your lodge

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.620
 in time. The door's locked and you spilled hot cocoa on the door knob and if

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.380
 you touch it, it'll burn your hand. So you can't get back in your house. So you're

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.140
 like, okay, I got this little blue-crypted dude after me, right? What's gonna

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.820
 happen if you catch me, Jason? You put me in a no-win situation. It's actually

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.820
 kind of dope. Well, not dope because you die in the end, but he's a professional

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.940
 hunter, not a professional. He's obviously not a professional. He's starving to death.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.980
 But I mean, he's not catching enough food to not be a starving man. But anyways,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.420
 he's able to track you down through the woods. He's a hunter, not a

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.620
 professional hunter, not a very good hunter, but he will find you. But he

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.580
 doesn't eat you. What he does is, and we've seen this in other cryptid legends,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.540
 which is interesting, he tickles you to death. So you're running through the

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:23.180
 darkness and you're coming up behind you. Come on, Rover. Rover, help me in the dog.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.940
 You're like, oh wait, I don't have a dog. Why did I even leave my house in the first

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.460
 place? Mwahaha, jumps on top of you and starts tickling you and you're like,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.620
 oh that's not too bad. But he has razor sharp claws, so each time he tickles you

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.220
 little pieces of flesh go flying off your body. And you scream out into the

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.980
 dark Alaskan night, I hate snow and the way that I'm dying and the snow keeps

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.820
 falling. But then somewhere a dog's like, tricked another victim. That dog's

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.420
 a cryptid too. And the next day, this is another sign that someone's been

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.700
 killed by a Mwahaha. It's, I don't know if that's actually how you enunciate it, but

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:06.820
 it is spelled M-A-H-A-H-A. So anyways, when these bodies are found dead with all

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.260
 their skin torn off, they have frozen painful smiles. So basically like, I

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.700
 don't know why I just made the face. I'm doing a podcast and I just made the

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.380
 face of a painful smile. You know what a painful smile is. So like all good

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.380
 cryptids, my favorite part is how you defeat them. Usually they have stupid

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.900
 ways to defeat them. This one actually might be the most logical way to defeat

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.100
 a cryptid. It should be the way to defeat almost any cryptid. The C-M-W-H-A-H-A, and

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.660
 you're being chased by it, its one weakness is being kicked into a river. So

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.940
 while that would work for like Bigfoot or like a unicorn or Mothman if you

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.740
 like, were able to like, lasso down his wings, kick him into the river, that would

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.340
 work for almost any cryptid. How many rivers are there in Alaska? Like, isn't

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.420
 the water frozen? Like, do you just kick him onto ice and he just slides across

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.780
 the ice and then he just gets back up, starts coming back after you? How many

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:05.020
 raging rivers are actually in Alaska? I'm sure there's a few, because I'm sure like

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.420
 the Inuit people were fishing and stuff like that, but are there really enough

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:15.460
 that it's a viable option to kick a cryptid into? Like, is it like, there are

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.220
 they a bunch of them? Maybe there's some tributaries, maybe a few inlets, but are

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.700
 there really a lot of rivers? I don't know. I don't care. I'll never go there, not

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.860
 because of the moa-ha-ha, but because I hate snow. Let's go ahead and move on to

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.940
 our next bite-sized cryptid. This is a little cool one, and this one is actually

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:39.620
 recommendation from El Pato Reviews. El Pato Reviews, if you still listen to the

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.400
 show, he recommended this, I don't know, eight months ago. He's like, "Hey Jason, look

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.380
 into these guys." And I said, "I will. Thanks for watching the show." And then I

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.140
 did look into these, now I'm covering them, so thank you El Pato. This is also on

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.620
 the Conspiracy Theory Iceberg, oddly enough. It's about 10 sentences long, so

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.900
 here we go. So let's go to anywhere other than Alaska. These things probably

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.680
 exist in Alaska, but we don't want to be here anymore. We tape our flesh back on

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.380
 over our body, straight up like some Hellraiser nonsense, where I like duct

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.780
 taping our skin back on. And then as we're getting back to the Dead Rabbit

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.260
 Durgible, you realize that I purposely landed on a salt flat? You're like,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.320
 "There's no salt flats in Alaska and I'm just pushing you into the salt." You're

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.340
 like, "Ah, I hate this flat guys." And then I pick you up and I'm like, "Sorry dude,

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.660
 sorry, that wasn't really funny." So it's kind of funny. So we put you onto the

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.500
 Dead Rabbit Durgible and I'm just like eating salt licks the whole time and

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.360
 throwing them in the backseat. You're like, "Ah, we're gonna fly out from the

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.260
 Dead Rabbit Durgible, not like Superman. We're gonna get in the Dead Rabbit

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:47.860
 Durgible and fly out of Alaska. We're going to any town, USA." So because these

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.020
 are all over the place apparently or nowhere because nobody really knows

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.940
 about these guys or if they exist, which they most likely don't, but let's take a

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.300
 look at them. We're gonna land in a town square. It's a beautiful little town,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.500
 bunch of people walking around, kids got balloons, there's a corn dog festival,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.860
 mayors giving a speech, whatever. It's a town that you would see in a movie or in

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.860
 real life if you happen to live in a town that has corn dog festival and we're

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.100
 enjoying the corn dog festival. We're part of the corn dog eating contest. I'm

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.780
 in the corn dog contest. You are in the pretzel eating contest so you're getting

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.740
 salt all over yourself. You're like, "Ah, take me to the hospital." Anyways, the

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.980
 sun sets. I don't know why I didn't start this narrative often. I could have

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.700
 avoided all that. The sun sets. It's getting dark. We're walking through the

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.540
 forest, not the forest. We're walking through the park together. Maybe it's a

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.100
 forest. It doesn't matter. There's a forest in the next story. We're walking

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.860
 through the park together. I feel bad that you're all salty. I feel bad. So

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.420
 anyways, you can tell how bad I feel. We're walking through the park

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.780
 and we see a grove of trees out in the distance. I'm like, "Hey, look at those

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.740
 trees." They're not salt trees, are they? I'm like, "No, no, no. They're totally fine."

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.900
 Look at those trees. Do you see that? You're like, "What?" I'm like, "I think

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.700
 something moved over there." You're looking through the darkness. The sun's still a

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.740
 little up. So it's really hard to tell what's going on and then you see it. It

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:20.860
 looks like a tree with no leaves kind of move. Kind of take this weird action. And

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.020
 you're like, "Is this a tree-based cryptid? Did you bring me all the way out

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.220
 here to talk about a tree cryptid or did you just want to eat corn dogs?" And I'm

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.820
 like, "Well, I did want to eat corn dogs." But that's not a tree cryptid. What we're

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:39.620
 looking at is known as the Black Stick Man. Black Stick Man. And what they are

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.340
 is they are basically a very tall cryptid. And I know people are going to talk

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.180
 about the Russian video. I think that's pretty much fake, but it's most likely

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:54.060
 fake. But they're basically, imagine if a little kid drew a black stick man, but

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.820
 that stick figure became like 12 feet tall and was walking around your

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.940
 neighborhood. And it's funny because now that they think about it, this almost has

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.420
 an idea of the dimensional merge where maybe so many kids have drawn stick

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.100
 figures over the years. They've become real, like in some sort of sense of a

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.860
 tulpa, some sort of sense of a thought form. But that's basically what

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.820
 these things are. And they're two-dimensional. So if you're looking

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.780
 at them from the front, you can see them perfectly. But if you see them from, if

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.060
 you go to the side, they're invisible. They're two-dimensional. Once you try to

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.180
 observe them out of their flat dimension, they're totally invisible. They could be,

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.740
 you could be surrounded by black stick figures right now. You wouldn't know it.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.420
 They're just standing on the side of you perfectly still. Assume that there is a

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.540
 black stick man next to you, no matter where you're at. Go to the bathroom,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.140
 Black Stick Man. Getting married, Black Stick Man. Drawing a black stick man,

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.300
 oddly enough, no black stick man. But usually they're all around you. Now,

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.660
 there was some researcher named, some cryptozoologist named Mark Wolfgang

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.900
 Miller. And he said that he found one in Buford, Wyoming. And he stood within six

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.540
 feet of it. And he said it actually looked like a tree until he watched it

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.900
 move in a non-tree-like manner, was his quote. And he couldn't take a photo of it,

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.300
 because that's of course what we want, a photo of a stick figure. Gonna take a

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.020
 photo of it, because it looked too much like a tree. Now, that's a quote that's

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.980
 associated with Mr. Wolfgang Miller. But here's the thing. He is a real person,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.620
 but there's no proof that he was ever in Buford, Wyoming. I couldn't find any

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.620
 connection between him actually being in Buford, Wyoming. So I think they either

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.940
 took a real person and attached this story to him, or it's a real story that's

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.860
 so obscure I couldn't find a connection. I couldn't find like an article written

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.380
 about him visiting Buford, Wyoming or anything like that. And just when he thought

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:49.620
 it was odd enough, they apparently wear hats. They have top hats as well. But

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.860
 there's a debate within the Black Stick Man community. Some people believe that

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.300
 they actually have hats, that they have purchased hats somewhere from like a

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.660
 two-dimensional hat store, or the hats are just big lumps on their heads that

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.740
 are perfectly shaped like a top hat. The debate, people don't know. And a lot of

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:13.060
 people think this is just a hoax, that it's so foolish that it has to be made up.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.460
 Now, I think the probably the biggest giveaway that it might be made up is the

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.180
 idea of a two-dimensional object existing in a three-dimensional space. Kind of

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.140
 blows your mind to think you can turn and look and something's not there, but

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.100
 it's there. You just can't see it because it's only in two dimensions. That's not a

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.900
 deal-breaker for me. Honestly, a deal-breaker for me is the hats. That's a

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.980
 little too weird. I don't know why, but I again, do they perfectly have hat

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:44.700
 shaped heads, or are they buying hats? They couldn't buy hats because you couldn't

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.780
 like, where's their pockets for their money? Do they find the hats and turn them?

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.980
 What if these are real people? Ooh, Jason just came up with the conspiracy theory.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.700
 What if these are real people who have been turned into two-dimensional people

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:03.060
 and they brought their hats with them? They all had their hats with them. Like, if

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.020
 you wear a top hat, you're a chance of being accidentally teleported into a

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.700
 two-dimensional world is higher than if you were wearing a red baseball cap. That

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.780
 is why Fred Durst is still with us, but Charlie Chaplin isn't conspiracy theory.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:20.060
 Is Charlie Chaplin the everywhere to top hat? I think he wore a bowler. It doesn't

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.140
 matter. Let's move on to our next story. Our next story is an actual story. Our

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:30.940
 next story is an actual full fleshed-out narrative. It's not Jason talking

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.300
 about baby-crypted stories. Thank you again, no El Pato reviews. I did like

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:40.460
 research on that. There just wasn't a lot there. We're going to Cisco Grove. Now,

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.700
 Cisco Grove is in California and it's up like in the North. I think it's in

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.340
 Placer County, California, but it's this tiny little place. It's not a tiny little

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.420
 place. It's a forest. It's a Grove, at least. So anyways, let's go back to the year

00:15:52.420 --> 00:16:02.740
 1964. Vietnam War was raging, I think. The Vietnam War was either about to happen

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:10.380
 or currently going on and Charles Manson was alive. I think he was five years

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:16.940
 away from his stupid murder plot. I hate that story. I know that Quentin Tarantino

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.820
 did his movie, but you guys, I don't like serial killers in general.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:26.340
 He's not even a serial killer. They were like a mass. I think they killed

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.780
 like two groups of people. They were more like a spree killer or a mass killer.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:36.420
 That whole thing about Charles Manson is, whenever I'm talking to someone, this

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.980
 comes up a lot because of the type of stuff I talk about in podcasts. You know,

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.100
 paranormal, true crime, stuff like that. I've been having these conversations for a

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.980
 long time. At least, I don't, I hate serial killers. I think they're super

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.940
 tacky and ghost and all that stuff, but a lot of times I meet people and you can

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:58.860
 tell how into this stuff they are or how sane they are by who they talk about. So

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.820
 if I'm talking about, if I bring up true crime or something like that and someone's

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.060
 like, "Oh yeah, you know, like Charles Manson, you're a pleb. Like you are so

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.700
 surface level into true crime, but that also means you're just an idiot. Like if

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.300
 that's your go-to first serial killer, you're like, "Yeah, you've seen a couple

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.980
 of movies. You may have read Heltier Skeletons. You think he's cool and

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.460
 counterculture and you're kind of into it." That's whatever. You're an idiot. When I'm

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.220
 talking about true crime or I'm just bringing up like macabre stuff and

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.580
 someone goes, "Oh yeah, you know, like Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer." It's the same

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.980
 thing, but it's a little more like, "Okay, this person has a kind of a working

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.260
 knowledge of serial killers." So Charles Manson is the one that everybody knows.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.900
 Nowadays, everybody knows about Ted Bundy and he was pretty popular, but now

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.580
 people know a lot of details about them. But I'll be talking to someone and

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.740
 they'll be like, "Oh yeah, you know, Jeffrey Dahmer." Because I always bring up

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.740
 that common serial killers or cowards because they only kill women and old

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.180
 people and children. And people go with Jeffrey Dahmer, killed men, and I go, "Yeah,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.580
 he drugged them. He drugged them and then he drilled holes into their brain. Like

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.700
 he wasn't stalking these people through the streets of Chicago. Like a

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.700
 hunter would." Which is coming up in our next story, assuming that I can get to it.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.860
 But every show often I'll meet someone who I'll talk about true crime. And I

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.660
 guess it's my fault for bringing up true crime. It's not like a walk down the

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.460
 stream, be like, "Hi, my name is Jason Carpenter. What do you think about all

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.220
 those murders that took place?" No, you know, it just comes up in conversation.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.140
 People go, "What do you do?" I go, "I podcast and da-da-da-da." And this happened a

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.060
 lot. What type of books do you read? Oh, I read true crime books, da-da-da. When people

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:32.460
 start bringing up people like Starkweather or Coral, Dean Coral, those are

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:38.380
 really, like, I don't want to say unknown because they're fairly well known in the

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.900
 true crime community, but in the general populace, most people don't know Stark

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.340
 weather or Coral, especially if they know Coral because that guy was a sick

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.420
 monster. When people, if they're go-to first-year-old killer they want to talk

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.140
 about or that they've read a book recently on is Dean Coral, they got

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:59.580
 some problems. They got some serious problems. Again, I've read more about

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.780
 true crime than I have about UFOs, conspiracies, everything like that. I

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.260
 just don't like talking about it on the show. It's a downer. So why am I talking

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.540
 about it right now? I have no idea. Probably get edited out. I don't even know

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:15.700
 how I got on this subject. Oh yeah, the year is 1964, where it's September 4th,

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:21.540
 1964, we're in Cisco Grove, California. These three dudes, three buddies, are out

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:32.100
 bow hunting. It's a sound of an elk and or raincour monster getting shot with an

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.700
 arrow and falling down. We have Donald Shrum and then it's two buddies, Vincent

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:41.180
 Alvarez. And tell me this is an adult name. His other buddies name was Tim

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.940
 Trueblood. Pretty awesome. So Tim Trueblood, Vincent Alvarez, Vincent, well

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.620
 it's funny. Vincent Alvarez is a pretty dynamic name as well, but it's not as

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:56.580
 good as Tim Trueblood. But both of them are better than Donald Shrum. Donald

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:03.020
 Shrum. So anyways, Shrum and Trueblood and Alvarez are bow hunting in the

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.540
 middle of Cisco Grove. And they decide to go, it's getting dark and they decide to

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.300
 go their separate ways to track down these deer or elk or raincours that

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.220
 they're looking for. And they're gonna meet back up at the base camp probably

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.500
 tomorrow morning because it's getting really dark. If they can find their way

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.380
 back before, that's cool. But if they can't, they can just make camp. So Shrum

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.660
 is like, "I'm the star of this story. You guys go. I will find something to shoot

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:31.020
 with my arrow." So anyways, some time passes. Now Vincent is out hunting out in

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.060
 the woods too. And he sees a light kind of hovering over the forest off in the

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:42.700
 distance. He doesn't really think much of it. It's just an odd anomaly. He's like,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.620
 "Is that maybe a helicopter flying?" Because it was kind of far off. He's like,

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.860
 "Maybe a helicopter flying? I don't know." Atmospheric something? Who knows?

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:58.740
 All I know is I'm about to kill this deer. Another deer goes down. But Donald Shrum

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:04.020
 is deep in the forest as well. It's totally dark. It's 1964, so it's not like

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.220
 they have night vision goggles or drones or stuff like that. You just got the eyes

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:14.180
 God gave you and then the bow you bought from Sports Masters. So he's walking

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.980
 through the woods it's totally dark. He's like, "Listen, there's no way I'm gonna get

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.140
 it home." And then he turns around and realizes there's nobody there. He's talking

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:26.220
 to nobody. And he goes, "My life is so lonely. Maybe someday I'll find a Mrs.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:32.420
 Shrum to make my own." So before he can go off and find true love, he says, "I got

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.780
 to sleep. I got to go to sleep. So I can't sleep on the ground because there's

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.460
 like mountain lions and bears and stuff like that. And the ghost of deer and elk

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:44.860
 I've killed." So he has a special belt. It's not like a magical Harry Potter belt,

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.860
 but it is a belt that he can climb up a tree and attach it to the tree and then

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.380
 fall asleep like Katniss from the Hunger Games. And he's like, "Why did I make that

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.500
 reference? That movie doesn't exist, but it would probably be good. That movie was

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.260
 actually pretty good." But anyways, he climbs up the tree after having that

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.340
 weird conversation with himself. He's like, "Maybe I should write a series of young

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.700
 adult novels." He adjusts the belt and he falls asleep. Wait, no he doesn't. He

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.180
 adjusts the belt and he's in the tree. He doesn't fall asleep yet. And he's hanging

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.860
 out up there and he wants to fall asleep. But then he sees a light coming through

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:19.100
 the forest. And now he thinks, "Okay, my buddies probably got back to base camp.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.620
 They're probably worried about me because it's really late. They probably sent out

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.340
 a search party. So yay!" So he undoes the belt and starts shimmying down the tree and

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.980
 he lights these flares, which I guess old, timey flares. He had a light with a

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.300
 match. But anyways, he uses a match. He has a bunch of match. He has a lot of

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.220
 matches in the story. He lights a match, lights a couple flares, and he's like,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:44.340
 "Over here, guys! Over here! It's me, Donald Trump!" And then the light's like

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:50.220
 (mimics light) coming towards him and he goes, "Oh." And it's like a sphere. It's a

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:55.260
 glowing sphere. So he's like, "That is not a rescue helicopter." Or if it is, it's the

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.700
 coolest rescue helicopter ever, but he realizes it isn't. He starts to shimmy

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.820
 back up the tree, ties his belt back on, because he doesn't really know where to

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:08.200
 go. It's pitch dark. That is not a word. It's pitch black. He can't just go

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.020
 running through the forest. And right when he gets back up the tree, he's probably

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.300
 a good 12 feet up, 10-12 feet... Oh, dude, what if it's a black stick man? He climbs up

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.700
 a black stick man. He doesn't realize that it's there. Anyways, it's about 10-12

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.780
 feet up. There's no stick man, no hat. And that is when he sees these two little

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:32.540
 alien people. They're not moving furniture. They're not groaning. They're just doing

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.460
 like alien stuff. They're walking from between the trees and like walking up to

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.520
 his tree. And he's described them as short humanoids. But then he sees another

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.960
 humanoid as well, and he goes, "It's a robot. This is a robot dude coming out of

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.800
 the forest, and the light is still going *makes noise*" So the UFO. So he's looking down at

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.880
 three little humanoid type aliens. It doesn't really get into a lot of

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.920
 specifics, at least in the articles I read if they were like reptilian, or they

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.360
 were wearing suits. I've seen different drawings of these things, and they seem to

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.680
 be some sort of reptilian in a suit, but I couldn't find any definitive description

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.540
 of these guys. So just little aliens. Use your imagination. Use your imagination. So

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.620
 little aliens come out. There's a robot. A little mechanical dude walks out of the

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.860
 forest as well. And he's looking down at them, and they're looking up at him. And

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:23.820
 the two aliens walk up to the tree. They're looking up, and they start shaking

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:29.060
 the tree. *makes noise* Now they are making sounds like they are moving furniture.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:35.020
 *makes noise* And he's like, "Oh, this is not gonna be good. This sucks." And the tree's

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.280
 kind of wobble in a bit. He has this trusty belt on. And they keep shaking the

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:47.720
 tree, and then the robot *makes noise* gets underneath the tree, and then white smoke

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:53.800
 billows out of its mouth, basically. And when it reaches "Shrum," he passes out.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:25:02.480
 *makes noise* He wakes up a time later, and the aliens are still at the bottom of

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.240
 the tree, trying to figure out how to get him down. So he begins lighting matches

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:13.120
 and throwing them out of the aliens, right? *makes noise* That's the sound of a match

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:19.040
 falling. Does that sound good? Here's another one. *makes noise* I mean, I will admit

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.240
 those are probably the loudest matches you've ever heard, but it doesn't deter

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.320
 the aliens. Each time he throws a match down, they do kind of step out of the way.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.000
 But then they move closer to the tree, and it's like they're looking to see how to

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.160
 get him out. Lights another match. Then he realizes, wait a second, I have one of

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.760
 the best weapons ever invented by mankind that's been used for a hundred

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.720
 thousand years, or ten thousand years, doesn't matter. He pulls out his bow, gets

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:47.960
 an arrow, loads it, that's terminology right? He loads the arrow, and it hits the

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:53.120
 robot. *makes noise* Robot starts walking around, sparks shooting out of the robot.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.520
 Like a 1950s sci-fi movie, *makes noise* and sparks are shooting out of it. Just a little

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:03.760
 sparks. Wasn't super dramatic. And then the aliens go *makes noise* Another robot walks

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:10.240
 into the scene, *makes noise* releases some smoke.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:19.320
 Shrom passes out again. He wakes up again, and the aliens are climbing the tree.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:28.440
 *makes noise* Mouth, whatever mouth you imagined opened with the type of teeth you

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.680
 want them to be. And he's like, this is not gonna end well. This is not gonna end

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.600
 well. So he begins, and this actually is fairly ingenious, he begins ripping off

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.680
 pieces of his clothes and lighting them on fire and throwing them at the aliens.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.960
 And it is slowing down the aliens' advance. He sets his hat on fire, throws it

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.800
 out, and he's taking off pieces of his clothes he's throwing at him. It does slow

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.680
 their progress. He begins taking coins out of his pocket and throwing them at

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.120
 the aliens, which kind of stepped down from setting your clothes on fire. He's

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.720
 throwing coins at him. Then he starts grabbing branches and setting those on

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.680
 fire and throwing them at the aliens as well. And at that point the aliens, they

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.440
 are still trying to get him. But enough is enough. They call in yet another robot.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.240
 *makes noise* You get the sound effects. It merges with one of the previous robots.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.680
 Straight up some Transformers combiner stuff. And then black smoke pours out. I

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:29.240
 didn't tell you. The other smoke was white. This stuff is black. *makes noise* And he falls asleep again.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:38.720
 When he wakes up, the sun is coming up. It's dawn. All the aliens are gone. And the UFO

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.800
 left earlier. I forgot that detail too. The UFO left during this whole thing. The

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.720
 aliens stuck around. We're still trying to get him. But when he wakes up after the

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.960
 black smoke, all the aliens are gone. UFO is gone. It was already gone. And he is

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.520
 totally terrified, but he shimmies down the tree. Runs all the way back to base

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.920
 camp. He tells his buddies, "Now Vincent said, 'Oh yeah, I did see a light out in

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.840
 the forest.'" And Shrum's like, "Dude, you should have come. We totally could have

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.120
 fought these guys in." Alvarez is like, "Maybe if you were true blood I would

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:12.640
 have come." But for Shrum, sorry bro. Apparently they went back and they grabbed

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.580
 the arrows because he shot a couple arrows. He just hit the robot with one

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:20.880
 arrow. They took the arrows. The coins were gone. So they always figured the

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.280
 aliens took the coins with them. And eventually they did go and tell the

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.280
 Air Force what happened. They're like, "Air Force, Air Force, you won't believe

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.320
 what happened to us in Air Force." It's like, "Calm down, kids. Why don't you take a

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.360
 seat and tell me what you saw?" And they're like, "Air Force, so anyway." They tell the

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:43.600
 story. Supposedly the Air Force took possession of the arrows. And Shrum said,

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.940
 "It looked like you could see metal shavings on the arrow from where I hit

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.740
 the robot." Unless his eyes are made of microscopes, I doubt he was able to tell

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:57.060
 that. But apparently the Air Force takes the arrows. And then they tell Shrum

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.460
 that didn't happen. Like, here's what you might have seen. And Shrum said, "It was

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:06.180
 like they were giving me alternative alternatives." Like saying, "No, no, you

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:11.460
 didn't see that. You saw this." Right? And he says they gave him a couple

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.280
 different stories, but he actually never, supposedly, never changed his story. And

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.840
 he was offered money to, like, for the rights of his story. And he never sold the

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.360
 rights. He just tells it over and over again. So supposedly that adds a little

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.800
 credence to the story, which is possible. It's one of the stories that could be

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.120
 true, could not be true. I'm a little curious how many matches the dude had. How

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.040
 much clothes he had when he ran to Basecamp. I imagine him running back to

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.680
 Basecamp in like his underwear and a big tree belt. And being like, "Guys, you won't

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.640
 believe what happened to me last night." And they're like, "Where are your clothes?"

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.500
 And he's like, "No, no, aliens showed up." And then I was up in a tree and a bunch

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.380
 of smoke came out. And they're like, "No, no, no. Back up, back up. Where's your shirt,

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.180
 bro? Like, how much of his clothes did he burn? How many matches was he carrying?

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:59.220
 Those are quibbling things. But it's still important stuff when you're trying

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.260
 to look at the details of whether or not the story is true. So that's the story of

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:08.540
 the Cisco Grove encounter. And I want to end the week on that story. Because you

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:13.320
 might think that story is scary. He's up in the tree. It's all alone in the dark,

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.380
 dark forest. He's helpless. He's trapped in the trees. Aliens are trying to get him.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.280
 But I don't want you to take a message of fear. I want you to take a message of

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:28.800
 hope. Because although this story has all the hallmarks of a spooky story, it

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:35.880
 really tells the tale of a man who held off alien intruders armed with

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:44.100
 technology far beyond our own. With a stone-age weapon, fire, and a couple coins.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:52.500
 And if a man named Donald Shrum can hold off two aliens and three robots using

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:58.560
 nothing but those tools, then we should have nothing to fear from those so-called

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:04.780
 alien invaders. This story proves that humans are the best. Their little UFO is

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.220
 no match to a box of strike-anywhere matches. There was no way they were

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:13.600
 gonna catch this dude. So you have to go through life with that mentality. Whenever

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.280
 life puts an obstacle in your way, I want you to see that obstacle as two

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:24.880
 aliens and three robots. And you're a box of matches ready to take on the world.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:29.760
 Disclaimer, don't actually take on the world with a box of matches.
