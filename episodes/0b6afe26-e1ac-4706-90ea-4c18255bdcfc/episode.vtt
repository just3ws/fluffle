 For the end of season seven, just one story. And it might seem an odd

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.460
 departure from the normal episode, because it's also a follow-up episode. And now

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.060
 we go back to Bismarck one last time, to meet a man who was murdered in a

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.900
 mysterious way. Was he killed because he knew too much? What is his connection to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:07.300
 the other victims? And is this cult still out there? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:18.220
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.820
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.020
 This is the last episode of season seven. I'm going to take a week long break

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.460
 after this, but we're going to have some best of episodes next week, with short

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.880
 introductions from me explaining why I picked that particular episode. Also, the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.360
 art for this episode is a bit different. This is some fan art. TVP, VTU, made this

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.500
 art for me quite a long time ago. This is one of the flyers we have available for

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.380
 you to download to atdeadrabbit.com. Post them up around your town, your college,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.100
 coffee shops, wherever. Hope you get the word out about the show. I also want to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.220
 give a shout out to Stuart Meatball, who recently got banned from Facebook for 72

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.500
 hours for promoting this show so zealously that they gave him a 72-hour

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.380
 ban. We respect the fallen. Stuart, really, really appreciate you getting the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.340
 word out. And actually, it shows where our download numbers are increasing rapidly,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.460
 rapidly, rapidly, rapidly. So everyone who's out there getting the word out,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.540
 really, really appreciate it. We also actually have a new Patreon as well. New

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.900
 Patreon. I wanted to go ahead and, okay, and also this name is not safe for work, so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.660
 if you're listening to this, you can turn it down. Turn it down a little bit. There

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.820
 you go. Is that a good volume? Thank you so much for supporting the Patreon. Meat

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.220
 Hammer McDickfist. Thank you, Mr. Meat Hammer. Really, really appreciate it.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.980
 Any support will do. And if you can't support the Patreon, you can definitely

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.860
 put up flyers or spam Facebook like Stuart or anywhere in between. Just

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.460
 helping get the word out about the show is totally, totally awesome. Let's go

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.100
 ahead, though, and move on to our first story. Now, yesterday, I'm gonna give a

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.420
 real brief overview, but this is actually the first time I've ever done this on the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.340
 history of the show. I would actually recommend listening to yesterday's

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.380
 episode if you haven't heard it already to really appreciate this first story.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.620
 And I've never done that. I always plan the podcast to be pretty self-contained.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.700
 But yesterday, on episode 349, we talked about a string of missing people in

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.220
 Bismarck. We had Roy Hagel. He went missing in 1989 in Death Valley. He was

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.820
 headed, he was from Bismarck, North Dakota, and he was headed back to Bismarck,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.740
 North Dakota. We talked about Michelle Joulson. She disappeared in 1994, five

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.260
 years after Roy Hagel. She disappeared in Bismarck. And then we talked about

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.340
 Sandra Jacobson and her son, John Jacobson, five-year-old son, John Jacobson,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.020
 also disappeared in Bismarck. They were driving from center North Dakota, where

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.740
 she lived, to Bismarck, North Dakota. She called the police in Bismarck, saying

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.380
 that she witnessed a satanic ritual and she didn't trust the police in center. So

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.940
 she was calling the police in Bismarck, which is 40 miles away from center. Her

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.220
 mother lived in Bismarck. And then she gets to her mother's house. Her mother

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.140
 could tell there was something mentally wrong with her and she had a history of

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.460
 mental issues, was the terminology used. Her and her son disappeared that night.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.260
 That was in 1996. Never to be seen again. None of these people have ever been seen

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.500
 again. The one clue that was uniform between them, other than the fact that

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.460
 they all were related to Bismarck. They all lived in Bismarck at one point or

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.620
 another. One, two of them lived in Bismarck at the time. Sandra Jacobson had

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.500
 just recently moved away to center, but she was living in Bismarck and died or

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.700
 disappeared in Bismarck that night. The other clue that was all connected was the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.420
 biggest piece of evidence investigators had was a car left at a scene. Roy Hagel,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.660
 his car was in the desert, keys and wallet on the driver's side seat. Michelle

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.860
 Joulson, her car was found, no keys, no wallet. It was completely empty except for

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.140
 a half-eaten gas station sandwich. Sandra Jacobson and John Jacobson, their car was

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.460
 found at a beach near a pretty wild river. Keys and the ignition purse on the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:40.020
 seat. So there are some coincidences there most likely, right? But let's take a look

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.580
 at one more case. And there's two things that make this really, really creepy.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.860
 When I was researching this story, when I was researching this story, and I talked

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.820
 about this on last night's episode as well, I said, originally I was just going

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.500
 to do a story on Sandra Jacobson and her son John Jacobson. A creepy story about a

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.460
 mom possibly running away with her son, possibly committing suicide with her son,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.180
 possibly actually having run afoul of saint worshipers and after reporting it

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.660
 to the police went missing. Because she called them that night. She called them

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.100
 that night, the night she went missing. The police. But as I was researching the

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.780
 story of Sandra Jacobson, I was on a forum called Tapatok and there is a special

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.820
 part of this forum called Porchlight, which is dedicated to unsolved mysteries,

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.420
 people missing, things like that. Leaving the porch light on for this person to

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.940
 come home. That was the first time I saw that the Sandra Jacobson story could be

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.420
 related. That was actually the first time I ever heard of Roy Hagel or Michelle

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.020
 Juleson was reading that article. And I was like, there's a lot of similarities.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.980
 Someone wrote an article saying, these cases have gone 20 years without being

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.020
 solved. They're the three longest unsolved cases in Bismarck, North Dakota.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.900
 And I was like, okay, this is interesting. This is the first time I've come across

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.100
 this info. So the story built out from there originally was just a short story

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.540
 to start off an episode about a creepy disappearance. And I go, maybe there's

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.220
 more to this. The way I have my research notes set up, it's a little complicated.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.220
 But while I was getting my bookmark folders and everything, an article kept

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.780
 popping up that had no natural relationship to any of those other three

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.620
 disappearances. But I kept going, why is it in this folder? Why is it here?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:28.980
 And I read it over and I go, why is it here? Now I was skimming it.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.980
 That'll become apparent in a second. And so when I was prepping last night's

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.580
 story, I left it out because for about a week I was kind of putting stuff

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.700
 together on this one. Maybe about three days on yesterday's episode. And then

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.940
 today, after my Brazilian Jujutsu lesson, and actually that's worked out really

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.780
 good for the show. Because now Tuesday, Thursdays, I do Brazilian Jujutsu. I get

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.580
 totally amped up. We have a striking class right after it. We do some Mu Tai,

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.340
 striking for about a half hour. And then I go and sit in a coffee shop for three

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.740
 hours and just do research for the show. It's really benefited the stories that I

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.660
 think I've been able to bring. And it's benefited the layers of research I've

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.620
 been able to do. Another great thing from the Brazilian Jujutsu class, I recommend

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.060
 you guys getting involved in some sort of physical activity, you'll find it's

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.940
 very, very beneficial. But today I was looking, today I was looking through my

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.900
 notes. And that article came back up. I was cleaning up bookmarks. You're like,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:31.300
 "Jason, what article? What article are you talking about?" Bismarck, North Dakota.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:39.180
 November 16th, 1996. Sandra Jacobson and John Jacobson go missing. October 2nd,

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:46.420
 2005. There's a Bismarck man known as Laverne Nastrum. Now he's found in

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.740
 Tuttle, North Dakota. And that's about, I believe, if I remember correctly, about an

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:57.700
 hour away. A rancher is out checking his fence line, which sounds like a totally

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.660
 tedious job. And I'm sure it is. I bet being a rancher is one of the most

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.500
 boring jobs. It'd be a job that you'd really have to love your work. Being

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.020
 outside, playing with your dog, raising babe the pig, deciphering Charlotte's

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.620
 meaning in her webs, all of those things. But this particular day is super boring.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.060
 He was just checking the fence line. And he sees a car resting against his fence.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:26.540
 "Dag, nabbit!" Them damn hippies and them, their automobiles? What'd they do? And as

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.420
 he's walking out to see what's going on, because this is just sitting against the

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:37.020
 fence, he sees a body in the grass. And he's like, "Definitely, definitely hippies.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.660
 This guy must be taking a nap." But he can tell just where he's at. The dude's dead.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.660
 Calls the authorities. The police come out and they identify him as Laverne

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.460
 Nastrum. They're looking at this scene and they go, "Okay, here we have this guy

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:57.660
 dead on the ground, obviously hit by a car. Head damage, tire track, a comic

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.300
 whole tire track on his back, his stomach's flat. He's killed by this car.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.780
 This car that is 75 feet away and resting against this fence." Now these things

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.820
 happen. People get ran over by their own cars. I wouldn't say a lot, but it does

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.540
 happen. I remember once, I didn't get run over by my car, obviously I didn't die,

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.740
 but I remember once it was Christmas day, I was trying to get to my grandma's

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:26.300
 house, and my car broke down. And I got out and I was like, "No one would help me."

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.260
 And I was dressed up in my Christmas vest. I had a nice shirt on, tie, and all

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.980
 that stuff. There's all... and no pants, no shoes, nothing. Totally naked, but I had a

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.740
 shirt and tie on. My car is... I'm maybe two blocks from my grandma's house. My car

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.940
 dies. Now I've lived in this area for the past couple years. I visited it every

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.180
 summer. I knew this area like the back of my hand. So I go... I'm in the middle of a

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.180
 major intersection. This was Hazel and Greenback, if you know the area in

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.260
 Citrus Heights. Orangevale, technically at that point. I go, "Well, I'm gonna have

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.900
 to push my own car." Because no one's stopping for me. Everyone's a big old

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:06.580
 jerk today. Christmas. Thanks a lot. So I get out and I start pushing my car, and

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.540
 I'm pushing it basically by the steering wheel. Yes, I am an incredibly strong

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:16.500
 human being. And I'm pushing it, and I start to turn it, and I'm like... because I'm at a

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:23.740
 turn section, and I'm turning the car. And then I noticed something. That the car is

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:32.540
 moving faster than I'm pushing it. And then it dawns on me that even though I

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.860
 had lived in this area for the past four or five years and visited this area

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.700
 every summer and every Christmas, there is a pretty big hill on the corner of

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.820
 Greenback and Hazel. And I had never really realized it before. And so the car

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.860
 starts moving faster than I'm pushing it. Then the car begins to move faster than

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:56.340
 I can move. And I had to make a split decision. I could jump into the car, hit

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:06.260
 the brakes, and stop the car in its tracks. Or just let it go. And by the time I was

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.940
 realizing what I could do, my arms are already getting hyper extended. The car

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:18.220
 was moving far faster than me. So I just let it go. There's an old 88 dots and

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.340
 took my hands off the wheel and stood there. And I watch it go down this hill.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.340
 And I remember there was this realization because I'm thinking the road in

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.940
 front of it was completely empty. And then on the other side was incoming

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.220
 traffic. It's a four-lane road. And I'm watching this car go down this hill and

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.660
 I'm thinking, "Please keep going right. Please stay to the right. Please stay to

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:42.340
 the right." And it does. And it hits this giant metal pole in a parking lot and

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.620
 comes through a complete stop. And the second it hits the pole, probably about

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:53.220
 50 feet away to my left. I hear someone go, "Yee-haw!" Because it was a hick town. It

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.660
 still is a hick town, by the way. And I remember just being like, "Now again, I was

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:04.340
 in much better shape. I think I was like 22, 23." So I ran to my grandma's house. I

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.700
 was in really, really good shape when I was in college. Much stronger as well. I

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.740
 get to my grandma's house and say, "I just crashed my car." And then for the rest

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:19.820
 of the life of that car, it had a comically shaped. It looked like Bugs Bunny

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.100
 hit it with a mallet. Like there was a straight-up perfect U in the front of the

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.500
 car where it hit that pole so hard it just dug a hole in it. Now, I'm telling you

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:34.100
 that story because people can easily get killed by their own cars. If I had tried

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.700
 jumping into the car, I could have fallen underneath it. Or I could have not hit the

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.380
 brakes in time. Or the car still could have hit something and I would have been

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.420
 stuck in the car and not been able to control it. So I just let it go. But they

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.460
 also had that young actor. This is probably more apt story because this

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:54.060
 actually was more like what we're talking about. There was a dude in... He was the

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.500
 guy in the new Star Trek movie. He was Chekov and he was in that movie Green Room.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.900
 He got killed by his own car. Young actor. The brakes were faulty on it and the

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.220
 car was actually in the middle of a recall and he was like closing his gate

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.540
 of his private driveway. The car rolled down the hill and pinned him against the

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.300
 gate killed him. So these things do happen. So when the cops come out and they

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:23.700
 see this dude dead. It's a car 75 feet away. They immediately think... Maybe he was

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.020
 working on his car. Maybe the car broke down and like a jack went out or

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:32.220
 something like that and it rolled over him. Those explanations are quickly

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:38.620
 dismissed because they go to the car and the transmission of the car is set to

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.780
 park. Now no car is going to be so faulty that you put it in park and then

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.980
 it's going to roll 75 feet. I mean I guess if you had no transmission if it

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.740
 was just a cardboard box with a pee painted on it and he put it in that

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:59.460
 that could happen. But the police saw this and they go... He wasn't alone. There's no

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.580
 way this could have happened. And of course you know they obviously test the

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:10.220
 car and they go yeah this transmission works. What must have happened was he

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:18.060
 got hit by a car. His own car. Someone put the car in park after it

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:25.700
 rested against the fence. So what looked like an accident in the beginning they

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.060
 immediately go this is a homicide. This guy was murdered. Sheriff Doug Howard

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.380
 starts investigating this. This was an interesting quote I found from one of the

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:39.060
 only articles detailing this. Sheriff Doug Howard says we're considering this as a

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.580
 homicide and here's a quote from the actual like there's a passage from the

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:48.220
 actual article. We're considering this a homicide the sheriff said. When asked why

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:54.300
 he responded... Good question. And that's an interesting way to look... That's an

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.980
 interesting way to answer that because it could be he's saying yeah it is a good

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.500
 question why he was murdered. It could also be a thing like it is a good

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.100
 question why we're investigating this as a homicide. Is this a homicide? But it's

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.380
 very it's a very mysterious or it can be something even else. It's a very

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.580
 mysterious answer. But he does pursue it as a homicide investigation. This guy

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:23.660
 found in this field ran over by his own car that was then put into park. They go

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.660
 there had to be someone else out here with him. The farmer didn't do it. They

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:32.180
 investigate. They interview 50 people and again it's funny because it seems like

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.180
 it should have just been written. I think a lot of police departments would have

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.580
 just written it off as an accident and then the transmission must have been

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.220
 faulty. These things happen so on and so forth. They investigate 50 people over

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.700
 the course of years. They end up giving a couple people polygraphs. They start

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.420
 traveling to other parts of the state trying to figure out what happened with

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.340
 this guy. As of now there's a $5,000 reward still for any evidence leading to

00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.100
 the capture of whoever killed him. It's still being investigated as a homicide.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:06.820
 This is the only unsolved homicide in Kidder County which is where Tuttle, the

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:11.940
 city of Tuttle is. And it was like on a maintenance road that's very very rarely

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:17.100
 traveled. It's basically farmland. Now they're gonna look at a couple different

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:22.740
 things. One, who was Laverne Nastrum? He was a criminal. He was currently

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.940
 being investigated for meth possession or he'd recently been charged with

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:31.540
 meth possession. This is where we start to get into connections for

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:38.660
 yesterday's episode. He also was known for breaking into and he'd been charged

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.580
 multiple times for this. I think he was actually found guilty and on probation.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:47.860
 For breaking into abandoned farms in Kidder County. So you have a guy who's

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.780
 breaking into old farms looking for anything he can sell. Make a little

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:58.300
 money, buy a little meth. So when we're talking about a Coltac in Kidder County

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:04.260
 and where Center is, their Center and Tuttle are also about an hour away.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:10.260
 There's basically a triangle between Bismarck, Tuttle and Center. But so the

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:16.020
 idea of someone breaking into abandoned farms in the Tuttle area, we could

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.900
 extrapolate that he also, those are the ones he was caught for, he may have

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.700
 actually been breaking into farms near Center, North Dakota, where a woman says

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:30.420
 that she saw some a Colt activity, a ritual. Could it be possible that Laverne

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:36.020
 broke into a farm, saw something creepy, saw something he wasn't supposed to see?

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:43.860
 Was chased to Tuttle and then killed with his own car? Is it possible through his

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:49.700
 meth dealings? He got into something. We see a lot of connections between

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.180
 meth and peddamine use and Satan worshiping. And just so I'm

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.060
 more clear here too, when I'm talking about Satan worshipers, I'm not talking

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.740
 about like Church of Satan or Temple of Set, like legitimate organized

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.660
 religions that believe that the human self is greater than any sort of outside

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.980
 force, they reject God, Satan is just a marketing gimmick or an image that they

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.020
 use to kind of like push people's buttons, really it's about worshiping the

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.700
 self and hedonism. I'm not talking about that type of legitimate religion. I'm

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:23.620
 talking about what you basically like child sacrifice, human sacrifice, Colt

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.940
 activity that's based around worshiping some sort of dark God. I'm not talking

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.700
 about like Anton Leves, just so we're clear on that because I've been using the

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.980
 term Satan worshiping a lot over the past few days and I wanted to make that

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.340
 distinction. I've made that distinction in the past but I wanted to make it again.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:46.500
 So you have this guy who, but saying that we do see a lot of cross

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:52.020
 contamination between people who do meth and people who believe in really dark

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:57.460
 things and people who worship really dark things because the meth is rotting

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:05.060
 their brain, really. And so we have this guy, no one meth user, no one person

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:10.340
 who's breaking into abandoned farms. He may have come across some secret ritual,

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:16.740
 he may have been part of a secret ritual, he's connected to the three other

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:22.580
 incidents that I just recently went over and went over yesterday. By a key fact,

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:31.700
 again we have the car as the key piece of evidence. He's in the ignition, an empty car.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:39.940
 All four of these cases, we have a car as a key piece of evidence. And you go,

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:46.180
 "Jason, that's a bit of a stretch." This guy was in total, he was from Bismarck,

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:52.580
 but he was in total at the time. Yes, a car ran him over that someone else was

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.100
 probably there because somebody would have had to put it in part. The car worked normally when

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:03.220
 the police tested it. So yes, you have four cases where a car is a key piece of evidence,

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:13.060
 but that's still a bit of a stretch. Sandra Jacobson and her son, John, disappeared in 1996.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:24.820
 But Sandra Jacobson had two children, John Jacobson and Spencer Nastrum, Laverne's son.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:32.100
 Laverne and Sharon Jacobson were married. They divorced three months before she disappeared.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:39.540
 They lived in Bismarck together. She leaves him to go to center North Dakota.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:46.260
 And then while driving back to Bismarck, she calls the police and says she saw a satanic ritual.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:55.380
 She goes missing that night. What would you do if your ex-wife and the mother of your son

00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:01.620
 went missing? Now, of course, someone can make a joke about ex-wives and stuff like that, but...

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:07.380
 The fact that she made the call saying that there was a satanic ritual in center North Dakota,

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.140
 that was common news at the time and made the story very evocative.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:20.020
 Is it possible that Laverne began investigating the disappearance of his ex-wife and the mother of

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:25.780
 his son? Is it possible he was involved in her disappearance in the first place?

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:35.860
 We'll never know, because all the answers to those questions died in a field in Tuttle, North Dakota.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:42.500
 Five victims. Four empty cars.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:52.260
 One city and long stretches of nothingness between these towns that may hold even more clues

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:57.380
 that is satanic cults operating in North Dakota.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:04.820
 What's interesting too about this whole thing? So let me go back to how I discovered it. I know I

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.860
 kind of ended it dramatically there, but let me go back to how I discovered this connection.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:15.300
 Like I said, I had this bookmark about Laverne Nastrum in my folder,

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:21.620
 and I thought, why is it with these? And I was skimming it. I've been, as I was preparing the

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:27.380
 episode yesterday, I go, why is this article here? When I was rereading today, I saw clearly that this

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.420
 guy was from Bismarck, and I thought, whoa, why didn't I pick up on that? That's not the supernatural

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:37.300
 part, this is me skimming stuff. But I read the Laverne article, and it never mentioned once

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:43.620
 that his ex-wife had gone missing with the young boy years earlier, not once. Well, that's weird.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:49.380
 And then I started thinking, how did I know, like how did I know to save this article? I had come

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:56.260
 across the Reddit post a while back that was talking about Sandra Jacobson and John Jacobson,

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:01.540
 and in it it said, Sandra Jacobson's older son is still alive, but oddly enough, his father was

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:08.420
 murdered years later. No name of the father. I had to search the name of the son, Spencer Nastrum,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:13.460
 found that article about the father, bookmarked it, forgot the correlation.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:18.580
 But see, when I was trying to connect it to, when I was like, there has to be a reason why this was

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:26.420
 saved in the same area as the Sandra Jacobson stuff, if you typed in Sandra Jacobson Laverne Nastrum,

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:31.620
 nothing pops up on the first page. You figure it should be, bam, it should be, but nothing pops

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:38.980
 up on the first page. You'll get something on the second page halfway down, a website called Tapatoc,

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:44.980
 the porch light forum. So again, the way I found out about the three missing people being connected

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:52.340
 in the first place, the porch light forum sent me to an article written in 2008, 2008,

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:57.860
 after the murder of Laverne, and that article didn't even connect them.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:03.620
 Most of these articles are dead links. When you'll read this thing on the porch light forum,

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:08.100
 you'll click a link, it'll take you to a page that doesn't exist anymore. This news is purged

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:13.220
 out of the system. Now that sounds like a conspiracy theory, obviously, someone's going in hacking the

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.780
 net, but these are newspapers, and a lot of times newspapers, especially back in the day,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.300
 they would purge out old articles. You're not getting a lot of hits, what's the point of having

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:27.620
 the article up there? They have copies of it. As of now, really, the only places that you can find

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:37.460
 a connection between Laverne Nastrum and Sandra Jacobson is a Reddit thread, the porch light

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:44.660
 forum, and this podcast. Even though every article about Laverne should talk about Sandra,

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.780
 because both cases are so bizarre, why aren't other people making these connections?

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:57.540
 Why is it just ordinary people online? The fact that the connections aren't being made

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:02.100
 makes me think one of two things. There really is no connection other than the fact that his

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:07.460
 ex-wife disappeared a couple years before in a mysterious way, and the other two missing cases

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.460
 have nothing to do with each other, everything. The only thing that's in common is that victims

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:19.060
 are from the same city, and they all involve cars in some way. Or that the cases are connected and

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:27.060
 someone's actively covering up the connections. I'll be honest, I hate doing episodes like this.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:32.980
 Absolutely despise them. And it's funny because I hate them even more before I go on break.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.900
 And the reason why I hate them is every so often I do a story where I think,

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.900
 this is true. And not in the sense, I've done stories where I've had experiences of supernatural

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.460
 creatures and stuff like that, and I know that's true. And I've done stories where I believe that

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.300
 the story is true in a sense, but it's like some goblin jump through someone's window. And I'm not

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.180
 worried about a goblin jump through- whooo! No, I'm just joking, did I get you? I can do stuff like

00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:02.420
 that on the season finale. I'm not worried about a goblin jump through my window, but when I do an

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:09.140
 episode that is about like a government conspiracy or a cult conspiracy, and then I'm like, "See you

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:17.780
 guys in a week!" It always makes me nervous. Now, I'm in Oregon. This stories take place in North

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:25.780
 Dakota. It's 14 years later after this guy gets ran over by his car. It's most likely a string of

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:35.860
 coincidences. So I should sleep safely at night. But I do walk a lot. And there's three things I

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:45.220
 worry about when I'm walking. Rabbit dogs, rabbit homeless people, and cars. So if something happens

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:53.300
 to me this week on vacation, if I don't come back to do the podcast, if I am knocked down or killed

00:27:53.300 --> 00:28:00.900
 in a mysterious hit and run, if the plates of the car show that it came from North Dakota,

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:11.780
 avenge me, dear listener. Avenge me. That's not gonna happen. I'll be back next week.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.660
 Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is gonna be our email address. You can also hit us up at
