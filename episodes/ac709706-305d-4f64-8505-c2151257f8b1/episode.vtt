00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360

 hosted by myself and Jess Halaak.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.400

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.320
 "Horrible Decisions," and "Big Facts" for one day only, okay?

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.920

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.400
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.920
 What would you do if you were walking around

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.800
 your backyard with your teeny, tiny puppy

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.480
 and then all of a sudden, a UFO appeared?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.200
 (mimics UFO noises)

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.840
 And then we take a look at the world of children.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 If you're listening to this,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.080
 you were a child once, so full of life,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.300
 so full of love, so full of fear of the dark.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.300
 But what happens when your fears become reality?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.880
 (upbeat music)

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.880
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.640
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.840
 you're doing.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.900
 Summer has started, so once again,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 I am recording an episode late at night

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.540
 hoping to beat the heat.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.860
 He says, as I'm already stuck to this chair

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.060
 that I'm sitting in, I have a metal folding chair.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.140
 That's, I've been recording this podcast

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020
 for the past five years.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.700
 And a folding chair from Walmart.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.180
 But someone who's more valuable

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.820
 than any plain old folding chair from Walmart,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.700
 if anything, they're a lazy boy recliner

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.220
 as our newest Patreon supporter.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.980
 Everyone give it up for Juan Gina Spirit.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.100
 Woo hoo, yeah, wee!

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.780
 Yeah, floating in like a ghost,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 floating in like the ghost of a lazy boy chair.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.440
 Woo, that's pretty cool.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.640
 Don't try sitting in it, you'll fall right through.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.960
 Juan the Gina Spirit, you're gonna be our captain,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.960
 our pilot of this episode.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.320
 If you guys can't support the Patreon,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.360
 and totally understand it, just help spread the word

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.920
 about Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.000
 That helps out so much.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.280
 Tell your friends, tell your family,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.160
 tell everyone you know that you love the show.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.280
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.540
 How did I never realize that right before?

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.900
 But if it rhymes, it's true, that's what they say.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.700
 Juan the Gina Spirit, let's go ahead

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.700
 and get this party started.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.020
 I'm gonna toss you the keys for a new vehicle.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.180
 I just came up with this.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.740
 Juan Gina Spirit, I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.220
 and toss you the keys to the Bunny Byplane.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.700
 Let's all hop on, boy, it's gonna be

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.660
 the same sound effect as a jet.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.140
 It's gonna be a little bit slower.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.620
 Let's all hop on board the Bunny Byplane.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.880
 Juan Gina, go ahead and spin that propeller.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.360
 (imitates propeller)

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.280
 And fly us all the way out to Florida.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 (imitates propeller)

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.200
 We're flying around all the way out to Florida.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.800
 It's June 13th, 1998.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.520
 It's summertime.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.760
 The world's grooving down to third eye blind.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.940
 If you're cool, matchbox 20, if you're lame.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.060
 Hit television shows like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.540
 and "Deep Space Nine" still fill the airwaves with laughter.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.100
 We're like, oh, look at all those people

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.920
 who've been devoured by aliens and vampires

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.580
 on a crossover episode.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.840
 What a good chuckle.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.600
 1998, what a year, what a year.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.200
 But we're not here to reminisce

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.540
 over how amazing 1998 was.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.540
 We're here to hang out with a woman named Mrs. Kinston.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.700
 June 13th, 1998 in Miami, Florida.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.860
 It's late at night.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.900
 Well, not super late, but later

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.180
 then you may want to be handling chores.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.020
 (imitates propeller)

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.740
 Oh, teeny, teeny, my puppy.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.860
 Ms. Kinston says as she's stroking its neck.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.460
 What do you want now?

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.740
 (imitates propeller)

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.780
 Oh, you want to go outside?

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.100
 I can tell.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.100
 I can tell because you're peeing all over the floor.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.340
 Probably should have let you outside a couple minutes ago.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.740
 Teeny, let's head on outside.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.100
 So Mrs. Kinston and her dog named Teeny

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.220
 go out into the backyard.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.380
 Everything's fine.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.860
 They're just having fun in the backyard.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.580
 She's all rolling around in the grass with them.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.020
 She's like, I should have been doing this my entire life.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.460
 This is so fun.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.640
 They're having fun.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.620
 But then all of a sudden they hear a loud whistling sound

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.620
 and a gust of air rips through the area.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.460
 Whoa.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.860
 (sighs)

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.500
 And that wasn't bad enough.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.740
 It's actually not that bad really to think about it.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.620
 It's just called the wind.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.660
 Well, the whistling sound might be a little annoying

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.900
 depending on how loud it is,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.380
 but if that wasn't okay enough,

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.380
 all of a sudden...

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.380
 (imitates propeller)

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:18.180
 A UFO, a flying saucer, descends from the night sky.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.740
 And is now hovering about 30 feet

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.340
 over Mrs. Kinston's backyard.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.500
 Teeny, do you see that, Teeny?

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.220
 That's one of them flying saucers.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.420
 She probably said we don't have any quotes.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.340
 I'm assuming she said something like that.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.020
 I'm assuming she sounded like Edith Bunker as well.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.340
 Teeny, look.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.900
 She doesn't say how big it is,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.340
 but these things can be around 30 feet long,

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.380
 30 feet in diameter.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.020
 It's hovering over her yard

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.620
 when suddenly,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.820
 a reptilian alien materializes underneath the UFO.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.060
 Like he got beamed down.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.340
 And he's standing there on the cold Florida soil

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.460
 or grass, depending on how well maintained

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.460
 her backyard was.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.420
 If you're an avid listener, dead rabbit radio,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.580
 I want you to pay attention to a couple of the details

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.420
 of this story.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.180
 I want you to stop doing the dishes.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.820
 Put down that gardening hoe

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.580
 because there's some interesting parallels

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.460
 to a story I covered really recently.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.580
 I just came across these two stories completely randomly.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.260
 This reptilian alien materializes like straight up sci-fi.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.660
 I mean, look at the UFO.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.860
 It's a reptilian alien.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.340
 Everything about him is sci-fi.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.700
 You could have a fork and you're like,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.500
 "Wow, is that a light speed fork?"

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.380
 And he's like, "Nope."

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.940
 But it's made out of alien metals.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.540
 You're like, "Wow."

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.180
 This alien reptilian appears in a,

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.020
 he's beamed down.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.020
 He's materialized onto the ground

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.860
 and teeny is like, "I'm outta here.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.980
 "I'm outta here."

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.540
 He takes off and he runs into the house.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.340
 Now that's the right thing to do

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.180
 if you encounter a reptilian alien.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.300
 Gray aliens, depending on the story,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.740
 they may be your friend

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.540
 or they may dissect you while you're still alive

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.340
 and then put you back together and wipe your memories.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.260
 But reptilians are almost always a hostile force.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.100
 Not all the time.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.940
 There might be one or two stories we've covered

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.700
 where they're like shaking hands with people

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.180
 and not ripping their limbs off.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.460
 But generally speaking, you probably should run away.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.140
 You probably should run away from most,

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.300
 if not all, alien encounters.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.740
 Teeny's smart enough to take off running into the house.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.140
 Now Mrs. Kingston, she's smart too,

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.180
 but the alien has other plans for her.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.420
 She's terrified and right before she can begin to run,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.140
 she said the reptilian's eyes lit up

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.580
 and she was frozen in place.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:07.620
 Mrs. Kingston said that she felt like a cold chill

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.540
 all over her body and she couldn't move.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.260
 She was completely frozen in place

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.700
 and she couldn't even scream.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.700
 She's kinda stuck there.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.620
 It would be kinda weird if you were able to free someone

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.620
 and you're like, you stay there

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.820
 and then the person's just like,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.820
 "Ah!"

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.020
 Just like screaming the whole time.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.060
 "Ah, somebody help me, yeah!"

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.980
 Aliens are like, "Oh, we should probably perfect

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.340
 "this technology to, I don't know,

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.940
 freeze their vocal cords as well.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.700
 "They keep alerting others to help them."

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.860
 She's completely frozen.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.860
 She can't even scream.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.860
 And at that point, the reptilian is kinda like,

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.220
 "Okay, first part of my job is done.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.940
 "Now it's on to phase two."

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.740
 And she notices that the reptilian is wearing a backpack.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.620
 And he begins kinda looking around on the ground

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.340
 and as far as she can tell,

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.580
 picking stuff up at random

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.020
 and putting it into his backpack,

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.340
 she's frozen this entire time.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.100
 I'm assuming her bladder is frozen as well.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.740
 She's not peeing constantly during this whole encounter.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.020
 He's looking around and he seems to be picking

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.100
 just normal stuff up, rocks, probably a snail, right?

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.740
 He can't get away, freezes it, just in case.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.980
 Picks it up, throws it in his suitcase,

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.060
 throws another rock in there.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.300
 He's like, "I'm sure it'll survive it."

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.300
 And then she'll on it.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.460
 He's picking stuff up at random.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.500
 Sorry, should we can tell, right?

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.860
 I'm sure the alien had a purpose of what he was picking up

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.540
 and he's putting it into his backpack

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.300
 and then all of a sudden, Teenie comes running out of the house.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.100
 Teenie in a burst of courage.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.940
 Decides to take on this alien invader.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.500
 Now, Teenie, we don't know the breed of the dog.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.780
 I will make a guess.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.020
 It's tiny, it's a tiny dog, I'm just gonna guess.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.100
 But its name is Teenie,

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.620
 unless it's one of those ironic names

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.500
 like when you call a big guy slim.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.420
 But Teenie, I'm assuming, is a diminutive dog.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:06.420
 He runs out of the house, he sees his mama frozen

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.460
 and he's gonna save the day

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.500
 and he begins barking and running at full speed

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.860
 towards the reptilian.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.740
 At this point, you know, his attention is on the rocks.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.260
 His attention is looking down on the ground,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.220
 he's picking stuff up.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.580
 He's not expecting this tiny dog to come after him.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.140
 Teenie is running straight towards this reptilian invader

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.740
 from another world.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.920
 And the reptilian turns and looks at Teenie.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.300
 And Teenie, whoof, whoof, whoof, whoof, whoof,

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.140
 is running and barking and headed right towards this alien

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.900
 and in a single motion,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:45.180
 the reptilian grabs Teenie, picks him up

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.700
 and swallows him whole.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.540
 Gulp.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:55.580
 There's no word on if Mrs. Kingston saw a little paws

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.540
 kicking its way down its throat.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.100
 She's probably too terrified to remember that

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.640
 or if she doesn't remember it to wanna mention it.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.600
 He swallowed a Teenie in a single gulp.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.580
 Now, if you were terrified before,

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.580
 this would be off the scale, right?

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.560
 If you're already scared, alien shows up,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.940
 freezes you in place and then he's like picking up rocks,

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.620
 picking up popsicle sticks and stuff,

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.260
 garbage in your backyard, like, hey, thanks.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.200
 I was supposed to do that tomorrow for my chores, thank you.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.920
 If you saw an alien,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.740
 or really anything, really anything on the planet Earth,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.220
 swallow your dog in one gulp.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.660
 Your fear level is going to go through the roof

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.980
 and that's exactly what happened

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.940
 but Mrs. Kingston is frozen, she can't do anything.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.220
 You'd wonder, am I next?

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.380
 Is he gonna swallow me?

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.460
 I'm bigger than a dog,

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.580
 is he gonna take three or four gulps?

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.100
 And my next, well, what happened was after the alien

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.220
 swallowed the dog, swallowed Teenie whole,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.520
 he then just kind of like looked around a bit

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.520
 and walked back underneath his UFO

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.240
 and (mimics flying)

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.600
 de-materialized, he got beamed back up into the ship

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.320
 and then the flying saucer flew off,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.200
 disappearing into the night sky.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.440
 I found this story on ThinkAboutDogs.com,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.440
 they got it from an author named Thiago Luis T'Chetti.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.300
 He is a UFO researcher, he's a UFO author,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.400
 he writes a lot of books about this stuff.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.820
 It was interesting, ThinkAboutDogs.com

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.060
 very rarely adds notes.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.300
 They added a note to this story,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.780
 they said I wasn't able to locate such a witness

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.940
 so I guess they tried,

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.620
 I guess they were going through the phone book

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.060
 looking at people in Florida named Mrs. Kingston.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.400
 I would guess that she moved, I would guess that

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.840
 if you were ever in any place

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.380
 where a reptilian alien came down,

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.780
 scoured your backyard, froze you in place,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.560
 then ate your dog in a single gulp

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.660
 and I keep kind of hammering that point home

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.280
 because that is spookier.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.560
 That is spookier, if someone, if he ripped the dog in two

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.840
 and was like, oh that's enough for my mouth,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.320
 now I was chewing, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.860
 He's holding the bloody iron quarter of a dog,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.260
 he's spinning around and then he goes,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.140
 ah, mm, seconds, ha, ha, ha, ha, nom, nom, nom.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.700
 That's disgusting and probably a little over the top

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.740
 for all you dog lovers out there.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.180
 But it would be less creepy, I would argue.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.980
 I would argue that there's a difference

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.260
 between being ripped in half and chewed up

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.980
 because then like if someone ate you,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.340
 imagine you were tasting your,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.760
 are you gonna get into that creepy, boring stuff?

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.200
 You're gonna start talking about, okay,

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.960
 so imagine if you got eaten,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.480
 but they were eating you like you would eat a steak, right?

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.600
 So they like start with your head,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.840
 that's how you normally eat a steak,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.480
 you're like, where's the cow, where's the cow,

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.640
 I need an appetizer, take a bite out of his bowl brains.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.960
 If someone like picked me up and started chomping on me,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.220
 nom, nom, nom, like if they started biting my sides,

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.780
 I'd be like, chewing blood everywhere,

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.380
 I'd be making a big old mess.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.980
 And if they bit my head off,

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.900
 then they chew my brain up and then I lose consciousness

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.380
 and I don't care what happens to me after that point

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.340
 'cause my brain's dead.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:40.220
 But it's worse to get swallowed whole

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.260
 because then first off, it must be like super tight

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.220
 going down someone's esophagus.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.460
 And in this case, it would clearly be the giant

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.920
 from Jack and the Beanstalk,

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.040
 there's nothing on earth that can eat me whole,

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.620
 but maybe a hippo.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.900
 You'd be like going down this tight esophagus

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.200
 and you'd probably be like trying to grab onto the sides,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.560
 you're trying to grab onto the sides

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.280
 to prevent you from falling in.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.080
 And then you're like stuck in his throat,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.280
 he's like, oh, he's all choking,

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.280
 you're all punching his windpipe, he's like, ah.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.400
 We are going down this tight esophagus

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.200
 and then you know what's gonna happen.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.500
 I mean, teeny doesn't understand biology,

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.700
 but you know that there's a bunch of stomach acid below you.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.260
 So as much as you're kind of stuck in this esophagus

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.500
 and you're trying to wiggle your way back up,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.780
 unless you have like a pocket knife

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.740
 and you can like cut handles into his esophagus,

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.260
 you're cutting gills into him,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.740
 he's just slide out of his neck.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.420
 You're gonna fall into stomach acid

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.420
 and you're gonna be like, ah, burning, ah.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.300
 And it would be horrific.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.200
 And you'd probably fall feet first.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.320
 So you're just standing in stomach acid

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.400
 and you're slowly melting and then you could go,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.800
 okay, this is gonna take a while,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.920
 this is gonna take a while, he eats some tums,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.840
 some giant tums, he's like, oh yes,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.720
 I like to slow down my digestion when I eat a human.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.440
 You're just kind of standing in stomach acid,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.040
 you would have to make a decision.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.960
 You know eventually that your legs are gonna dissolve

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.920
 and then it's just gonna be,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.240
 you're gonna be standing on skeleton legs

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.400
 and then you're gonna fall on your butt

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.960
 and then it'll be sitting in stomach acid

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.380
 and then like your waist,

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.440
 it takes you, you become a cartoon character,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.400
 if your legs dissolve, you've bled to death.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.480
 Well, what if you're just standing there,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.760
 you're in lower half of the skeleton,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.160
 you're like, ah, this is pretty painful.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.600
 But my thing is, would you,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.360
 if you were standing in a puddle of it

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.280
 or like a stomach of acid,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.240
 would you, like you're just standing up in it

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.120
 and you can feel it dissolving,

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.640
 this actually was not what I planned on talking about.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.660
 I have a really interesting connection to a past story,

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.240
 but you're like, yeah, Jayce,

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.520
 he told us to pay attention.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.480
 Now, I forgot what you were originally talking about.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.560
 Now you're talking about being eaten by a giant

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.660
 from a fairy tale.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.400
 If you were standing in stomach acid,

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.840
 I'm not telling you what this is,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.440
 if you're standing in stomach acid

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.200
 and it was slowly dissolving your legs,

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.400
 would you drown yourself in the acid

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.840
 just to get it over with?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.640
 Would you be like, okay, this is gonna take like hours

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.760
 and the whole time it's just flakes of skin

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.800
 are gonna be like flying off of my legs

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.640
 and I'm gonna be like, ah, screaming, would you say,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.720
 you know what, I'm just gonna lay down in the acid,

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.400
 I'm gonna put my head in

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.520
 and let my head dissolve first

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.920
 and just get it over with.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.200
 'Cause there's no way out of here.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.480
 You might be able to try crawling through his butt hole.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.560
 You may wanna try that first, actually.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.960
 I probably should have done that

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.720
 before I melted my eyeballs.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.480
 You're like, okay, you stick your head

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.840
 in your whole face melts, you're like,

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.240
 that plan didn't work, my brain is still functional

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.400
 and I can't see where I'm going.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.480
 Would you, if you were in a giant puddle of acid,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.480
 would you kill yourself quicker by laying down in it?

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.960
 It's terrifying to be swallowed whole,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.800
 but here's the interesting thing.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.720
 Recently, like maybe like two weeks ago,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.160
 it hasn't been that long at all.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.040
 Yeah, it was episode 1073, The Hunting Party.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.760
 This is so fascinating, 'cause I did not

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.040
 put these two stories together in any way, shape, or form.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.640
 I found them at different times.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.760
 We covered a story just a couple of weeks ago

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.960
 and it took place, if I remember correctly,

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.960
 it was 1968, a UFO containing reptilian aliens landed in,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:33.600
 it was Colorado, I don't remember the exact name

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.360
 of the city, it was a uranium mining town.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.640
 The aliens probably saw it glowing from space,

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.480
 they're like, let's go check that place out.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.400
 This alien craft landed and a little girl woke up

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.880
 in the middle of the night, the rest of her family

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.320
 was knocked out like some sort of knockout drug

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.720
 or ray or whatever, she couldn't rouse

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.800
 the other people in the house, the dog was barking

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.820
 in that story.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:03.400
 She looks at her window, she sees a flying saucer land,

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.960
 with landing gear and a stairway came out of it

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.040
 and the reptilians walked down off the stairway,

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.040
 which in that episode I go, isn't that interesting

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.240
 how you could have sci-fi technology futuristic

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.720
 as far as we're concerned in technology,

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.880
 but then it still requires landing gears

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.440
 and a gangplank, like a little ladder you see

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.240
 come out of an airplane.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.800
 So that was an interesting detail.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.920
 And I have not encountered this before with reptilians,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.640
 I think we've encountered them with other alien races,

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.000
 but in that story, these reptilians got off the UFO,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.840
 they were all wearing backpacks,

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.480
 which again was a detail I noted in that,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.560
 I was like, that's so weird,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.640
 I haven't come across it before these reptilians come off,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.800
 they had backpacks, they also were carrying bows,

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:57.920
 which again is like one of the most primitive weapons

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.160
 that mankind, I mean, it's served us well over the 10,000 years

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.800
 it's been around, but it's been around for that long.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.520
 The bow, it's funny now that I say that I wonder,

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.000
 'cause they never used it in the story,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.320
 I wonder if it was an actual like a bow like functions for us,

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.000
 or if it was some sort of other device

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.360
 that looked like a bow, we don't know,

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.360
 but you have these reptilians get off this UFO,

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.320
 the dog was freaking out,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.240
 and they were looking around for something.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.760
 And the reason why I called the episode,

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.200
 the hunting party was because they were carrying these bows,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.400
 but we don't know what they were here for,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.400
 the little girl tried waking her mom up,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.440
 and then they both ended up falling asleep anyways.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.360
 It's a really interesting episode,

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.760
 especially the way that story ends,

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.320
 but when I came across this story,

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.240
 I was like, okay, there's some really interesting things

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.240
 about this, and I don't wanna go on too long,

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.100
 even though I go on at length about being digested by a giant.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.960
 Think about it, these two stories

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.040
 are about 30 years apart.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.920
 Like timeline wise, right?

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.760
 We have the stories reported in 1968,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.280
 the stories reported in 1998,

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.540
 two different stories, two different states.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:07.080
 In third, this is gonna sound totally weird,

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.400
 but like everything else on the show,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.520
 within 30 year time period is it possible

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.240
 that these reptilians,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.720
 this could be a particular offshoot

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.000
 of the reptilian civilization,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.680
 they could be considered mainstream reptilian civilization.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.120
 We don't know, but it's so interesting

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.760
 to think within 30 years,

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.120
 they went from having flying saucers

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.200
 that needed landing gear and a staircase

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.360
 to pop out of it, like an airplane,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.100
 like a commercial jet,

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.100
 to being able to materialize and dematerialize.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.440
 The ship didn't even land in this story,

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.640
 it was hovering over the ground,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.960
 the reptilian just appeared underneath it,

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.480
 and started walking around.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:54.160
 So it's, I mean, is there a technological tree

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.000
 within our lifetime?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.080
 You think about what's happened in technology

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.960
 on earth between 1968 and 1998, it's staggering, right?

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.960
 We started seeing from punch card computers

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.840
 to personal computers in your home,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.200
 the beginnings of the internet, all this stuff,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.240
 CDs versus eight tracks,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.360
 and it's within just a 30 year time span,

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.120
 we had these really big advancements,

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.480
 even though they're mostly in the form of entertainment,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.120
 we did have these things.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.280
 Within that same time period,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.280
 it's 20, 'cause in a lot of UFO reports from the '50s,

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.040
 they do talk about landing gear,

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.360
 they do talk about the UFO sitting on the ground

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.600
 with the little legs coming out of it,

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.400
 and this more modern UFO report,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.000
 it never touches the ground,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.240
 the alien beams down all a star trek,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.280
 starts walking around.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:52.440
 So that's a really interesting idea, right?

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.840
 Because I think we have this thought that the aliens,

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.280
 they're so much more advanced than us,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.880
 their advancements have stopped.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.800
 They already have UFOs, what else do they need?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.200
 They already have this ability to freeze people in place

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.080
 and to do all of these things,

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.920
 but is it possible that they're also continually

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.120
 advancing their tech as well?

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.760
 Because of these two, so, and the reason why,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.880
 we cover a lot of reptilian stories,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.400
 we cover a lot of reptilian stories,

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.440
 and I'm not connecting,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.240
 I normally don't make all these connections,

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.000
 the fact that they both have the backpack,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.280
 which again, we've covered aliens wearing weird suits before,

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.680
 but reptilians with backpacks is such a unique detail,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.440
 and I called it out in that first episode,

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.200
 and then last week I came across this one,

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.560
 and a totally different website,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.440
 the first one was from Phantoms and Monsters,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.720
 this one's the thing about a dog,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.560
 30 years apart, two different witnesses,

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.600
 two different states, what in the world

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.760
 that idea of a reptilian?

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.160
 Because they're more war-like,

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.440
 they're considered a more war-like,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.240
 more brutal alien race,

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.240
 and I'm not saying you can't be brutal with a backpack,

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.240
 but the backpack does kind of make you think

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.400
 an explorer, a scientist,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.240
 but just the idea of reptilians,

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.160
 sometimes they'll wear an insignia,

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.400
 very rarely, right, they're usually nude,

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.640
 they're usually these giant nude reptilian creatures,

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.880
 same thing with the great aliens,

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.000
 there's debate over if the great aliens are nude,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.720
 or if that's some sort of space suit they're wearing,

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.880
 but fascinating connection,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.440
 you have these two aliens, reptilians,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.160
 they're both wearing the backpack,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.320
 they both have flying saucers,

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.520
 but 30 years apart,

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.920
 the flying saucer technology acts differently.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:35.240
 If the first story had the UFO floating there,

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.400
 and a guy beaming down,

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.240
 and the second story had the landing gears,

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.840
 you would go, oh, you know,

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.080
 it's maybe the second guy,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.240
 maybe the guy with the landing gears

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.960
 needed to skimp a little bit on his UFO,

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.960
 he didn't have a good credit rating,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.760
 but the fact that we have them 30 years apart

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.840
 and the futuristic one,

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.560
 the more modern one I guess I should say,

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.480
 has more futuristic technology,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.720
 just interesting, really interesting way to look at

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.560
 the world of aliens, the world of paranormal,

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.600
 that constant advancement, is it happening?

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.520
 Are they getting better tech?

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.900
 Who knows, really, really cool story.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.360
 Juan, Gina, Spirit, I'm gonna go ahead

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.160
 and toss you the keys of the carbonar copter,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.840
 we are leaving behind Florida,

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.560
 fly us all the way out, too.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.480
 The little boys' bedroom.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.320
 (imitates gunshot)

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:30.000
 Recently I did an episode about a shadow man

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.360
 who folded up a dude in a bed,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.520
 turning him into a human burrito.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.960
 He didn't eat him, that was not a four episode.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.840
 And in that same episode,

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.600
 I talked about this thing called the empty spot,

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.480
 it was a place in this kitchen,

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.720
 these people lived in this house

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.160
 and there is a place in the kitchen

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.440
 where when you walked by it,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.320
 you felt like almost like a pull on your stomach,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.360
 like you were going down a roller coaster.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.480
 And one day the dad dropped his phone

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.080
 over the empty spot and it disappeared.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.040
 And it went missing for like a year,

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.520
 maybe a longer, and then it reappeared

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.120
 when they heard it hit the ground.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.680
 It was a really interesting story.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.280
 I thought, Mason, long time,

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.320
 Patreon supporter of the show,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.840
 long time just general supporter of the show,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.000
 was talking about it on the Patreon Discord

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.640
 and he goes, that was a really cool combination

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.120
 of like childhood fears, just kind of like wrapped up,

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.580
 kind of wrapped up like a delicious burrito,

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.240
 delicious human burrito.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.160
 It's funny 'cause I didn't think about that going in.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.720
 I mean, maybe I don't have fears of turning into a burrito,

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.080
 that might be a Mason thing,

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.360
 he's like, ah, my two worst fears, losing my phone

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.800
 and being folded up in a mattress.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.000
 But I thought that was interesting

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.720
 and it did make me think, I bet you,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.520
 that I can find some other childhood experiences.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.760
 These are some weird ones,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.360
 and they vary on level of creepiness.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.560
 We're gonna start off by meeting this kid named Phillip.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.880
 Phillip, he goes, when I was a little kid,

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.640
 I had this reoccurring dream,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.920
 where he goes, I had this dream over 10 times

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.840
 throughout my childhood.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.480
 He goes, I was in my house

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:07.160
 and there was a gorilla in the house

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.520
 and this gorilla would begin chasing me

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.960
 through my own home.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.440
 (gibberish)

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.000
 I guess, well, how does a gorilla sound again?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.400
 (gibberish)

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.480
 Phillip's running through the house,

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.600
 this gorilla's in the hot pursuit

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.720
 and the dream went in the same way every single time.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.280
 In one of the back bedrooms,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.360
 there was this large storage closet

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.960
 and Phillip would throw the door open

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.200
 and there would be a toilet in the storage closet.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.880
 Now, in real life, there is no toilet there,

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.960
 it's just a storage closet,

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.760
 but in the dreams, every time we opened that door,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.960
 there was a toilet there

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.040
 and right before this gorilla could wrap its beefy hands

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.800
 around this young boy's neck,

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.360
 Phillip would jump into the toilet

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.960
 and go down the drain.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.800
 (gibberish)

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.720
 I'm thinking, you'd be saying,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.680
 we're like, okay, I know where this journey ends.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.640
 Puddles full of poop, but Phillip would wake up.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.800
 That is the way he would get away from the gorilla.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.640
 No matter what happened,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.320
 if the gorilla was in hot pursuit,

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.240
 chasing with you through the house,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.480
 Phillip had to get to that storage closet

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.720
 where there was this toilet.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.800
 He would jump in and flesh himself to safety.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.720
 And like I said, he had this dream

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.920
 more than 10 times throughout his childhood.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.200
 Also, that toilet never existed.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.040
 Like he was, he's like, oh man,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.960
 I really gotta go to the bathroom.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.880
 He's like, I know where I'll go, the storage closet.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.080
 He opens up the door, he's like, I forgot.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.000
 That was just the realm of this

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.120
 subliminal poop in his pants.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.920
 Around the time Phillip turned 18,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.360
 his parents had decided to sell the house.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.040
 And you know, it's time to move on.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.620
 Kid, Phillip's probably going away somewhere.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.240
 Gonna sell the house.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.280
 And he said, when they were getting ready

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.760
 to sell the house, they made a decision.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.880
 (laughs)

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.160
 He released the gorilla into the house.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.560
 They were, this will attract buyers, right?

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.560
 Everyone loves having their face ripped off.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.120
 They made a decision.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.840
 They went and, you know, to increase the property value,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.800
 they turn in that back bedroom,

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.800
 they turned the storage closet into a bathroom.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:29.640
 So now there was a toilet back there.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.980
 Oh, here's the thing.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.640
 Is that story creepy?

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.000
 Not really.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.160
 Now I'm thinking of, I have a dreams episode coming up.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.920
 Probably should have saved it for that.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.120
 I'm sorry about dreams that come true,

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.920
 not like you won the lottery,

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.800
 but like people who had weird dreams

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.160
 and then the dreams ended up being real.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.760
 I should have saved it for that episode,

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.320
 but I think it still kind of fits

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.120
 into this one because technically it's creepy.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.280
 Imagine if he had dreamt something else.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.480
 He dreamt, he's like running from the gorilla.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.280
 He goes in there, it's a wood shop full of hanging hay hooks

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.600
 and he's like dodging them

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.520
 and the gorilla gets stuck on them.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.120
 And then he wakes up.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.280
 And then when he turns 18,

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:26.200
 his dad says, "Hey son, I got a secret to share with you.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.040
 "Come in this storage closet,"

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.240
 and Phillip walks in there

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.480
 and there's a bunch of hay hooks.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.560
 And he's like, "Dad, what?

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.400
 "What's your secret?"

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.240
 "What's your secret?"

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.080
 And he's like, "Dad's starting a chainsaw."

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.640
 It's your secret that you love hay hooks,

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.560
 you love sharp objects,

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.560
 and the dad's cutting them.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.360
 (laughing)

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.000
 The dad's cutting them with a chainsaw.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.600
 Phillip's like, "You haven't told me the secret yet.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.280
 "It's blood, corn, shooting everywhere."

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.560
 Dad, come on, what's your secret?

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.320
 What if the dad was a serial killer?

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.160
 (laughing)

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.000
 He's like chasing it.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.840
 He didn't.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.840
 That didn't happen.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.080
 You can't say,

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.000
 "I'm gonna tell you a creepy story."

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.200
 Jason, you cannot say,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.640
 "You're gonna tell me a creepy childhood story.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.640
 "Tell me a mundane story at best."

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.960
 And then say, "Well, it could have been a serial killer."

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.960
 That's not how that works.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.000
 Okay, so I probably should have saved that,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.480
 but let's keep going.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.680
 I have this other story.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.520
 Two more.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.040
 Oh no.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.360
 Jason, did you take Ben at drill before this episode as well?

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.520
 I'm recording it at night.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.720
 I have to go to bed right after this.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.200
 So yeah, it must have allergies, Audelina.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.360
 The next story he came across,

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.600
 all of all these show notes from Jason,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.680
 I'm not gonna check them.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.920
 Wow, I wanna know more about that bad toilet story.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.800
 I wanna know more about that bathroom story.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.080
 Wow, Jason.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.880
 I hope you put it in the show notes.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.720
 Let's go ahead.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.880
 We're gonna go over to this other dude's house.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.640
 We're gonna call him Michael.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.480
 We don't have locations for any of these stories

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.220
 or real names, unfortunately.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.080
 We're about to meet this kid named Michael,

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.920
 and he said when I was a little kid, it was Christmas Eve.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.880
 It was late one night.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.240
 Everyone's asleep in the house,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.400
 but Michael is woken up to the sound

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.880
 of Christmas presents unwrapping.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.520
 I mean, that's pretty sensitive hearing.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.000
 Who is this daredevil?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.360
 Like what, was that a bow I heard unravel?

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.160
 Roused me out of my deep sleep.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.280
 He wakes up a year as Christmas presents being unwrapped.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.440
 He probably figures it's someone else in the house, you know?

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.560
 Getting an early start.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.280
 He wants an early start, so he sneaks out of bed

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.000
 and he walks into the living room

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.320
 where all of the Christmas presents

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.040
 are positioned around the tree.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.800
 And when Michael walks into the room,

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.600
 there's a little boy sitting in front of the presents.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.520
 He's just sitting there.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.200
 And Michael says he kind of froze.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.920
 He doesn't know who this kid is.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.760
 And the kid in front of the Christmas tree

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.960
 turns his head and stares directly at Michael.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:07.760
 And then the boy, the boy sitting in front

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.440
 of this Christmas tree slowly floats away.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.000
 And disappears from sight.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.040
 He goes, he had never seen the kid before or since.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.720
 He had no idea who this was.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.040
 But on Christmas Eve, he heard,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.560
 it's a creepy ghost story,

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.240
 more creepy than the toilet one,

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.720
 unless you're afraid of gorillas.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.200
 Because again, it's that abstract nature of the paranormal.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.080
 He didn't come down.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.000
 If he had come down and seen the ghost

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.280
 unwrapping the presents, that's a little,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.160
 I mean, it's still, you'd still pee your pants,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.000
 but if you saw the ghost like actively doing something

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.120
 and being like, oh, I hope this is the wooden horse.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.440
 The headmistress promised me,

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.800
 you haven't such a good orphan this year.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.120
 And then he turned and elliptic you and floated away.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.700
 It's still terrifying, but it makes a little more sense.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.880
 But if you hear the sound of an activity,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.040
 in this case, presents being unwrapped,

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.140
 and then you walk in and you see a kid

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:06.080
 sitting there motionless, no presents have been unwrapped.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.560
 How does that work?

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.420
 How does that work?

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.800
 It's such a, it's creepy, the imagery is creepy, right?

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.480
 This poor little kid just wants a Christmas,

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.160
 but he's a ghost, he's flown away.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.960
 It would be creepier to hear the noise,

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.480
 but to not see the action and not see the result of it.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.820
 As well, none of the presents were unwrapped.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.980
 The boy wasn't doing anything,

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.220
 but the sound of the presents being unwrapped.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.020
 And it's interesting too, if you think about it.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.380
 I made the joke at the beginning, how did he hear it?

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.540
 'Cause that's kind of a quiet thing

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.380
 unless you're really going to town on him.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.380
 Maybe the sound was like projected to him

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.140
 for whatever reason.

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.620
 Like again, with ghosts, there's,

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.380
 ghost physics is such an interesting thing.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.800
 It doesn't get talked about enough.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.280
 That's why I kind of dwell on it.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.080
 'Cause I just find that angle of paranoia,

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.200
 it just doesn't, maybe it's not sexy enough for researchers,

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.440
 but I find it absolutely fascinating.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.640
 We got one more story here we're gonna take a look at.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.640
 Let's go meet another young boy named Silas,

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.360
 again, fake name.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.960
 He said when he was about six or seven years old,

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.760
 he woke up in the middle of the night

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.640
 and had to use his bathroom.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.220
 But he doesn't wanna get out of bed.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.500
 Not 'cause he's like lazy or nothing,

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.100
 but because he's terrified.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.020
 He all of a sudden, he doesn't say whether

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.340
 or not this is a normal fear he has,

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.420
 but definitely in this moment, he was afraid that something,

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.300
 terribly afraid something was going to get him

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.300
 once he got out of bed.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.860
 Now that's a normal childhood fear.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.620
 So I'm assuming this is just something he dealt with,

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.620
 but he goes, "I worked up the courage

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.180
 "and I hopped out of bed."

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.420
 (sighs)

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.540
 Hmm, it's nothing, okay.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.320
 Totally fine, totally fine.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.960
 The growing wet stain on his pajamas say otherwise.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.120
 But he finally makes it into the bathroom,

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.120
 walks down the hallway, goes to the bathroom,

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.360
 shuts off the bathroom line,

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.360
 and when he steps out of the bathroom back into the hallway,

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:13.400
 he sees a truly terrifying sight.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.320
 Materializing out of the wall.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.320
 It's like reaching right out of the wall is a arm.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:28.360
 And he goes, "I looked down at it,

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.380
 "and to this day, I could tell you everything about it.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.720
 "I could tell you everything.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.820
 "I could totally describe this arm to you."

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.040
 And he goes, "A lot of people said it's a dream.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.280
 "My parents said it was a dream."

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.780
 Definitely when I told them about it,

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.820
 when I jumped into bed in just a few moments.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.260
 And he goes, "In my mind, I think it has to be a dream, right?

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.180
 "It has to be a dream.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.900
 "But I've never had a dream where I can remember

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.060
 "all of these details."

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.800
 And he goes, "I don't think it was a dream.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.260
 "Cause I had just gone to the bathroom.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.660
 "I got up, walked to the bathroom, went to the bathroom,

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.940
 "and came out, but this is what I saw.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.120
 "This arm reached out of the wall.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:09.780
 "It was a big hand with long, skinny fingers.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:17.820
 "The flesh on the hand looked to be real.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.940
 "Rawning.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:24.060
 "Looked as if it was decomposing

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.820
 "as it was coming out of the wall."

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:31.420
 He said, "It was a pale, dead, decomposing hand

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.420
 "reaching out.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.020
 "But it's not just the hand."

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.900
 He goes, "I could see the wrist.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.660
 "I could see part of the forearm."

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.500
 He said, "It was wearing what looked like

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.300
 "a white button-up sleeve shirt."

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.500
 So you know, like the shirts you wear

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.300
 when you go to a job interview or whatever

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.540
 to make it look like you're not a slob.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.500
 He said it was like that.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.060
 He goes, "It was a shirt, it was a long sleeve button-up shirt."

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.020
 He goes, "But the sleeve was rolled back a bit."

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.860
 It was unbuttoned at the cuff

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.820
 and it was rolled back a little bit.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:08.820
 And in what might be one of the most bizarre details,

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.540
 one of the most bizarre details

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.220
 when you're talking about an arm

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.940
 manifesting through a wall,

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.620
 you think, we did a whole story about phantom hands,

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.820
 these hands that were chasing around children in Mexico.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.580
 It's a very popular boogeyman-esque story over there,

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.040
 possibly a real phenomenon.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.900
 You think hand reaching out of a wall,

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:35.300
 monster hand gobbling hand, ghost hand, zombie hand,

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.900
 those all make sense in this world,

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.000
 this paranormal world that we live in,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.380
 monster under your bed,

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.580
 boogeyman in your closet, all of this.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.460
 This hand is reaching out of the wall.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.380
 It's a big hand with long, skinny fingers.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.260
 It looks like it's wearing a shirt

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.220
 that's rolled up a bit and that's the cuff's undone.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:02.100
 And, so bizarre,

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:06.540
 and it was wearing a watch.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.980
 So that, again, sometimes it's those small details

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.540
 that really, what is this?

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.820
 What is it?

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.880
 You have to start asking all sorts of questions

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.300
 and the first thing that pops in my head

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.420
 is do ghosts even wear watches?

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.460
 Have we had enough ghost accounts?

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.580
 'Cause we'll often describe the clothes that they're wearing.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.820
 But a ghost with a watch,

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.980
 I mean, honestly, it's bizarre to think about.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.020
 You kind of chuckle and you go,

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.100
 "Well, of course they would have a watch."

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.940
 I mean, if you dye it and you believe the ghosts

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.620
 are wearing the clothes, dah, dah, dah, dah.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.260
 But a watch is a symbol of the limitations of reality.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.520
 It's a measurement of time.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:59.940
 I'm sure there are ghost stories about, I'm sure,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.260
 I can't think of any of them at the time I had,

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.780
 but I'm sure there are ghost stories, not a ton,

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:08.140
 but a few about a ghost who always had a gold pocket watch.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.780
 Like an old-timey Civil War ghost,

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.060
 always had a gold pocket watch.

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.660
 And the ghosts is still seen with the pocket watch.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.300
 They may say the ghost,

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.500
 that he was known to be a meticulous timekeeper

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.020
 and now even in death, he'll turn the watch and look at it.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.220
 I would argue that that would be

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.860
 what we call a residual haunting.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.660
 It's not a ghost, it's not a soul you can interact with.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.620
 It's a recording of an event.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.540
 He put so much energy into obsessing over his watch

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.180
 that he left a little bit of it behind.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.700
 In the right area, under the right conditions,

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.380
 it can leave an after image.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.140
 A lot of ghosts are that.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.220
 They're not the ghosts that you can actually talk to,

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.740
 interact with, or really have to be afraid of.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.180
 A ghost with a watch, and I don't,

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.780
 we don't know what this is.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.660
 And the story's not over yet either.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.740
 But we don't know what this is.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.380
 Why would a goblin need a watch?

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.380
 Why would any sort of entity, creature need a watch?

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.140
 I can't think of a ghost wearing a wristwatch

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.860
 because again, it's a limiting factor.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.860
 It would be a reminder of what to a entity.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.380
 It's just fascinating detail, right?

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.620
 What is, why is this, whatever it has, has a watch.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.980
 Now, you go Jason, he's walking out of the bathroom.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.460
 He's six or seven years old.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.620
 He just woke him in the middle of the night.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.780
 He shed enough of the bathroom light.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.900
 We'll assume the hall lights on

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.820
 because he seems to be a bit of a scaredy cat.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.860
 It turns out he had good reason to be.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.660
 There's a whole arm appearing

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.860
 or most of an arm appearing out of the wall.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.740
 You're allowed to be a little bit of a scaredy cat

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.100
 if you live in this house.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.500
 We'll assume the hall lights on.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.460
 It's possible the hall lights off.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.660
 Who would be out of character for this kid?

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.940
 But how does he take in so much detail?

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:54.820
 It's the middle of the night.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.820
 You just peed.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.620
 He's walking around the house.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.760
 Well, because it grabbed him.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.980
 He saw this hand come out of the wall

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.500
 and it instantly locked onto his ankle.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:13.980
 It was low to the ground.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.380
 I should have said that earlier.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.620
 He thinks it's like coming out to shake his hand.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:20.540
 It came out of the wall low enough

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.060
 that the first place he grabbed.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.860
 And I mean, it would be an effective place

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.660
 to grab someone is their ankle.

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:26.940
 If you have a strong enough grip,

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.660
 if you can grab their ankle.

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.020
 If you're ever in a fight and you were like,

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.780
 "Oh, I better materialize through this wall

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.460
 to get the upper hand on this guy."

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.940
 It's an effective place to grab anyone.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.140
 And I would argue it's probably an even more effective place

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:40.980
 to grab a kid.

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:41.980
 They have tiny ankles.

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.740
 You can wrap your whole hand around it.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:44.820
 This hand was giant.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.300
 Probably didn't have.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.580
 And again, he says big.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.220
 I guess it's not giant.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.420
 It's larger than a normal hand.

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.500
 Wraps around his ankle.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.780
 He's stuck.

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.040
 That's why he gets a good look at it.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:57.880
 He looks down.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.860
 He sees it coming out of the wall.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:59.700
 He's terrified.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.220
 It wraps around his ankle.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:06.060
 And he does have to struggle to get free of this hand.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.300
 But he does put up that struggle.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.380
 I mean, you imagine talking about adrenaline kicking in.

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:17.080
 He is able to break free from this thing's grasp,

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.540
 runs into his parents room and they convince him.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.900
 Well, they don't,

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.340
 you could argue that they do convince him

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.380
 'cause he's thinking about it today that,

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.420
 "Maybe I was dreaming."

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.340
 But they say you're just dreaming.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.560
 It's all a dream.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.020
 And he tells that story today and he goes,

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.660
 "It had to have been a dream."

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.700
 This is something we see happen so often

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.100
 in the world of paranormal.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.340
 It had to have been a dream

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.940
 because the reality of admitting that it's real

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.800
 is too terrifying that a hand can reach out of the wall

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.640
 and grab you.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.020
 And do God knows what?

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.980
 So it was just a dream.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.740
 It's a fascinating story.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.820
 And I think that one is a truly terrifying story

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.420
 of a child under assault from,

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.020
 what type of entity is this thing?

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.060
 We've been talking a lot about this.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.420
 So I don't wanna beat a dead horse,

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.500
 but what could this be?

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.660
 It's fascinating.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.860
 I don't know what it was.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.860
 I'll default to the ghost story,

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.140
 but I don't even know why I'm picking that out.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.740
 And I'm wondering if he was always scared

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.120
 of something under his bed,

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.340
 or if this night the fear was more intense,

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.820
 or if he was never scared of it,

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.700
 and this was the first time he was actually afraid of it,

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.340
 it's because that entity was watching him.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:38.380
 Like whatever it was,

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.820
 whatever was in the house, in the walls,

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:47.620
 was waiting for him.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.820
 And it could have got him in the bedroom.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.720
 It could have got him in the bathroom,

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.900
 but it tried its luck in the hallway,

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.300
 and Silas was able to get away.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:06.580
 I mean, imagine if this hand had latched onto him

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:07.900
 in the bathroom.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.660
 I mean, that's all you,

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.460
 one quick yank that kid's gonna smash his head

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.420
 against the side of the bathroom sink,

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.700
 or on the toilet bowl.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.180
 You know, you get a pretty serious injury,

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:26.180
 if not just an outright life-ending injury.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.480
 Hard enough he ain't, he'd smash his head open.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.320
 What if it got him in the bedroom,

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.360
 and didn't try going for, you know,

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.160
 making it look like it was an accident,

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.840
 making it look like he slipped in the bathroom,

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.320
 smashed his head on something,

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.040
 just yanked him under the bed,

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:45.760
 took him into the wall.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:51.080
 But the wall is a wall to us.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.620
 What was it to this entity?

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.820
 What would Silas have gone?

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:02.980
 And again, this is one of those stories,

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.660
 like if you woke up in the middle of the night

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.300
 and your kid was gone.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.020
 And these stories happen.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.660
 These stories happen.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.140
 People go missing and we have zero clue

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:15.980
 of where they went.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.820
 You're like, Jason, please, don't say.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.220
 I think Madeline McCann went in a wall.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:25.480
 I'm not saying every unexplained disappearance

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.960
 is wall related, I'm not saying that.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.100
 But maybe some of them are.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.360
 And the thing is, it's so unbelievable that, I mean,

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.800
 it would be easier to believe

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.280
 that someone broke in your house

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.120
 with no evidence of a break and took your kid,

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.720
 leaving no DNA, nothing.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.600
 The kid just vanished,

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.440
 never seen again, can't figure it out.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.760
 That's easier to believe.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.040
 You're chasing my guess, that is easier to believe.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.540
 Then the wall got him.

00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:01.240
 But what I find so fascinating is that

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.360
 you wouldn't believe it, you wouldn't believe it at all.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:08.360
 But here we have a kid who experienced it.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.300
 He goes, it was not a dream,

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.760
 but it had to have been a dream

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.960
 because it doesn't make sense.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.960
 But he looked down, he saw this thing come out of the wall.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.500
 He could see all these details about it,

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.440
 including, again, like if he saw Casper's arm reach out

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.720
 or a demonic creature claw

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.920
 that looked like something from some movie

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.960
 he had recently seen,

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.600
 then he could be a little more suspect, sure.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.840
 But to look down and see some sort of crazy entity

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:40.360
 wearing a watch, such a bizarre detail,

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.600
 he sees this thing come out of the wall,

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.560
 grab onto him, hold onto him,

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.080
 he has to break its grip

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.760
 and then go running down the hallway.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.400
 He experienced it and he can't believe it.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.400
 He was the one who felt the hand,

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.560
 who saw the hand, who had to break free from the hand

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.040
 and even he's like, this just can't be true.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.160
 So how are people, how are investigators

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.500
 supposed to believe in these things?

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:14.000
 How are people trying to solve these missing people cases?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.360
 I know this sounds insensitive, I get it.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:23.360
 But again, I think even if 1% of missing person cases

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.560
 are paranormal related,

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.360
 and I honestly, I think that's probably

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.680
 a pretty good estimate,

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.440
 1% of all missing person cases

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.520
 may have a paranormal answer.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.600
 But we wouldn't even know where to start looking like,

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.440
 what are you gonna do,

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.640
 start knocking over gravestones,

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.200
 be like, tell us what you know, tell us what you know.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.960
 It would just, but again, like again,

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.040
 I feel like I'm beating a dead horse,

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.400
 we've talked about it a couple of different times recently,

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.840
 but I guess it's been on my mind.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.880
 It's such a terrifying thought to think

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.640
 that the world of the paranormal is so dangerous

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.160
 it can get you at any time.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:00.400
 But the fact of the matter is it can.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:06.080
 So it's easier for us to just go,

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.520
 no, no, that's not possible.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.760
 It's just dreams and spooky stories that we read online

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.260
 or someone tells us in a podcast or it's just,

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.960
 it's not real.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.680
 Can't be real.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:28.000
 And while those may be comforting thoughts

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.960
 to fall asleep to,

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.920
 those denials of the dangers of the world

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.000
 of the paranormal will not save you.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.880
 When a rotting pale hand reaches out of the wall

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:46.320
 and drags you into their darkness.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.840
 (upbeat music)

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.640
 DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com is gonna be your email address.

 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.720
 and true crime podcast.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.240
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.840
 We glad you listened to it today.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.680
 - DeadRabber.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.260
 (upbeat music)

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:26.880
 - In America, it's estimated that 4% of people in prison

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.920
 are actually innocent.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.560
 - When I saw them for the very first time,

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.960
 like I knew who my jury was gonna be doing trial.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.200
 To be honest, I knew I lost them.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.120
 - In 2002, the state of Georgia found Keri guilty

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.600
 for his alleged involvement in a vicious rape.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.920
 Only a small percentage of those people

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.080
 have their convictions overturned.

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.760
 - You know, as one great justice said many years ago,

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.120
 we don't find our witnesses from church pews.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.880
 - What series of events led to Keri's wrongful conviction?

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.240
 Could this happen to anyone?

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:05.120
 What finally convinced the courts to overturn his conviction?

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.480
 From Zapier, in partnership with the Georgia Innocence Project,

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.840
 this is the 4%.
