00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
 - Charlotte, main of God here.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,240

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,400
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,920
 What would you do if you were walking around

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,800
 your backyard with your teeny, tiny puppy

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,480
 and then all of a sudden, a UFO appeared?

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,200
 (mimics UFO noises)

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,840
 And then we take a look at the world of children.

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
 If you're listening to this,

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,080
 you were a child once, so full of life,

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,300
 so full of love, so full of fear of the dark.

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,300
 But what happens when your fears become reality?

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,300
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,880
 (upbeat music)

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:17,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,880
 I'm having a great day.

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,640
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,840
 you're doing.

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,900
 Summer has started, so once again,

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,900
 I am recording an episode late at night

36
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,540
 hoping to beat the heat.

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,860
 He says, as I'm already stuck to this chair

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,060
 that I'm sitting in, I have a metal folding chair.

39
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,140
 That's, I've been recording this podcast

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,020
 for the past five years.

41
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,700
 And a folding chair from Walmart.

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,180
 But someone who's more valuable

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,820
 than any plain old folding chair from Walmart,

44
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,700
 if anything, they're a lazy boy recliner

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,460
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,220
 as our newest Patreon supporter.

47
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,980
 Everyone give it up for Juan Gina Spirit.

48
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,100
 Woo hoo, yeah, wee!

49
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,780
 Yeah, floating in like a ghost,

50
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,740
 floating in like the ghost of a lazy boy chair.

51
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,440
 Woo, that's pretty cool.

52
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,640
 Don't try sitting in it, you'll fall right through.

53
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,960
 Juan the Gina Spirit, you're gonna be our captain,

54
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
 our pilot of this episode.

55
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,320
 If you guys can't support the Patreon,

56
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,360
 and totally understand it, just help spread the word

57
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,920
 about Dead Rabbit Radio.

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
 That helps out so much.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,280
 Tell your friends, tell your family,

60
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,160
 tell everyone you know that you love the show.

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,540
 How did I never realize that right before?

63
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,900
 But if it rhymes, it's true, that's what they say.

64
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,700
 Juan the Gina Spirit, let's go ahead

65
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
 and get this party started.

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,020
 I'm gonna toss you the keys for a new vehicle.

67
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,180
 I just came up with this.

68
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,740
 Juan Gina Spirit, I'm gonna go ahead

69
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,220
 and toss you the keys to the Bunny Byplane.

70
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,700
 Let's all hop on, boy, it's gonna be

71
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,660
 the same sound effect as a jet.

72
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,140
 It's gonna be a little bit slower.

73
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,620
 Let's all hop on board the Bunny Byplane.

74
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,880
 Juan Gina, go ahead and spin that propeller.

75
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,360
 (imitates propeller)

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
 And fly us all the way out to Florida.

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,280
 (imitates propeller)

78
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,200
 We're flying around all the way out to Florida.

79
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,800
 It's June 13th, 1998.

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,520
 It's summertime.

81
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,760
 The world's grooving down to third eye blind.

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,940
 If you're cool, matchbox 20, if you're lame.

83
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,060
 Hit television shows like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

84
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,540
 and "Deep Space Nine" still fill the airwaves with laughter.

85
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,100
 We're like, oh, look at all those people

86
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,920
 who've been devoured by aliens and vampires

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,580
 on a crossover episode.

88
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,840
 What a good chuckle.

89
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,600
 1998, what a year, what a year.

90
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
 But we're not here to reminisce

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,540
 over how amazing 1998 was.

92
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,540
 We're here to hang out with a woman named Mrs. Kinston.

93
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,700
 June 13th, 1998 in Miami, Florida.

94
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,860
 It's late at night.

95
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,900
 Well, not super late, but later

96
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,180
 then you may want to be handling chores.

97
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,020
 (imitates propeller)

98
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,740
 Oh, teeny, teeny, my puppy.

99
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,860
 Ms. Kinston says as she's stroking its neck.

100
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,460
 What do you want now?

101
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,740
 (imitates propeller)

102
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,780
 Oh, you want to go outside?

103
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,100
 I can tell.

104
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,100
 I can tell because you're peeing all over the floor.

105
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,340
 Probably should have let you outside a couple minutes ago.

106
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,740
 Teeny, let's head on outside.

107
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,100
 So Mrs. Kinston and her dog named Teeny

108
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,220
 go out into the backyard.

109
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,380
 Everything's fine.

110
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,860
 They're just having fun in the backyard.

111
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,580
 She's all rolling around in the grass with them.

112
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,020
 She's like, I should have been doing this my entire life.

113
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,460
 This is so fun.

114
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,640
 They're having fun.

115
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,620
 But then all of a sudden they hear a loud whistling sound

116
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,620
 and a gust of air rips through the area.

117
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,460
 Whoa.

118
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,860
 (sighs)

119
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,500
 And that wasn't bad enough.

120
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,740
 It's actually not that bad really to think about it.

121
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,620
 It's just called the wind.

122
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,660
 Well, the whistling sound might be a little annoying

123
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,900
 depending on how loud it is,

124
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,380
 but if that wasn't okay enough,

125
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,380
 all of a sudden...

126
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,380
 (imitates propeller)

127
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:18,180
 A UFO, a flying saucer, descends from the night sky.

128
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,740
 And is now hovering about 30 feet

129
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,340
 over Mrs. Kinston's backyard.

130
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,500
 Teeny, do you see that, Teeny?

131
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,220
 That's one of them flying saucers.

132
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,420
 She probably said we don't have any quotes.

133
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,340
 I'm assuming she said something like that.

134
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,020
 I'm assuming she sounded like Edith Bunker as well.

135
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,340
 Teeny, look.

136
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,900
 She doesn't say how big it is,

137
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,340
 but these things can be around 30 feet long,

138
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,380
 30 feet in diameter.

139
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,020
 It's hovering over her yard

140
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,620
 when suddenly,

141
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:00,820
 a reptilian alien materializes underneath the UFO.

142
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,060
 Like he got beamed down.

143
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,340
 And he's standing there on the cold Florida soil

144
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,460
 or grass, depending on how well maintained

145
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
 her backyard was.

146
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,420
 If you're an avid listener, dead rabbit radio,

147
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,580
 I want you to pay attention to a couple of the details

148
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,420
 of this story.

149
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,180
 I want you to stop doing the dishes.

150
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,820
 Put down that gardening hoe

151
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,580
 because there's some interesting parallels

152
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,460
 to a story I covered really recently.

153
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,580
 I just came across these two stories completely randomly.

154
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:42,260
 This reptilian alien materializes like straight up sci-fi.

155
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,660
 I mean, look at the UFO.

156
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,860
 It's a reptilian alien.

157
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,340
 Everything about him is sci-fi.

158
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,700
 You could have a fork and you're like,

159
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
 "Wow, is that a light speed fork?"

160
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,380
 And he's like, "Nope."

161
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,940
 But it's made out of alien metals.

162
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,540
 You're like, "Wow."

163
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,180
 This alien reptilian appears in a,

164
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,020
 he's beamed down.

165
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,020
 He's materialized onto the ground

166
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,860
 and teeny is like, "I'm outta here.

167
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,980
 "I'm outta here."

168
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,540
 He takes off and he runs into the house.

169
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,340
 Now that's the right thing to do

170
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,180
 if you encounter a reptilian alien.

171
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,300
 Gray aliens, depending on the story,

172
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,740
 they may be your friend

173
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,540
 or they may dissect you while you're still alive

174
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,340
 and then put you back together and wipe your memories.

175
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,260
 But reptilians are almost always a hostile force.

176
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,100
 Not all the time.

177
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,940
 There might be one or two stories we've covered

178
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,700
 where they're like shaking hands with people

179
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,180
 and not ripping their limbs off.

180
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,460
 But generally speaking, you probably should run away.

181
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,140
 You probably should run away from most,

182
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,300
 if not all, alien encounters.

183
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,740
 Teeny's smart enough to take off running into the house.

184
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,140
 Now Mrs. Kingston, she's smart too,

185
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,180
 but the alien has other plans for her.

186
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,420
 She's terrified and right before she can begin to run,

187
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,140
 she said the reptilian's eyes lit up

188
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,580
 and she was frozen in place.

189
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,620
 Mrs. Kingston said that she felt like a cold chill

190
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,540
 all over her body and she couldn't move.

191
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,260
 She was completely frozen in place

192
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,700
 and she couldn't even scream.

193
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
 She's kinda stuck there.

194
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,620
 It would be kinda weird if you were able to free someone

195
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,620
 and you're like, you stay there

196
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,820
 and then the person's just like,

197
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,820
 "Ah!"

198
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,020
 Just like screaming the whole time.

199
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,060
 "Ah, somebody help me, yeah!"

200
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,980
 Aliens are like, "Oh, we should probably perfect

201
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,340
 "this technology to, I don't know,

202
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,940
 freeze their vocal cords as well.

203
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,700
 "They keep alerting others to help them."

204
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,860
 She's completely frozen.

205
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
 She can't even scream.

206
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,860
 And at that point, the reptilian is kinda like,

207
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,220
 "Okay, first part of my job is done.

208
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,940
 "Now it's on to phase two."

209
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,740
 And she notices that the reptilian is wearing a backpack.

210
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,620
 And he begins kinda looking around on the ground

211
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,340
 and as far as she can tell,

212
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,580
 picking stuff up at random

213
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,020
 and putting it into his backpack,

214
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,340
 she's frozen this entire time.

215
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,100
 I'm assuming her bladder is frozen as well.

216
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,740
 She's not peeing constantly during this whole encounter.

217
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,020
 He's looking around and he seems to be picking

218
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,100
 just normal stuff up, rocks, probably a snail, right?

219
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,740
 He can't get away, freezes it, just in case.

220
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,980
 Picks it up, throws it in his suitcase,

221
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,060
 throws another rock in there.

222
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,300
 He's like, "I'm sure it'll survive it."

223
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
 And then she'll on it.

224
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,460
 He's picking stuff up at random.

225
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,500
 Sorry, should we can tell, right?

226
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,860
 I'm sure the alien had a purpose of what he was picking up

227
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,540
 and he's putting it into his backpack

228
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,300
 and then all of a sudden, Teenie comes running out of the house.

229
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,100
 Teenie in a burst of courage.

230
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,940
 Decides to take on this alien invader.

231
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,500
 Now, Teenie, we don't know the breed of the dog.

232
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,780
 I will make a guess.

233
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,020
 It's tiny, it's a tiny dog, I'm just gonna guess.

234
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,100
 But its name is Teenie,

235
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,620
 unless it's one of those ironic names

236
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,500
 like when you call a big guy slim.

237
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,420
 But Teenie, I'm assuming, is a diminutive dog.

238
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,420
 He runs out of the house, he sees his mama frozen

239
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,460
 and he's gonna save the day

240
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,500
 and he begins barking and running at full speed

241
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,860
 towards the reptilian.

242
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,740
 At this point, you know, his attention is on the rocks.

243
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,260
 His attention is looking down on the ground,

244
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,220
 he's picking stuff up.

245
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,580
 He's not expecting this tiny dog to come after him.

246
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,140
 Teenie is running straight towards this reptilian invader

247
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,740
 from another world.

248
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,920
 And the reptilian turns and looks at Teenie.

249
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,300
 And Teenie, whoof, whoof, whoof, whoof, whoof,

250
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,140
 is running and barking and headed right towards this alien

251
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,900
 and in a single motion,

252
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,180
 the reptilian grabs Teenie, picks him up

253
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,700
 and swallows him whole.

254
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,540
 Gulp.

255
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,580
 There's no word on if Mrs. Kingston saw a little paws

256
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,540
 kicking its way down its throat.

257
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,100
 She's probably too terrified to remember that

258
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,640
 or if she doesn't remember it to wanna mention it.

259
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,600
 He swallowed a Teenie in a single gulp.

260
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,580
 Now, if you were terrified before,

261
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,580
 this would be off the scale, right?

262
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,560
 If you're already scared, alien shows up,

263
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,940
 freezes you in place and then he's like picking up rocks,

264
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,620
 picking up popsicle sticks and stuff,

265
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,260
 garbage in your backyard, like, hey, thanks.

266
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,200
 I was supposed to do that tomorrow for my chores, thank you.

267
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
 If you saw an alien,

268
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,740
 or really anything, really anything on the planet Earth,

269
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,220
 swallow your dog in one gulp.

270
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,660
 Your fear level is going to go through the roof

271
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,980
 and that's exactly what happened

272
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,940
 but Mrs. Kingston is frozen, she can't do anything.

273
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,220
 You'd wonder, am I next?

274
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,380
 Is he gonna swallow me?

275
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,460
 I'm bigger than a dog,

276
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,580
 is he gonna take three or four gulps?

277
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,100
 And my next, well, what happened was after the alien

278
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,220
 swallowed the dog, swallowed Teenie whole,

279
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,520
 he then just kind of like looked around a bit

280
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,520
 and walked back underneath his UFO

281
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,240
 and (mimics flying)

282
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,600
 de-materialized, he got beamed back up into the ship

283
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,320
 and then the flying saucer flew off,

284
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,200
 disappearing into the night sky.

285
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,440
 I found this story on ThinkAboutDogs.com,

286
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,440
 they got it from an author named Thiago Luis T'Chetti.

287
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,300
 He is a UFO researcher, he's a UFO author,

288
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,400
 he writes a lot of books about this stuff.

289
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,820
 It was interesting, ThinkAboutDogs.com

290
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,060
 very rarely adds notes.

291
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,300
 They added a note to this story,

292
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,780
 they said I wasn't able to locate such a witness

293
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,940
 so I guess they tried,

294
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,620
 I guess they were going through the phone book

295
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,060
 looking at people in Florida named Mrs. Kingston.

296
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,400
 I would guess that she moved, I would guess that

297
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,840
 if you were ever in any place

298
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,380
 where a reptilian alien came down,

299
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,780
 scoured your backyard, froze you in place,

300
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,560
 then ate your dog in a single gulp

301
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,660
 and I keep kind of hammering that point home

302
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,280
 because that is spookier.

303
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,560
 That is spookier, if someone, if he ripped the dog in two

304
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,840
 and was like, oh that's enough for my mouth,

305
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,320
 now I was chewing, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

306
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,860
 He's holding the bloody iron quarter of a dog,

307
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,260
 he's spinning around and then he goes,

308
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,140
 ah, mm, seconds, ha, ha, ha, ha, nom, nom, nom.

309
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,700
 That's disgusting and probably a little over the top

310
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,740
 for all you dog lovers out there.

311
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,180
 But it would be less creepy, I would argue.

312
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,980
 I would argue that there's a difference

313
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,260
 between being ripped in half and chewed up

314
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,980
 because then like if someone ate you,

315
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,340
 imagine you were tasting your,

316
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,760
 are you gonna get into that creepy, boring stuff?

317
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,200
 You're gonna start talking about, okay,

318
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,960
 so imagine if you got eaten,

319
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,480
 but they were eating you like you would eat a steak, right?

320
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,600
 So they like start with your head,

321
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,840
 that's how you normally eat a steak,

322
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,480
 you're like, where's the cow, where's the cow,

323
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,640
 I need an appetizer, take a bite out of his bowl brains.

324
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,960
 If someone like picked me up and started chomping on me,

325
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,220
 nom, nom, nom, like if they started biting my sides,

326
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,780
 I'd be like, chewing blood everywhere,

327
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,380
 I'd be making a big old mess.

328
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,980
 And if they bit my head off,

329
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,900
 then they chew my brain up and then I lose consciousness

330
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,380
 and I don't care what happens to me after that point

331
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,340
 'cause my brain's dead.

332
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,220
 But it's worse to get swallowed whole

333
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,260
 because then first off, it must be like super tight

334
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,220
 going down someone's esophagus.

335
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,460
 And in this case, it would clearly be the giant

336
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,920
 from Jack and the Beanstalk,

337
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,040
 there's nothing on earth that can eat me whole,

338
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,620
 but maybe a hippo.

339
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,900
 You'd be like going down this tight esophagus

340
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,200
 and you'd probably be like trying to grab onto the sides,

341
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,560
 you're trying to grab onto the sides

342
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,280
 to prevent you from falling in.

343
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,080
 And then you're like stuck in his throat,

344
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,280
 he's like, oh, he's all choking,

345
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,280
 you're all punching his windpipe, he's like, ah.

346
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,400
 We are going down this tight esophagus

347
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,200
 and then you know what's gonna happen.

348
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,500
 I mean, teeny doesn't understand biology,

349
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,700
 but you know that there's a bunch of stomach acid below you.

350
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,260
 So as much as you're kind of stuck in this esophagus

351
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,500
 and you're trying to wiggle your way back up,

352
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,780
 unless you have like a pocket knife

353
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,740
 and you can like cut handles into his esophagus,

354
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,260
 you're cutting gills into him,

355
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,740
 he's just slide out of his neck.

356
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,420
 You're gonna fall into stomach acid

357
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,420
 and you're gonna be like, ah, burning, ah.

358
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,300
 And it would be horrific.

359
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,200
 And you'd probably fall feet first.

360
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,320
 So you're just standing in stomach acid

361
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,400
 and you're slowly melting and then you could go,

362
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,800
 okay, this is gonna take a while,

363
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,920
 this is gonna take a while, he eats some tums,

364
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,840
 some giant tums, he's like, oh yes,

365
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,720
 I like to slow down my digestion when I eat a human.

366
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,440
 You're just kind of standing in stomach acid,

367
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,040
 you would have to make a decision.

368
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,960
 You know eventually that your legs are gonna dissolve

369
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,920
 and then it's just gonna be,

370
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,240
 you're gonna be standing on skeleton legs

371
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,400
 and then you're gonna fall on your butt

372
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,960
 and then it'll be sitting in stomach acid

373
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,380
 and then like your waist,

374
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,440
 it takes you, you become a cartoon character,

375
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,400
 if your legs dissolve, you've bled to death.

376
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,480
 Well, what if you're just standing there,

377
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,760
 you're in lower half of the skeleton,

378
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,160
 you're like, ah, this is pretty painful.

379
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,600
 But my thing is, would you,

380
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,360
 if you were standing in a puddle of it

381
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,280
 or like a stomach of acid,

382
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,240
 would you, like you're just standing up in it

383
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,120
 and you can feel it dissolving,

384
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,640
 this actually was not what I planned on talking about.

385
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,660
 I have a really interesting connection to a past story,

386
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,240
 but you're like, yeah, Jayce,

387
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,520
 he told us to pay attention.

388
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,480
 Now, I forgot what you were originally talking about.

389
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,560
 Now you're talking about being eaten by a giant

390
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,660
 from a fairy tale.

391
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,400
 If you were standing in stomach acid,

392
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,840
 I'm not telling you what this is,

393
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,440
 if you're standing in stomach acid

394
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,200
 and it was slowly dissolving your legs,

395
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,400
 would you drown yourself in the acid

396
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,840
 just to get it over with?

397
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,640
 Would you be like, okay, this is gonna take like hours

398
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,760
 and the whole time it's just flakes of skin

399
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,800
 are gonna be like flying off of my legs

400
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,640
 and I'm gonna be like, ah, screaming, would you say,

401
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,720
 you know what, I'm just gonna lay down in the acid,

402
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,400
 I'm gonna put my head in

403
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,520
 and let my head dissolve first

404
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,920
 and just get it over with.

405
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,200
 'Cause there's no way out of here.

406
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,480
 You might be able to try crawling through his butt hole.

407
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,560
 You may wanna try that first, actually.

408
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,960
 I probably should have done that

409
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,720
 before I melted my eyeballs.

410
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,480
 You're like, okay, you stick your head

411
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,840
 in your whole face melts, you're like,

412
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,240
 that plan didn't work, my brain is still functional

413
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,400
 and I can't see where I'm going.

414
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,480
 Would you, if you were in a giant puddle of acid,

415
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,480
 would you kill yourself quicker by laying down in it?

416
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,960
 It's terrifying to be swallowed whole,

417
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,800
 but here's the interesting thing.

418
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,720
 Recently, like maybe like two weeks ago,

419
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,160
 it hasn't been that long at all.

420
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,040
 Yeah, it was episode 1073, The Hunting Party.

421
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,760
 This is so fascinating, 'cause I did not

422
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,040
 put these two stories together in any way, shape, or form.

423
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,640
 I found them at different times.

424
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,760
 We covered a story just a couple of weeks ago

425
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,960
 and it took place, if I remember correctly,

426
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,960
 it was 1968, a UFO containing reptilian aliens landed in,

427
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,600
 it was Colorado, I don't remember the exact name

428
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,360
 of the city, it was a uranium mining town.

429
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,640
 The aliens probably saw it glowing from space,

430
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,480
 they're like, let's go check that place out.

431
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,400
 This alien craft landed and a little girl woke up

432
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,880
 in the middle of the night, the rest of her family

433
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,320
 was knocked out like some sort of knockout drug

434
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,720
 or ray or whatever, she couldn't rouse

435
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,800
 the other people in the house, the dog was barking

436
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,820
 in that story.

437
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,400
 She looks at her window, she sees a flying saucer land,

438
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,960
 with landing gear and a stairway came out of it

439
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,040
 and the reptilians walked down off the stairway,

440
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
 which in that episode I go, isn't that interesting

441
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,240
 how you could have sci-fi technology futuristic

442
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,720
 as far as we're concerned in technology,

443
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,880
 but then it still requires landing gears

444
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,440
 and a gangplank, like a little ladder you see

445
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,240
 come out of an airplane.

446
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,800
 So that was an interesting detail.

447
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,920
 And I have not encountered this before with reptilians,

448
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,640
 I think we've encountered them with other alien races,

449
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,000
 but in that story, these reptilians got off the UFO,

450
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,840
 they were all wearing backpacks,

451
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,480
 which again was a detail I noted in that,

452
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,560
 I was like, that's so weird,

453
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,640
 I haven't come across it before these reptilians come off,

454
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,800
 they had backpacks, they also were carrying bows,

455
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,920
 which again is like one of the most primitive weapons

456
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,160
 that mankind, I mean, it's served us well over the 10,000 years

457
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,800
 it's been around, but it's been around for that long.

458
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,520
 The bow, it's funny now that I say that I wonder,

459
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,000
 'cause they never used it in the story,

460
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,320
 I wonder if it was an actual like a bow like functions for us,

461
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,000
 or if it was some sort of other device

462
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,360
 that looked like a bow, we don't know,

463
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,360
 but you have these reptilians get off this UFO,

464
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,320
 the dog was freaking out,

465
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,240
 and they were looking around for something.

466
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,760
 And the reason why I called the episode,

467
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,200
 the hunting party was because they were carrying these bows,

468
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,400
 but we don't know what they were here for,

469
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
 the little girl tried waking her mom up,

470
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,440
 and then they both ended up falling asleep anyways.

471
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
 It's a really interesting episode,

472
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,760
 especially the way that story ends,

473
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,320
 but when I came across this story,

474
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,240
 I was like, okay, there's some really interesting things

475
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
 about this, and I don't wanna go on too long,

476
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,100
 even though I go on at length about being digested by a giant.

477
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,960
 Think about it, these two stories

478
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,040
 are about 30 years apart.

479
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,920
 Like timeline wise, right?

480
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,760
 We have the stories reported in 1968,

481
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,280
 the stories reported in 1998,

482
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,540
 two different stories, two different states.

483
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:07,080
 In third, this is gonna sound totally weird,

484
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,400
 but like everything else on the show,

485
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
 within 30 year time period is it possible

486
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,240
 that these reptilians,

487
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,720
 this could be a particular offshoot

488
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,000
 of the reptilian civilization,

489
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,680
 they could be considered mainstream reptilian civilization.

490
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,120
 We don't know, but it's so interesting

491
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,760
 to think within 30 years,

492
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,120
 they went from having flying saucers

493
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,200
 that needed landing gear and a staircase

494
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,360
 to pop out of it, like an airplane,

495
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,100
 like a commercial jet,

496
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,100
 to being able to materialize and dematerialize.

497
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,440
 The ship didn't even land in this story,

498
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
 it was hovering over the ground,

499
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,960
 the reptilian just appeared underneath it,

500
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,480
 and started walking around.

501
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:54,160
 So it's, I mean, is there a technological tree

502
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,000
 within our lifetime?

503
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,080
 You think about what's happened in technology

504
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,960
 on earth between 1968 and 1998, it's staggering, right?

505
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,960
 We started seeing from punch card computers

506
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,840
 to personal computers in your home,

507
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,200
 the beginnings of the internet, all this stuff,

508
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,240
 CDs versus eight tracks,

509
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,360
 and it's within just a 30 year time span,

510
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,120
 we had these really big advancements,

511
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,480
 even though they're mostly in the form of entertainment,

512
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,120
 we did have these things.

513
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,280
 Within that same time period,

514
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,280
 it's 20, 'cause in a lot of UFO reports from the '50s,

515
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,040
 they do talk about landing gear,

516
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,360
 they do talk about the UFO sitting on the ground

517
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,600
 with the little legs coming out of it,

518
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,400
 and this more modern UFO report,

519
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,000
 it never touches the ground,

520
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,240
 the alien beams down all a star trek,

521
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,280
 starts walking around.

522
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,440
 So that's a really interesting idea, right?

523
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,840
 Because I think we have this thought that the aliens,

524
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,280
 they're so much more advanced than us,

525
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,880
 their advancements have stopped.

526
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,800
 They already have UFOs, what else do they need?

527
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,200
 They already have this ability to freeze people in place

528
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,080
 and to do all of these things,

529
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,920
 but is it possible that they're also continually

530
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,120
 advancing their tech as well?

531
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,760
 Because of these two, so, and the reason why,

532
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,880
 we cover a lot of reptilian stories,

533
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
 we cover a lot of reptilian stories,

534
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,440
 and I'm not connecting,

535
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,240
 I normally don't make all these connections,

536
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,000
 the fact that they both have the backpack,

537
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,280
 which again, we've covered aliens wearing weird suits before,

538
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,680
 but reptilians with backpacks is such a unique detail,

539
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,440
 and I called it out in that first episode,

540
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,200
 and then last week I came across this one,

541
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,560
 and a totally different website,

542
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,440
 the first one was from Phantoms and Monsters,

543
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,720
 this one's the thing about a dog,

544
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,560
 30 years apart, two different witnesses,

545
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,600
 two different states, what in the world

546
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,760
 that idea of a reptilian?

547
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,160
 Because they're more war-like,

548
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,440
 they're considered a more war-like,

549
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,240
 more brutal alien race,

550
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,240
 and I'm not saying you can't be brutal with a backpack,

551
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
 but the backpack does kind of make you think

552
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,400
 an explorer, a scientist,

553
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,240
 but just the idea of reptilians,

554
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,160
 sometimes they'll wear an insignia,

555
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,400
 very rarely, right, they're usually nude,

556
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,640
 they're usually these giant nude reptilian creatures,

557
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,880
 same thing with the great aliens,

558
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,000
 there's debate over if the great aliens are nude,

559
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,720
 or if that's some sort of space suit they're wearing,

560
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,880
 but fascinating connection,

561
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
 you have these two aliens, reptilians,

562
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,160
 they're both wearing the backpack,

563
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,320
 they both have flying saucers,

564
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,520
 but 30 years apart,

565
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,920
 the flying saucer technology acts differently.

566
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,240
 If the first story had the UFO floating there,

567
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,400
 and a guy beaming down,

568
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,240
 and the second story had the landing gears,

569
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,840
 you would go, oh, you know,

570
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,080
 it's maybe the second guy,

571
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,240
 maybe the guy with the landing gears

572
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,960
 needed to skimp a little bit on his UFO,

573
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
 he didn't have a good credit rating,

574
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,760
 but the fact that we have them 30 years apart

575
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,840
 and the futuristic one,

576
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,560
 the more modern one I guess I should say,

577
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,480
 has more futuristic technology,

578
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,720
 just interesting, really interesting way to look at

579
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,560
 the world of aliens, the world of paranormal,

580
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,600
 that constant advancement, is it happening?

581
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,520
 Are they getting better tech?

582
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,900
 Who knows, really, really cool story.

583
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,360
 Juan, Gina, Spirit, I'm gonna go ahead

584
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,160
 and toss you the keys of the carbonar copter,

585
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,840
 we are leaving behind Florida,

586
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,560
 fly us all the way out, too.

587
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,480
 The little boys' bedroom.

588
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,320
 (imitates gunshot)

589
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:30,000
 Recently I did an episode about a shadow man

590
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,360
 who folded up a dude in a bed,

591
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
 turning him into a human burrito.

592
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,960
 He didn't eat him, that was not a four episode.

593
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,840
 And in that same episode,

594
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,600
 I talked about this thing called the empty spot,

595
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,480
 it was a place in this kitchen,

596
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,720
 these people lived in this house

597
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,160
 and there is a place in the kitchen

598
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,440
 where when you walked by it,

599
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,320
 you felt like almost like a pull on your stomach,

600
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,360
 like you were going down a roller coaster.

601
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,480
 And one day the dad dropped his phone

602
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
 over the empty spot and it disappeared.

603
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,040
 And it went missing for like a year,

604
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,520
 maybe a longer, and then it reappeared

605
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,120
 when they heard it hit the ground.

606
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,680
 It was a really interesting story.

607
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,280
 I thought, Mason, long time,

608
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,320
 Patreon supporter of the show,

609
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,840
 long time just general supporter of the show,

610
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,000
 was talking about it on the Patreon Discord

611
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,640
 and he goes, that was a really cool combination

612
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,120
 of like childhood fears, just kind of like wrapped up,

613
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,580
 kind of wrapped up like a delicious burrito,

614
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,240
 delicious human burrito.

615
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,160
 It's funny 'cause I didn't think about that going in.

616
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,720
 I mean, maybe I don't have fears of turning into a burrito,

617
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,080
 that might be a Mason thing,

618
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,360
 he's like, ah, my two worst fears, losing my phone

619
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,800
 and being folded up in a mattress.

620
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,000
 But I thought that was interesting

621
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,720
 and it did make me think, I bet you,

622
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,520
 that I can find some other childhood experiences.

623
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,760
 These are some weird ones,

624
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,360
 and they vary on level of creepiness.

625
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,560
 We're gonna start off by meeting this kid named Phillip.

626
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,880
 Phillip, he goes, when I was a little kid,

627
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,640
 I had this reoccurring dream,

628
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,920
 where he goes, I had this dream over 10 times

629
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,840
 throughout my childhood.

630
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,480
 He goes, I was in my house

631
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,160
 and there was a gorilla in the house

632
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,520
 and this gorilla would begin chasing me

633
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,960
 through my own home.

634
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,440
 (gibberish)

635
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,000
 I guess, well, how does a gorilla sound again?

636
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,400
 (gibberish)

637
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,480
 Phillip's running through the house,

638
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,600
 this gorilla's in the hot pursuit

639
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,720
 and the dream went in the same way every single time.

640
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,280
 In one of the back bedrooms,

641
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,360
 there was this large storage closet

642
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,960
 and Phillip would throw the door open

643
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,200
 and there would be a toilet in the storage closet.

644
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,880
 Now, in real life, there is no toilet there,

645
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,960
 it's just a storage closet,

646
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,760
 but in the dreams, every time we opened that door,

647
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,960
 there was a toilet there

648
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,040
 and right before this gorilla could wrap its beefy hands

649
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,800
 around this young boy's neck,

650
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,360
 Phillip would jump into the toilet

651
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,960
 and go down the drain.

652
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,800
 (gibberish)

653
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,720
 I'm thinking, you'd be saying,

654
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,680
 we're like, okay, I know where this journey ends.

655
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,640
 Puddles full of poop, but Phillip would wake up.

656
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,800
 That is the way he would get away from the gorilla.

657
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,640
 No matter what happened,

658
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,320
 if the gorilla was in hot pursuit,

659
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,240
 chasing with you through the house,

660
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,480
 Phillip had to get to that storage closet

661
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,720
 where there was this toilet.

662
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,800
 He would jump in and flesh himself to safety.

663
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,720
 And like I said, he had this dream

664
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,920
 more than 10 times throughout his childhood.

665
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,200
 Also, that toilet never existed.

666
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,040
 Like he was, he's like, oh man,

667
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,960
 I really gotta go to the bathroom.

668
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
 He's like, I know where I'll go, the storage closet.

669
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,080
 He opens up the door, he's like, I forgot.

670
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,000
 That was just the realm of this

671
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,120
 subliminal poop in his pants.

672
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,920
 Around the time Phillip turned 18,

673
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,360
 his parents had decided to sell the house.

674
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,040
 And you know, it's time to move on.

675
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,620
 Kid, Phillip's probably going away somewhere.

676
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,240
 Gonna sell the house.

677
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,280
 And he said, when they were getting ready

678
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,760
 to sell the house, they made a decision.

679
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,880
 (laughs)

680
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,160
 He released the gorilla into the house.

681
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,560
 They were, this will attract buyers, right?

682
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
 Everyone loves having their face ripped off.

683
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,120
 They made a decision.

684
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,840
 They went and, you know, to increase the property value,

685
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,800
 they turn in that back bedroom,

686
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 they turned the storage closet into a bathroom.

687
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:29,640
 So now there was a toilet back there.

688
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,980
 Oh, here's the thing.

689
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,640
 Is that story creepy?

690
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,000
 Not really.

691
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,160
 Now I'm thinking of, I have a dreams episode coming up.

692
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,920
 Probably should have saved it for that.

693
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,120
 I'm sorry about dreams that come true,

694
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,920
 not like you won the lottery,

695
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,800
 but like people who had weird dreams

696
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,160
 and then the dreams ended up being real.

697
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,760
 I should have saved it for that episode,

698
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,320
 but I think it still kind of fits

699
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,120
 into this one because technically it's creepy.

700
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,280
 Imagine if he had dreamt something else.

701
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,480
 He dreamt, he's like running from the gorilla.

702
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,280
 He goes in there, it's a wood shop full of hanging hay hooks

703
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,600
 and he's like dodging them

704
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,520
 and the gorilla gets stuck on them.

705
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,120
 And then he wakes up.

706
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,280
 And then when he turns 18,

707
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,200
 his dad says, "Hey son, I got a secret to share with you.

708
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,040
 "Come in this storage closet,"

709
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,240
 and Phillip walks in there

710
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,480
 and there's a bunch of hay hooks.

711
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,560
 And he's like, "Dad, what?

712
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,400
 "What's your secret?"

713
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,240
 "What's your secret?"

714
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,080
 And he's like, "Dad's starting a chainsaw."

715
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,640
 It's your secret that you love hay hooks,

716
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,560
 you love sharp objects,

717
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
 and the dad's cutting them.

718
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,360
 (laughing)

719
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,000
 The dad's cutting them with a chainsaw.

720
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,600
 Phillip's like, "You haven't told me the secret yet.

721
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,280
 "It's blood, corn, shooting everywhere."

722
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,560
 Dad, come on, what's your secret?

723
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,320
 What if the dad was a serial killer?

724
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,160
 (laughing)

725
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,000
 He's like chasing it.

726
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,840
 He didn't.

727
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
 That didn't happen.

728
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,080
 You can't say,

729
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,000
 "I'm gonna tell you a creepy story."

730
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
 Jason, you cannot say,

731
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,640
 "You're gonna tell me a creepy childhood story.

732
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,640
 "Tell me a mundane story at best."

733
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,960
 And then say, "Well, it could have been a serial killer."

734
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
 That's not how that works.

735
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,000
 Okay, so I probably should have saved that,

736
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,480
 but let's keep going.

737
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,680
 I have this other story.

738
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,520
 Two more.

739
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,040
 Oh no.

740
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,360
 Jason, did you take Ben at drill before this episode as well?

741
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,520
 I'm recording it at night.

742
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,720
 I have to go to bed right after this.

743
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,200
 So yeah, it must have allergies, Audelina.

744
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,360
 The next story he came across,

745
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,600
 all of all these show notes from Jason,

746
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,680
 I'm not gonna check them.

747
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,920
 Wow, I wanna know more about that bad toilet story.

748
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,800
 I wanna know more about that bathroom story.

749
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,080
 Wow, Jason.

750
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,880
 I hope you put it in the show notes.

751
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,720
 Let's go ahead.

752
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,880
 We're gonna go over to this other dude's house.

753
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
 We're gonna call him Michael.

754
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
 We don't have locations for any of these stories

755
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,220
 or real names, unfortunately.

756
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,080
 We're about to meet this kid named Michael,

757
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,920
 and he said when I was a little kid, it was Christmas Eve.

758
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,880
 It was late one night.

759
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,240
 Everyone's asleep in the house,

760
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,400
 but Michael is woken up to the sound

761
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,880
 of Christmas presents unwrapping.

762
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,520
 I mean, that's pretty sensitive hearing.

763
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,000
 Who is this daredevil?

764
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,360
 Like what, was that a bow I heard unravel?

765
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,160
 Roused me out of my deep sleep.

766
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,280
 He wakes up a year as Christmas presents being unwrapped.

767
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,440
 He probably figures it's someone else in the house, you know?

768
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,560
 Getting an early start.

769
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,280
 He wants an early start, so he sneaks out of bed

770
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,000
 and he walks into the living room

771
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,320
 where all of the Christmas presents

772
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,040
 are positioned around the tree.

773
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,800
 And when Michael walks into the room,

774
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,600
 there's a little boy sitting in front of the presents.

775
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,520
 He's just sitting there.

776
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,200
 And Michael says he kind of froze.

777
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,920
 He doesn't know who this kid is.

778
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,760
 And the kid in front of the Christmas tree

779
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,960
 turns his head and stares directly at Michael.

780
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,760
 And then the boy, the boy sitting in front

781
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,440
 of this Christmas tree slowly floats away.

782
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,000
 And disappears from sight.

783
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,040
 He goes, he had never seen the kid before or since.

784
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,720
 He had no idea who this was.

785
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,040
 But on Christmas Eve, he heard,

786
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,560
 it's a creepy ghost story,

787
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,240
 more creepy than the toilet one,

788
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,720
 unless you're afraid of gorillas.

789
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,200
 Because again, it's that abstract nature of the paranormal.

790
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,080
 He didn't come down.

791
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,000
 If he had come down and seen the ghost

792
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,280
 unwrapping the presents, that's a little,

793
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,160
 I mean, it's still, you'd still pee your pants,

794
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,000
 but if you saw the ghost like actively doing something

795
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,120
 and being like, oh, I hope this is the wooden horse.

796
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,440
 The headmistress promised me,

797
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,800
 you haven't such a good orphan this year.

798
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,120
 And then he turned and elliptic you and floated away.

799
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,700
 It's still terrifying, but it makes a little more sense.

800
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,880
 But if you hear the sound of an activity,

801
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,040
 in this case, presents being unwrapped,

802
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,140
 and then you walk in and you see a kid

803
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,080
 sitting there motionless, no presents have been unwrapped.

804
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,560
 How does that work?

805
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,420
 How does that work?

806
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,800
 It's such a, it's creepy, the imagery is creepy, right?

807
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,480
 This poor little kid just wants a Christmas,

808
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,160
 but he's a ghost, he's flown away.

809
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,960
 It would be creepier to hear the noise,

810
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,480
 but to not see the action and not see the result of it.

811
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,820
 As well, none of the presents were unwrapped.

812
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,980
 The boy wasn't doing anything,

813
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,220
 but the sound of the presents being unwrapped.

814
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,020
 And it's interesting too, if you think about it.

815
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,380
 I made the joke at the beginning, how did he hear it?

816
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,540
 'Cause that's kind of a quiet thing

817
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,380
 unless you're really going to town on him.

818
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,380
 Maybe the sound was like projected to him

819
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,140
 for whatever reason.

820
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,620
 Like again, with ghosts, there's,

821
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,380
 ghost physics is such an interesting thing.

822
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,800
 It doesn't get talked about enough.

823
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,280
 That's why I kind of dwell on it.

824
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,080
 'Cause I just find that angle of paranoia,

825
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,200
 it just doesn't, maybe it's not sexy enough for researchers,

826
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,440
 but I find it absolutely fascinating.

827
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,640
 We got one more story here we're gonna take a look at.

828
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,640
 Let's go meet another young boy named Silas,

829
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,360
 again, fake name.

830
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,960
 He said when he was about six or seven years old,

831
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,760
 he woke up in the middle of the night

832
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,640
 and had to use his bathroom.

833
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,220
 But he doesn't wanna get out of bed.

834
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,500
 Not 'cause he's like lazy or nothing,

835
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,100
 but because he's terrified.

836
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,020
 He all of a sudden, he doesn't say whether

837
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,340
 or not this is a normal fear he has,

838
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,420
 but definitely in this moment, he was afraid that something,

839
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,300
 terribly afraid something was going to get him

840
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,300
 once he got out of bed.

841
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,860
 Now that's a normal childhood fear.

842
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,620
 So I'm assuming this is just something he dealt with,

843
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,620
 but he goes, "I worked up the courage

844
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,180
 "and I hopped out of bed."

845
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,420
 (sighs)

846
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,540
 Hmm, it's nothing, okay.

847
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,320
 Totally fine, totally fine.

848
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,960
 The growing wet stain on his pajamas say otherwise.

849
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,120
 But he finally makes it into the bathroom,

850
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,120
 walks down the hallway, goes to the bathroom,

851
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,360
 shuts off the bathroom line,

852
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,360
 and when he steps out of the bathroom back into the hallway,

853
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:13,400
 he sees a truly terrifying sight.

854
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,320
 Materializing out of the wall.

855
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,320
 It's like reaching right out of the wall is a arm.

856
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,360
 And he goes, "I looked down at it,

857
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,380
 "and to this day, I could tell you everything about it.

858
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,720
 "I could tell you everything.

859
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,820
 "I could totally describe this arm to you."

860
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,040
 And he goes, "A lot of people said it's a dream.

861
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,280
 "My parents said it was a dream."

862
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,780
 Definitely when I told them about it,

863
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,820
 when I jumped into bed in just a few moments.

864
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,260
 And he goes, "In my mind, I think it has to be a dream, right?

865
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,180
 "It has to be a dream.

866
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,900
 "But I've never had a dream where I can remember

867
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,060
 "all of these details."

868
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,800
 And he goes, "I don't think it was a dream.

869
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,260
 "Cause I had just gone to the bathroom.

870
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,660
 "I got up, walked to the bathroom, went to the bathroom,

871
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,940
 "and came out, but this is what I saw.

872
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,120
 "This arm reached out of the wall.

873
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:09,780
 "It was a big hand with long, skinny fingers.

874
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:17,820
 "The flesh on the hand looked to be real.

875
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,940
 "Rawning.

876
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:24,060
 "Looked as if it was decomposing

877
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,820
 "as it was coming out of the wall."

878
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,420
 He said, "It was a pale, dead, decomposing hand

879
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,420
 "reaching out.

880
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,020
 "But it's not just the hand."

881
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,900
 He goes, "I could see the wrist.

882
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,660
 "I could see part of the forearm."

883
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,500
 He said, "It was wearing what looked like

884
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,300
 "a white button-up sleeve shirt."

885
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,500
 So you know, like the shirts you wear

886
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,300
 when you go to a job interview or whatever

887
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,540
 to make it look like you're not a slob.

888
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,500
 He said it was like that.

889
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,060
 He goes, "It was a shirt, it was a long sleeve button-up shirt."

890
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,020
 He goes, "But the sleeve was rolled back a bit."

891
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,860
 It was unbuttoned at the cuff

892
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,820
 and it was rolled back a little bit.

893
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,820
 And in what might be one of the most bizarre details,

894
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,540
 one of the most bizarre details

895
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,220
 when you're talking about an arm

896
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,940
 manifesting through a wall,

897
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,620
 you think, we did a whole story about phantom hands,

898
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,820
 these hands that were chasing around children in Mexico.

899
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,580
 It's a very popular boogeyman-esque story over there,

900
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,040
 possibly a real phenomenon.

901
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,900
 You think hand reaching out of a wall,

902
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,300
 monster hand gobbling hand, ghost hand, zombie hand,

903
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,900
 those all make sense in this world,

904
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,000
 this paranormal world that we live in,

905
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,380
 monster under your bed,

906
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,580
 boogeyman in your closet, all of this.

907
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,460
 This hand is reaching out of the wall.

908
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,380
 It's a big hand with long, skinny fingers.

909
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,260
 It looks like it's wearing a shirt

910
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,220
 that's rolled up a bit and that's the cuff's undone.

911
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,100
 And, so bizarre,

912
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,540
 and it was wearing a watch.

913
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,980
 So that, again, sometimes it's those small details

914
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,540
 that really, what is this?

915
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,820
 What is it?

916
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,880
 You have to start asking all sorts of questions

917
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,300
 and the first thing that pops in my head

918
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,420
 is do ghosts even wear watches?

919
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,460
 Have we had enough ghost accounts?

920
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,580
 'Cause we'll often describe the clothes that they're wearing.

921
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,820
 But a ghost with a watch,

922
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,980
 I mean, honestly, it's bizarre to think about.

923
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,020
 You kind of chuckle and you go,

924
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,100
 "Well, of course they would have a watch."

925
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,940
 I mean, if you dye it and you believe the ghosts

926
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,620
 are wearing the clothes, dah, dah, dah, dah.

927
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,260
 But a watch is a symbol of the limitations of reality.

928
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,520
 It's a measurement of time.

929
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,940
 I'm sure there are ghost stories about, I'm sure,

930
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,260
 I can't think of any of them at the time I had,

931
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,780
 but I'm sure there are ghost stories, not a ton,

932
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,140
 but a few about a ghost who always had a gold pocket watch.

933
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,780
 Like an old-timey Civil War ghost,

934
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,060
 always had a gold pocket watch.

935
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,660
 And the ghosts is still seen with the pocket watch.

936
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,300
 They may say the ghost,

937
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,500
 that he was known to be a meticulous timekeeper

938
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,020
 and now even in death, he'll turn the watch and look at it.

939
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,220
 I would argue that that would be

940
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,860
 what we call a residual haunting.

941
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,660
 It's not a ghost, it's not a soul you can interact with.

942
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,620
 It's a recording of an event.

943
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,540
 He put so much energy into obsessing over his watch

944
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,180
 that he left a little bit of it behind.

945
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,700
 In the right area, under the right conditions,

946
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,380
 it can leave an after image.

947
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,140
 A lot of ghosts are that.

948
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,220
 They're not the ghosts that you can actually talk to,

949
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,740
 interact with, or really have to be afraid of.

950
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,180
 A ghost with a watch, and I don't,

951
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,780
 we don't know what this is.

952
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,660
 And the story's not over yet either.

953
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,740
 But we don't know what this is.

954
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,380
 Why would a goblin need a watch?

955
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,380
 Why would any sort of entity, creature need a watch?

956
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,140
 I can't think of a ghost wearing a wristwatch

957
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,860
 because again, it's a limiting factor.

958
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,860
 It would be a reminder of what to a entity.

959
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,380
 It's just fascinating detail, right?

960
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,620
 What is, why is this, whatever it has, has a watch.

961
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,980
 Now, you go Jason, he's walking out of the bathroom.

962
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,460
 He's six or seven years old.

963
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,620
 He just woke him in the middle of the night.

964
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,780
 He shed enough of the bathroom light.

965
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,900
 We'll assume the hall lights on

966
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,820
 because he seems to be a bit of a scaredy cat.

967
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,860
 It turns out he had good reason to be.

968
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,660
 There's a whole arm appearing

969
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,860
 or most of an arm appearing out of the wall.

970
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,740
 You're allowed to be a little bit of a scaredy cat

971
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,100
 if you live in this house.

972
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,500
 We'll assume the hall lights on.

973
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,460
 It's possible the hall lights off.

974
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,660
 Who would be out of character for this kid?

975
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,940
 But how does he take in so much detail?

976
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,820
 It's the middle of the night.

977
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,820
 You just peed.

978
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,620
 He's walking around the house.

979
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,760
 Well, because it grabbed him.

980
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,980
 He saw this hand come out of the wall

981
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,500
 and it instantly locked onto his ankle.

982
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,980
 It was low to the ground.

983
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,380
 I should have said that earlier.

984
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,620
 He thinks it's like coming out to shake his hand.

985
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,540
 It came out of the wall low enough

986
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,060
 that the first place he grabbed.

987
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,860
 And I mean, it would be an effective place

988
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,660
 to grab someone is their ankle.

989
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,940
 If you have a strong enough grip,

990
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,660
 if you can grab their ankle.

991
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,020
 If you're ever in a fight and you were like,

992
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,780
 "Oh, I better materialize through this wall

993
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,460
 to get the upper hand on this guy."

994
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,940
 It's an effective place to grab anyone.

995
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,140
 And I would argue it's probably an even more effective place

996
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,980
 to grab a kid.

997
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,980
 They have tiny ankles.

998
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,740
 You can wrap your whole hand around it.

999
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,820
 This hand was giant.

1000
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,300
 Probably didn't have.

1001
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,580
 And again, he says big.

1002
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,220
 I guess it's not giant.

1003
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,420
 It's larger than a normal hand.

1004
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,500
 Wraps around his ankle.

1005
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,780
 He's stuck.

1006
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,040
 That's why he gets a good look at it.

1007
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,880
 He looks down.

1008
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,860
 He sees it coming out of the wall.

1009
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,700
 He's terrified.

1010
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,220
 It wraps around his ankle.

1011
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,060
 And he does have to struggle to get free of this hand.

1012
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,300
 But he does put up that struggle.

1013
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,380
 I mean, you imagine talking about adrenaline kicking in.

1014
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,080
 He is able to break free from this thing's grasp,

1015
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,540
 runs into his parents room and they convince him.

1016
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,900
 Well, they don't,

1017
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,340
 you could argue that they do convince him

1018
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,380
 'cause he's thinking about it today that,

1019
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,420
 "Maybe I was dreaming."

1020
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,340
 But they say you're just dreaming.

1021
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,560
 It's all a dream.

1022
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,020
 And he tells that story today and he goes,

1023
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,660
 "It had to have been a dream."

1024
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,700
 This is something we see happen so often

1025
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,100
 in the world of paranormal.

1026
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,340
 It had to have been a dream

1027
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,940
 because the reality of admitting that it's real

1028
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,800
 is too terrifying that a hand can reach out of the wall

1029
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,640
 and grab you.

1030
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,020
 And do God knows what?

1031
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,980
 So it was just a dream.

1032
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,740
 It's a fascinating story.

1033
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,820
 And I think that one is a truly terrifying story

1034
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,420
 of a child under assault from,

1035
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,020
 what type of entity is this thing?

1036
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,060
 We've been talking a lot about this.

1037
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,420
 So I don't wanna beat a dead horse,

1038
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,500
 but what could this be?

1039
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,660
 It's fascinating.

1040
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,860
 I don't know what it was.

1041
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,860
 I'll default to the ghost story,

1042
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,140
 but I don't even know why I'm picking that out.

1043
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,740
 And I'm wondering if he was always scared

1044
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,120
 of something under his bed,

1045
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,340
 or if this night the fear was more intense,

1046
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,820
 or if he was never scared of it,

1047
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,700
 and this was the first time he was actually afraid of it,

1048
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,340
 it's because that entity was watching him.

1049
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,380
 Like whatever it was,

1050
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,820
 whatever was in the house, in the walls,

1051
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:47,620
 was waiting for him.

1052
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,820
 And it could have got him in the bedroom.

1053
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,720
 It could have got him in the bathroom,

1054
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,900
 but it tried its luck in the hallway,

1055
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,300
 and Silas was able to get away.

1056
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:06,580
 I mean, imagine if this hand had latched onto him

1057
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,900
 in the bathroom.

1058
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,660
 I mean, that's all you,

1059
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,460
 one quick yank that kid's gonna smash his head

1060
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,420
 against the side of the bathroom sink,

1061
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,700
 or on the toilet bowl.

1062
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,180
 You know, you get a pretty serious injury,

1063
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,180
 if not just an outright life-ending injury.

1064
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,480
 Hard enough he ain't, he'd smash his head open.

1065
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,320
 What if it got him in the bedroom,

1066
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,360
 and didn't try going for, you know,

1067
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,160
 making it look like it was an accident,

1068
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,840
 making it look like he slipped in the bathroom,

1069
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,320
 smashed his head on something,

1070
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,040
 just yanked him under the bed,

1071
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,760
 took him into the wall.

1072
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,080
 But the wall is a wall to us.

1073
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,620
 What was it to this entity?

1074
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,820
 What would Silas have gone?

1075
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:02,980
 And again, this is one of those stories,

1076
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,660
 like if you woke up in the middle of the night

1077
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,300
 and your kid was gone.

1078
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,020
 And these stories happen.

1079
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,660
 These stories happen.

1080
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,140
 People go missing and we have zero clue

1081
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,980
 of where they went.

1082
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,820
 You're like, Jason, please, don't say.

1083
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,220
 I think Madeline McCann went in a wall.

1084
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:25,480
 I'm not saying every unexplained disappearance

1085
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,960
 is wall related, I'm not saying that.

1086
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,100
 But maybe some of them are.

1087
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,360
 And the thing is, it's so unbelievable that, I mean,

1088
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,800
 it would be easier to believe

1089
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,280
 that someone broke in your house

1090
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,120
 with no evidence of a break and took your kid,

1091
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,720
 leaving no DNA, nothing.

1092
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,600
 The kid just vanished,

1093
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,440
 never seen again, can't figure it out.

1094
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,760
 That's easier to believe.

1095
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,040
 You're chasing my guess, that is easier to believe.

1096
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,540
 Then the wall got him.

1097
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,240
 But what I find so fascinating is that

1098
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,360
 you wouldn't believe it, you wouldn't believe it at all.

1099
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,360
 But here we have a kid who experienced it.

1100
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,300
 He goes, it was not a dream,

1101
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,760
 but it had to have been a dream

1102
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,960
 because it doesn't make sense.

1103
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,960
 But he looked down, he saw this thing come out of the wall.

1104
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,500
 He could see all these details about it,

1105
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,440
 including, again, like if he saw Casper's arm reach out

1106
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,720
 or a demonic creature claw

1107
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,920
 that looked like something from some movie

1108
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,960
 he had recently seen,

1109
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,600
 then he could be a little more suspect, sure.

1110
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,840
 But to look down and see some sort of crazy entity

1111
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,360
 wearing a watch, such a bizarre detail,

1112
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,600
 he sees this thing come out of the wall,

1113
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,560
 grab onto him, hold onto him,

1114
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,080
 he has to break its grip

1115
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,760
 and then go running down the hallway.

1116
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,400
 He experienced it and he can't believe it.

1117
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,400
 He was the one who felt the hand,

1118
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,560
 who saw the hand, who had to break free from the hand

1119
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,040
 and even he's like, this just can't be true.

1120
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,160
 So how are people, how are investigators

1121
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,500
 supposed to believe in these things?

1122
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,000
 How are people trying to solve these missing people cases?

1123
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,360
 I know this sounds insensitive, I get it.

1124
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,360
 But again, I think even if 1% of missing person cases

1125
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,560
 are paranormal related,

1126
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,360
 and I honestly, I think that's probably

1127
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,680
 a pretty good estimate,

1128
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,440
 1% of all missing person cases

1129
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,520
 may have a paranormal answer.

1130
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,600
 But we wouldn't even know where to start looking like,

1131
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,440
 what are you gonna do,

1132
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,640
 start knocking over gravestones,

1133
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,200
 be like, tell us what you know, tell us what you know.

1134
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,960
 It would just, but again, like again,

1135
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,040
 I feel like I'm beating a dead horse,

1136
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,400
 we've talked about it a couple of different times recently,

1137
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,840
 but I guess it's been on my mind.

1138
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,880
 It's such a terrifying thought to think

1139
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,640
 that the world of the paranormal is so dangerous

1140
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,160
 it can get you at any time.

1141
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,400
 But the fact of the matter is it can.

1142
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,080
 So it's easier for us to just go,

1143
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,520
 no, no, that's not possible.

1144
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,760
 It's just dreams and spooky stories that we read online

1145
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,260
 or someone tells us in a podcast or it's just,

1146
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,960
 it's not real.

1147
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,680
 Can't be real.

1148
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,000
 And while those may be comforting thoughts

1149
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,960
 to fall asleep to,

1150
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,920
 those denials of the dangers of the world

1151
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,000
 of the paranormal will not save you.

1152
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,880
 When a rotting pale hand reaches out of the wall

1153
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,320
 and drags you into their darkness.

1154
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,840
 (upbeat music)

1155
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,640

 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy

1159
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,720
 and true crime podcast.

1160
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,240
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

1161
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,840
 We glad you listened to it today.

1162
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,680
 - DeadRabber.

1163
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,260
 (upbeat music)

1164
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:26,880
 - In America, it's estimated that 4% of people in prison

1165
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,920
 are actually innocent.

1166
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,560
 - When I saw them for the very first time,

1167
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,960
 like I knew who my jury was gonna be doing trial.

1168
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,200
 To be honest, I knew I lost them.

1169
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,120
 - In 2002, the state of Georgia found Keri guilty

1170
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,600
 for his alleged involvement in a vicious rape.

1171
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,920
 Only a small percentage of those people

1172
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,080
 have their convictions overturned.

1173
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,760
 - You know, as one great justice said many years ago,

1174
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,120
 we don't find our witnesses from church pews.

1175
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,880
 - What series of events led to Keri's wrongful conviction?

1176
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,240
 Could this happen to anyone?

1177
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,120
 What finally convinced the courts to overturn his conviction?

1178
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,480
 From Zapier, in partnership with the Georgia Innocence Project,

1179
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,840
 this is the 4%.
