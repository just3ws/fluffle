00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 This is the story of a home of family game nights and living room dance recitals.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Wow, that was some storm.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 It's also the story of an insurance company that offered information and advice to help prepare that home for the worst.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 If it matters to you, Traveler's Insurance will help protect it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Travelers, it's better under the umbrella.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Speak to an independent agent today.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 In ancient China, a battle rages on, and a general comes up with a daring maneuver.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Then we travel to Athens, Georgia to take a look at the portal to hell and a staircase that leads nowhere.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 I'm your host Jason Carvener. I'm having a great day.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. Don't forget Thanksgiving, 12 p.m.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Pacific Standard Time. We're going to do a live stream episode on YouTube, a totally live episode.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 I'm going to be on a little bit earlier to talk to you guys after the episode.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 We'll continue the conversation, answer any questions, just kind of chat.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 If you guys don't go to the YouTube, don't worry.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I'm going to upload that as a podcast episode later than night on Thursday.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 And then I'm not going to do an episode on Friday. That's going to be a little break.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Those live episodes take a lot out of me, honestly.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 It takes a lot to sit in front of a webcam.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 It takes a lot to have to talk and know you're not going to be able to edit it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 It's what it is. It's kind of draining as a performer.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 But I like spending that time with you, and we did the last Thanksgiving.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 It was totally awesome. And I know this Thanksgiving, it's even.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 I don't, it's so important. I don't even have to pronounce the G at the end.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 This Thanksgiving, not everyone can be with their family.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 So let's be a family together and tune into that live stream or listen to it later.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 But I'm sure maybe you have a family that loves you and you can spend time with them.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Still listen to the, listen to the episode.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 But speaking of someone who does love you, let's give a round of applause to our newest Patreon supporter, Kim So-Raw.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Kim So-Raw is walking in. She's blowing kisses to everyone.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Oh, you caught one. Oh, that's pretty cute.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Kim, you're going to be our captain or pilot of this episode.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 You can't support the Patreon. Totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 That is a way you can also help out the show.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 So I turn around and Kim So-Raw already has a patch and a peg leg and like a bird.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I don't know, I don't know how she's snuck in with all this stuff, but she's in full pirate gear and that's perfect.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Because we are taking the dead rabbit dreadnought.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 So let's get her in the captain's perch and we are all sitting on the, the, the wood.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 We're just sitting on the wood of the ship as it sets sail to ancient China.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 [Exhales]

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 We have to have a warship because we are headed into a battle zone.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 So everyone's sharpening their knives the whole time, getting ready, making shields, tearing the bow, tearing the wood of the boat apart.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 They're like, "Look, I made a bunch of shields as we're sinking."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 But it's okay. We're almost there.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Now I found out about this story from Noyce Poetry.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 So I wanted to give a shout out to Noyce Poetry for bringing this story to my attention.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 That's really, really awesome.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 The year is 623 AD.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 [Groans]

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 And then like Zack Snyder Rock music starts playing and you're like Jason explain the same first.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Just don't make grunting noises and then add a soundtrack.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 What it is, it's old timey.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 So it's all like sepia tone, but like red and stuff because you know, there's the sun.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 It's a army of nomads coming over the hills.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 [Groans]

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Now you guys get the visual right? They're moving all slow.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Generals like, "Dude, we could run in slow motion. We got a battle to fight."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 These are members of the Tuyan Kingdom and they've had their eyes on the Gansu province.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Are they ready to take it?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 I don't know why nomads have a kingdom, but the kingdom constantly moves.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 The castle, they're like, "Where do we put the castle?"

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 It's over there now.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 This army of nomads lay siege to the Gansu province.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Now the Gansu province was territory of the Tang Dynasty.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 And the emperor sitting back at home and he's like, "Hey, did you hear that rock music?"

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 I'm pretty sure he got invaded. I heard rock music and the generals are like, "Yeah, we heard that too. It was pretty bitchin'.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 So the emperor sends out General Chai Shao to go there, to go to Gansu and say, "You're really a general. You can kind of think outside the box."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 General Chai takes his army out to meet them at Gansu province.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 But see, the nomads have been there for so long and it's kind of a hilly area that when the Tang troops get there, they're just getting picked off by arrows.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 The nomads have a high ground. They've got a whole bunch of arrows. They prepared for this.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 They didn't just bring one. They're recycling. They prepared for this.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 So they're just picking off troops constantly. General Chai is like, "Okay."

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Because I need to take that hill, but it's pretty well defended.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 I got all these men here, but I think I'm going to need to send in a special strike team.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Some time passes. And the nomads are on the top of the hill. They got their arrows ready.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 They're waiting for these troops to make another move.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 But the troops aren't making a move. Instead, an elite task force of only three soldiers are moving behind enemy lines.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 As the nomads are in their battle formation, just in case the Tang forces advance again, behind them, they hear...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 [singing]

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 And they're like, "Okay, that's not a joke. That's not as excited a joke. That's actual music playing."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 [singing]

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And a couple of the nomads turn around to see where the music's coming from. And on a hill, overlooking the Nomad camp are three figures.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 One of them has a little guitar. Technically, it's called a pipa. But if you guys get it, it's a string instrument.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 [singing]

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 But that's not what's keeping the nomads' attention.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Nomads like, "Hey, look at...look what's up on that hill." And another guy turns around and is like, "Oh my God."

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Because what is on the top of the hill is not only a do with a pipa, but two super hot chicks dancing sexy.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 They're all rubbing up on each other. They're getting...I'm not making that up to be sleetious either.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 They were doing an erotic dance with each other to the sound of...

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 [singing]

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 You might have had a better tune than that. The nomads see these two hot women bumping and grinding a dude with a little guitar playing a song,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 and they're absolutely mesmerized by the beauty, the sheer eroticism of this moment.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 And in that moment, you're kind of lost, right? Maybe you haven't seen a woman in 30 years. You're a nomad. You keep forgetting where you put the women.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 But as you're watching these women, you start to hear noises. You start to hear noises about 4,000 men behind you.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 [singing]

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 It seems to get a little closer. You're still mesmerized by this awesome sight you're seeing. Maybe about 800 men behind you.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 [singing]

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Stop looking at...Pay attention!

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 No, no, the people are still watching this. General Chai slaughtered 500 men, because the majority of them were staring at hot chicks.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Now, there was more than 500 men there. He's just...that's all he could do. He's like, "Oh, my arm's cramping up, guys. Let's take a break."

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 We should have stretched before this massacre. The rest of them ran away. I would be furious, dude.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 First off, I'd be furious that I was so far back in the crowd that I couldn't see the girls. I just see two kind of like feminine shaped blurry objects.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 I'm like, "Is that a mirage? Are those two palm trees like knocking up against each other in the wind?"

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 I'd be mad that I don't have a good front seat view. Secondly, I'd be mad that as the arrow is going through my neck,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 I see the guys in front of me still hanging out with these chicks, still trying to get their phone number, still trying to invent a phone and the number system, just so they can get their phone number.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 I'd be super mad that my compatriots, my countrymen were so thirsty that 500 dudes got killed, and then the rest just ran away.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 So that is the story of General Chai, his ultimate secret weapon. They should use this in war more often.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 But here's my question. When I was telling this story, I kind of paused. Did he bring the two hot chicks with him?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Like, was General Chai lead this army out into the middle of nowhere, into Gansi province? Sorry if you live there. I'm sure it's a lovely place.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 I heard they have great entertainment, but he's leading this army out there and the whole time, like his sergeants were like, "Dude, we are well stocked for the war," and General Chai's like, "Yes."

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 The sergeants were like, "But I do have a question about them!" And on the horse, the next one was, "Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude." And there's two chicks dancing on the horse.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 And General Chai's like, "Listen, I don't know. I need them. I might not. We may get there. The nomads may not be prepared. We take them by surprise."

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 Or they could be on a hill shooting arrows at us. The sergeants were like, "That's a weird contingency plan."

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 But that is why he was a general and the other guy was a sergeant. He could think two steps ahead.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Kim, so raw. Let's go ahead and hop in the carbonar copter. We're gonna get you in the pilot seat of that.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 You're still wearing your pirate costume. Might be a little hard with a patch in your eye to fly an advanced helicopter.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 But I'm sure you will do a great job. We are leaving behind Gansi province in China. We are headed out to Athens, Georgia.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.800
 Georgia. It's a long trip. The whole time and practicing my dance moves. I'm making you play

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.260
 a guitar and...You're like, my fingers are bleeding. I'm dancing in front of you. C'mon

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.840
 man keep dancing. Is this distracting you? You're like, "It's annoying me" is what it's

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.960
 doing. We're flying out to Athens, Georgia and I want you to fly over there. I'm kind

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.720
 of pointing out the helicopter as I'm still wiggling. I want you to fly over there and

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:25.040
 we're flying over and we see in Georgia, off the Atlanta highway is a hobby lobby. And

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.200
 standing outside that store is a young man named Tyler. Now I recently had an interview.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.040
 I recently was interviewed by a journalist about podcasts and how they find sources, how

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.760
 they verify sources, how they cite sources. It was kind of behind the scenes, podcasting

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.720
 thing like that, ethics in sourcing. And Tyler was the one who was writing that article and

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.440
 interviewed me with them. He posted that on Reddit looking for interviews so I went

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.840
 through his Reddit history because I think that's kind of what everyone does. And I

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.200
 saw that he also had posted about something known as the portal of hell. So I said, "Tell

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.760
 you what young man, I'll make you a trade. I will do your interview for you, but I want

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.560
 to hear your story about the portal of hell." So as we're flying over this location in Georgia,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.600
 we see Tyler waving at us and Kimso Ross getting ready to land and I'm like, "No, no,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.120
 we're not actually going to land on this story." Just kind of hover here and Tyler's like

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.600
 shucking his shoulders down there. This is an interesting story, but I don't really

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.440
 want to go too in depth to it, but it's a good gateway for our next story. So we're

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.480
 sure we'll leave Tyler hanging out down there. He packed a lunch. He packed a whole picnic

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.240
 for us. In Georgia off the Atlanta highway, there is a location known as the portal of

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.640
 hell or hell's gate. It's behind the Hobby Lobby. Oh no, no, no, no, no. It's actually

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.440
 behind Beach Haven Baptist Church. Or does it exist at all? This is an interesting story,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.520
 but it's just a little bite-sized story. There's an old spooky house in this area that was

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.600
 built in 1910. And supposedly, and I read this, I read a bunch of sources on this. Tyler

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.720
 told me a version of this story, I read other versions of this story. There's an altar

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:05.320
 in the backyard. There's rumors of Satan worshipers, KKK members running the house. There's a

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.640
 naked guy on a horse, which puts the other two groups to shame, right? Like Satanists,

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.480
 yeah, you know whatever, the little cliche, KKK, again, little cliche. Naked guy on a

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.860
 horse. That's pretty dope. You can touch a tree out there, it bleeds. The reason why

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:25.680
 we're not landing for this story is because this is a typical urban legend in a town,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:32.080
 a spooky house in a location off the beaten track. So it's not at the Hobby Lobby. You

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.600
 don't walk into Hobby Lobby and it's there. It's like behind the Hobby Lobby. And even

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.880
 the fact that they can't really agree on, because I read a bunch of different sources

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.360
 on this, they can't agree on the location, also adds the idea that this is probably a

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.940
 story crafted around a location than a location having a story organically. But every neighborhood

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:55.920
 has one of these houses. Every neighborhood has the spooky house. What's interesting about

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.760
 this house is two things. One, it's very well known. If I tried finding spooky houses in

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.480
 my hometown or your hometown or whatever, unless it's Amityville, you're gonna have

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.200
 a hard time finding a lot of resources on this. There were so many resources on the

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.280
 portal of hell in Georgia that there was enough to start contradicting each other. All these

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.360
 different legends people had heard growing up. They're posting them on Reddit, they're

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.800
 posting them on these websites. So although that was interesting, normally they don't

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.280
 get so famous they have multiple mentions across the websites. But then something else

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.920
 is going on and Tyler keyed me in on this and when he was talking about it, my eyebrow

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.600
 kind of raised, the house is now private property and they're going to demolish it or renovate

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.680
 the entire area to build some sort of park. To preserve the area. And the reason why that

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.320
 raised my eyebrow, it's probably the same reason why it should have raised your eyebrow,

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.360
 we've talked about this a lot of times on the show. Places that have a reputation for

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:58.840
 being haunted. Being purchased by the local government or a group of outside interests

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:05.480
 like the dark entity or the dark entity association bought that place in Connecticut. We've seen

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.040
 this happen several times. The US government built a base around the hole that Charles

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:16.280
 Manson was going to go in after Helter Skelter, which he believe led to paradise under earth.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.080
 There's a lot of different examples where these places that are supposedly haunted or

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.920
 have some sort of power, the government buys it up and they are looking at this. I saw that

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:33.040
 they did fill out budgetary concerns to do all this stuff. But I wouldn't be surprised

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.360
 if this goes on for years and years and years and they never do anything with the area and

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.520
 it's just a cordoned off area that they can say, "Oh, no trespassing, this is actually

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.000
 county property. We're going to be building something here, it's not safe." And they just

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.680
 keep it that way for 10, 15, 20 years and the legend grows. Which would make me think

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.680
 that there may be something actually behind the portal of hell as far as a paranormal activity

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.120
 goes. Or you have government officials who just like riding in their horses naked and

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.600
 that's the safest place to do it. Listen to that, you want to know what's shocking though

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:08.360
 outside of Saint worshippers riding horses naked to fix this area up for a park, $13

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:15.800
 million. If you gave me $13 million I would give every person in Georgia a piggyback ride.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.440
 That's funner than a park. Now Kim, go ahead and pick up Tyler, put him in the carbon

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:26.200
 decopter, he has a picnic lunch ready for us, we are headed out to a truly terrifying story

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:32.800
 in Athens, Georgia. Pretty sure the portal of hell was on the outskirts of Athens, Georgia,

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.080
 I don't think it was in the city proper. But now we are actually in Athens, Georgia, we're

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.520
 headed to the University of Georgia. So I hope you guys brought your schoolbooks, I

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:46.360
 hope you guys brought your scantrons. We all hop out of the carbon decopter, we're walking

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.760
 around the University of Georgia. This was the other story Tyler told me and this was

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.120
 one that again had a ton of sources on, really good source of information for this type of

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.160
 stuff. Really weird one. We're going to let Kim lead the way though, we're going to let

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.280
 Kim lead the way with a flashlight, we're walking through the darkness, we're sneaking

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:12.160
 onto campus, it's night, we're headed to Joe Brown Hall. Open the door, it's all spooky.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.080
 Actually the hall is not spooky itself, it's just one part of it, I'm sure the door is

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.440
 automated. But anyways we're walking through Joe Brown Hall. Joe Brown Hall is just another

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:27.040
 building on campus. Dorm rooms, teachers offices, there's a little debate about that. We'll

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.560
 put a pin in that for right now. But it's a typical college building. Now according

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.200
 to Carol Bishop, she's the archival assistant of the Special Collections Library and she

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:42.920
 also runs a ghost tour here at University of Georgia. In 1971, Thanksgiving break, ooh

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:50.720
 I didn't realize it's super close. There's a student, he's the only one in the dorms.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.480
 Everyone else has gone for student break, he wanted to stay home and play pong or something.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.080
 Whatever he did back in 1971 for fun. Just sit there, inanimate, that's what they love

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:05.840
 to do. But something went wrong, deadly wrong, because after Thanksgiving break people come

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.160
 back and they're like oh that was so good, I ate all that turkey. They're walking into

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:17.800
 school and there is this student, this nameless student hanging in his door room. Super gross,

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.920
 right? He'd been hanging for three or four days and when the janitors came everyone's

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.720
 like I'll manage to say Thanksgiving. Throwing it up, stove top stuff in everywhere. The

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.680
 janitors come in, the cleaning crew comes in and they said it was so gross and so gory.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.320
 They don't matter how much they tried cleaning up the blood, cleaning up the body fluids,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.200
 all this stuff, they could never get all the stains out, they couldn't get the smell out.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.040
 It had been three days, hold your questions guys, hold your questions. It had been three

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.520
 whole days according to Carol Bishop or maybe five, doesn't matter. It was so stinky that

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:58.560
 they just said we can't do this anymore. So the doorway to his dorm room, they walled

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.440
 in. But there's a curious little reminder of this story, there's actually a staircase

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:11.480
 in Joe Brown Hall that dead ends to a wall. That is the story of the staircase to nowhere.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.120
 Or is it? No it's not. There's more to the story, there's more to the story because I'll

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.160
 tell you this right now. I used to work at a crematory, bodies can start smelling, bodies

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.400
 will smell after five days and they'll get all gory and goopy and stuff like that. But

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.080
 not to the point that you couldn't clean them up. Like unless they had, oh it was the 70s,

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.800
 maybe they had really thick shag carpet. I'm gonna bet dollars to donuts that you could

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:40.640
 clean up five day old gore. I'd almost be certain of that. I'm not saying it would be

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.760
 the place people would want to live in their door room, yippee! I got the tragedy room,

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:51.040
 but you could do it. If you had your choice between eliminating a room and walling it

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.600
 up and plastering it over or just spending a weekend scrubbing and ripping out carpet

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.500
 and tile and stuff like that, it doesn't make sense. But that's why that story actually

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:05.960
 is not true. That story is not true. There's another version of the story that I found multiple

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.720
 times online. There was a police cadet at the time. He was working at the police academy

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:17.640
 and one of the things they do to the new cadets is they make him look at really gross photos.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.360
 Make him look at like people popping pimples, people pulling slivers out underneath their

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.440
 fingernails and cops are like "Oh, is this disgusting? Does this have anything to do

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.640
 with their job?" The chiefs are like "No, I just have a fetish for watching young men

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:35.120
 have disgusting looks on their faces." That's my thing. He says that an unknown year, he

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.480
 said "I don't remember the year it happened. I remember seeing the photos and I remember

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:45.800
 being told this story. It was late summer. It was around August, was this guy's story.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.520
 There was a professor who had a staircase that led right into his office in Joe Brownhall.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:58.360
 He was also an avid fan of autoerotic affixiation. If you don't know what that is, you don't

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.880
 have to hang yourself, but it's where you cut off the supply of oxygen to your brain

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.720
 as you're masturbating and then right before you, orgasm, for lack of a better word, there's

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.640
 a lot of words. I don't have a lack of a word, but in polite company, right before you orgasm

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.880
 you'll stop choking yourself and the blood goes back into your brain and it's this supposedly

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:25.560
 amazing rush. I never tried it. You should be evident I'm still alive. It's super dangerous,

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.800
 it can kill you and maybe you just start off using your hand, but eventually it's August

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.680
 of an unknown year and you're tying a noose because that's how a lot of people do it.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:41.200
 That's how the leasing of in excess died. That's how Kung Fu died, David Carradine.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.000
 You have, it's super dangerous. So the idea is this professor really left autoerotic affixiation

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.280
 when he messed up and he hung there for anywhere from a few weeks to a full month. Now we're

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:00.840
 cooking with bodily fluids, right? After a couple weeks, you're going to have a really

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.200
 hard time getting that smell out. You're going to have a really, really hard time getting

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.760
 that smell out. I mean, again, five days isn't going to be easy. I'm not going to be like,

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.080
 what? No, why? They can happen here. It doesn't smell so bad. As it sits and it soaks and it

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:18.760
 gets all gory and more elements of the decay are coming in and the blood turns black and

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.120
 all that stuff. It gets super, super thick. He basically was mel- It was like if you were

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:28.040
 holding a popsicle on a rope on a hot day. You probably didn't need that visual, but

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.760
 he was just melting out of the noose. So it's George's summers. So it's getting extra boiling

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.240
 in there. You guys like, take it Jason. I'm eating a pot pie right now. Can you stop talking

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.480
 about this? Okay, sure, sure. And so for, there is no way they were going to get that

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.000
 smell out. They tried over and over again. This cop said he had actually heard that they

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.800
 sent in firefighters with scuba tanks on and even they were throwing up, which would be

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.160
 hilarious to watch a scuba tank throw up. Hopefully it was one of those big old timey

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.400
 ones with like the glass viewpoint, the big ball heading, just see it filling up with

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.440
 puke. You're like, Jason, I'm still eating my pot pie. I'm still eating my pot pie.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.040
 Sorry. I should think we're done. So anyways, that was that story and I've seen that story

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.200
 go around as well. Now what's interesting is there are parts of the story that are

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.880
 true. The main part of the story, like the portal to hell, people can't even really agree

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.920
 where the building's at. Joe Brown Hall does have a staircase that leads to nowhere. It

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.120
 leads to a dead end and I'll actually post a photo on my Twitter and my Instagram because

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.560
 I want you guys to see it. Somebody painted an infinite doorway on the wall. It's really

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.440
 cool looking. So it's like you get to the top of the stairs and you're just looking down

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.760
 infinity. It's that what is it? The Kruger effect or something like that where you can

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.080
 see the image keep getting reflected farther than farther than that. Really cool. It's

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:54.000
 true. There is a staircase leading to a wall. Your mind thinks obviously that's not a design

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.840
 quirk. There must have been something behind that wall. But you're hearing the story about

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.160
 the student who, in the version that I read from Carol, it wasn't implied that it was

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.280
 autoerotic affixiation. It wasn't specifically stated as suicide either. So maybe she was

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.120
 keeping it clean for the students. The police cadet goes, "Oh no, the dude was checking

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.720
 off." But the big difference was it was a professor in his office and it was in August

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:23.480
 in this hot August sun for a week or a month. The other one was a cold Georgia Thanksgiving

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:30.480
 break. Let's give a shout out to PHP Apple and Gaius Julius Kaiser. They actually did

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.400
 a lot of digging on this. They were posting this on Reddit. Really found the truth behind

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:43.360
 this story. March 2nd, 1972, they found the article, they found the exact date that will

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:50.680
 tell us what happened behind that wall. 26 year old University of Georgia student Stanley

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:57.440
 Park Haddock hung himself in his dorm room. He'd only been up there for a few days. But

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.180
 the reason why the cops don't think it was a suicide was because his pants were down

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:06.700
 around his ankles. So they're looking at it and they're going, "This is weird. It's

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.120
 super weird. Like we've seen it before, autoerotic affixiation happens." But it's also possible

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.500
 that maybe he hated pants. He hated pants so he wanted to take them off and commit suicide.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.980
 But there's an odd clue in this story. When Tyler told me it, I was like, "What are you

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:27.980
 talking about? I didn't say that to him." He's like, "And then they found." And I was

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:33.860
 like, "What? I'm thinking, okay, what does that mean?" But when I read it in context

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:38.060
 I was like, "Oh, okay. Now I know what Tyler was trying to say." Not only did they find

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:45.100
 a dead man hanging with his pants around his ankles, they found donuts. I was like, "Who

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:51.180
 cares if they found donuts?" But apparently this was the clue. This is why I'm not a police

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.700
 officer. When the police walked in, they found this guy hanging with his pants around his

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.060
 ankles. They found fresh donuts. Well, they wore fresh when he bought them five days ago,

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:05.820
 but they found new donuts. And they're so funny. This is what the cops thought. And this is

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:12.300
 true. They thought no one would ever buy fresh donuts and then kill themselves because donuts

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.700
 were hands down the most delicious food out there. There is no one on earth who would

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.700
 come home with a dozen donuts, set them down and goes, "Now my story is over. The saga

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.540
 of me comes to an end." You'd eat the donuts and then you'd feel better and then everything

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.620
 in life would go on. That was their clue. The pants around the ankles you could figure

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.660
 out, I don't know, maybe he was, maybe he borrowed his big brother's jeans, but the

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:41.780
 donuts, the brand new donuts made them think that he had actually accidentally killed himself

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:47.620
 doing an autoerotic asphyxiation. It's tragic. I think it's an interesting story and we

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.660
 are walking out of there with the donut. Stanley is looking down on us as a ghost

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.220
 he's waving to us. He's eating ghost donuts. So everything worked out okay. But as we're

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.860
 walking down the staircase and we're eating donuts, something still doesn't sit right

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:08.660
 with me with this story. Even though this is a true story, I don't think that's what's

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:16.420
 behind the wall. Hear me out. Nowhere in that article that I read did they say, and then

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:20.460
 the maintenance crew sealed up his dorm room. No one would ever get in there again. They

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:25.740
 just said on March 2nd, which again, very good weather. You're not going to have massive

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:32.100
 levels of super stinky decay. Again, I'm not saying you want a dead body in your house

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.020
 for five days. What I'm saying is that's not a level where you would never be able to

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:41.660
 clean it up. Nowhere in the article does it say that they sealed it up. This is my theory.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.100
 That yes, that story is true. That Stanley did have a horrible accident and accidentally

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:51.540
 killed himself. But I don't think that's what's behind that wall of that staircase. Because

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.620
 I've been in a lot of dorm rooms in my life and I've never seen one that has a staircase

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.980
 for a single room. I mean, you gotta be like cock of the block if you're like, "See you

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.180
 guys later, you're walking up the stairs to your room." That doesn't make sense. And

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:10.300
 what's interesting is when Tyler first told me this story, he said, and I might be misquoting

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:16.260
 him, but I believe this is what I heard, he said that behind that walled up door is an

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:22.540
 entire hallway, which I would think would imply there's other multiple rooms back there.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:29.380
 That makes sense. The idea of a stairway going to just one room, you have an entire floor

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:36.180
 dedicated to one room, it doesn't make sense. I think that the story of Stanley is true

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.900
 and that story has been transported to answer the mystery of what that staircase leads

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:48.340
 to. When in fact, that's not true. Now, Stanley's room could have been one of the several rooms

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:53.460
 in that hall. But if you have one room that's super stinky and as a college you want to

00:27:53.460 --> 00:28:00.020
 maximize the people on your campus, are you going to shut down an entire floor, half a

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:05.940
 floor, a wing, because one room's super stinky? Give them a discount, give those kids a discount.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:11.700
 You figure a way to take care of that without shutting off access to an entire wing. There's

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:16.940
 no way that door only leads to one room. It doesn't make sense from a design standpoint.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.620
 They want to shut all these rooms down just because it's stank. They definitely want to

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:27.420
 keep it shut down all this time. It happened back in 1972. You can get out smell, you can

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:33.660
 wipe away gore, you can clean up messes. But let's put on our conspiracy caps here and

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:40.180
 wrap the episode up like this. One thing that's hard to get rid of is paranormal activity.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:46.620
 Exorcist or not, sage, cleansings, anything like that, salt. If something's powerful

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:52.780
 enough, if something wants to stay long enough, it's not going to leave. Someone complains

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:57.260
 about the smell, you can cover up the smell. Someone wakes up in the middle of the night

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.620
 and there's a 24 year old man standing at the foot of their bed. How do you deal with

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:07.020
 that complaint? Some kid's doing his homework late at night, has his headphones on, and

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.820
 starts to feel like something's different in the room. And doesn't realize that just

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:18.260
 inches behind him, there's a face staring at the back of his head. In the shower room,

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:23.660
 you think you're alone until you hear wet footsteps walking behind you. These are things

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.820
 that no cleanup crew can take care of. Now would be a reason why you would seal off an

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:36.860
 entire wing. So if you ever find yourself in Athens, Georgia, I dare you to try to find

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:43.620
 out what's behind that bricked up door. Sure, there's another access point. A window you

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:49.540
 can scurry through, a heating vent for John McClain, you can pop through the heating vent.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:56.900
 And you'll find yourself in a darkened hallway that no living human has been in for almost

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:04.580
 50 years. Sealed off from the world. Moonlight coming in through a window that people have

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:11.500
 not glanced out of for decades. And while you're in this dark hallway, you have your

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:19.700
 sage, you have your crucifix, you're ready for anything. But then you smell a familiar

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:28.140
 smell. A smell that reminds you of happiness. You turn around and see a box of fresh donuts

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:33.020
 sitting in the darkness in front of you. You know your time is up. You know that this

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:41.980
 spirit is about to take you into the shadow realm. But at least before you die, you get

00:30:41.980 --> 00:31:11.260
 to eat a donut. You get to eat a ghost donut and then you die.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.840
 (upbeat music)

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.420
 (upbeat music)

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.000
 (upbeat music)

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.580
 (bright music)
