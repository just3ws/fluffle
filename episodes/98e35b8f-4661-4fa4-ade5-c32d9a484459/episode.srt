00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440

 British Swim School, make us flash.

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,260
 Today we look at a man who goes so crazy,

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,900
 he becomes an urban legend.

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,220
 And then we meet a young man driving down the road

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,540
 to visit his girlfriend on a rainy afternoon.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,500
 But when he loses control of his car

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,020
 and it goes over an embankment,

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,380
 he's hoping for a miracle.

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,880
 Instead, he finds a mystery today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

21
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,460
 (upbeat music)

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,960
 - Want a drink, though?

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,540
 (upbeat music)

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,260
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

25
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,340
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,300
 I'm your host Jason Carvener.

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,140
 I'm having a great day.

28
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,060
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,500
 Hope you guys are ready for some cool, paranormal action

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,820
 coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

31
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,660
 Everyone on your feet be prepared to salute

32
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,700
 one of our Thanksgiving live stream donators.

33
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,740
 Give it up for Rudy Jazz.

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,180
 Rudy Jazz, longtime Patreon supporter as well.

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,500
 Rudy, thank you so much for supporting the show.

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,620
 You guys can't support the Patreon

37
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,740
 or support the show financially.

38
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,300
 I totally understand that.

39
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,020
 Just help spread the word about the show

40
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,740
 really, really helps out a lot.

41
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,260
 Rudy Jazz, I'm gonna go ahead and touch the keys

42
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,740
 to the Jason Jalopy where he leaves behind Dead Rabbit Command.

43
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,900
 We're headed all the way out to Dover, Delaware.

44
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,140
 (upbeat music)

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,620
 And as we're headed back there,

46
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,420
 Rudy, go ahead and hit that time travel button.

47
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,140
 We're going back to the late '90s, early 2000s.

48
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,220
 So, (mimics music)

49
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,300
 Matrix, Shrek, a bunch of other movies

50
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,540
 came out in this time period.

51
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,020
 Music was so good.

52
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,860
 Some 41, Blink 182, Eiffel 65.

53
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,820
 You had all the hits, all the hits in this time period.

54
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,180
 And we're listening to them on repeat.

55
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,020
 I'm blue.

56
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,520
 The whole time headed out to Dover, Delaware.

57
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,380
 And by the time we get there, we need to get some food.

58
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,620
 We just drove across the country with no food

59
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,380
 and listening to Eiffel 65 on repeat

60
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,140
 has also driven us a little insane.

61
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,380
 We're headed to the Stop and Shop in Dover, Delaware.

62
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,180
 We see an old man just standing there

63
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,380
 in front of the store.

64
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,940
 And as we're walking up, we figure maybe this is

65
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,780
 the shopkeeper.

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,620
 This is Dover, Delaware.

67
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,460
 Maybe the shopkeeper.

68
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,780
 Maybe they do something different here.

69
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,620
 Maybe the shopkeeper stands outside

70
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,380
 and does all the money transactions out there.

71
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,340
 I don't know.

72
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,620
 But then the old man begins walking back and forth

73
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,300
 in front of the door of the Stop and Shop.

74
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,780
 And it's not like a casual walk,

75
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,880
 like he's smoking a cigarette

76
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,020
 and then walking back and forth.

77
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,500
 He's walking like a guard at attention.

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,760
 (gurgling)

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,660
 Now, it wasn't making that noise,

80
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,580
 but that was supposed to be the sound of his little legs.

81
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,140
 And he's walking back and forth

82
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,940
 and sometimes he would walk like a little army man

83
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,780
 in front of the door,

84
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,500
 but a lot of times he would just stand there.

85
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,060
 And the children called him the guardian.

86
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,260
 They made fun of this old man who looked like a guard

87
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,060
 standing in front of the Stop and Shop,

88
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,020
 which is where they bought their,

89
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,620
 what should I call it, bars?

90
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,460
 One day, this narrator,

91
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,900
 the person who's telling us this story,

92
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,300
 he goes online by the name Ben Lucas 10,

93
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,740
 which I think is a cartoon reference,

94
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,460
 but we'll call him Ben.

95
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,580
 Ben is riding in a car.

96
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,660
 He's like a tween at this point.

97
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,340
 Has this guy even been doing this for years,

98
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,260
 walking in front of the Stop and Shop?

99
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,620
 And one day, Ben is riding in his best friend's

100
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,180
 grandpas car down the street.

101
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,180
 And the best friend and Ben look and they see the guard

102
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,860
 and he's walking back and forth in front of the store

103
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,980
 and they kind of laugh

104
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,500
 'cause they make fun of this guy, right?

105
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,900
 He's a big old weirdo.

106
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,220
 The grandpa driving the car,

107
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,860
 turning to him and said, "Don't ever laugh at that man."

108
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,740
 Ben looks at his friend and they kind of look at the grandpa

109
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,380
 and they're like, "What, do you know his story?"

110
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,060
 We just thought he was a crazy guy.

111
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,620
 The grandpa goes, "Well,

112
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,740
 you're half right."

113
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,940
 He didn't actually say that.

114
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,220
 It was, don't quote him.

115
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,420
 I don't want this grandpa's ghost

116
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,140
 to come to sue me in ghost court.

117
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,580
 But he does tell the story.

118
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,780
 He didn't say it dramatically,

119
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,500
 but he does tell the story.

120
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,060
 What happened was he used to know this dude.

121
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,260
 He used to know this guy back in the 1970s.

122
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,820
 He was a soldier at Dover Air Force Base.

123
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,660
 Very dedicated, honorable soldier working out of Dover.

124
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,380
 Now Dover, it's not well known,

125
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,380
 but Dover apparently is a refrigerator base,

126
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,980
 which I don't know if that's their official designation.

127
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,140
 I don't know if they have a patch for this,

128
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,740
 but when bodies of Americans are coming back

129
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,540
 to the United States, if something happens to them overseas,

130
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,540
 they get taken to Dover and then they are stored there

131
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,900
 for a while and then flown to their families

132
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,180
 in the United States, which makes sense.

133
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,700
 Instead of having a hundred different planes

134
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,180
 coming from a hundred different parts of the world,

135
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,780
 you send them all here, it's a sorting facility.

136
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,340
 And a lot of times you would have casualties

137
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,500
 of military operations or just horrible accidents.

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,860
 They'd be flown over from Germany,

139
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,180
 flown over from Japan or the Middle East or wherever,

140
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,940
 they end up at Dover.

141
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,460
 But in November of 1978,

142
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,820
 the man who worked at the Dover Air Force Base,

143
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,160
 let's call him Bruce.

144
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,500
 Bruce is assigned a very special role at the Air Force Base.

145
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,540
 He's been assigned to be a guard.

146
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:56,000
 There is a warehouse style building,

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,340
 and in it are the victims of the Jonestown Massacre.

148
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,180
 In November of 1978,

149
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,180
 the cult of Jim Jones in Guyana committed mass suicide.

150
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,300
 That shouldn't be a revelation to anyone

151
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
 into conspiracy theory or true crime.

152
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,700
 It is a very, very interesting story,

153
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,260
 but 918 people died in Guiana.

154
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,340
 One third of them were children.

155
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,580
 They were brought there by their parents

156
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,580
 to be a part of this cult.

157
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,020
 And because of his madness,

158
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,660
 he had everyone commit suicide.

159
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
 Some of them did it.

160
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,180
 They didn't know they were drinking poison.

161
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,020
 Some of them were shot with crossbows

162
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,380
 when they tried to run off into the jungle.

163
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,540
 It's a horrible story.

164
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,100
 And the majority of those people came from America.

165
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,820
 So all of a sudden you had Bruce,

166
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,940
 who was a guard at Dover Air Force Base,

167
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,940
 guarding a warehouse full of hundreds of bodies.

168
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,580
 And he watched them.

169
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,980
 He stood guard over them,

170
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,020
 which would make sense because we didn't know,

171
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,780
 I'm sure they usually have guards patrolling areas,

172
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,180
 but this was a cult.

173
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,100
 And I'm sure they figured

174
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,660
 that someone would make them to try to get the bodies,

175
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,300
 or because you still had worshipers

176
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,740
 of Jim Jones out there.

177
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,420
 Not a lot, not a lot, but they don't know that.

178
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,760
 So you would want someone to guard the bodies

179
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,100
 of this horrible, horrible massacre.

180
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,300
 'Cause who knows what other use they could be put to.

181
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,380
 So he apparently is guarding the bodies

182
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,900
 and he's in this warehouse night after night after night.

183
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,260
 And they are shipping these bodies out as much as they can.

184
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,300
 They're trying to find these people's families

185
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,060
 so they can then fly them out of Dover Air Force Base

186
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,740
 so the family can receive and put the remains to rest.

187
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,900
 But he stood there every night.

188
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,020
 He stood guard and every night he stood there

189
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,140
 and thought about the powerless children

190
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,220
 who were swept up into this cult,

191
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,220
 laying next to their lifeless parents.

192
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:26,540
 Or even worse, these bodies being separated puzzle piece-like,

193
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,940
 children corpses among strangers

194
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,060
 while their parents lay somewhere else.

195
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,660
 I've been getting complaints about how dark

196
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,540
 the show has gotten and I apologize,

197
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,300
 but I have to show how insane this guy is going.

198
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,580
 Right? You're like, Jason,

199
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,420
 you're not trying to drive me insane, are you?

200
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,420
 No, this is this guy.

201
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,660
 And he's sitting in there night after night

202
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,180
 and he's pondering all of this horror.

203
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,180
 Hundreds and hundreds of bodies sit behind him.

204
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,460
 Do you think your job sucks?

205
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,860
 Imagining going, imagining having to work here

206
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,660
 for like the fifth day in a row.

207
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,420
 He begins to smell the bodies.

208
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,260
 And whether that is actual

209
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,980
 because the decaying process is overriding the preservation

210
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,020
 or he's hallucinating,

211
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,220
 if you can't hallucinate smells,

212
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,860
 we talked about that on yesterday's episode.

213
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,260
 He begins to smell the bodies,

214
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,380
 but then he begins to see things.

215
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,580
 And so when he reports what's going on to his supervisors

216
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,020
 on the Air Force Base,

217
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,860
 they quietly relieve him of duty

218
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,080
 and he hasn't been right since.

219
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,900
 So the grandpa driving the car says, that is that man.

220
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,260
 After they, he got an honorable discharge

221
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,360
 and after he left the military,

222
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,300
 that's what he does all day long.

223
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,900
 He stands guard outside the stop and shop.

224
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:09,420
 I love these type of stories.

225
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,120
 I love these neighborhood quirky individuals.

226
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,060
 I just love stories like this

227
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,180
 and they're always super obscure.

228
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,060
 Anytime at pre-internet,

229
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,900
 this story would have,

230
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,420
 it's not the most important story in the world, is it?

231
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,020
 But it's so fascinating to me

232
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,340
 it's fascinating that the internet

233
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,980
 lets us share these local legends

234
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,460
 'cause otherwise you never would have heard about this

235
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,300
 or the Catman of Grenoch or Joe Trombone,

236
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,020
 Max Kramer, all these local weirdos.

237
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
 Steven Lightfoot, all of the,

238
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,140
 I just love this stuff.

239
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,300
 I absolutely love this stuff.

240
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,660
 And that would weigh on you, right?

241
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,380
 That would weigh on you.

242
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,220
 On the one hand,

243
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,700
 I grew up in the mortuary business

244
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
 or I spent my teenage years in the mortuary business

245
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,700
 and it is very mechanical and very methodical

246
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,020
 and you do kind of remove yourself from the idea

247
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,420
 that you're dealing with a human body.

248
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,500
 You realize that,

249
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,340
 but you don't think of it

250
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,900
 as having the human soul anymore.

251
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,740
 It's simply this container.

252
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,980
 But I remember something my dad told me

253
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,060
 when he was in the business,

254
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,260
 he said, "When you're dealing with the dead,

255
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,800
 "you have to be so respectful towards them."

256
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,140
 He goes, "Because you are going to be the last person

257
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,220
 "to ever touch their physical body."

258
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,180
 So don't sit there eating a ham sandwich on top of it.

259
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,420
 Don't tip your cigarette into its mouth.

260
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,580
 It is a lifeless husk, the body is gone.

261
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,460
 But somebody loved this body.

262
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,860
 A mother loved this body.

263
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,740
 Someone loved being in this body.

264
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,060
 Other people loved this body.

265
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,060
 So you just have to be respectful

266
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,460
 because you will be the last person

267
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,060
 to ever interact with this person.

268
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,660
 And this guard was doing that.

269
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,620
 He was guarding these as much as he was guarding

270
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,620
 any precious cargo or jewels, anything.

271
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,740
 He put his soul into that and it did break him.

272
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,300
 I guess there's no upside to it

273
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,140
 other than that it's an interesting story.

274
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,940
 The narrator goes on to say he passed away 10 years ago

275
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,740
 but he hopes that more people know this story

276
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,020
 and what a hero he was.

277
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,980
 'Cause he took a job that I doubt a lot of people could do.

278
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,300
 I would have a hard time doing it

279
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,380
 and I spent a lot of time in the mortuary business.

280
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,060
 He's just, okay, I was about to tell a mortuary story

281
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,180
 but this episode has gotten more depressing

282
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,020
 than I wanted to.

283
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,380
 It's so funny because Rudy,

284
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,460
 I'm gonna go ahead and touch the keys

285
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,300
 of the carpenter copter where you're leaving behind

286
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,380
 Dover Delaware.

287
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,780
 We're gonna salute the guardian of the stop and shop

288
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,700
 as we fly away.

289
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,780
 I hope you have found peace and death.

290
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,060
 Didn't that just sound better than it did?

291
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,340
 Rudy, fly us out of here.

292
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,940
 We are headed all the way out to Kentucky.

293
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,020
 (imitates gunshots)

294
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,820
 And I wanna do really, really quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

295
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,900
 I saw this movie the other night.

296
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,680
 I really enjoyed it and I gotta be honest,

297
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,820
 I slept on this.

298
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,380
 I laughed at this movie.

299
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,020
 I read the reviews of this movie and I go,

300
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,740
 "Oh, that looks super dumb."

301
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,100
 "Oh, I saw like a clip."

302
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,700
 I was like, "Oh, those special effects look like trash."

303
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,260
 I watched it the other night

304
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,420
 and I really enjoyed this movie.

305
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,640
 I wanna see a sequel.

306
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,100
 I was actually thinking about buying the book

307
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,180
 and I never read.

308
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,300
 I never read anything.

309
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,140
 Well, I read articles and stuff like that with books.

310
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,100
 It's called The Silence.

311
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,580
 It is a Netflix movie.

312
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,540
 It's basically was, it came out right after a quiet place.

313
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,640
 It's the same premise.

314
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,540
 These monsters show up and they can't see you

315
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,060
 but they can hear you and they brutally eat you.

316
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,940
 This movie is dope.

317
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,500
 I'll be honest, this movie to me

318
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,860
 is better than a quiet place.

319
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,940
 And if you're like, "I didn't like a quiet place anyways.

320
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,780
 I don't like the genre."

321
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,780
 That's fine.

322
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,500
 But this movie, it's the beginning,

323
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,580
 the problem I hate with stuff like a quiet place

324
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,340
 and a lot of newer zombie movies,

325
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,580
 they start off, you put it in

326
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,660
 and they go three years after the event.

327
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,180
 I don't care about three years after the event.

328
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,140
 That's boring.

329
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,340
 If I wanna learn about people rebuilding society,

330
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,580
 I'll read a history book.

331
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,900
 I wanna see about right now, day one, hour one

332
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,620
 of these end of the world stories.

333
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,840
 And that's what The Silence is.

334
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,220
 The Silence is like two, the first two weeks of this.

335
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,220
 And listen, the special effects are garbage.

336
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,140
 The special effects are really, really bad.

337
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,420
 They're asylum level special effects.

338
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,260
 A car blows up and they just paint an explosion on.

339
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,300
 It's embarrassingly bad.

340
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,260
 But the acting's good.

341
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,340
 It starts Stanley Tucci and Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

342
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,980
 Not Melissa Joan Hart, but the new one.

343
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,060
 It's fast paced.

344
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,420
 It's super dark.

345
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,660
 It has some really, really creepy scenes in it.

346
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,140
 And it's funny because there are some

347
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,420
 really dumb things in it.

348
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,280
 The special effects being the main one.

349
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,100
 But the story's intriguing enough.

350
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,700
 It's a basic end of the world story,

351
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,100
 but it's done in a well enough way

352
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,300
 and the characters make some really, really bad decisions.

353
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,860
 But you go, "That's what you would do in real life."

354
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,820
 You wouldn't think three days through

355
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,780
 you're thinking what's going to happen in the next hour.

356
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,900
 I'm going to do, I really enjoyed it.

357
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,100
 So if you guys are looking,

358
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,260
 it's a great end of the world movie.

359
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,420
 You guys are looking for a good end

360
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,580
 of the world movie this weekend.

361
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,500
 Check out The Silence.

362
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,580
 I totally slept on it.

363
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,900
 And I wanna know more about this world

364
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,260
 and these creatures and things like that.

365
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,100
 So check it out.

366
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,900
 I often fall victim to,

367
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,820
 and I think a lot of people do this,

368
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,180
 but I definitely do this, critics.

369
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,060
 And when critics are like, "Oh, that movie sucked.

370
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,220
 "It was like, yeah, I don't know.

371
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
 "I don't have time to watch it anyway, so maybe it sucked."

372
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,380
 And then I watch it years later

373
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,900
 and I was like, "What in the world?"

374
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,740
 Did the same thing with War and the Worlds, dude.

375
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,940
 That movie is dope.

376
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,460
 That movie gets slept on to this day.

377
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,900
 And what a shame.

378
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,380
 I mean, I guess there's other things that are more shameful,

379
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,740
 things like the Jonestown massacre and cults

380
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,540
 taking people's lives for ego.

381
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,580
 But the second most shameful thing

382
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,260
 is critics making me not watch movies.

383
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,940
 The reason why we're headed to Kentucky

384
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,180
 is because of my aforementioned doing too many dark stories.

385
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,660
 It wasn't that I did too many dark stories.

386
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,500
 What happened was,

387
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,100
 I mentioned this before on Monday's episode.

388
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,380
 Last Friday, did an episode,

389
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,100
 "Hey Jason, please don't bring it up again.

390
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,260
 "Please don't bring it up."

391
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,420
 I did an episode Friday about a coworker of mine

392
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,900
 who was blind and it was this story

393
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,660
 about like this workplace drama

394
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,740
 and all this stuff was going on.

395
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,580
 And it just kind of had this open ended

396
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,900
 and it was a little depressing.

397
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,100
 And because of that,

398
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,700
 Cantillion's longtime supporter of the show,

399
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,260
 long, long time supporter of the show,

400
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,540
 hit me up and said, "Dude, that was way, way too depressing.

401
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,380
 "I'm gonna send you something a little more lighthearted

402
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,500
 "to kind of balance out the yin-yang of the show."

403
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,700
 Totally awesome, totally, totally awesome.

404
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,900
 And he sent me this story and the story,

405
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,500
 this article, I keep calling this story,

406
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,140
 this is apparently a real story.

407
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,540
 It was written by Bill Love.

408
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,340
 It's a guy named Bill Love who told this story.

409
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,020
 So we're gonna go back in time to the year 1961

410
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,220
 as Bill is driving down a Kentucky road.

411
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,420
 Specifically, we're headed down Highway 40,

412
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,300
 which is in between Paintsville, Kentucky and Williamsport.

413
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,320
 And this area is known as Two Mile Hill.

414
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,460
 He's driving his car, he's actually not driving his car,

415
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,620
 he's driving his dad's VW Bug.

416
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,100
 Now he'd been driving down this road

417
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,740
 many, many times before.

418
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,060
 He's leaving his house to go visit his girlfriend,

419
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,460
 but he wasn't familiar with how his dad's VW Bug drove.

420
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,580
 So (humming)

421
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,660
 It's going up Two Mile Hill and it's drizzly.

422
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,640
 It's been a slightly rainy morning.

423
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,820
 So the roads are a little slick, a little too curvy.

424
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,060
 And a young man behind a car that he's not familiar with

425
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,780
 is a terrible recipe.

426
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,820
 I tried eating it once and I threw up.

427
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,180
 He loses control of his VW Bug

428
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,060
 (imitates engine revving)

429
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,380
 and it goes off the embankment.

430
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,260
 (imitates engine revving)

431
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,220
 As the car is driving down this embankment,

432
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,100
 he hits a rock outcropping

433
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,260
 and the car goes airborne for 50 feet.

434
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,820
 (laughing)

435
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,660
 He's just telling his Jason Bourne novels at this point.

436
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,340
 No, it's airborne for 50 feet

437
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,940
 until luckily it lands on all four tires

438
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,120
 and comes to a stop.

439
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,300
 The first thing that Bill does is the limb check.

440
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,260
 I don't know if this is the actual name for it,

441
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,180
 but I do it all the time.

442
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,500
 Whenever I hear a gunshot, it got used to this growing up.

443
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,220
 Whenever I heard a gunshot, I would never know

444
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,340
 if I was hit by a stray bullet.

445
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,500
 'Cause I'm a stray of the paranoid

446
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,620
 and I live in bad neighborhoods.

447
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,300
 So the first thing I will do is I will look at my arms

448
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,520
 and my legs to make sure that I have no external injuries.

449
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,100
 And then I'll usually brush my hand across my head.

450
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,820
 And if I don't feel any blood, if I don't,

451
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,780
 'cause you won't feel it.

452
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,020
 A lot of times you'll get shot and you could just,

453
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,380
 people will say, I didn't know I was shot

454
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,020
 until my clothes got wet

455
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,460
 and you look down and there's blood everywhere.

456
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,780
 So it is important when you do get in an accident,

457
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,460
 I go leg, leg, arm, arm, I look

458
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,780
 and then I kind of rub my hand over my head

459
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,860
 to make sure that I'm not bleeding anywhere.

460
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,500
 You don't wanna stand up and have,

461
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 one of your legs gone and then you tumble down.

462
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,340
 So he does that.

463
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,180
 He does that.

464
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,940
 He actually makes sure that all of his limbs are there.

465
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,700
 And he notices there's a little bit of blood on him.

466
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,660
 He has some cut from the broken glass,

467
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,860
 which again in 1961, I'm pretty sure everything was real glass,

468
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,300
 not that breakaway stuff.

469
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,820
 And his rear view mirrors busted off.

470
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,260
 The car is a total mess, but he gets out of the car

471
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,420
 and he's kinda looking around now.

472
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,980
 It's still drizzling outside

473
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,580
 and he's looking up at this embankment.

474
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
 It's pretty far away, but I can make it,

475
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,420
 but I'm gonna need something to walk up with.

476
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,940
 So he looks down and he sees like this sapling

477
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,140
 that he's going to use as a crutch.

478
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,660
 And when he bends down to get it,

479
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,380
 all of a sudden his entire face gets wet.

480
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,420
 And he stands up and he puts his hand back.

481
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,860
 And what has happened is his entire scalp

482
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,660
 has been peeled off of him

483
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,920
 and it's hanging down, touching his neck.

484
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,300
 He can feel the loose skin back there.

485
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,820
 And then he reaches up and when he touches his head,

486
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,620
 he realizes he's touching his skull.

487
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,140
 Now, Cantillian's is the one

488
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,300
 who said this was a more upbeat story.

489
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,260
 It is a really cool story.

490
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,740
 I think you're resending it.

491
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,140
 Well, what a gruesome,

492
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,900
 can you imagine feeling your own skull?

493
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,060
 See, that's why you do the check.

494
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,740
 That's why you do the check.

495
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,780
 He's now, he's bleeding profusely.

496
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,580
 And he's like, now I really need to get up this hill.

497
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,020
 This is 1961, I gotta keep hammering at home

498
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,300
 because even when I was reading the story,

499
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,440
 I was like, oh, well, you know, like a cell phone.

500
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,700
 Go to the neighbors and call.

501
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,660
 This is 1961, rural Kentucky.

502
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,140
 There's not even anyone around living around him,

503
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,460
 let alone the fact that they might have a satellite phone.

504
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,420
 And he's sitting there and he takes his skin

505
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,260
 and he puts it back over his head.

506
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,020
 He's just kind of flapping there like a hood,

507
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,980
 but now it's at least slightly covering up

508
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,180
 the gaping wound.

509
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,900
 And he goes, I gotta get up out of here.

510
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,780
 And when he turns and he's kind of brushing blood

511
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,220
 away from his eyes to kind of see,

512
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,220
 'cause now he is bleeding profusely.

513
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,300
 It's coming all over him.

514
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,860
 He turns and he looks and for the first time,

515
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,380
 he'd been down this road a lot of times.

516
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,000
 He looks and there's a house.

517
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,740
 He looks over and he's looking at this house.

518
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,100
 He goes, I've never seen that house before.

519
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,820
 And then through his bloodied vision,

520
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,820
 he sees movement on the porch.

521
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:16,660
 There's a man sitting there watching Bill

522
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,880
 try to hobble up the embankment.

523
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,300
 Bill's watching him too and he sees this man

524
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,180
 get up and walk towards a car.

525
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,280
 There's a car parked in the driveway of this house.

526
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,060
 But it's through all these trees.

527
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,580
 It's through all this brush.

528
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,700
 And before Bill can really make a decision

529
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,940
 to walk towards the house,

530
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,780
 which I imagine would be easier,

531
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,840
 he continues going up the embankment.

532
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,840
 And then suddenly, he sees the car at the top.

533
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,980
 It's idling on the roadside

534
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,180
 and a man rolls down the passenger window

535
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,740
 and yells to him, if you can make it to the top,

536
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,300
 I'll take you to the hospital.

537
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,540
 Now that is a challenge, right?

538
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,220
 He's just covered in blood.

539
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,620
 He just got out of this horrible car accident.

540
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,640
 But the man won't help him.

541
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,700
 The man is just sitting in the car and watches

542
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,300
 as Bill finds the strength.

543
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,940
 I mean, he needs to get out of here.

544
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,720
 He will bleed to death.

545
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,960
 And he finds the strength and he makes his way

546
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,060
 through the trees and gets up to the road

547
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,300
 and gets in the car.

548
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,060
 And the driver begins heading into town.

549
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,180
 Bill described the driver

550
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,540
 as a very nondescript 40 year old man.

551
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,540
 Just wearing like a Bay shirt and pants,

552
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,180
 slacks and a fedora.

553
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:43,500
 And he's driving his car down towards the city.

554
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,700
 Bill said even the car was nondescript.

555
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,500
 He goes, I really couldn't make out the make or the model,

556
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,240
 but it reminded me of a car from the 1940s.

557
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,540
 And we're driving down this road together.

558
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,420
 I'm bleeding profusely.

559
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,380
 It's coming straight out of my head.

560
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,060
 And this man goes, you know what?

561
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,260
 I was in the war.

562
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,460
 You're gonna bleed out.

563
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,740
 You're about to die.

564
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,220
 We need to stop the bleeding right now.

565
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,340
 The man gives Bill his jacket and says,

566
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,620
 you need to put this on your head.

567
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,620
 You need to hold it on your head as hard as possible.

568
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,020
 We need to staunch that bleeding.

569
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,200
 And Bill said the guy had never seen this guy before.

570
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,860
 He knew his way around town though,

571
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,220
 because when he asked what hospital

572
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,120
 did I wanna go to, I said the clinic.

573
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
 And he goes, yeah.

574
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,360
 And he drove him right there.

575
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,280
 He knew exactly where the clinic was.

576
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,440
 And as they're pulling up to the clinic,

577
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,800
 the man says an odd thing.

578
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,280
 He goes, I can't get out of the car.

579
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,560
 Can you make it in okay?

580
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,680
 And Bill doesn't question this.

581
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,640
 He doesn't question this until later.

582
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,960
 But he goes, oh no, no, no, I'm fine.

583
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,880
 I can be totally fine.

584
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,960
 He took the jacket, he gave it back to the man.

585
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,000
 The blood soaked jacket, gives it back to him

586
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,560
 and walks into the clinic.

587
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,080
 He needed 55 stitches.

588
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,800
 This wasn't, he woke up from a dream in the middle of the night.

589
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,600
 He was holding a bloody jacket,

590
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,160
 which would be alarming enough.

591
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,280
 This was real.

592
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,200
 He needed 55 stitches and he needed to stay in the hospital

593
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,960
 for a couple of days.

594
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,360
 He lost so much blood,

595
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,780
 they had to transfuse more blood into him.

596
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,360
 When his dad picks him up to take him home,

597
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,480
 the dad says, hey, you know what, listen Bill,

598
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,840
 we should stop by that dude's house and give him some money

599
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,480
 because you've ruined his jacket at the very least.

600
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,240
 Most likely there's blood all over his car.

601
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,320
 Let's go buy, tell him thanks, give him some cash

602
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,240
 to help clean stuff up.

603
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,040
 And Bill's totally fine with that.

604
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,000
 Bill's like, yeah, I kind of want to meet him again, right?

605
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,240
 Say thanks.

606
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,480
 So as they're driving down the road, he realizes,

607
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,920
 'cause this is the first time he's been in this area

608
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,560
 since the accident, as they're driving down the road,

609
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,960
 Bill realizes, oh, you can't see the house from the road.

610
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,760
 That's why I drove past this so many times,

611
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
 I never saw that house.

612
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,420
 But you can see the driveway.

613
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,920
 And as they're driving down Highway 40, sure enough,

614
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,960
 they see that little driveway

615
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,200
 leading down to a house just off the road.

616
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,760
 But when the dad drives his car down,

617
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,240
 Bill notices something's off.

618
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,560
 This house looks like it hasn't been lived in for decades.

619
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,600
 It's completely decrepit.

620
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,520
 Now, that's fine, right?

621
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,440
 He didn't say that the old man lived there.

622
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,600
 We just saw the old man sitting on the porch.

623
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,960
 When they get out and they look around,

624
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,260
 the house appears to be empty.

625
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,960
 There's nothing in this ram shackle building,

626
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,680
 not even cigarette butts on the porch.

627
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,320
 'Cause he wasn't smoking a cigarette in the car,

628
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
 driving him, so what happened to the cigarette

629
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,120
 that he was smoking before he picked him up?

630
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,200
 There's no cigarette butts on the ground.

631
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,800
 It doesn't look like anyone's lived in this house for years.

632
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,120
 And he's looking at the driveway,

633
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,260
 and it's covered in weeds.

634
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,440
 So he's thinking, how in the world,

635
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,080
 I don't remember seeing weeds the first time

636
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,160
 I looked over the driveway.

637
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,840
 To be fair, it was quite a distance

638
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,520
 and I had blood all over my face

639
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,560
 and I just got brain damage.

640
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,040
 But this place doesn't look like anyone's lived here

641
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,960
 in a long, long time.

642
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,800
 There's not even a footprint.

643
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,880
 Just an empty house off a highway.

644
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,080
 But this empty house had a miracle living inside of it.

645
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,720
 To this day, he really can't explain what happened

646
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,880
 and it's one of those stories that how could you?

647
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,480
 The most rational answer,

648
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
 'cause he wouldn't have hallucinated it.

649
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,040
 That's what's interesting about this.

650
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,560
 We know he got a ride to the clinic.

651
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,120
 There's a lot of times people get injured

652
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,680
 and they hallucinate stuff.

653
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,280
 I had a friend who got on a motorcycle accident

654
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,880
 and thought he was in a pumpkin patch for a while.

655
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,760
 But he didn't come home with the giant pumpkin

656
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
 and they're like, where'd you get that from?

657
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,120
 And he's like, I don't know.

658
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,480
 Like it was fake.

659
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
 It was a hallucination.

660
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,920
 He got his brain so rattled

661
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,520
 that he thought he was somewhere else.

662
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,000
 But he showed up at the clinic in a car

663
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,520
 and his car was in the middle of the road.

664
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,840
 So he didn't walk, he would have bled to death.

665
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,420
 So we know that that realistic thing happened.

666
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,480
 That's a really cool thing.

667
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,960
 And thanks, Cantillion again for sending us over.

668
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,360
 That's a really cool thing we can kind of hang our hat on

669
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,040
 or hang our scalp on.

670
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,840
 One of the answers that he was putting forward,

671
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,800
 that it's possible that this person

672
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,680
 didn't want to be seen by the police.

673
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,640
 This might have been someone on the run

674
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,120
 and they were staying at this house just for the day.

675
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,200
 And it would explain why they might've come back

676
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,040
 and cleaned up any evidence.

677
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,120
 It would explain why they didn't want to get out of the car

678
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,640
 at any point.

679
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,940
 But it wouldn't explain why they would help

680
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,100
 a bloody person in the first place.

681
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,140
 Maybe they're a good-hearted criminal,

682
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,260
 but if you're on the run from the law,

683
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,540
 you're making a decision.

684
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,140
 Then you also look at stuff like guardian angels,

685
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
 like ghosts, right?

686
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,420
 I think the idea that he won't get out of the car,

687
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,220
 like we never saw him.

688
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,220
 It's so weird because we see him walking into the car,

689
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,300
 but after that he refuses to get out.

690
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,420
 So we know that he can physically walk into a car.

691
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,420
 One of the suggestions,

692
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,900
 'cause he's told other people about the story,

693
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,760
 he's one of the suggestions that he's heard over the years,

694
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,180
 was maybe the person was not able to physically

695
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,240
 able to get out of the car.

696
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,800
 Maybe they had paralysis, they couldn't move their legs.

697
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,040
 And he goes, he could drive a stick shift.

698
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,760
 This guy didn't seem to have a problem with a stick shift.

699
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,120
 Was it just one of those cars?

700
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,640
 So, and he saw him walk into the car.

701
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
 So what, was it a time traveler?

702
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,200
 Was it someone on the run?

703
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,480
 Was it a guardian angel?

704
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,380
 And they chose to take this form?

705
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,320
 Just a bizarre story all around.

706
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,620
 So the paranormal doesn't always have to be dark.

707
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,460
 The paranormal can sometimes be as lighthearted

708
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,220
 as a man who's scalp gets ripped off of his skull

709
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,020
 and is forced to walk up a cliff

710
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,860
 just so he can get some stitches.

711
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,060
 But it's so fascinating to me that this man,

712
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
 his life was saved.

713
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,140
 One of the most important events in his life

714
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,380
 is just one big mystery.

715
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,980
 He will always wonder who that man was

716
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,300
 and why he acted in such bizarre ways.

717
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,720
 And he'll never have any answers.

718
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,040
 He'll go through life knowing that his life was saved

719
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,480
 by a mystery.

720
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,140
 He may not know who saved him,

721
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,160
 but he will always remember the man who never existed.

722
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,540
