 British Swim School, make us flash.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.260
 Today we look at a man who goes so crazy,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900
 he becomes an urban legend.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.220
 And then we meet a young man driving down the road

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.540
 to visit his girlfriend on a rainy afternoon.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.500
 But when he loses control of his car

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.020
 and it goes over an embankment,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.380
 he's hoping for a miracle.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.880
 Instead, he finds a mystery today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.460
 (upbeat music)

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.960
 - Want a drink, though?

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.540
 (upbeat music)

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.260
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.340
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.300
 I'm your host Jason Carvener.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.140
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.060
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.500
 Hope you guys are ready for some cool, paranormal action

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.820
 coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.660
 Everyone on your feet be prepared to salute

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.700
 one of our Thanksgiving live stream donators.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.740
 Give it up for Rudy Jazz.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.180
 Rudy Jazz, longtime Patreon supporter as well.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.500
 Rudy, thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.620
 You guys can't support the Patreon

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.740
 or support the show financially.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.300
 I totally understand that.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.020
 Just help spread the word about the show

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.740
 really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.260
 Rudy Jazz, I'm gonna go ahead and touch the keys

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.740
 to the Jason Jalopy where he leaves behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.900
 We're headed all the way out to Dover, Delaware.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.140
 (upbeat music)

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.620
 And as we're headed back there,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.420
 Rudy, go ahead and hit that time travel button.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.140
 We're going back to the late '90s, early 2000s.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.220
 So, (mimics music)

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.300
 Matrix, Shrek, a bunch of other movies

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.540
 came out in this time period.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.020
 Music was so good.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.860
 Some 41, Blink 182, Eiffel 65.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.820
 You had all the hits, all the hits in this time period.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.180
 And we're listening to them on repeat.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.020
 I'm blue.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.520
 The whole time headed out to Dover, Delaware.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.380
 And by the time we get there, we need to get some food.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.620
 We just drove across the country with no food

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.380
 and listening to Eiffel 65 on repeat

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.140
 has also driven us a little insane.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.380
 We're headed to the Stop and Shop in Dover, Delaware.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.180
 We see an old man just standing there

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.380
 in front of the store.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.940
 And as we're walking up, we figure maybe this is

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.780
 the shopkeeper.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.620
 This is Dover, Delaware.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.460
 Maybe the shopkeeper.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.780
 Maybe they do something different here.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.620
 Maybe the shopkeeper stands outside

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.380
 and does all the money transactions out there.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.340
 I don't know.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.620
 But then the old man begins walking back and forth

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.300
 in front of the door of the Stop and Shop.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.780
 And it's not like a casual walk,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.880
 like he's smoking a cigarette

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.020
 and then walking back and forth.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.500
 He's walking like a guard at attention.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.760
 (gurgling)

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.660
 Now, it wasn't making that noise,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.580
 but that was supposed to be the sound of his little legs.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.140
 And he's walking back and forth

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.940
 and sometimes he would walk like a little army man

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.780
 in front of the door,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.500
 but a lot of times he would just stand there.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.060
 And the children called him the guardian.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.260
 They made fun of this old man who looked like a guard

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.060
 standing in front of the Stop and Shop,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.020
 which is where they bought their,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.620
 what should I call it, bars?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.460
 One day, this narrator,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.900
 the person who's telling us this story,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.300
 he goes online by the name Ben Lucas 10,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.740
 which I think is a cartoon reference,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.460
 but we'll call him Ben.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.580
 Ben is riding in a car.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.660
 He's like a tween at this point.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.340
 Has this guy even been doing this for years,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.260
 walking in front of the Stop and Shop?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.620
 And one day, Ben is riding in his best friend's

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.180
 grandpas car down the street.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.180
 And the best friend and Ben look and they see the guard

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.860
 and he's walking back and forth in front of the store

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.980
 and they kind of laugh

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.500
 'cause they make fun of this guy, right?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.900
 He's a big old weirdo.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.220
 The grandpa driving the car,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.860
 turning to him and said, "Don't ever laugh at that man."

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.740
 Ben looks at his friend and they kind of look at the grandpa

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.380
 and they're like, "What, do you know his story?"

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.060
 We just thought he was a crazy guy.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.620
 The grandpa goes, "Well,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.740
 you're half right."

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.940
 He didn't actually say that.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.220
 It was, don't quote him.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.420
 I don't want this grandpa's ghost

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.140
 to come to sue me in ghost court.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.580
 But he does tell the story.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.780
 He didn't say it dramatically,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.500
 but he does tell the story.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.060
 What happened was he used to know this dude.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.260
 He used to know this guy back in the 1970s.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.820
 He was a soldier at Dover Air Force Base.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.660
 Very dedicated, honorable soldier working out of Dover.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.380
 Now Dover, it's not well known,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.380
 but Dover apparently is a refrigerator base,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.980
 which I don't know if that's their official designation.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.140
 I don't know if they have a patch for this,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.740
 but when bodies of Americans are coming back

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.540
 to the United States, if something happens to them overseas,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.540
 they get taken to Dover and then they are stored there

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.900
 for a while and then flown to their families

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.180
 in the United States, which makes sense.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.700
 Instead of having a hundred different planes

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.180
 coming from a hundred different parts of the world,

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.780
 you send them all here, it's a sorting facility.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.340
 And a lot of times you would have casualties

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.500
 of military operations or just horrible accidents.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.860
 They'd be flown over from Germany,

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.180
 flown over from Japan or the Middle East or wherever,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.940
 they end up at Dover.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.460
 But in November of 1978,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.820
 the man who worked at the Dover Air Force Base,

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.160
 let's call him Bruce.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.500
 Bruce is assigned a very special role at the Air Force Base.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.540
 He's been assigned to be a guard.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.000
 There is a warehouse style building,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.340
 and in it are the victims of the Jonestown Massacre.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.180
 In November of 1978,

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.180
 the cult of Jim Jones in Guyana committed mass suicide.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.300
 That shouldn't be a revelation to anyone

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.300
 into conspiracy theory or true crime.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.700
 It is a very, very interesting story,

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.260
 but 918 people died in Guiana.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.340
 One third of them were children.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.580
 They were brought there by their parents

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.580
 to be a part of this cult.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.020
 And because of his madness,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.660
 he had everyone commit suicide.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.660
 Some of them did it.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.180
 They didn't know they were drinking poison.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.020
 Some of them were shot with crossbows

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.380
 when they tried to run off into the jungle.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.540
 It's a horrible story.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.100
 And the majority of those people came from America.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.820
 So all of a sudden you had Bruce,

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.940
 who was a guard at Dover Air Force Base,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.940
 guarding a warehouse full of hundreds of bodies.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.580
 And he watched them.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.980
 He stood guard over them,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.020
 which would make sense because we didn't know,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.780
 I'm sure they usually have guards patrolling areas,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.180
 but this was a cult.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.100
 And I'm sure they figured

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.660
 that someone would make them to try to get the bodies,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.300
 or because you still had worshipers

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.740
 of Jim Jones out there.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.420
 Not a lot, not a lot, but they don't know that.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.760
 So you would want someone to guard the bodies

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.100
 of this horrible, horrible massacre.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.300
 'Cause who knows what other use they could be put to.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.380
 So he apparently is guarding the bodies

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.900
 and he's in this warehouse night after night after night.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.260
 And they are shipping these bodies out as much as they can.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.300
 They're trying to find these people's families

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.060
 so they can then fly them out of Dover Air Force Base

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.740
 so the family can receive and put the remains to rest.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.900
 But he stood there every night.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.020
 He stood guard and every night he stood there

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.140
 and thought about the powerless children

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.220
 who were swept up into this cult,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.220
 laying next to their lifeless parents.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:26.540
 Or even worse, these bodies being separated puzzle piece-like,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.940
 children corpses among strangers

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.060
 while their parents lay somewhere else.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.660
 I've been getting complaints about how dark

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.540
 the show has gotten and I apologize,

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.300
 but I have to show how insane this guy is going.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.580
 Right? You're like, Jason,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.420
 you're not trying to drive me insane, are you?

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.420
 No, this is this guy.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.660
 And he's sitting in there night after night

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.180
 and he's pondering all of this horror.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.180
 Hundreds and hundreds of bodies sit behind him.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.460
 Do you think your job sucks?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.860
 Imagining going, imagining having to work here

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.660
 for like the fifth day in a row.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:08.420
 He begins to smell the bodies.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.260
 And whether that is actual

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.980
 because the decaying process is overriding the preservation

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.020
 or he's hallucinating,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.220
 if you can't hallucinate smells,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.860
 we talked about that on yesterday's episode.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.260
 He begins to smell the bodies,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.380
 but then he begins to see things.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.580
 And so when he reports what's going on to his supervisors

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.020
 on the Air Force Base,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.860
 they quietly relieve him of duty

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.080
 and he hasn't been right since.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.900
 So the grandpa driving the car says, that is that man.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.260
 After they, he got an honorable discharge

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.360
 and after he left the military,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.300
 that's what he does all day long.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.900
 He stands guard outside the stop and shop.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:09.420
 I love these type of stories.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.120
 I love these neighborhood quirky individuals.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.060
 I just love stories like this

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.180
 and they're always super obscure.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.060
 Anytime at pre-internet,

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.900
 this story would have,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.420
 it's not the most important story in the world, is it?

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.020
 But it's so fascinating to me

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.340
 it's fascinating that the internet

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.980
 lets us share these local legends

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.460
 'cause otherwise you never would have heard about this

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.300
 or the Catman of Grenoch or Joe Trombone,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.020
 Max Kramer, all these local weirdos.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.020
 Steven Lightfoot, all of the,

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.140
 I just love this stuff.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.300
 I absolutely love this stuff.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.660
 And that would weigh on you, right?

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.380
 That would weigh on you.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.220
 On the one hand,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.700
 I grew up in the mortuary business

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.700
 or I spent my teenage years in the mortuary business

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.700
 and it is very mechanical and very methodical

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.020
 and you do kind of remove yourself from the idea

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.420
 that you're dealing with a human body.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.500
 You realize that,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.340
 but you don't think of it

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.900
 as having the human soul anymore.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.740
 It's simply this container.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.980
 But I remember something my dad told me

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.060
 when he was in the business,

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.260
 he said, "When you're dealing with the dead,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.800
 "you have to be so respectful towards them."

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.140
 He goes, "Because you are going to be the last person

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.220
 "to ever touch their physical body."

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.180
 So don't sit there eating a ham sandwich on top of it.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.420
 Don't tip your cigarette into its mouth.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.580
 It is a lifeless husk, the body is gone.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.460
 But somebody loved this body.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.860
 A mother loved this body.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.740
 Someone loved being in this body.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.060
 Other people loved this body.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.060
 So you just have to be respectful

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.460
 because you will be the last person

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.060
 to ever interact with this person.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.660
 And this guard was doing that.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.620
 He was guarding these as much as he was guarding

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.620
 any precious cargo or jewels, anything.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.740
 He put his soul into that and it did break him.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.300
 I guess there's no upside to it

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.140
 other than that it's an interesting story.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.940
 The narrator goes on to say he passed away 10 years ago

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.740
 but he hopes that more people know this story

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.020
 and what a hero he was.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.980
 'Cause he took a job that I doubt a lot of people could do.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.300
 I would have a hard time doing it

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.380
 and I spent a lot of time in the mortuary business.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.060
 He's just, okay, I was about to tell a mortuary story

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.180
 but this episode has gotten more depressing

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.020
 than I wanted to.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.380
 It's so funny because Rudy,

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.460
 I'm gonna go ahead and touch the keys

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.300
 of the carpenter copter where you're leaving behind

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.380
 Dover Delaware.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.780
 We're gonna salute the guardian of the stop and shop

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.700
 as we fly away.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.780
 I hope you have found peace and death.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.060
 Didn't that just sound better than it did?

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.340
 Rudy, fly us out of here.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.940
 We are headed all the way out to Kentucky.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.020
 (imitates gunshots)

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.820
 And I wanna do really, really quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.900
 I saw this movie the other night.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.680
 I really enjoyed it and I gotta be honest,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.820
 I slept on this.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.380
 I laughed at this movie.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.020
 I read the reviews of this movie and I go,

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.740
 "Oh, that looks super dumb."

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.100
 "Oh, I saw like a clip."

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.700
 I was like, "Oh, those special effects look like trash."

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.260
 I watched it the other night

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.420
 and I really enjoyed this movie.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.640
 I wanna see a sequel.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.100
 I was actually thinking about buying the book

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.180
 and I never read.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.300
 I never read anything.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.140
 Well, I read articles and stuff like that with books.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.100
 It's called The Silence.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.580
 It is a Netflix movie.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.540
 It's basically was, it came out right after a quiet place.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.640
 It's the same premise.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.540
 These monsters show up and they can't see you

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.060
 but they can hear you and they brutally eat you.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.940
 This movie is dope.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.500
 I'll be honest, this movie to me

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.860
 is better than a quiet place.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.940
 And if you're like, "I didn't like a quiet place anyways.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.780
 I don't like the genre."

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.780
 That's fine.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.500
 But this movie, it's the beginning,

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.580
 the problem I hate with stuff like a quiet place

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.340
 and a lot of newer zombie movies,

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.580
 they start off, you put it in

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.660
 and they go three years after the event.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.180
 I don't care about three years after the event.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.140
 That's boring.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.340
 If I wanna learn about people rebuilding society,

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.580
 I'll read a history book.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.900
 I wanna see about right now, day one, hour one

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.620
 of these end of the world stories.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.840
 And that's what The Silence is.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.220
 The Silence is like two, the first two weeks of this.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.220
 And listen, the special effects are garbage.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.140
 The special effects are really, really bad.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.420
 They're asylum level special effects.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.260
 A car blows up and they just paint an explosion on.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.300
 It's embarrassingly bad.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.260
 But the acting's good.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.340
 It starts Stanley Tucci and Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.980
 Not Melissa Joan Hart, but the new one.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.060
 It's fast paced.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.420
 It's super dark.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.660
 It has some really, really creepy scenes in it.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.140
 And it's funny because there are some

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.420
 really dumb things in it.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.280
 The special effects being the main one.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.100
 But the story's intriguing enough.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.700
 It's a basic end of the world story,

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.100
 but it's done in a well enough way

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.300
 and the characters make some really, really bad decisions.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.860
 But you go, "That's what you would do in real life."

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.820
 You wouldn't think three days through

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.780
 you're thinking what's going to happen in the next hour.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.900
 I'm going to do, I really enjoyed it.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.100
 So if you guys are looking,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.260
 it's a great end of the world movie.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.420
 You guys are looking for a good end

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.580
 of the world movie this weekend.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.500
 Check out The Silence.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.580
 I totally slept on it.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.900
 And I wanna know more about this world

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.260
 and these creatures and things like that.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.100
 So check it out.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.900
 I often fall victim to,

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.820
 and I think a lot of people do this,

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.180
 but I definitely do this, critics.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.060
 And when critics are like, "Oh, that movie sucked.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.220
 "It was like, yeah, I don't know.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.220
 "I don't have time to watch it anyway, so maybe it sucked."

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.380
 And then I watch it years later

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.900
 and I was like, "What in the world?"

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.740
 Did the same thing with War and the Worlds, dude.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.940
 That movie is dope.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.460
 That movie gets slept on to this day.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.900
 And what a shame.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.380
 I mean, I guess there's other things that are more shameful,

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.740
 things like the Jonestown massacre and cults

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.540
 taking people's lives for ego.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.580
 But the second most shameful thing

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.260
 is critics making me not watch movies.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.940
 The reason why we're headed to Kentucky

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.180
 is because of my aforementioned doing too many dark stories.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.660
 It wasn't that I did too many dark stories.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.500
 What happened was,

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.100
 I mentioned this before on Monday's episode.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.380
 Last Friday, did an episode,

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.100
 "Hey Jason, please don't bring it up again.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.260
 "Please don't bring it up."

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.420
 I did an episode Friday about a coworker of mine

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.900
 who was blind and it was this story

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.660
 about like this workplace drama

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.740
 and all this stuff was going on.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.580
 And it just kind of had this open ended

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.900
 and it was a little depressing.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.100
 And because of that,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.700
 Cantillion's longtime supporter of the show,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.260
 long, long time supporter of the show,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.540
 hit me up and said, "Dude, that was way, way too depressing.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.380
 "I'm gonna send you something a little more lighthearted

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.500
 "to kind of balance out the yin-yang of the show."

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.700
 Totally awesome, totally, totally awesome.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.900
 And he sent me this story and the story,

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.500
 this article, I keep calling this story,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.140
 this is apparently a real story.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.540
 It was written by Bill Love.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.340
 It's a guy named Bill Love who told this story.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.020
 So we're gonna go back in time to the year 1961

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.220
 as Bill is driving down a Kentucky road.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.420
 Specifically, we're headed down Highway 40,

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.300
 which is in between Paintsville, Kentucky and Williamsport.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.320
 And this area is known as Two Mile Hill.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.460
 He's driving his car, he's actually not driving his car,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.620
 he's driving his dad's VW Bug.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.100
 Now he'd been driving down this road

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.740
 many, many times before.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.060
 He's leaving his house to go visit his girlfriend,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.460
 but he wasn't familiar with how his dad's VW Bug drove.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.580
 So (humming)

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.660
 It's going up Two Mile Hill and it's drizzly.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.640
 It's been a slightly rainy morning.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.820
 So the roads are a little slick, a little too curvy.

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.060
 And a young man behind a car that he's not familiar with

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.780
 is a terrible recipe.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.820
 I tried eating it once and I threw up.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.180
 He loses control of his VW Bug

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.060
 (imitates engine revving)

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.380
 and it goes off the embankment.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.260
 (imitates engine revving)

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.220
 As the car is driving down this embankment,

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.100
 he hits a rock outcropping

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.260
 and the car goes airborne for 50 feet.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.820
 (laughing)

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.660
 He's just telling his Jason Bourne novels at this point.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.340
 No, it's airborne for 50 feet

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.940
 until luckily it lands on all four tires

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.120
 and comes to a stop.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.300
 The first thing that Bill does is the limb check.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.260
 I don't know if this is the actual name for it,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.180
 but I do it all the time.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.500
 Whenever I hear a gunshot, it got used to this growing up.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.220
 Whenever I heard a gunshot, I would never know

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.340
 if I was hit by a stray bullet.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.500
 'Cause I'm a stray of the paranoid

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.620
 and I live in bad neighborhoods.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.300
 So the first thing I will do is I will look at my arms

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.520
 and my legs to make sure that I have no external injuries.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.100
 And then I'll usually brush my hand across my head.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.820
 And if I don't feel any blood, if I don't,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.780
 'cause you won't feel it.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.020
 A lot of times you'll get shot and you could just,

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.380
 people will say, I didn't know I was shot

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.020
 until my clothes got wet

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.460
 and you look down and there's blood everywhere.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.780
 So it is important when you do get in an accident,

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.460
 I go leg, leg, arm, arm, I look

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.780
 and then I kind of rub my hand over my head

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.860
 to make sure that I'm not bleeding anywhere.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.500
 You don't wanna stand up and have,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.500
 one of your legs gone and then you tumble down.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.340
 So he does that.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.180
 He does that.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.940
 He actually makes sure that all of his limbs are there.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.700
 And he notices there's a little bit of blood on him.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.660
 He has some cut from the broken glass,

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.860
 which again in 1961, I'm pretty sure everything was real glass,

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.300
 not that breakaway stuff.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.820
 And his rear view mirrors busted off.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.260
 The car is a total mess, but he gets out of the car

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.420
 and he's kinda looking around now.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.980
 It's still drizzling outside

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.580
 and he's looking up at this embankment.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.580
 It's pretty far away, but I can make it,

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.420
 but I'm gonna need something to walk up with.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.940
 So he looks down and he sees like this sapling

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.140
 that he's going to use as a crutch.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.660
 And when he bends down to get it,

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.380
 all of a sudden his entire face gets wet.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.420
 And he stands up and he puts his hand back.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.860
 And what has happened is his entire scalp

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.660
 has been peeled off of him

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.920
 and it's hanging down, touching his neck.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.300
 He can feel the loose skin back there.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.820
 And then he reaches up and when he touches his head,

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.620
 he realizes he's touching his skull.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.140
 Now, Cantillian's is the one

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.300
 who said this was a more upbeat story.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.260
 It is a really cool story.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.740
 I think you're resending it.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.140
 Well, what a gruesome,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.900
 can you imagine feeling your own skull?

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.060
 See, that's why you do the check.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.740
 That's why you do the check.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.780
 He's now, he's bleeding profusely.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.580
 And he's like, now I really need to get up this hill.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.020
 This is 1961, I gotta keep hammering at home

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.300
 because even when I was reading the story,

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.440
 I was like, oh, well, you know, like a cell phone.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.700
 Go to the neighbors and call.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.660
 This is 1961, rural Kentucky.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.140
 There's not even anyone around living around him,

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.460
 let alone the fact that they might have a satellite phone.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.420
 And he's sitting there and he takes his skin

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.260
 and he puts it back over his head.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.020
 He's just kind of flapping there like a hood,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.980
 but now it's at least slightly covering up

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.180
 the gaping wound.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.900
 And he goes, I gotta get up out of here.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.780
 And when he turns and he's kind of brushing blood

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.220
 away from his eyes to kind of see,

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.220
 'cause now he is bleeding profusely.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.300
 It's coming all over him.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.860
 He turns and he looks and for the first time,

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.380
 he'd been down this road a lot of times.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.000
 He looks and there's a house.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.740
 He looks over and he's looking at this house.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.100
 He goes, I've never seen that house before.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.820
 And then through his bloodied vision,

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.820
 he sees movement on the porch.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:16.660
 There's a man sitting there watching Bill

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.880
 try to hobble up the embankment.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.300
 Bill's watching him too and he sees this man

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.180
 get up and walk towards a car.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.280
 There's a car parked in the driveway of this house.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.060
 But it's through all these trees.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.580
 It's through all this brush.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.700
 And before Bill can really make a decision

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.940
 to walk towards the house,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.780
 which I imagine would be easier,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.840
 he continues going up the embankment.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.840
 And then suddenly, he sees the car at the top.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.980
 It's idling on the roadside

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.180
 and a man rolls down the passenger window

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.740
 and yells to him, if you can make it to the top,

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.300
 I'll take you to the hospital.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.540
 Now that is a challenge, right?

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.220
 He's just covered in blood.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.620
 He just got out of this horrible car accident.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.640
 But the man won't help him.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.700
 The man is just sitting in the car and watches

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.300
 as Bill finds the strength.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.940
 I mean, he needs to get out of here.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.720
 He will bleed to death.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.960
 And he finds the strength and he makes his way

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.060
 through the trees and gets up to the road

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.300
 and gets in the car.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.060
 And the driver begins heading into town.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.180
 Bill described the driver

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.540
 as a very nondescript 40 year old man.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.540
 Just wearing like a Bay shirt and pants,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.180
 slacks and a fedora.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:43.500
 And he's driving his car down towards the city.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.700
 Bill said even the car was nondescript.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.500
 He goes, I really couldn't make out the make or the model,

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.240
 but it reminded me of a car from the 1940s.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.540
 And we're driving down this road together.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.420
 I'm bleeding profusely.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.380
 It's coming straight out of my head.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.060
 And this man goes, you know what?

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.260
 I was in the war.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.460
 You're gonna bleed out.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.740
 You're about to die.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.220
 We need to stop the bleeding right now.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.340
 The man gives Bill his jacket and says,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.620
 you need to put this on your head.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.620
 You need to hold it on your head as hard as possible.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.020
 We need to staunch that bleeding.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.200
 And Bill said the guy had never seen this guy before.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.860
 He knew his way around town though,

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.220
 because when he asked what hospital

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.120
 did I wanna go to, I said the clinic.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.960
 And he goes, yeah.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.360
 And he drove him right there.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.280
 He knew exactly where the clinic was.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.440
 And as they're pulling up to the clinic,

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.800
 the man says an odd thing.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.280
 He goes, I can't get out of the car.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.560
 Can you make it in okay?

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.680
 And Bill doesn't question this.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.640
 He doesn't question this until later.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.960
 But he goes, oh no, no, no, I'm fine.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.880
 I can be totally fine.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.960
 He took the jacket, he gave it back to the man.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.000
 The blood soaked jacket, gives it back to him

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.560
 and walks into the clinic.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.080
 He needed 55 stitches.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.800
 This wasn't, he woke up from a dream in the middle of the night.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.600
 He was holding a bloody jacket,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.160
 which would be alarming enough.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.280
 This was real.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.200
 He needed 55 stitches and he needed to stay in the hospital

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:16.960
 for a couple of days.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.360
 He lost so much blood,

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.780
 they had to transfuse more blood into him.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.360
 When his dad picks him up to take him home,

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.480
 the dad says, hey, you know what, listen Bill,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.840
 we should stop by that dude's house and give him some money

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.480
 because you've ruined his jacket at the very least.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.240
 Most likely there's blood all over his car.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.320
 Let's go buy, tell him thanks, give him some cash

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.240
 to help clean stuff up.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.040
 And Bill's totally fine with that.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.000
 Bill's like, yeah, I kind of want to meet him again, right?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.240
 Say thanks.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.480
 So as they're driving down the road, he realizes,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.920
 'cause this is the first time he's been in this area

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.560
 since the accident, as they're driving down the road,

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.960
 Bill realizes, oh, you can't see the house from the road.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.760
 That's why I drove past this so many times,

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.360
 I never saw that house.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.420
 But you can see the driveway.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.920
 And as they're driving down Highway 40, sure enough,

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.960
 they see that little driveway

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.200
 leading down to a house just off the road.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.760
 But when the dad drives his car down,

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.240
 Bill notices something's off.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:20.560
 This house looks like it hasn't been lived in for decades.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.600
 It's completely decrepit.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.520
 Now, that's fine, right?

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.440
 He didn't say that the old man lived there.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.600
 We just saw the old man sitting on the porch.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.960
 When they get out and they look around,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.260
 the house appears to be empty.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:41.960
 There's nothing in this ram shackle building,

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.680
 not even cigarette butts on the porch.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.320
 'Cause he wasn't smoking a cigarette in the car,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.320
 driving him, so what happened to the cigarette

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.120
 that he was smoking before he picked him up?

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.200
 There's no cigarette butts on the ground.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.800
 It doesn't look like anyone's lived in this house for years.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.120
 And he's looking at the driveway,

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.260
 and it's covered in weeds.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.440
 So he's thinking, how in the world,

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.080
 I don't remember seeing weeds the first time

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.160
 I looked over the driveway.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.840
 To be fair, it was quite a distance

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.520
 and I had blood all over my face

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.560
 and I just got brain damage.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.040
 But this place doesn't look like anyone's lived here

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.960
 in a long, long time.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.800
 There's not even a footprint.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.880
 Just an empty house off a highway.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.080
 But this empty house had a miracle living inside of it.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.720
 To this day, he really can't explain what happened

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.880
 and it's one of those stories that how could you?

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.480
 The most rational answer,

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.480
 'cause he wouldn't have hallucinated it.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.040
 That's what's interesting about this.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.560
 We know he got a ride to the clinic.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.120
 There's a lot of times people get injured

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.680
 and they hallucinate stuff.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.280
 I had a friend who got on a motorcycle accident

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.880
 and thought he was in a pumpkin patch for a while.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.760
 But he didn't come home with the giant pumpkin

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.760
 and they're like, where'd you get that from?

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.120
 And he's like, I don't know.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.480
 Like it was fake.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.480
 It was a hallucination.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.920
 He got his brain so rattled

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.520
 that he thought he was somewhere else.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.000
 But he showed up at the clinic in a car

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.520
 and his car was in the middle of the road.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.840
 So he didn't walk, he would have bled to death.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.420
 So we know that that realistic thing happened.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.480
 That's a really cool thing.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.960
 And thanks, Cantillion again for sending us over.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.360
 That's a really cool thing we can kind of hang our hat on

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.040
 or hang our scalp on.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.840
 One of the answers that he was putting forward,

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.800
 that it's possible that this person

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.680
 didn't want to be seen by the police.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.640
 This might have been someone on the run

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.120
 and they were staying at this house just for the day.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.200
 And it would explain why they might've come back

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.040
 and cleaned up any evidence.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.120
 It would explain why they didn't want to get out of the car

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.640
 at any point.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.940
 But it wouldn't explain why they would help

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.100
 a bloody person in the first place.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.140
 Maybe they're a good-hearted criminal,

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.260
 but if you're on the run from the law,

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.540
 you're making a decision.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.140
 Then you also look at stuff like guardian angels,

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.140
 like ghosts, right?

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.420
 I think the idea that he won't get out of the car,

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.220
 like we never saw him.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.220
 It's so weird because we see him walking into the car,

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.300
 but after that he refuses to get out.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.420
 So we know that he can physically walk into a car.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.420
 One of the suggestions,

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.900
 'cause he's told other people about the story,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.760
 he's one of the suggestions that he's heard over the years,

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.180
 was maybe the person was not able to physically

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.240
 able to get out of the car.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.800
 Maybe they had paralysis, they couldn't move their legs.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.040
 And he goes, he could drive a stick shift.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.760
 This guy didn't seem to have a problem with a stick shift.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.120
 Was it just one of those cars?

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.640
 So, and he saw him walk into the car.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.640
 So what, was it a time traveler?

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.200
 Was it someone on the run?

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.480
 Was it a guardian angel?

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.380
 And they chose to take this form?

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.320
 Just a bizarre story all around.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.620
 So the paranormal doesn't always have to be dark.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.460
 The paranormal can sometimes be as lighthearted

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.220
 as a man who's scalp gets ripped off of his skull

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.020
 and is forced to walk up a cliff

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.860
 just so he can get some stitches.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.060
 But it's so fascinating to me that this man,

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.060
 his life was saved.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.140
 One of the most important events in his life

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.380
 is just one big mystery.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.980
 He will always wonder who that man was

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.300
 and why he acted in such bizarre ways.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.720
 And he'll never have any answers.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.040
 He'll go through life knowing that his life was saved

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.480
 by a mystery.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.140
 He may not know who saved him,

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:28.160
 but he will always remember the man who never existed.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.540
