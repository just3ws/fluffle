14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,480
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,320
 Hawaii, a tropical paradise,

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,640
 a place where people go to get away from it all.

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,160
 But at night, a phenomenon happens

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,020
 that makes you pee yourself, literally.

19
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,880
 And then, we travel back in time,

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,800
 not literally as great as that would be,

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,400
 we travel back in time

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,400
 to investigate a string of attacks in 1890s Nebraska.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,120
 What was killing cattle and men alike?

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,520
 Some say it was America's first vampire,

25
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,280
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,860
 (upbeat music)

27
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:15,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,520
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,640
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,480
 I'm having a great day.

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,200
 Today's episode might be a little short,

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,240
 we're having some technical issues.

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,600
 So I kinda gotta get everything done

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,680
 and get it edited, but I hope it still is a one two punch.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,820
 I'm good stuff for you.

37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,120
 And you enjoy it.

38
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,880
 I hope you enjoy every episode, but they're not as short.

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,600
 But let's go ahead and get started here.

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,520
 We're going to sunny, sunny Hawaii.

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,400
 The island that never sleeps.

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,080
 Islands are all islands volcanoes, technically.

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,240
 Technically, I guess no.

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,440
 I guess most islands are just mountains

45
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,600
 that are poking up out of the ocean.

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,080
 But anyways, Hawaii, bunch of volcanoes,

47
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,880
 and Dog the Bounty Hunter lives there.

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,800
 And Hulu skirts and Lilo and Stitch.

49
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,280
 I have now exhausted all of my Hawaii knowledge.

50
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,120
 I've never been there.

51
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
 I'm not a big fan of flying over oceans.

52
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,000
 But there are people who are born there

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,560
 and they don't have to worry about that.

54
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,720
 You just have to worry about Lilo and Stitch

55
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,420
 running around, blowing stuff up.

56
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,760
 So in Hawaii, Hawaii has a rich, rich,

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
 I guess I know more about Hawaii than that.

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,620
 Hawaii has a rich, rich legacy of tribal warfare

59
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,320
 and cultures and stuff like that

60
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,560
 before the settlers showed up.

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
 And you have this community where you have

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,120
 both of those pretty much colliding.

63
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
 Where you have like modern culture

64
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,480
 and then you have these old spiritual beliefs.

65
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,720
 And you have that in a lot of places around the world.

66
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,280
 I think just Hawaii seems to be more rich and magical

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,720
 because it's far away and you need a plane to get there.

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,520
 You know, I had a question the other day.

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,840
 Why don't dogs bark at planes?

70
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
 Why don't animals like freak out

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,880
 when they see planes flying overhead?

72
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,500
 You think that would be the weirdest thing

73
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 in the world for them to see?

74
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,300
 A dog hates fireworks, but a jet can fly through

75
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,540
 the neighborhood and they'd just be like eating their soup.

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,100
 They don't eat soup, but they could be eating

77
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,300
 whatever they're eating.

78
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,140
 So bizarre.

79
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,300
 Anyway, so much for having a short episode.

80
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,700
 Hawaii, civilization and spiritualism collide.

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,000
 So in Hawaii, they have a particular,

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,860
 some could call it a superstition,

83
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,860
 a skeptic could call it a superstition.

84
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,380
 Paranormal investigator could call it a actual event.

85
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,540
 But over there, they call it the night marchers,

86
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,120
 the night marchers.

87
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,320
 And what it is, is they have this thing

88
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,960
 that supposedly has been going on

89
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,100
 since the dawn of their culture,

90
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,200
 where you have these high ranking chieftains who have died

91
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,320
 and they're now in the spirit world.

92
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,960
 But they still gotta get from point A to point B.

93
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,020
 They just don't sit in the grave.

94
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,400
 They wanna go visit this place.

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,340
 They wanna go through this particular portal on this island.

96
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,520
 They wanna go visit.

97
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,060
 Their great, great grand chieftain gets some advice.

98
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,780
 So they have to be able to move

99
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,680
 through the landscape of Hawaii.

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,520
 But these great chieftains aren't gonna do it alone

101
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,180
 because they're most powerful people in their history

102
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,320
 and their culture.

103
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,940
 So they have surrounding them

104
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,460
 what's known as the night marchers.

105
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,020
 These are basically spirit warriors

106
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,700
 who create a convoy.

107
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,360
 So you'll see these,

108
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,860
 it's interesting, it's not just a ghost

109
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,460
 with chains rattling.

110
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,480
 It's like basically a regimen of ghosts

111
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,080
 just marching through the street.

112
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,280
 And you know that this is the way that you know

113
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,340
 that you're running into a group of night marchers

114
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,480
 as opposed to just a random gang of ghosts

115
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,400
 marching in a straight line.

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,640
 They usually march at night

117
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,000
 because they don't wanna be seen.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
 When they march you hear the sound of thunderous drums.

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,380
 (marching)

120
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,240
 The Metallica Blarin'.

121
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
 They carry torches.

122
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,960
 So if you can't hear them right away,

123
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,200
 you can see them and you can go,

124
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,340
 uh-oh, there's the night marchers.

125
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,180
 I wanna get out of the way

126
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,740
 because their goal is to intimidate you

127
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,780
 so you don't look at the chieftain.

128
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,600
 They also blow a big old conch shell.

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,780
 (marching)

130
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,620
 When you hear it and you're like,

131
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,740
 okay, dude, that's enough.

132
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,660
 I heard the thunderous drums to solve the torches.

133
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,460
 You don't have to blow a conch shell in my ear.

134
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,100
 I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

135
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,420
 If you can't get away from these guys,

136
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,540
 if they have, if you're walking down an alley

137
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,340
 and you turn and you see them like a marching band

138
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,900
 start walking down the alley,

139
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,320
 you have to show them fear or reverence.

140
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,440
 You have to show like,

141
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,880
 oh my God, you guys are so spooky.

142
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,000
 Please don't kill me.

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,720
 You either can strip all your clothes off

144
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,000
 and lay flat on the ground

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,040
 and the night marchers will be like,

146
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,600
 yes, we are your superiors

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
 and they'll walk right past you.

148
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,160
 Which actually is a great cover story.

149
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
 If you were like a peeping Tom in Hawaii,

150
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,440
 you'd be like, no officer, no officer.

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
 Night marchers are coming after me.

152
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,080
 That's why I'm totally naked.

153
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,040
 Running through the neighborhood.

154
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,320
 Officers are like, oh, have a good day then.

155
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,100
 And you're like, see, you hear the conch shell?

156
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,340
 The cops are like, yeah, go, go, go.

157
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,660
 Put your clothes on.

158
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,220
 Or if you can't take all your clothes off,

159
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,260
 you're supposed to pee all over yourself

160
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,820
 to show how scared you are.

161
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,660
 And then night marchers go,

162
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,340
 oh, look at that person is in fear of us.

163
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,180
 We'll let him go.

164
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,560
 You're just still just peeing.

165
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,260
 Again, a great excuse if you ever wet your pants in Hawaii.

166
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,380
 Just be like, woo.

167
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,220
 I'm gonna have a ringtone

168
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,940
 that's just a conch shell in my pocket.

169
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,220
 I'm gonna go to Hawaii,

170
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,240
 walk around naked, covered in pee.

171
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,360
 Have perfect, perfect alibi.

172
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,040
 Now, the problem is is that they have had,

173
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,640
 oh, oh, and I guess I should say this.

174
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,280
 If you don't pee on yourself

175
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,400
 or take all your clothes off

176
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,760
 and lay down bowing in front of them,

177
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,280
 they kill you, but it's even worse than that.

178
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,960
 Getting killed by a regiment of ghosts

179
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,400
 would be kind of cool thing to have on your tombstone.

180
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,560
 You become a night marcher

181
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,680
 if you don't do one of these things.

182
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,400
 They do kill you,

183
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,260
 and then you're sucked into their nightly voyages.

184
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,500
 Is it voyage if they're walking?

185
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,700
 They're nightly walks.

186
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,540
 That makes it sound like

187
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,420
 they're just walking around the park.

188
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,740
 But anyways, expeditions,

189
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,220
 you're now trapped as a night marcher

190
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,660
 for the rest of eternity.

191
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,820
 Now, the thing is,

192
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,780
 it's like they've been doing these walks forever,

193
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,580
 but as cities have grown,

194
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,320
 they've actually started to grow onto paths

195
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,620
 where these night marchers are.

196
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,460
 And you're thinking, okay, Jay,

197
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,700
 so this is just like folklore, right?

198
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,660
 Like obviously this isn't a provable thing.

199
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,800
 It's one of those things that

200
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
 I'm sure people have tried investigating it,

201
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,500
 like paranormal investigators and things like that.

202
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,680
 Actually, I know that for a fact,

203
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,000
 because let me get to that part.

204
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,060
 So in 2012, there was a guy, okay,

205
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,060
 he is, his name is Lopaka Kapanui,

206
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,300
 and he's a night marcher expert.

207
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,420
 You're like, oh, so he's like a ghost hunter/storyteller.

208
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,860
 So you're kind of like,

209
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,260
 he may be making this part up,

210
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,600
 but anyways, we're just gonna keep going.

211
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,180
 So people have investigated this stuff.

212
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,500
 He's a night marcher expert.

213
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,500
 So in 2012, a bunch of lawyers call up Lopaka.

214
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,780
 Wait, that's not his name.

215
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,340
 Lopaka, Lopaka, okay, he's all,

216
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,180
 what'd you call me?

217
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,500
 That's not my name hangs up.

218
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,340
 They call him back.

219
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,880
 They're like, sorry, sir, we miss brown sugar name.

220
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,500
 But we need you to come to our corporate office building

221
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,020
 in a shiny, shiny building in the middle of Hawaii,

222
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,480
 'cause we wanna talk to you about something.

223
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,860
 We know you're a night marcher expert,

224
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,340
 and he's like, I am.

225
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,060
 So he shows up and he goes,

226
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,100
 and he's thinking, well, these guys

227
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,900
 probably must have seen some night marchers, right?

228
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,380
 He's like checking their pants to make sure

229
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,780
 that they didn't wet themselves.

230
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,700
 He's like, oh.

231
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,740
 And they say, this is the story

232
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,720
 they've been hearing going on in their building.

233
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,780
 There's a rumor going around in our building

234
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,860
 that the night marchers walked through our lobby one day.

235
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,820
 Blown conch shells, torches, everything.

236
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,100
 And it was freaking people out.

237
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,420
 And they apparently showed Lopaka,

238
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,700
 they're very careful pronouncing his name now,

239
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,980
 showed him a surveillance footage

240
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,220
 and go look and here you can see it.

241
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,700
 And he sees like these night marchers

242
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,540
 walking through the lobby.

243
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,420
 And he's like, oh, that is quite interesting.

244
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,740
 He apparently got a night rush accent all of a sudden.

245
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,020
 And he goes, so yeah, that's what happens is

246
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,620
 places have been built over these particular trails.

247
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,880
 And every so often the night marchers

248
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,140
 will kind of take this trail

249
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,820
 and they'll walk through downtown Honolulu.

250
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,900
 Lawyers go in unison,

251
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,340
 'cause I don't know which one said this,

252
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,380
 but they all said at once,

253
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,460
 there's another part of the story.

254
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,820
 There was a young maid,

255
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,140
 member of a maintenance staff,

256
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,140
 I guess they're not called maids if they work at a law office.

257
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,460
 You sit in their janitors dressed up

258
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,260
 in a cute little French maid outfit.

259
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,940
 Anyways, there is a female maintenance worker

260
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,380
 working at this law firm in this building.

261
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,020
 And she was in the lobby,

262
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,060
 she saw the night marchers walk through.

263
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,980
 She didn't do any of the steps.

264
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,060
 She didn't take her clothes off.

265
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,380
 It's really hard to get out of a sexy maid costume.

266
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,260
 So I understand that.

267
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,620
 She didn't pee herself either.

268
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,460
 Good.

269
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,980
 And so you don't want to ruin that costume.

270
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,140
 So the night marchers walked by her

271
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,740
 and she told people the next day,

272
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,980
 the night marchers, these dudes walked through the lobby

273
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,140
 and I was like totally freaked out.

274
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,460
 People were like, did you take your clothes off?

275
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,860
 And she filed sexual harassment forms against them.

276
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,100
 No, what happened was she said she saw it.

277
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,460
 She didn't do anything like that.

278
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,780
 And she, again, here's probably the urban legend.

279
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,980
 She died the next day.

280
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,100
 And then in a future march

281
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,460
 where the night marchers ended up marching

282
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,020
 through that building,

283
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,860
 one of her coworkers saw her as a night marcher,

284
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,860
 marching through the lobby late at night.

285
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,300
 I think that's a really interesting story.

286
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,260
 And it always, it scares me more.

287
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,860
 People being sucked into like some sort of hell dimension

288
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,780
 than people just get like dying.

289
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,460
 I think the idea of someone watching this

290
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,560
 and not going through the proper steps

291
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,500
 and then getting sucked into this reality

292
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,460
 where for the rest of eternity, they're just marching,

293
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,900
 which would have to be terrible for your feet.

294
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,920
 You'd have like planter fasciitis and all sorts of stuff.

295
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,400
 I doubt the medical care for being a night marcher is great.

296
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,100
 You'd have foot problems always.

297
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,880
 So I think that is more scary than just the ghost killing you.

298
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,040
 I'm assuming the witness who saw her marching

299
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,440
 did pee himself because one, he knows the steps

300
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,060
 and then two, he's seized the actual ramifications

301
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,700
 of someone who didn't follow the steps.

302
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,700
 Now that ending by Lopika may be a bit

303
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,520
 of a storytelling flourish to it all

304
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,540
 'cause he is a professional storyteller.

305
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,320
 But the story of the night marchers has marched on

306
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,880
 through Hawaiian history for centuries.

307
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,720
 And I think it's just a fascinating look

308
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,280
 at what happens when you have like this paranormal

309
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,820
 superstitious world that for the longest time

310
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,880
 we're just marching through these trails

311
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,720
 throughout the islands of Hawaii.

312
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,980
 But as civilization grew and grew and grew and grew

313
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,840
 it basically encroached on those borders

314
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,980
 between the real and the unreal.

315
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,620
 And now these marchers aren't gonna change their patterns.

316
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,580
 They're just gonna continue to march through these cities

317
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,340
 and people who just happen to be visiting,

318
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,460
 people who don't know any of these legends

319
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,380
 are sitting drinking coffee at Starbucks one day

320
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,620
 and they hear a conch shell blow

321
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,860
 and they look out the window.

322
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,500
 And while everyone else is pissing themselves,

323
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,100
 they're like, "Man, what's going on here?"

324
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,360
 Some sort of biological agent making everyone's bladder loose.

325
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,960
 They're opening themselves up

326
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,000
 to becoming a night marcher themselves.

327
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,960
 This is a brief overview of the night marchers.

328
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,320
 There's tons of identified trails throughout Hawaii

329
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,500
 where people are like, "Hey, this trail is closed

330
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,880
 "after sunset."

331
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
 And you're like, "Oh, because of handles?"

332
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
 And they're like, "No, 'cause the night marchers

333
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
 "will get you."

334
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,280
 And you're like, "What?"

335
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,400
 So basically the moral of the story is don't go to Hawaii.

336
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,800
 If you do to go to Hawaii,

337
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
 either bring extra pair of underwear

338
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,520
 or be prepared to be naked at any given point at night.

339
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,880
 And that's just living an exciting life.

340
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,880
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

341
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,600
 Now, our next story is really kind of,

342
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,360
 it kind of falls into the same category

343
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,440
 where there's some official confirmation of it,

344
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,160
 but you have to go off a lot of like,

345
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
 I'm gonna tell you the story and you go,

346
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
 that's an interesting story,

347
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,400
 but and it would just be a typical ghost story

348
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,200
 if there weren't some interesting details in it.

349
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,920
 Let's go back in time.

350
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,840
 Let's go back in time.

351
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,800
 Let's go to 1895, Nebraska.

352
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,480
 Dawes County, to be specific.

353
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,000
 Little County in the middle of Nebraska.

354
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,400
 I don't know any Nebraska stereotypes or accents.

355
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,840
 So you guys are gonna look out on that.

356
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,320
 I guess I just imagine Nebraska is just a big,

357
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,160
 flat state full of flat people wearing flat hats.

358
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,720
 And but not back in 1895

359
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,080
 'cause it was populated by cowboys.

360
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,360
 So they had big hats.

361
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,320
 They were probably still flat.

362
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,800
 But anyways, in Nebraska, in Dawes County,

363
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,640
 you had a rancher come out one day,

364
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,720
 he has a cow ripped to pieces.

365
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,240
 He's like, "Dag, now that was my favorite cow.

366
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,040
 That was my lovin' cow.

367
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,400
 Bessie, why'd you leave me?"

368
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,240
 He's petting it.

369
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,240
 All the blood is drained out of the cow.

370
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,040
 You're like, "Ooh, alien abduction."

371
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,480
 I already gave it away when it is

372
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,360
 in the insurance vampire,

373
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,240
 but anyways, he's like, "Ah, Bessie."

374
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,040
 He can't figure out what it is.

375
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,760
 He starts talking to other people in the area.

376
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,600
 He's like, "Hey, is anything wrong with your cows?"

377
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,200
 And they're like, "It's funny that you say that.

378
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,520
 I was sleeping with my cow last night."

379
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,640
 I mean, I was milking my cow last night.

380
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,520
 Everything was fine.

381
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,080
 And when I woke up this morning, torn shreds,

382
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,920
 completely torn shreds.

383
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,320
 Other ranchers in the area are like,

384
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,680
 "Same things happen to me."

385
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,600
 Now, it didn't all happen on the same night,

386
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,320
 but they were having this ongoing thing.

387
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,880
 That'd be a very busy vampire.

388
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,040
 That'd be like the fattest vampire ever.

389
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,060
 He's like, "Must eat 10 cows a night."

390
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,640
 People started reporting a humanoid-like creature

391
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,760
 in the area.

392
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,600
 And people would be like, "What?

393
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,440
 What do you mean?

394
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,280
 Is it a human?"

395
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,800
 And they're like, "Well, it kind of looked like a human,

396
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,400
 but it didn't act like a human."

397
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,000
 I was like, "Dun dun dun."

398
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,860
 They can't figure it out.

399
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,200
 Search parties, though, at this point,

400
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,480
 are really looking for the culprit,

401
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,840
 the cow killer that's doing all this stuff.

402
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,040
 And one night, moon long on the horizon,

403
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,240
 there's a guy walking around with his gun,

404
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,580
 looking for this cow killer,

405
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,860
 and he sees a dead cow out in the field.

406
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,980
 And he's like, "Aha."

407
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,020
 Actually, that's not a clue.

408
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,780
 They've seen dead cows all over town.

409
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,740
 But a clue is he sees some beast leaning over the cow.

410
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,980
 And he goes, "Aha."

411
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,820
 There's a clue.

412
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,700
 That's an actual clue.

413
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,580
 And he realizes it's a human and a creature.

414
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,420
 Oh, it's not a human.

415
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,260
 It's a creature.

416
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,460
 I mean, it's human.

417
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,140
 And he's lapping up the cow's blood

418
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,900
 right out of an open wound.

419
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,960
 Dude's like, "That's creepy."

420
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,800
 And he runs away.

421
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,440
 It is no report that he shot him or anything like that,

422
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,280
 but he runs away.

423
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,760
 And so now they kind of have something to go off of.

424
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,880
 Yes, it is a human who likes to drink cow's blood.

425
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,200
 Still can't figure out how it's ripping

426
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,040
 these cows to pieces.

427
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,440
 Well, I guess they could just use a bunch of knives

428
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320
 and Wolverine chopping people up.

429
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,160
 Wolverine was around back then.

430
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,760
 I mean, Wolverine's fictional,

431
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,800
 but in the fiction, I think he was like eight

432
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
 in 1895 or something like that.

433
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,080
 So it could have been Wolverine.

434
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,440
 Anyways, there is now we step in our hero of the story,

435
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,940
 a young man known as Jack Lewis.

436
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,080
 He is a cowboy and he's doing his wranglin' thing.

437
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,320
 He's out with wranglers, throwing cows,

438
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,660
 throwing ropes around cows' necks and pulling them in

439
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,300
 and making them go places.

440
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,400
 They wrangle up cows.

441
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,920
 They wrangle them.

442
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,860
 But dusk is setting this night.

443
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,660
 Sun going over the horizon.

444
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,440
 I should tell you all these attacks took place at night too.

445
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,320
 It's not a surprise that it's a vampire,

446
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,340
 but we'll get into some surprising stuff in a second.

447
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,860
 Sun's going over the horizon.

448
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:34,340
 Big fiery fireball that gives the earth life disappears

449
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,920
 and is replaced by twilight.

450
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,660
 Jack Lewis is hanging out with his buddies

451
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,960
 and he goes away for some quote personal time.

452
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,200
 That's an actual, that's actually what the articles

453
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,800
 kept saying he's stepped aside for personal time.

454
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,640
 So you can imagine what a cowboy does with this personal time.

455
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,760
 I guess most people would probably think

456
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,600
 he was going to the bathroom.

457
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,040
 I immediately assumed he was masturbating

458
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,720
 on the other side of a hill.

459
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,700
 But whatever he was doing, he was by himself.

460
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,160
 Hopefully he was just like reading a book

461
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,520
 because what happens is as he's,

462
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,740
 well he's pleasing himself.

463
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,340
 He's most likely masturbating on the other side of the hill.

464
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,900
 He's very focused.

465
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,100
 He's thinking, you know, whatever cowboys think of,

466
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,900
 whatever cowboys think of, I don't wanna know.

467
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,740
 Leather, they're probably into leather.

468
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,160
 They're probably into like some like rugged stuff.

469
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,360
 Dusty women, like women just covered in dust.

470
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,480
 They might have just been attracted to normal women.

471
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,000
 But anyways, as this cowboy is pleasing himself

472
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,560
 on the other side of this prairie,

473
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,200
 on the other side of this hill,

474
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,920
 we see from the point of view of the vampire,

475
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
 it's thermal vision.

476
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
 (sighs)

477
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,800
 The vampire's like, what's he doing?

478
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,400
 No, that's a little embarrassing.

479
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,440
 Guys, masturbating.

480
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,040
 Yeah, I'll let him finish first.

481
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,180
 I don't want, I'll wait until he washes his hands.

482
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,340
 Vampire, crawl some eyes in the bushes.

483
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,220
 Jack Lewis finishes off.

484
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,940
 Vampire sees him kinda wipe his hands off.

485
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,180
 Vampire, that part of the story,

486
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,940
 there's no verification for it.

487
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,460
 All we know is that Jack Lewis

488
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,860
 was spending some personal time alone.

489
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,020
 And while he was doing that, vampire

490
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,620
 jumps out of the bushes and lands on him.

491
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,980
 And Jack Lewis, he's trying to pull his pants up.

492
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,280
 He's like, oh no, oh no.

493
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,460
 But at the same time, he's trying to fight this thing off.

494
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,280
 And the first thing he does is he feels it,

495
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,860
 try to bite into his neck

496
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,800
 and at the same time, strangle him.

497
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,000
 So it's basically like a frenzied attack.

498
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,080
 He's feeling two hands around his throat

499
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,040
 and then he's getting bit as well, really deep bites.

500
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,800
 And Jack is freaking out.

501
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,240
 He grabs his gun and starts firing off shots.

502
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,360
 Basically, there's no chance he's gonna hit a guy

503
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,180
 on his back with a rifle, maybe he had a pistol,

504
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,360
 but even then, shooting bullets right by your head.

505
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,540
 What he really needed to do was alert his friends

506
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,140
 on the other side of the prairie.

507
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,740
 They come over the prairie and the creature sees them

508
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,940
 and jumps off and starts running.

509
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
 And they all get on their horses

510
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,900
 and they're like, Jack, what were you doing?

511
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,140
 You're by yourself in the first place.

512
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,460
 And he's like, I've read in a book.

513
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,300
 They're like, where's the book?

514
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,300
 He's like, charge.

515
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,860
 And they all go off in their horses.

516
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,460
 They chase this guy off into the night

517
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,900
 and he gets darker and darker and darker.

518
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,540
 And eventually they lose him.

519
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,320
 Twilight has now turned to night

520
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,880
 and they lose track of this man who's out running horses.

521
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,040
 Jack Lewis wasn't doing too well.

522
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,480
 He had facial wounds like he was all cut up

523
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
 and he had neck wounds, he was all bit,

524
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
 but he did survive.

525
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,840
 Now, there's a couple interesting things about that.

526
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,680
 And you go, Jason, okay, so that's like a local legend.

527
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,600
 And it kind of is.

528
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,760
 We have no news articles that this event ever took place.

529
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,840
 That's ends up red flag number one.

530
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,240
 But here's some interesting tidbits.

531
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,500
 This story is found on Nebraska's,

532
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,980
 let me find the actual website.

533
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,980
 This story is found on history.nebraska.gov.

534
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,660
 So it's on their official website.

535
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,460
 Now they do have a section for folklore,

536
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,200
 but there's maybe only four stories

537
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,800
 on this whole folklore section of this website.

538
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,100
 And they're usually like a mild ghost story.

539
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,960
 So this one sticks out of place as far as that goes.

540
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,960
 Most stories like this have some sort of conclusion.

541
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,520
 Most folklore like this has some sort of conclusion.

542
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,520
 Where when we talked about Bunny Man a couple days ago,

543
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,920
 you had, when we look at the urban legend of it,

544
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,360
 you had the inmates escape from the prison

545
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,520
 and then one kills the other one

546
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,800
 and then he hangs himself

547
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,720
 and now his ghost haunts Honey Man, Bunny Man Bridge,

548
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,560
 Bunny Man Bridge, not Honey Man Bridge,

549
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,020
 which sounds delicious.

550
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,920
 I wouldn't mind dying there.

551
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,280
 You're all like, "Rub, rub, rub."

552
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
 It had a beginning, middle and end.

553
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,120
 This one is basically the end is,

554
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,640
 this creature's still out there.

555
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,800
 Whatever it was, they were never able to identify it.

556
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,840
 He never turned around and said,

557
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,800
 "I defied the Christian God and I've been cursed."

558
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,000
 There's no moral to this story in any way, shape or form.

559
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,960
 It's a series of events that happen,

560
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,060
 a final confrontation, only final because the guy took off.

561
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,440
 Now there are some urban legends that do end like that,

562
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,800
 but for the most part,

563
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,480
 they tend to have some sort of satisfying wrap up,

564
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,560
 even if the wrap up is, and now he's a ghost.

565
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,120
 This one is just a guy was eating cows

566
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,000
 and we shot at him and we chased him

567
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,400
 and we never saw him again.

568
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,960
 And there's no saying.

569
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,760
 And then on the 18th night of every February,

570
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,400
 he shows up to eat more cow.

571
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,720
 There's nothing like that.

572
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,860
 If we take into account that this story

573
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,000
 actually happened in 1895, there's a very, very interesting.

574
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,440
 So let's assume that elements of the story are real

575
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,240
 or the story itself is real.

576
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,000
 This is something that was very fascinating to me.

577
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,800
 You could have had real cows getting killed in Nebraska.

578
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,640
 From whatever, there was some maniac

579
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,560
 walking around knives stabbing cows.

580
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,480
 They were a bunch of unexplained cow deaths

581
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,020
 and someone created the ending of the story

582
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,480
 to explain for the cows.

583
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,140
 It's possible that the cows actually were dying

584
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,920
 and there was a human killing them

585
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,480
 and he was drinking their blood

586
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,540
 and the story is for the most part true,

587
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,040
 except for the frenzied vampire attack

588
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,380
 on Jack Lewis at the ending.

589
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,160
 That might have been made up or could have all been true.

590
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,320
 So we have this attack in 1895 that if somebody

591
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,680
 was going to make up a story about a vampire attack,

592
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,480
 you would just pick the things that you know from Dracula

593
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,140
 because those are the most commonly things

594
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,360
 known about vampires.

595
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,180
 In 1895, the book Dracula didn't exist.

596
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,000
 It wasn't written.

597
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,800
 It came out in 1897.

598
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 So it's not like these attacks were happening

599
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,280
 and people go, oh, this is just like that book Dracula.

600
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,880
 And they started adding details onto it.

601
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,560
 It's almost like these events happened

602
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,800
 before anyone had ever heard that name,

603
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,060
 unless you lived in Yugoslavia or Transylvania

604
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,420
 or something like that.

605
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,000
 Like for an American rancher in 1895

606
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,840
 to have ever heard about that type of vampire,

607
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,380
 they may have heard of a Irish vampire coming

608
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,260
 from their homeland or a German vampire

609
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,860
 when they came over and stuff like that.

610
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,640
 But this is basically like a vampire boiled down

611
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,080
 to its roots, a beast creature that drinks blood

612
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,360
 that hunts at night that is incredibly strong

613
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,380
 and tries to tear your throat out.

614
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,720
 That's like if you took all the different versions

615
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
 of vampirism or vampires from around the world

616
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,280
 and boiled them down to their one core identifier,

617
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,120
 that's it.

618
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,720
 The Irish one, it's like, oh, but then he also

619
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,520
 likes to do this and the Spanish one's like,

620
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,140
 well, you gotta like put a rock in his mouth.

621
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,740
 Like every other country has their own little take

622
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,880
 on the details, but if you boil them all down

623
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,520
 to their pure essence, that was this attack.

624
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,720
 And that's the book Dracula, but this attack took place

625
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,920
 before these farmers would have ever read that book.

626
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,920
 So that's another detail that makes it more plausible.

627
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,000
 Was there really a vampire running around Nebraska,

628
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,880
 eating cows?

629
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,040
 Was there a creature who avoided humans

630
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,280
 for the longest time?

631
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,940
 It could have been killing these ranchers the whole time.

632
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,900
 Wasn't killing them.

633
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,100
 It's killing the cattle.

634
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,540
 But one night when it saw a man out there alone,

635
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,060
 it attacked him and that man survived.

636
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,940
 Now, when I say too, it wasn't killing other ranchers.

637
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,180
 It may have been killing people that weren't from around there,

638
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,140
 settlers moving through the area and so forth.

639
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,220
 Because someone who goes missing in your area,

640
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,640
 you will know the next day.

641
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
 But if someone's traveling from New York to California

642
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,220
 goes missing, it's a little bit harder to find out

643
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,180
 where they went wrong.

644
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,260
 Like what happened to them?

645
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,620
 They don't have cell phones unless they sent to telegram

646
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,000
 saying I'm in the middle of Nebraska,

647
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,780
 I'm in Dahls County today,

648
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,260
 and then you don't get a telegram the next day,

649
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,960
 you're never gonna know where those people disappeared at.

650
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,400
 The frontier of America would have been prime

651
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,220
 vampire hunting ground.

652
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,320
 You would have people traveling across this giant

653
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,500
 country in small groups, in pairs,

654
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,100
 maybe even alone, not in pairs,

655
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,660
 they're driving around fruit,

656
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,180
 but in pairs or even alone if they were very,

657
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,420
 like if they were on the run from the law

658
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,260
 or something like that.

659
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,560
 These huge stretches of nothing but wilderness,

660
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,620
 America would have been a prime hunting ground for vampires.

661
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,740
 And you find, it's kind of an interesting way

662
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,620
 to look at that.

663
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,860
 Because you would have had, let's put on

664
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,000
 our paranormal caps here for a second.

665
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,720
 You have these old world vampire alcoves throughout Europe.

666
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,400
 You have some in Japan and things like that.

667
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,920
 And as these expeditions are being sent over

668
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,600
 these explorations and things like that,

669
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,520
 basically it would be the equivalent of,

670
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,400
 if in your hometown,

671
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,000
 they opened up a brand new fast food restaurant,

672
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,760
 but it was the biggest fast food restaurant ever.

673
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,160
 That's how a vampire would have seen America.

674
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,960
 Because everyone you have families

675
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,020
 that have lived in Germany for a hundred years,

676
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,060
 if they go missing, people are going to notice.

677
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,300
 But when you start to have hundreds of thousands of people

678
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,640
 travel a perilous ocean to get to a wasteland

679
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,260
 or a wild land is a better term for it.

680
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,460
 And begin settling across it.

681
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,240
 People go missing all the time on the boat voyage over.

682
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,840
 When they first reach and the weather gets really bad

683
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,580
 that year, even another hundred, 200 years,

684
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,420
 we're in the 1770s, we're in the 1770s,

685
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,980
 we're in the 1800s, we're in the early 1900s.

686
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,280
 You still have huge stretches of land

687
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,720
 people are traveling across.

688
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,420
 And you have mixed in with these groups of settlers,

689
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,820
 just one vampire could be responsible

690
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,800
 for the disappearance of an entire colony,

691
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,460
 like Roanoke or something like that.

692
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,040
 America would have been a prime hunting ground

693
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,440
 for age old vampires.

694
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,140
 Nobody knew who they were.

695
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,500
 Nobody knew their weaknesses.

696
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,480
 And they could hunt without regard to being caught.

697
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,880
 Because if you found a family slaughtered

698
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,180
 in the middle of nowhere, you would assume Indians,

699
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,160
 bear attack, bad luck.

700
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,320
 But most likely we just never find the bodies at all.

701
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,520
 And it could be like the Hawaii story,

702
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,400
 where they could be out in the wilderness,

703
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,160
 hunting the way they've hunted for the past

704
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,360
 three, 400 years in America.

705
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,200
 And as our cities again are encroaching

706
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,800
 on the hunting grounds of these creatures

707
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,880
 that may be killing people one by one,

708
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,040
 hitchhikers, broken down motorists, things like that.

709
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,920
 As our cities, just like the Hawaii story,

710
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,080
 as our cities get bigger and encroach on their hunting grounds,

711
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,120
 they've been hunting for three, 400 years in America.

712
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
 They don't have a choice,

713
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,420
 but to start hunting in the cities.

714
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,480
 They aren't already.

715
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,840
 In the early days of America,

716
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,520
 there was no social safety net.

717
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,680
 If you came here, you had to work as hard as you could,

718
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,080
 or you failed and died.

719
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,280
 And people from all over the world came over

720
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,440
 to try their luck at the American dream.

721
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,640
 But more than just people may have come over on those boats.

722
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,200
 Come over to give it their best shot,

723
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,400
 to try to make a life in America,

724
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,700
 even if that meant killing us in the process.

725
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,580
 (upbeat music)

726
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,380

 (upbeat music)

736
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,720
 (upbeat music)

737
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,300
 (upbeat music)

738
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,880
 (upbeat music)

739
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
