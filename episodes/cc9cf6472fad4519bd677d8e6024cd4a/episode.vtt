 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.320
 Hawaii, a tropical paradise,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.640
 a place where people go to get away from it all.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.160
 But at night, a phenomenon happens

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.020
 that makes you pee yourself, literally.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.880
 And then, we travel back in time,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.800
 not literally as great as that would be,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.400
 we travel back in time

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 to investigate a string of attacks in 1890s Nebraska.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.120
 What was killing cattle and men alike?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.520
 Some say it was America's first vampire,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.280
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.860
 (upbeat music)

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.520
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.640
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.480
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
 Today's episode might be a little short,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.240
 we're having some technical issues.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.600
 So I kinda gotta get everything done

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.680
 and get it edited, but I hope it still is a one two punch.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.820
 I'm good stuff for you.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120
 And you enjoy it.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.880
 I hope you enjoy every episode, but they're not as short.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.600
 But let's go ahead and get started here.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.520
 We're going to sunny, sunny Hawaii.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.400
 The island that never sleeps.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.080
 Islands are all islands volcanoes, technically.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.240
 Technically, I guess no.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.440
 I guess most islands are just mountains

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.600
 that are poking up out of the ocean.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.080
 But anyways, Hawaii, bunch of volcanoes,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.880
 and Dog the Bounty Hunter lives there.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.800
 And Hulu skirts and Lilo and Stitch.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.280
 I have now exhausted all of my Hawaii knowledge.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.120
 I've never been there.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120
 I'm not a big fan of flying over oceans.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.000
 But there are people who are born there

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.560
 and they don't have to worry about that.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.720
 You just have to worry about Lilo and Stitch

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.420
 running around, blowing stuff up.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.760
 So in Hawaii, Hawaii has a rich, rich,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.440
 I guess I know more about Hawaii than that.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.620
 Hawaii has a rich, rich legacy of tribal warfare

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.320
 and cultures and stuff like that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.560
 before the settlers showed up.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.680
 And you have this community where you have

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.120
 both of those pretty much colliding.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 Where you have like modern culture

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.480
 and then you have these old spiritual beliefs.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.720
 And you have that in a lot of places around the world.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.280
 I think just Hawaii seems to be more rich and magical

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.720
 because it's far away and you need a plane to get there.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.520
 You know, I had a question the other day.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.840
 Why don't dogs bark at planes?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.360
 Why don't animals like freak out

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880
 when they see planes flying overhead?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.500
 You think that would be the weirdest thing

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
 in the world for them to see?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.300
 A dog hates fireworks, but a jet can fly through

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.540
 the neighborhood and they'd just be like eating their soup.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.100
 They don't eat soup, but they could be eating

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.300
 whatever they're eating.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.140
 So bizarre.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.300
 Anyway, so much for having a short episode.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.700
 Hawaii, civilization and spiritualism collide.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.000
 So in Hawaii, they have a particular,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.860
 some could call it a superstition,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.860
 a skeptic could call it a superstition.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.380
 Paranormal investigator could call it a actual event.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.540
 But over there, they call it the night marchers,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.120
 the night marchers.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.320
 And what it is, is they have this thing

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.960
 that supposedly has been going on

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.100
 since the dawn of their culture,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.200
 where you have these high ranking chieftains who have died

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.320
 and they're now in the spirit world.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.960
 But they still gotta get from point A to point B.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.020
 They just don't sit in the grave.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.400
 They wanna go visit this place.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.340
 They wanna go through this particular portal on this island.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.520
 They wanna go visit.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.060
 Their great, great grand chieftain gets some advice.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.780
 So they have to be able to move

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.680
 through the landscape of Hawaii.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.520
 But these great chieftains aren't gonna do it alone

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.180
 because they're most powerful people in their history

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.320
 and their culture.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.940
 So they have surrounding them

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.460
 what's known as the night marchers.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.020
 These are basically spirit warriors

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.700
 who create a convoy.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.360
 So you'll see these,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.860
 it's interesting, it's not just a ghost

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.460
 with chains rattling.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.480
 It's like basically a regimen of ghosts

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.080
 just marching through the street.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.280
 And you know that this is the way that you know

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.340
 that you're running into a group of night marchers

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.480
 as opposed to just a random gang of ghosts

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.400
 marching in a straight line.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.640
 They usually march at night

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.000
 because they don't wanna be seen.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.120
 When they march you hear the sound of thunderous drums.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.380
 (marching)

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.240
 The Metallica Blarin'.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.240
 They carry torches.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.960
 So if you can't hear them right away,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.200
 you can see them and you can go,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.340
 uh-oh, there's the night marchers.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.180
 I wanna get out of the way

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.740
 because their goal is to intimidate you

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.780
 so you don't look at the chieftain.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.600
 They also blow a big old conch shell.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.780
 (marching)

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.620
 When you hear it and you're like,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.740
 okay, dude, that's enough.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.660
 I heard the thunderous drums to solve the torches.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.460
 You don't have to blow a conch shell in my ear.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.100
 I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.420
 If you can't get away from these guys,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.540
 if they have, if you're walking down an alley

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.340
 and you turn and you see them like a marching band

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.900
 start walking down the alley,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.320
 you have to show them fear or reverence.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.440
 You have to show like,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.880
 oh my God, you guys are so spooky.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.000
 Please don't kill me.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.720
 You either can strip all your clothes off

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.000
 and lay flat on the ground

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.040
 and the night marchers will be like,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.600
 yes, we are your superiors

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.200
 and they'll walk right past you.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.160
 Which actually is a great cover story.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
 If you were like a peeping Tom in Hawaii,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.440
 you'd be like, no officer, no officer.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.720
 Night marchers are coming after me.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.080
 That's why I'm totally naked.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.040
 Running through the neighborhood.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.320
 Officers are like, oh, have a good day then.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.100
 And you're like, see, you hear the conch shell?

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.340
 The cops are like, yeah, go, go, go.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.660
 Put your clothes on.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.220
 Or if you can't take all your clothes off,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.260
 you're supposed to pee all over yourself

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.820
 to show how scared you are.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.660
 And then night marchers go,

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.340
 oh, look at that person is in fear of us.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.180
 We'll let him go.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.560
 You're just still just peeing.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.260
 Again, a great excuse if you ever wet your pants in Hawaii.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.380
 Just be like, woo.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.220
 I'm gonna have a ringtone

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.940
 that's just a conch shell in my pocket.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.220
 I'm gonna go to Hawaii,

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.240
 walk around naked, covered in pee.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.360
 Have perfect, perfect alibi.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.040
 Now, the problem is is that they have had,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.640
 oh, oh, and I guess I should say this.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.280
 If you don't pee on yourself

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.400
 or take all your clothes off

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.760
 and lay down bowing in front of them,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.280
 they kill you, but it's even worse than that.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.960
 Getting killed by a regiment of ghosts

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.400
 would be kind of cool thing to have on your tombstone.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.560
 You become a night marcher

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.680
 if you don't do one of these things.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.400
 They do kill you,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.260
 and then you're sucked into their nightly voyages.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.500
 Is it voyage if they're walking?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.700
 They're nightly walks.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.540
 That makes it sound like

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.420
 they're just walking around the park.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.740
 But anyways, expeditions,

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.220
 you're now trapped as a night marcher

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.660
 for the rest of eternity.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.820
 Now, the thing is,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.780
 it's like they've been doing these walks forever,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.580
 but as cities have grown,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.320
 they've actually started to grow onto paths

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.620
 where these night marchers are.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.460
 And you're thinking, okay, Jay,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.700
 so this is just like folklore, right?

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.660
 Like obviously this isn't a provable thing.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.800
 It's one of those things that

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.000
 I'm sure people have tried investigating it,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.500
 like paranormal investigators and things like that.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.680
 Actually, I know that for a fact,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.000
 because let me get to that part.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.060
 So in 2012, there was a guy, okay,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.060
 he is, his name is Lopaka Kapanui,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.300
 and he's a night marcher expert.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.420
 You're like, oh, so he's like a ghost hunter/storyteller.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.860
 So you're kind of like,

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.260
 he may be making this part up,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.600
 but anyways, we're just gonna keep going.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.180
 So people have investigated this stuff.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.500
 He's a night marcher expert.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.500
 So in 2012, a bunch of lawyers call up Lopaka.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.780
 Wait, that's not his name.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.340
 Lopaka, Lopaka, okay, he's all,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.180
 what'd you call me?

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.500
 That's not my name hangs up.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.340
 They call him back.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.880
 They're like, sorry, sir, we miss brown sugar name.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.500
 But we need you to come to our corporate office building

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.020
 in a shiny, shiny building in the middle of Hawaii,

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.480
 'cause we wanna talk to you about something.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.860
 We know you're a night marcher expert,

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.340
 and he's like, I am.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.060
 So he shows up and he goes,

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.100
 and he's thinking, well, these guys

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.900
 probably must have seen some night marchers, right?

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.380
 He's like checking their pants to make sure

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.780
 that they didn't wet themselves.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.700
 He's like, oh.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.740
 And they say, this is the story

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.720
 they've been hearing going on in their building.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.780
 There's a rumor going around in our building

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.860
 that the night marchers walked through our lobby one day.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.820
 Blown conch shells, torches, everything.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.100
 And it was freaking people out.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.420
 And they apparently showed Lopaka,

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.700
 they're very careful pronouncing his name now,

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.980
 showed him a surveillance footage

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.220
 and go look and here you can see it.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.700
 And he sees like these night marchers

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.540
 walking through the lobby.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.420
 And he's like, oh, that is quite interesting.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.740
 He apparently got a night rush accent all of a sudden.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.020
 And he goes, so yeah, that's what happens is

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.620
 places have been built over these particular trails.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.880
 And every so often the night marchers

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.140
 will kind of take this trail

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.820
 and they'll walk through downtown Honolulu.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.900
 Lawyers go in unison,

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.340
 'cause I don't know which one said this,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.380
 but they all said at once,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.460
 there's another part of the story.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.820
 There was a young maid,

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.140
 member of a maintenance staff,

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.140
 I guess they're not called maids if they work at a law office.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.460
 You sit in their janitors dressed up

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.260
 in a cute little French maid outfit.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.940
 Anyways, there is a female maintenance worker

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.380
 working at this law firm in this building.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.020
 And she was in the lobby,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.060
 she saw the night marchers walk through.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.980
 She didn't do any of the steps.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.060
 She didn't take her clothes off.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.380
 It's really hard to get out of a sexy maid costume.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.260
 So I understand that.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.620
 She didn't pee herself either.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.460
 Good.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.980
 And so you don't want to ruin that costume.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.140
 So the night marchers walked by her

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.740
 and she told people the next day,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.980
 the night marchers, these dudes walked through the lobby

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.140
 and I was like totally freaked out.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.460
 People were like, did you take your clothes off?

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.860
 And she filed sexual harassment forms against them.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.100
 No, what happened was she said she saw it.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.460
 She didn't do anything like that.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.780
 And she, again, here's probably the urban legend.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.980
 She died the next day.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.100
 And then in a future march

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.460
 where the night marchers ended up marching

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.020
 through that building,

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.860
 one of her coworkers saw her as a night marcher,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.860
 marching through the lobby late at night.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.300
 I think that's a really interesting story.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.260
 And it always, it scares me more.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.860
 People being sucked into like some sort of hell dimension

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.780
 than people just get like dying.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.460
 I think the idea of someone watching this

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.560
 and not going through the proper steps

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.500
 and then getting sucked into this reality

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.460
 where for the rest of eternity, they're just marching,

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.900
 which would have to be terrible for your feet.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.920
 You'd have like planter fasciitis and all sorts of stuff.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.400
 I doubt the medical care for being a night marcher is great.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.100
 You'd have foot problems always.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.880
 So I think that is more scary than just the ghost killing you.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.040
 I'm assuming the witness who saw her marching

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.440
 did pee himself because one, he knows the steps

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.060
 and then two, he's seized the actual ramifications

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.700
 of someone who didn't follow the steps.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.700
 Now that ending by Lopika may be a bit

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.520
 of a storytelling flourish to it all

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.540
 'cause he is a professional storyteller.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.320
 But the story of the night marchers has marched on

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.880
 through Hawaiian history for centuries.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.720
 And I think it's just a fascinating look

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.280
 at what happens when you have like this paranormal

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.820
 superstitious world that for the longest time

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.880
 we're just marching through these trails

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.720
 throughout the islands of Hawaii.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.980
 But as civilization grew and grew and grew and grew

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.840
 it basically encroached on those borders

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.980
 between the real and the unreal.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.620
 And now these marchers aren't gonna change their patterns.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.580
 They're just gonna continue to march through these cities

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.340
 and people who just happen to be visiting,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.460
 people who don't know any of these legends

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.380
 are sitting drinking coffee at Starbucks one day

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.620
 and they hear a conch shell blow

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.860
 and they look out the window.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.500
 And while everyone else is pissing themselves,

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.100
 they're like, "Man, what's going on here?"

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.360
 Some sort of biological agent making everyone's bladder loose.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.960
 They're opening themselves up

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.000
 to becoming a night marcher themselves.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.960
 This is a brief overview of the night marchers.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.320
 There's tons of identified trails throughout Hawaii

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.500
 where people are like, "Hey, this trail is closed

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.880
 "after sunset."

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.240
 And you're like, "Oh, because of handles?"

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.600
 And they're like, "No, 'cause the night marchers

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.440
 "will get you."

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.280
 And you're like, "What?"

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.400
 So basically the moral of the story is don't go to Hawaii.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.800
 If you do to go to Hawaii,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.560
 either bring extra pair of underwear

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.520
 or be prepared to be naked at any given point at night.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.880
 And that's just living an exciting life.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.880
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.600
 Now, our next story is really kind of,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.360
 it kind of falls into the same category

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.440
 where there's some official confirmation of it,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.160
 but you have to go off a lot of like,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
 I'm gonna tell you the story and you go,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.600
 that's an interesting story,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.400
 but and it would just be a typical ghost story

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.200
 if there weren't some interesting details in it.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.920
 Let's go back in time.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.840
 Let's go back in time.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.800
 Let's go to 1895, Nebraska.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.480
 Dawes County, to be specific.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.000
 Little County in the middle of Nebraska.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.400
 I don't know any Nebraska stereotypes or accents.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.840
 So you guys are gonna look out on that.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.320
 I guess I just imagine Nebraska is just a big,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.160
 flat state full of flat people wearing flat hats.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.720
 And but not back in 1895

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.080
 'cause it was populated by cowboys.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.360
 So they had big hats.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.320
 They were probably still flat.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.800
 But anyways, in Nebraska, in Dawes County,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.640
 you had a rancher come out one day,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.720
 he has a cow ripped to pieces.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.240
 He's like, "Dag, now that was my favorite cow.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.040
 That was my lovin' cow.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.400
 Bessie, why'd you leave me?"

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.240
 He's petting it.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.240
 All the blood is drained out of the cow.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.040
 You're like, "Ooh, alien abduction."

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.480
 I already gave it away when it is

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.360
 in the insurance vampire,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.240
 but anyways, he's like, "Ah, Bessie."

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.040
 He can't figure out what it is.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.760
 He starts talking to other people in the area.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.600
 He's like, "Hey, is anything wrong with your cows?"

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.200
 And they're like, "It's funny that you say that.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.520
 I was sleeping with my cow last night."

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.640
 I mean, I was milking my cow last night.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.520
 Everything was fine.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.080
 And when I woke up this morning, torn shreds,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.920
 completely torn shreds.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.320
 Other ranchers in the area are like,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.680
 "Same things happen to me."

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.600
 Now, it didn't all happen on the same night,

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.320
 but they were having this ongoing thing.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.880
 That'd be a very busy vampire.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.040
 That'd be like the fattest vampire ever.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.060
 He's like, "Must eat 10 cows a night."

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.640
 People started reporting a humanoid-like creature

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.760
 in the area.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.600
 And people would be like, "What?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.440
 What do you mean?

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.280
 Is it a human?"

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.800
 And they're like, "Well, it kind of looked like a human,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.400
 but it didn't act like a human."

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.000
 I was like, "Dun dun dun."

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.860
 They can't figure it out.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.200
 Search parties, though, at this point,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.480
 are really looking for the culprit,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.840
 the cow killer that's doing all this stuff.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.040
 And one night, moon long on the horizon,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.240
 there's a guy walking around with his gun,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.580
 looking for this cow killer,

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.860
 and he sees a dead cow out in the field.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.980
 And he's like, "Aha."

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.020
 Actually, that's not a clue.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.780
 They've seen dead cows all over town.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.740
 But a clue is he sees some beast leaning over the cow.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.980
 And he goes, "Aha."

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.820
 There's a clue.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.700
 That's an actual clue.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.580
 And he realizes it's a human and a creature.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.420
 Oh, it's not a human.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.260
 It's a creature.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.460
 I mean, it's human.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.140
 And he's lapping up the cow's blood

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.900
 right out of an open wound.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.960
 Dude's like, "That's creepy."

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.800
 And he runs away.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.440
 It is no report that he shot him or anything like that,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.280
 but he runs away.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.760
 And so now they kind of have something to go off of.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.880
 Yes, it is a human who likes to drink cow's blood.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.200
 Still can't figure out how it's ripping

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.040
 these cows to pieces.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.440
 Well, I guess they could just use a bunch of knives

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.320
 and Wolverine chopping people up.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.160
 Wolverine was around back then.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.760
 I mean, Wolverine's fictional,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.800
 but in the fiction, I think he was like eight

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.240
 in 1895 or something like that.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.080
 So it could have been Wolverine.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.440
 Anyways, there is now we step in our hero of the story,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.940
 a young man known as Jack Lewis.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.080
 He is a cowboy and he's doing his wranglin' thing.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.320
 He's out with wranglers, throwing cows,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.660
 throwing ropes around cows' necks and pulling them in

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.300
 and making them go places.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.400
 They wrangle up cows.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.920
 They wrangle them.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.860
 But dusk is setting this night.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.660
 Sun going over the horizon.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.440
 I should tell you all these attacks took place at night too.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.320
 It's not a surprise that it's a vampire,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.340
 but we'll get into some surprising stuff in a second.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.860
 Sun's going over the horizon.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:34.340
 Big fiery fireball that gives the earth life disappears

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.920
 and is replaced by twilight.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.660
 Jack Lewis is hanging out with his buddies

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.960
 and he goes away for some quote personal time.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.200
 That's an actual, that's actually what the articles

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.800
 kept saying he's stepped aside for personal time.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.640
 So you can imagine what a cowboy does with this personal time.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.760
 I guess most people would probably think

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.600
 he was going to the bathroom.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.040
 I immediately assumed he was masturbating

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.720
 on the other side of a hill.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.700
 But whatever he was doing, he was by himself.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.160
 Hopefully he was just like reading a book

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.520
 because what happens is as he's,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.740
 well he's pleasing himself.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.340
 He's most likely masturbating on the other side of the hill.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.900
 He's very focused.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.100
 He's thinking, you know, whatever cowboys think of,

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.900
 whatever cowboys think of, I don't wanna know.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.740
 Leather, they're probably into leather.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.160
 They're probably into like some like rugged stuff.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.360
 Dusty women, like women just covered in dust.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.480
 They might have just been attracted to normal women.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.000
 But anyways, as this cowboy is pleasing himself

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.560
 on the other side of this prairie,

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.200
 on the other side of this hill,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.920
 we see from the point of view of the vampire,

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.920
 it's thermal vision.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.920
 (sighs)

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.800
 The vampire's like, what's he doing?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.400
 No, that's a little embarrassing.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.440
 Guys, masturbating.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.040
 Yeah, I'll let him finish first.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.180
 I don't want, I'll wait until he washes his hands.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.340
 Vampire, crawl some eyes in the bushes.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.220
 Jack Lewis finishes off.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.940
 Vampire sees him kinda wipe his hands off.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.180
 Vampire, that part of the story,

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.940
 there's no verification for it.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.460
 All we know is that Jack Lewis

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.860
 was spending some personal time alone.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.020
 And while he was doing that, vampire

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.620
 jumps out of the bushes and lands on him.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.980
 And Jack Lewis, he's trying to pull his pants up.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.280
 He's like, oh no, oh no.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.460
 But at the same time, he's trying to fight this thing off.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.280
 And the first thing he does is he feels it,

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.860
 try to bite into his neck

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.800
 and at the same time, strangle him.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.000
 So it's basically like a frenzied attack.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.080
 He's feeling two hands around his throat

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.040
 and then he's getting bit as well, really deep bites.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.800
 And Jack is freaking out.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.240
 He grabs his gun and starts firing off shots.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.360
 Basically, there's no chance he's gonna hit a guy

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.180
 on his back with a rifle, maybe he had a pistol,

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.360
 but even then, shooting bullets right by your head.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.540
 What he really needed to do was alert his friends

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.140
 on the other side of the prairie.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.740
 They come over the prairie and the creature sees them

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.940
 and jumps off and starts running.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.940
 And they all get on their horses

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.900
 and they're like, Jack, what were you doing?

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.140
 You're by yourself in the first place.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.460
 And he's like, I've read in a book.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.300
 They're like, where's the book?

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.300
 He's like, charge.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.860
 And they all go off in their horses.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.460
 They chase this guy off into the night

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.900
 and he gets darker and darker and darker.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.540
 And eventually they lose him.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.320
 Twilight has now turned to night

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.880
 and they lose track of this man who's out running horses.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.040
 Jack Lewis wasn't doing too well.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.480
 He had facial wounds like he was all cut up

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.640
 and he had neck wounds, he was all bit,

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.080
 but he did survive.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.840
 Now, there's a couple interesting things about that.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.680
 And you go, Jason, okay, so that's like a local legend.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.600
 And it kind of is.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.760
 We have no news articles that this event ever took place.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.840
 That's ends up red flag number one.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.240
 But here's some interesting tidbits.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.500
 This story is found on Nebraska's,

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.980
 let me find the actual website.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.980
 This story is found on history.nebraska.gov.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.660
 So it's on their official website.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.460
 Now they do have a section for folklore,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.200
 but there's maybe only four stories

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.800
 on this whole folklore section of this website.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.100
 And they're usually like a mild ghost story.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.960
 So this one sticks out of place as far as that goes.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.960
 Most stories like this have some sort of conclusion.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.520
 Most folklore like this has some sort of conclusion.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.520
 Where when we talked about Bunny Man a couple days ago,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.920
 you had, when we look at the urban legend of it,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.360
 you had the inmates escape from the prison

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.520
 and then one kills the other one

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.800
 and then he hangs himself

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.720
 and now his ghost haunts Honey Man, Bunny Man Bridge,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.560
 Bunny Man Bridge, not Honey Man Bridge,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.020
 which sounds delicious.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.920
 I wouldn't mind dying there.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.280
 You're all like, "Rub, rub, rub."

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.280
 It had a beginning, middle and end.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.120
 This one is basically the end is,

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.640
 this creature's still out there.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.800
 Whatever it was, they were never able to identify it.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.840
 He never turned around and said,

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.800
 "I defied the Christian God and I've been cursed."

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.000
 There's no moral to this story in any way, shape or form.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.960
 It's a series of events that happen,

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.060
 a final confrontation, only final because the guy took off.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.440
 Now there are some urban legends that do end like that,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.800
 but for the most part,

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.480
 they tend to have some sort of satisfying wrap up,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.560
 even if the wrap up is, and now he's a ghost.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.120
 This one is just a guy was eating cows

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.000
 and we shot at him and we chased him

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.400
 and we never saw him again.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.960
 And there's no saying.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.760
 And then on the 18th night of every February,

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.400
 he shows up to eat more cow.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.720
 There's nothing like that.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.860
 If we take into account that this story

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.000
 actually happened in 1895, there's a very, very interesting.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.440
 So let's assume that elements of the story are real

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.240
 or the story itself is real.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.000
 This is something that was very fascinating to me.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.800
 You could have had real cows getting killed in Nebraska.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.640
 From whatever, there was some maniac

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.560
 walking around knives stabbing cows.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.480
 They were a bunch of unexplained cow deaths

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.020
 and someone created the ending of the story

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.480
 to explain for the cows.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.140
 It's possible that the cows actually were dying

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.920
 and there was a human killing them

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.480
 and he was drinking their blood

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.540
 and the story is for the most part true,

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.040
 except for the frenzied vampire attack

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.380
 on Jack Lewis at the ending.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.160
 That might have been made up or could have all been true.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.320
 So we have this attack in 1895 that if somebody

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.680
 was going to make up a story about a vampire attack,

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.480
 you would just pick the things that you know from Dracula

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.140
 because those are the most commonly things

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.360
 known about vampires.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:24.180
 In 1895, the book Dracula didn't exist.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.000
 It wasn't written.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.800
 It came out in 1897.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.800
 So it's not like these attacks were happening

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.280
 and people go, oh, this is just like that book Dracula.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.880
 And they started adding details onto it.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.560
 It's almost like these events happened

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.800
 before anyone had ever heard that name,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.060
 unless you lived in Yugoslavia or Transylvania

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.420
 or something like that.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.000
 Like for an American rancher in 1895

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.840
 to have ever heard about that type of vampire,

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.380
 they may have heard of a Irish vampire coming

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.260
 from their homeland or a German vampire

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.860
 when they came over and stuff like that.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.640
 But this is basically like a vampire boiled down

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.080
 to its roots, a beast creature that drinks blood

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.360
 that hunts at night that is incredibly strong

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.380
 and tries to tear your throat out.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.720
 That's like if you took all the different versions

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.960
 of vampirism or vampires from around the world

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.280
 and boiled them down to their one core identifier,

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.120
 that's it.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.720
 The Irish one, it's like, oh, but then he also

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.520
 likes to do this and the Spanish one's like,

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.140
 well, you gotta like put a rock in his mouth.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.740
 Like every other country has their own little take

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.880
 on the details, but if you boil them all down

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.520
 to their pure essence, that was this attack.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.720
 And that's the book Dracula, but this attack took place

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.920
 before these farmers would have ever read that book.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.920
 So that's another detail that makes it more plausible.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.000
 Was there really a vampire running around Nebraska,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.880
 eating cows?

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.040
 Was there a creature who avoided humans

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.280
 for the longest time?

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.940
 It could have been killing these ranchers the whole time.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.900
 Wasn't killing them.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.100
 It's killing the cattle.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.540
 But one night when it saw a man out there alone,

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.060
 it attacked him and that man survived.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.940
 Now, when I say too, it wasn't killing other ranchers.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.180
 It may have been killing people that weren't from around there,

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.140
 settlers moving through the area and so forth.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.220
 Because someone who goes missing in your area,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.640
 you will know the next day.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.960
 But if someone's traveling from New York to California

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.220
 goes missing, it's a little bit harder to find out

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.180
 where they went wrong.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.260
 Like what happened to them?

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.620
 They don't have cell phones unless they sent to telegram

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.000
 saying I'm in the middle of Nebraska,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.780
 I'm in Dahls County today,

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.260
 and then you don't get a telegram the next day,

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.960
 you're never gonna know where those people disappeared at.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.400
 The frontier of America would have been prime

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.220
 vampire hunting ground.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.320
 You would have people traveling across this giant

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.500
 country in small groups, in pairs,

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.100
 maybe even alone, not in pairs,

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.660
 they're driving around fruit,

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.180
 but in pairs or even alone if they were very,

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.420
 like if they were on the run from the law

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.260
 or something like that.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.560
 These huge stretches of nothing but wilderness,

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.620
 America would have been a prime hunting ground for vampires.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.740
 And you find, it's kind of an interesting way

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.620
 to look at that.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.860
 Because you would have had, let's put on

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.000
 our paranormal caps here for a second.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.720
 You have these old world vampire alcoves throughout Europe.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.400
 You have some in Japan and things like that.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.920
 And as these expeditions are being sent over

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.600
 these explorations and things like that,

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.520
 basically it would be the equivalent of,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.400
 if in your hometown,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.000
 they opened up a brand new fast food restaurant,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.760
 but it was the biggest fast food restaurant ever.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.160
 That's how a vampire would have seen America.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.960
 Because everyone you have families

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.020
 that have lived in Germany for a hundred years,

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.060
 if they go missing, people are going to notice.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.300
 But when you start to have hundreds of thousands of people

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.640
 travel a perilous ocean to get to a wasteland

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.260
 or a wild land is a better term for it.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.460
 And begin settling across it.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:09.240
 People go missing all the time on the boat voyage over.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.840
 When they first reach and the weather gets really bad

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.580
 that year, even another hundred, 200 years,

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.420
 we're in the 1770s, we're in the 1770s,

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.980
 we're in the 1800s, we're in the early 1900s.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.280
 You still have huge stretches of land

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.720
 people are traveling across.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.420
 And you have mixed in with these groups of settlers,

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.820
 just one vampire could be responsible

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.800
 for the disappearance of an entire colony,

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.460
 like Roanoke or something like that.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.040
 America would have been a prime hunting ground

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.440
 for age old vampires.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.140
 Nobody knew who they were.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.500
 Nobody knew their weaknesses.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.480
 And they could hunt without regard to being caught.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.880
 Because if you found a family slaughtered

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.180
 in the middle of nowhere, you would assume Indians,

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.160
 bear attack, bad luck.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.320
 But most likely we just never find the bodies at all.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.520
 And it could be like the Hawaii story,

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.400
 where they could be out in the wilderness,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.160
 hunting the way they've hunted for the past

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.360
 three, 400 years in America.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.200
 And as our cities again are encroaching

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.800
 on the hunting grounds of these creatures

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.880
 that may be killing people one by one,

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.040
 hitchhikers, broken down motorists, things like that.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.920
 As our cities, just like the Hawaii story,

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.080
 as our cities get bigger and encroach on their hunting grounds,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.120
 they've been hunting for three, 400 years in America.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.520
 They don't have a choice,

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.420
 but to start hunting in the cities.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.480
 They aren't already.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.840
 In the early days of America,

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.520
 there was no social safety net.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.680
 If you came here, you had to work as hard as you could,

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.080
 or you failed and died.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.280
 And people from all over the world came over

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.440
 to try their luck at the American dream.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.640
 But more than just people may have come over on those boats.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.200
 Come over to give it their best shot,

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.400
 to try to make a life in America,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.700
 even if that meant killing us in the process.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.580
 (upbeat music)

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.380
