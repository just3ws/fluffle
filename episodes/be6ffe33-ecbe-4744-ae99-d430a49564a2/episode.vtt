00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 A comet from outside our solar system is headed our way, and the signs of the apocalypse have already started.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 And then we travel to South America, to hunt a cryptid who feeds on human fat.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.500
 When the conquistadors came from Spain, did they bring one of their homegrown monsters with them?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.500
 And does that creature still exist today stalking the streets of Peru?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 *I don't wanna sleep down, actually I'm a walkie-talkie*

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500
 Still super sore from my workout yesterday.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.000
 Incredibly sore.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.500
 You know, despite my soreness, I've talked a little bit about this.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 If you're a new listener, I started doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which has made me start listening to New Metal again.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 And here's a question. New Metal? There's a lot of really bad New Metal.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 And you guys are like, "Jason, that's not... there's no question attached to that. That's a simple statement."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Here's my thing.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Have you heard that Limpis... I forgot that this song even existed. There's a song by Limpis, kid.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.500
 It was for the Mission Impossible soundtrack.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 And it has that awesome bass line.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 *singing* It's really cool rhythm and the lyrics are awful.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 He's rapping about... they're playing the Mission Impossible theme song.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 So you figure that the lyrics should be about like, danger and getting away from stuff or going on some sort of adventure.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 And he's talking about how many fans he has.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 It's almost like the band went into the studio and they're like, "Dude, this is gonna be so kickass."

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 And they're recording this song and then Fred Durst shows up and he's just like, "Yo, all my limo ride over a couple girls sat in my lap."

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.500
 The band's like, "What is this rap about missions being impossible?"

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 Here's my question. Have they ever done a remake or a reboot of a song?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 And not like a cover. You have a song with a great beat, awful lyrics.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 Has a music company, has a studio ever said, you know what, the song was a hit, but it could have been even better.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.500
 Let's scrap the original lyrics and put new lyrics on top of it.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 You change nothing about the music behind it.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
 Has that ever happened? Because you do it with movies all the time.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 You go, "Hey, Batman's great. People love the guy in the cape. The cape crusader. He's running around. He's running around."

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.500
 But that last two movies sucked. Let's reboot.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
 We'll just keep key elements of the character.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500
 And we've seen that with like Predator, all sorts of movies.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 Have they ever done that with a song?

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 Same thing with that saliva, there's a band named Saliva.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500
 Same thing with that saliva song, "Click, Click, Boom."

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.500
 Great instrumental, great chorus. The song's about how he doesn't complain about his parents.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500
 "Click, Click, Boom!" And you're like, "What?"

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.500
 The song's about how he used to sit up and listen to his radio while all the other kids were engaging in social activities.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 "Click, Click, Boom!" You think it's an action song. They need to remake those songs.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500
 Do they remake songs? I don't know, that's my question to you.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.500
 Stay something in the comments, like and share, subscribe if you think Jason has officially become an old man wanting new metal remakes.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 Let's actually get started with the episode here, because we surprisingly have a lot of stuff to cover.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.500
 First thing is very, very brief. I saw in the news today.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.500
 There's really no story attached to this yet, but I thought this was interesting.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.500
 December 2019, which is next month, which is well, a couple days ago, I mean away.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500
 The time loop, the time loop has already started.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.500
 Oh, and remember, and I just got a notification on my phone.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.500
 Tomorrow on Thanksgiving, we are doing the Thanksgiving YouTube livestream.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 I don't know what I'm doing yet, so there you go for that preparation.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 I'm doing something, and I think it's going to start. I think I'm going to shoot for 3pm.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.500
 Pacific Standard Time, Dead Rabbit Radio livestream.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 I have a couple ideas. I'm kind of kicking them around in my head, but join us.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.500
 You got nothing better to do on Thanksgiving. Join us for the YouTube livestream.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.500
 Okay, let's get to the story, though. December 2019, there is a comet coming towards our solar system.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.500
 And I'm telling you about this one, because it's interesting.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.500
 It's a comet headed our way, too. It's from outside of our solar system, which is incredibly rare.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.500
 But here's the thing. It was incredibly rare. The first time it ever happened in observable history was in 2017.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.500
 That's when that Omu Mama came through. And some people were like, "Oh, it's an alien probe. It's coming from outside of the solar system."

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.500
 Other people were like, "No, no, it's a big old rock." A lot of times they had drawings of it, and people thought it was the actual photograph,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.500
 and it looked like it was in trotty warship from Robotech. But it just kind of flew through it, and we tried to see if it was an alien probe.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.500
 It was given off any sort of signals. When that happened in 2017, people were like, "Dude, this is the first time something's ever come from outside of our solar system."

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:03.500
 And now we have another object coming just two years later. So it is a little weird. On an astronomical scale, that's a weird coincidence.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:11.500
 But this guy coming is named Tuai Borisov. It's going to pass by us in December of 2019.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:19.500
 And it's going to be two solar units away, or AU, I think is the term, "astronom." I don't know. It's basically the Earth to the Sun.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.500
 It's two of those distances. So it will probably see it. I don't know if we can see it with the naked eye. Probably.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 If you can see Mars with the naked eye, you can at least see a little dot. You'll probably see something.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.500
 Now, people are going to be like, "Oh, it's the end of the world. It's going to fly by in December 2019."

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:42.500
 And 2 plus 0 plus 1 plus 9 is 12, and then 12 plus 12 is 24, and then 2 plus 4 is 6.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.500
 And I forgot to go to the bathroom three times yesterday. Three times 6 is 6, 6, 6 is the sign of the beat.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.500
 We're going to be getting all of this doomsday stuff over the next couple of weeks.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.500
 It's going to be absolutely insane. All the numerology.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.500
 Well, if you take all the letters of Borisov and tournament numbers and add them up, it equals out to the eighth number.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:10.500
 Ugh. All of this stuff. So buckle up because the loonies are coming out for the next month, and then nothing will happen, and they'll come out for some other disaster.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:18.500
 However, I did find one of the signs of the apocalypse actually happening. This comment may actually be the end of the world,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.500
 because tell me if this story doesn't sound completely unnatural.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:29.500
 Let's hop in the Carpentercopter. We're flying to Chatham, Ontario. The city where the ham never stops chatting.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:38.500
 Chat ham. Chat ham. There must have been a guy named like Jerry Chatham, because there's no reason why they would name a city Chatham.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:45.500
 Doesn't make sense. Now this has officially become a Jerry Seinfelds produced podcast.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.500
 What's the deal with Chatham? Hams don't talk.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.500
 Candle laughter. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Whatever that musical key was.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:58.500
 I never watched that show when it was on. I watched it when it was syndicated, but I never watched it when it was new,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:05.500
 because I hated those musical interludes. They were just close enough to jazz for me to hate them.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:12.500
 So I never watched, I think I watched the last episode, the night it aired, but I never watched it while it was brand new,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:20.500
 because it was just enough jazz. I'm going to make a shirt that just says just enough jazz, and it's a picture of me clutching my fists,

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.500
 destroying musical notes in my fists.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:33.500
 Anyways, I got a lot of people who are upset about my jazz rant a couple episodes ago, and "Blay, Blay," I think that's how you pronounce your name,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:43.500
 sent me a list of recommendations for jazz music, and I appreciate it. I'm just not a fan of brass instruments, or jazz in general.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.500
 I'm not a fan of saxophones or trumpets or tubas or any of that stuff.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:57.500
 I think maybe in a past life I died in a foundry, I was killed by the T2, I sacrificed myself, I just don't like metal instruments.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:04.500
 Anyways, maybe a steel drum, maybe a steel drum, but anyways, so I'm crushing musical notes with my t-shirt.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.500
 We're in Chatham, it's November 2019, so it's this month, the apocalypse is an eye.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:15.500
 Someone's driving down the road, it's snowy outside, that's another sign of the apocalypse, it's snowing, because everyone hates snow,

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:23.500
 especially me, no snow zone, and they see a dog kind of like huddled up in the snow, and they're like, "Aww, that's sad, it's a big old puppy,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:30.500
 it's a big old two-year-old puppy," and they're like, "Wait a second, that's kind of weird, why is this dog out here, and like, why, it's sitting weird.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:36.500
 Does it have hymrites?" That should always be your go-to whenever someone isn't sitting properly.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.500
 "Yeah, you got hymrites?" They're like, "No, I just have my wallet in my back pocket." You're like, "Oh, okay."

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.500
 But dogs don't have wallets, nor back pockets, but he is sitting weird, though, so the person glicks a little closer,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.500
 and this big old dog is cuddled over five baby kittens.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.500
 [meowing]

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.500
 And the person's like, "Aww," and calls animal control.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.500
 It's like, "Get down here with your biggest net, and then five little nets." We have a situation.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:10.500
 So animal control shows up, and they're like, "Aww," and the dog at this point is like, "Dude, just please help me, I'm freezing cold,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:17.500
 freezing cold, and the little kittens are meowing." So they scoop them all up with just the one giant net.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.500
 "Woo." No, the dog and the kittens all came peacefully.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:27.500
 Now, they don't know who the dog is, it was a stray dog, and they don't know where the kitten mom is.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.500
 The kittens are taken into animal control, so is the puppy. And it's adorable.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.500
 It is a sign of the apocalypse, cats and dogs living together. The great Peter Vinkman said that,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.500
 but the story does have a sad ending. No, none of them died, it's not that sad.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.500
 But the animal control, the shelter says, "We have to adopt them out to different families."

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.500
 Because people are said, "Well, the dog was taking care of the kittens, are you going to let someone adopt all of them?"

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:58.500
 And they said, "Here's the thing, as adorable as that is, they want to get the animals out of the shelter as quickly as possible."

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:05.500
 So you want to get the dog into what they call the forever home, which actually sounds like where the Demogorgon lives.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.500
 You go to the forever home. It doesn't sound like a good place, but that's the term they use.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.500
 They don't want to have these dogs. You know there's foster care for animals?

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.500
 Where you don't adopt a dog, you just let it chill at your house for a couple of days at your house.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.500
 Your house is how humans are supposed to say, you let the dog chill at your house for a couple of weeks, and then you give it back up.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:31.500
 And you have, so they're saying you can't adopt all of them because the kittens won't be ready to leave the shelter for months and months.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:37.500
 They're that kitten. Actually now that I think about it, what if this story isn't as heartwarming as we thought?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:44.500
 Because where's the mama cat? What if the dog ate the mom and was keeping the kittens warm for future meals?

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.500
 He's like, "Mmm, kitten McNuggets." He's just sitting on them.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:53.500
 But anyways, these cats were so young it's going to take months for them to be able to get their forever homes.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:11:00.500
 And then the dog is going to get it. The dog is now named Serenity and going to be adopted out soon.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.500
 So maybe they'll have a reunion. Maybe someday they'll have a reunion.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.500
 Maybe someday the cats will get older. They'll be out of their own houses.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:14.500
 And then one day they'll remember that bleak night with the dog's serenity savagely eating their mother.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.500
 And then the five of them will have to team up. They'll each learn a different martial art.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.500
 And then the kittens come up and they start beating up this dog.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.500
 And then nobody, they just find a dead dog. What is, how did this get so bleak?

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.500
 Anyways, James Wan, I know you listen to this podcast. It's the reverse of Air Buddies.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:39.500
 Or it's Air Bud colon Snow Buddies underline the revenge.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:44.500
 So Air Buddies is the title of the series. And then the subtitle is Snow Buddies.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:52.500
 And then underneath that you'll put the revenge. And the cover will be a dog sitting there in like the shadows.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.500
 And he's looking over four, five black kittens. Sorry, there's five of them.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500
 There's five black kittens standing there in the shadows as well.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.500
 The whole cover is just a black box. You don't see anything. It's all shadows.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.500
 And then you turn the box over. I'm totally describing.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.500
 They even have back of the boxes now that you have red box.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:15.500
 You turn the back of the box over and it's like a fun family romp says Richard Ebert.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.500
 Richard Ebert. That's like, what is it? Okay, never mind. I've totally gotten lost.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:26.500
 Let's go ahead and just go aw at the sight of five little kittens and a dog.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.500
 As there's plotting their revenge and the dog is like, I hope no one finds out that I hate their mom.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.500
 I hope I get adopted to a good house. A good house with lots of delicious kittens.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:41.500
 We're going to leave Serenity and the kittens behind. And we are going to Peru.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.500
 Let's hop into Dead Rabbit Rowboat. Let's take the Dead Rabbit Rowboat to Peru.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.500
 We haven't used it in a while. So let's start rowing, dude, all the way from Chat Ham.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.500
 We're rowing. I got a bunch of hams with me and I'm like, talk to me. Damn it.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.500
 Talk to me and you're just like, that joke again Jason? Really? You're going to end the story on that joke.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:04.500
 I'm like, yeah, just talk to me. Anyway, so we're rowing off to Peru and a little bit of Bolivia.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.500
 And a little bit of Bolivia. So we're hopping out of the boat. We're walking around Peru.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.500
 And here in these jungles lives the Pish Taco.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:22.500
 The Pish Taco, despite its funny name, is an incredibly deadly cryptid.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:30.500
 And oddly enough, it comes from Spain. You see, after the conquistadors came to South America,

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:36.500
 you had the dudes with the muskets and the armor slowly taking over the continent.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.500
 And you had the friars, you had the priests walking around in their big old robes

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.500
 and their funny looking haircuts, preaching, converting the natives.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.500
 But you also had another more deadly creature.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:14:01.500
 Now to the natives he was seen as a man, a white man, a Spaniard, with a beard,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:12.500
 a kind of a big brimmed hat, a belt made out of something that looks human.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.500
 Now it didn't actually look like a human. It didn't have two arms, two legs, and a little head.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.500
 The material looked like it was made out of flesh.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.500
 And this white man would stalk through the jungles holding a giant knife.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.500
 And he would find you, a young native, running through the jungle.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.500
 You're just doing track. You're not running from anything.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.500
 You're just exercising because you got the big track meat at the Olympics coming up that don't exist.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:41.500
 I'm sure they had some sort of Olympics. I know they were throwing heads and baskets and stuff like that over there.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.500
 But I'm sure they did some sort of sports. We'll just assume they were doing track at this point.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:51.500
 You're running through the jungle, you come out of the jungle checking your pulse,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:57.500
 and then a white man appears with a knife. And you're like, "Oh, this is one of those dreaded conquistadors I've heard about."

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:03.500
 And he goes, "No, I'm not a conquistador. Come here, young native boy."

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.500
 Or, "Girl, I don't know who's listening. I don't know who's listening to this."

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.500
 And you feel mesmerized. You walk over, and before you can even react,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.500
 you're split open with this large knife.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.500
 And you can actually feel.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.500
 And as you fall to the ground on this dirt trail, the middle of the jungle,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:33.500
 the last thing you feel is lips on your stomach wound.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:39.500
 And you can feel him sucking the human fat straight from your body.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.500
 Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! Have everyone enjoy that turkey tomorrow.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.500
 This guy is human as he is. He's classified as a cryptid. It is a monster.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:54.500
 It is a fabled legend dating back to like the earliest record they have of him. It's 1574.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.500
 You had these friars talking to these people, these priests.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.500
 I think it might be the actual technical word, but talking to these natives,

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.500
 and it was only a short time after the Spaniards came over that,

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.500
 which I don't think Spaniard is a racist term.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.500
 I don't think it is in that context. It might be. So I apologize, Spanish people.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:22.500
 But they would say the natives would not come to a house that had Spaniards in it.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.500
 He's going to keep using the word, isn't he?

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.500
 They would not come to a house that had Spaniards in it because they were afraid that

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.500
 they were going to get their fat eaten out of them.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.500
 And it wasn't just the fat being eaten out of them.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:39.500
 The natives of, especially in the Andes region, their great god was known as

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.500
 Viracocha. Viracocha is their creation god. It was the dude who was like,

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.500
 "Here's the sun, here's the moon, here's the earth." It was their great one.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:58.500
 Viracocha means sea of fat. They considered fat, the human fat, to be a sign of good will,

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:04.500
 of good luck, of health. The bigger you were, the better off you were.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:09.500
 And if you were sick, it was because you didn't have enough fat.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.500
 It was kind of their life-giving essence.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:17.500
 So when the Contekisodors were coming over here, they brought a tradition from Europe

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.500
 where you would use human -- this is true. This is historically true.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.500
 You would use human fat to treat wounds.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:31.500
 So the natives were watching these people come, these white men come from another country.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:40.500
 And they'd have a battle, throwing tomahawks and arrows versus muskets and Spanish steels.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:48.500
 And in the aftermath of the battle, they'd be like, "Hey, Sanchez, bring me some of that sweet, sweet native fat.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.500
 I got this cut on my arm. Give me some of that old school neosporin."

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.500
 And they were scooping out fat and rubbing it on their wounds.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:01.500
 And to a group of people who worship -- maybe not worship, but who value human fat --

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.500
 that was absolutely disgusting and blasphemous.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:12.500
 Now, obviously, if you were happening to be in a situation where you saw a guy fall on the ground and scrape his knee,

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.500
 and then another guy fall on the ground and die, and the guy who scraped his knee cut the dude open,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.500
 started rubbing human fat on his knee, you'd be grossed out, too.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.500
 But this also had a whole level of religious significance to it.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.500
 There was -- I don't know if this part was true. That part was true. I don't know if this part was true.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:35.500
 There were rumors -- and it sounds true -- there were rumors that because the metal guns

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:42.500
 and the cannons, the weaponry of the Spanish, was rusting out so quickly in this new environment,

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:50.500
 that they were using -- they were also using human fat to -- not polish, but to lubricate the weapons, especially the cannons.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:56.500
 You needed some stuff in there to keep those balls nice and glistening, so they look shinny as they're coming at you,

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.500
 and also you needed to lubricate them so they don't get stuck in the cannon and kill 30 men.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:06.500
 The natives said that they were killing the people to use your human fats to make their weapons to kill more people.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.500
 You know the reason why church bells ring so beautifully? Human fat.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:19.500
 The natives were like, "We don't know. There's no way that you can make this bell sound so, so sweet."

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:25.500
 So they must be using human fat. We already know that they are using human fat for these other things,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.500
 so we can't trust the religious class either, because see then the story of the Pistach --

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:36.500
 this is really, really interesting. I really like this story -- then the story of the Pistachos started to change.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:43.500
 It was no longer just a white man wearing a white-brimmed hat and wearing kind of like this loose collection of clothing.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:54.500
 Now he was being spotted specifically as a conquistador in the armor or a friar in monk robes.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:01.500
 But this creature is not able to be stopped. We look at a lot of cryptids and they're like, "Throw three pennies on the ground,"

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:07.500
 and the creature will try to bend over to pick up the pennies, and then if it's noon and the sun hits the back of its neck and explodes,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:18.500
 we've seen so many of these cryptids. This one has no weaknesses and exists as far as we know today.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:25.500
 Because now the legends are no longer the Spaniards are coming over here, still using that word, don't know if it's races,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.500
 are coming over here to cut out the human fat to lubricate their weapons.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:37.500
 Mills. You go to the mill, has this sweet machinery that's working like a charm, never breaks down.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:45.500
 Natives believe it's lubricated with human fat. The only reason why jets can fly the way they do, human fat.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:53.500
 Now you go, "Okay, Jason." So a bunch of bumpkins in the middle of the Andes Mountains see a plane fly by and they think that Fat Albert is working for Boeing.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.500
 There is bumpkins living everywhere.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:08.500
 1987. This rumor swept the country. The president, so back in the 80s, they might still be around, but there was a terrorist group.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.500
 As far as I know, they were a terrorist group. I was a kid when this all happened, so I didn't look too much into it.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.500
 But back then, I think they are considered a label terrorist group.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:21.500
 Shining Path was like a group that was trying to overthrow the government of Peru.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:33.500
 And it was a long-running struggle between the legitimate government cut, between the government of Peru and this offshoot, this group, trying to overthrow them.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.500
 The people in the country began talking. A rumor had started.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:43.500
 Peru was in economic troubles and the president needed some money they didn't have.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:52.500
 But he did have an enemy that he wanted to take care of and they had a resource that was worth money.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:22:04.500
 So the rumor spread through the cities that the president had found 5,000 pitch tacos to go into Shining Path territory to slaughter them.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:12.500
 They could eat some of the fat, but the rest of the fat would be shipped back to the president.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:19.500
 He'd get his old scoop. No, they'd be shipped back to the capital and then shipped off to Europe to pay off the debt.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:25.500
 Because see, at this point, now we're in the late 80s, the colonization has been completed.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:34.500
 You have entire swaths of the country that are half Spanish and half native, which is basically the main population.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:41.500
 You still have indigenous people there. You still have full-blooded Spanish people, but the main population is kind of this mixture between the two.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:49.500
 So the idea of a white man walking through your neighborhood in the middle of the night is no longer scary because there's white people everywhere.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.500
 They're no longer an anomaly. And at this point, the legend of the pitch taco actually starts to change.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:03.500
 The pitch taco is no longer a white person. It's a non-local or non-rural person, rural as in farm.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:09.500
 I can't really say that word, but the legend starts-- the creature is still there. I mean, he got 5,000 of them.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:16.500
 I don't think anyone would even think there were 5,000 Bigfoot in America. This is still a real threat.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.500
 This is still a real threat in this country. People believe in this thing.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:26.500
 Now you go, Jason, it just sounds like a serial killer. This doesn't sound like a cryptid in the sense that it has some sort of powers.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:34.500
 The thing with the pitch taco is it's one of those creatures that you either run into and die or you don't run into at all.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:41.500
 It's more a level of a vampire-type character. And the reason why we know about vampires through all the fiction?

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:51.500
 But in a historical vampire, you either died and you never told your story or you survived because you didn't end up running into these ones.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:57.500
 There is a story I came across that the pitch taco would hold its hand up and its fingers would fall off.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.500
 And then it would start wriggling around on the dirt like worms. And it was completely shocking to you.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:08.500
 And while you were taking in the sight of those worms, it would slit your belly open and start eating your fat out.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.500
 Jason, you could have told us that eight minutes ago. I go, "Yeah, yeah, I forgot about that part."

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:20.500
 But anyway, so it definitely does have some sort of cryptid qualities. It's just not a team of serial killers.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:28.500
 Verner Herzog, the film director, the acclaimed film director, and he's also in The Mandalorian.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.500
 I know bounty hunting is a complicated business. That show is so dope.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.500
 Now, I don't want to oversell it. It is like a Western, but I really, really love that show.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:45.500
 He got accused of being a pitch taco when he was filming Fitz Carrero? Fitz Corraldo?

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:51.500
 There's this movie, there's a story about a guy who wanted to move his boat over, I think it was the Andes,

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:56.500
 but he wanted to move a boat from one side of South America to the other, so he took it over the Andes,

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:02.500
 and then took it to the other side. And Verner Herzog wanted to make a movie about that, but he wanted to be realistic.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:09.500
 So he built the same size boat and filmed them actually taking it over the mountain. The dude's a madman.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:15.500
 But they also asked if he had seen The Mandalorian, he's like, "I don't watch Star Wars. I don't watch Star Wars movies."

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.500
 I'll be in the television shows, but I don't watch that. He says, "I watch WWE because I think it's what the people watch,

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:25.500
 but I don't watch Star Wars stuff." So the dude is a madman. The dude is quite awesome.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:31.500
 But anyways, he was also in Jack Reacher. That's the most of the things that I know him from, Mandalorian and Jack Reacher.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:41.500
 He got accused of being a fish taco. 2009. This is going to be a long episode, because I can't really skimp on this part here.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:47.500
 2009, Lima, Peru. Three gang members are arrested.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:54.500
 Now, generally, if I don't know how it is in other countries, in America they do it, in Mexico, South America they do it as well.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:00.500
 I think they do it in Russia too. A lot of times when they do these drug busts, they'll have a table with all the evidence on it.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:06.500
 And sometimes, they do this a lot in South America and Mexico, they'll have the culprits there as well, the accused there as well.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.500
 They don't really do that in America, because they have to have the trial first.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:16.500
 But you'll have in Mexico, you had these three dudes, you had this bunch of police, you had a table,

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:22.500
 and you had two bottles of something called Inca Cola, which is like actually a pretty dope name for a soda,

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.500
 because it's where the Incas actually live. It's so funny that that actually exists.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:32.500
 Sounds like a joke, Inca Cola. What the gods drink. But you have this thing down there called Inca Cola.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.500
 There's two bottles and there's like a yellowish liquid inside these bottles.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:41.500
 And there's a photograph of a human head. They didn't actually bring the human head out.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.500
 And the police said, "Ladies and gentlemen, we've arrested these three men.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:51.500
 They've confessed to over 60 murders." What? The audience is like, "That's kind of weird.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.500
 I thought I was here for that new Inca Cola release. That delicious flavor.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.500
 A salty yellow goodness." And the cops are like, "No, no, no. Don't drink that. Don't drink that.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.500
 It's evidence. And you don't want to drink it, even if it wasn't evidence."

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.500
 They've confessed to over 60 murders. They've led us to the body of one of their most recent victims.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:15.500
 Here's a photograph of his head. We'll notify the family after this press conference.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:20.500
 Everyone's like, "Yeah, yeah." The reason why they've been murdering people, it's people get murdered in Peru.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.500
 It's sad. There's a lot of drug dealing, especially where this happened in this small community.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.500
 But these men were not murdering people over drugs or drug deaths or anything like that.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:34.500
 These people were murdering over this. And the police officer picks up the Inca Cola.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.500
 This, ladies and gentlemen, is a bottle of human fat.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:44.500
 These gang members are Pish Tacos. And everyone's like, "Click, click, click, click, click."

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.500
 Everyone forgot their cameras that day, so they just go, "Click, click, click, click."

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.500
 And move their fingers around. But then eventually someone does get a camera.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.500
 It actually takes photos of what was going on.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.500
 These people were labeled by the local authorities as actual Pish Tacos.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.500
 And apparently this gang, this is what they said.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:10.500
 They were being paid by these two Italian mafiosos, $15,000 per liter of human fat that they could give to the mafia.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.500
 And then the mafia was taking it to Europe where it was being used in cosmetics.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:20.500
 Now, this story, if you think that's weird, it hasn't even started yet.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.500
 Because at this point, everything goes off the rails.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.500
 The media starts looking at it. I mean, imagine this.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:34.500
 Imagine if all of a sudden, the feds, the FBI held a press conference here in America.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:42.500
 And they're like, "Ladies and gentlemen, we have found out that every sighting of Bigfoot was actually a blood gang member."

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:50.500
 People are like, "What? Yes. The bloods have infiltrated the Pacific Northwest, parts of the Southwest United States.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.500
 They are all seven feet tall and have giant feet."

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.500
 People are like, "That's not... Lil Wayne is a blood."

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.500
 And he's not saying, "Well, save your questions till the end."

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:05.500
 By the way, every Chupacabra attack was actually a member of the Latin Kings.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.500
 People are like, "What is going on?"

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:15.500
 It would be the equivalent because you have these guys who are arrested, who have bottles of human fat in front of them.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.500
 And they're basically saying that these guys are a mythological creature.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:26.500
 Now, the DA, or the chief of police came out and said, "We're just calling them Pisztaukos.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:32.500
 We're not saying these are actual creatures of them, but they're definitely engaging in Pisztauko-like behavior."

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.500
 The two Italians apparently left the country. They tried arresting them.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.500
 And there's a man-wide hunt for these two Italians.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.500
 We're going to find these guys.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:46.500
 Now, as the media goes nuts, they start investigating this.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.500
 And what almost seems like a coordinated effort.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.500
 You guys remember Gamergate?

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:58.500
 You guys remember that where it was just like one day, all of a sudden, every headline to the exact same thing.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.500
 And that was like, "Gain culture is dead."

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.500
 Like, "Fandom is dead," or whatever.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:13.500
 So whatever your opinion on Gamergate was, like it was this weird, like, bam, the next day, Kotaku and Giant Bomb and all these websites basically had the same thing,

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.500
 ready to go, the same type of article, ready to go.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.500
 That's what happened here.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.500
 Because all the articles are up.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:25.500
 You had all these articles come out and say, "We talked to someone who worked at a liposuction clinic."

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.500
 And they said, "We have barrels of fat.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.500
 There's no way you would have to pay $15,000 for fat.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.500
 People pay us way less than that just to pull it out.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.500
 We just have it sitting here.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.500
 We got a flush down the drain.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.500
 No one's paying $50,000, $15,000 for fat.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.500
 That doesn't make sense."

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.500
 And all these articles are like, "This story doesn't make sense.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.500
 There has to be something else going on.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.500
 This story does not make sense."

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.500
 Despite the fact that you have these people, you do have a body.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.500
 They found a body.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.500
 You do have the container of human fat.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:01.500
 Now, the newspapers begin investigating this as the story is not real.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.500
 Which is their right, obviously, but it seemed oddly coordinated.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.500
 The first thing they do is they contact the police department,

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.500
 because this is being held somewhere else.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.500
 This guy got arrested.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.500
 These three guys got arrested somewhere else.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.500
 They contact the police department where there's 60 murders supposedly took place.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.500
 And that police department says, "We found out about this on the news.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.500
 We have not heard anything about these 60."

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.500
 And they go, "Yes, there have been a lot of people disappearing in our region,

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.500
 but we're one of the main drug trafficking hubs."

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.500
 They also said that what they're saying, $15,000 for a liter of human fat,

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.500
 that's more than coke.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.500
 That's more than you and me moving an equivalent amount of coke.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.500
 So they said, "We just think it's ridiculous.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.500
 We don't think that's true."

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.500
 They start interviewing this expert.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.500
 This one expert goes, "What are you going to do with human fat?"

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.500
 It starts to go bad within 30 minutes.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.500
 You pull human fat out.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.500
 It starts to go bad after 30 minutes.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.500
 It's completely useless in any sort of medical procedure.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.500
 And the idea of extracting it and selling it for $15,000 to a cosmetic company

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.500
 that's on the other side of the planet,

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.500
 it's going to lose all of its gooey, gooey goodness by the time it gets to Milan.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.500
 It's just not going to work.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.500
 And so this is where the story sits right now.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.500
 This happened in 2009 and it disappeared in a month.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.500
 It was a hoax.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.500
 This is what the media is saying.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.500
 This is a hoax.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.500
 And I read that and I was like, "Oh, okay."

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.500
 And I kind of continued on with my research and I thought,

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.500
 "I went back to this whole thing and I go,

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.500
 and hoax in what way?

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.500
 Were the criminals like just actors?

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.500
 Was this an upright citizens brigade gone wrong?

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.500
 Was this an improv class gone wrong?"

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.500
 No.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:43.500
 So apparently these guys were actually criminals

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.500
 and they did confess and show the location of at least the one body that was all chopped up.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.500
 There's no answer to whether or not the bottle actually contained any human fat.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.500
 Apparently what they would do is they would cut the heads off the people

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.500
 and like eviscerate them, hang them up and,

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.500
 "Happy Thanksgiving, guys!"

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.500
 Hang them up and then put candles underneath it

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.500
 and it would melt the fat into Inca cola bottles,

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.500
 which they must be loving this publicity.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.500
 Inca cola must have been over the moon when all these stories came out.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.500
 It would take these empty Inca cola bottles.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.500
 The human fat would drip out of the body into the bottles.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.500
 It would be a inefficient way to gather human fat, I would imagine,

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.500
 but people said that's stupid, that wouldn't work.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.500
 But here's the thing, those people were actually arrested.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.500
 No one was saying those people were fake.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.500
 No one was saying that the body was fake.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.500
 The only...

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.500
 This story now is known as a hoax,

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.500
 but this is the only reason why they think it's a hoax.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.500
 Three days earlier, there was an investigative journalist came out with an article

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.500
 implicating police in the region where these guys were arrested.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.500
 The crimes were apparently taking place somewhere else,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.500
 in all these little secret shacks around Peru and this other province,

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.500
 but these three guys were arrested in this other area.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.500
 Sorry, I don't have...it was Lima.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.500
 Lima where these three guys were arrested.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:58.500
 They, in this area, the police chief who was in charge of this whole investigation

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.500
 and a couple other people, this investigative journalist wrote an article

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:08.500
 saying that the police chief helped cover up 46 murders by the police department.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.500
 So the police department was doing extrajudicial killings,

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.500
 basically punisher style vigilante stuff, at best,

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.500
 at worst, they're killing drug dealers and taking their money.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.500
 But generally extrajudicial means,

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.500
 "I can't prove in the court that you're a bad guy."

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.500
 Well, I don't have to prove it anymore.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.500
 So, this article comes out three days before,

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:35.500
 and then, all of a sudden, the police chief is walking around with a yellow bottle of Inca Cola,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.500
 puts it on the table and goes, "Any questions?"

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.500
 And everyone's like, "Oh my God, this is the biggest news story.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.500
 Mythical creatures."

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.500
 And if these guys aren't actual mythical creatures, they're doing stuff mythical creatures do.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.500
 That's it!

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.500
 It's known as a hoax simply because of the timing of it.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.500
 The police chief was removed from office.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:56.500
 His superior goes, "Can you prove to me any of this is real?"

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.500
 And apparently the police chief goes,

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.500
 "Other than the bottle of fat, the three suspects, and the location of this chopped up body,

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.500
 other than the fact that they're saying they did this,

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.500
 I can't prove any of it."

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.500
 And the guy goes, "Get out. You're fired."

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.500
 I technically fired him, removed him from office.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.500
 He may be back now, because this will happen back in 2009,

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.500
 but I couldn't find any proof of him coming back.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:23.500
 And Interpol said, "International manhunt, we know nothing about these two Italians."

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.500
 So when the police chief goes, "Oh, we're all looking for them,"

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.500
 Interpol said, "This isn't true.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.500
 As far as we know, this is the first we've heard about this story."

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.500
 So it's such a bizarre...

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.500
 A reporter says that these guys are killing people on the slide.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:46.500
 Three days later, a gang is showing to possibly admitting to committing crimes

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.500
 that are on the level of a mythological creature.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.500
 Sixty murders to sell a human fat.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.500
 The media immediately goes into, I don't believe that mode,

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:01.500
 which again is a fair mode to be in, because we're talking about a ridiculous situation.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.500
 But within days, the whole story comes, it's a hoax.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.500
 The only reason this is out here is to cover up this story that happened three days before.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.500
 But they can't prove it's a hoax.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.500
 It's a very, very interesting thing.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.500
 They can't prove it's a hoax, just the timing is suspicious.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.500
 But for a creature that stalks the jungle,

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.500
 that changes shape according to the times that it's living in,

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:35.500
 that can be a lone straggler walking through a darkened street looking for a sweet meal,

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:42.500
 or a population of over 5,000, integrated into society.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:49.500
 The best thing they could hope for is that their existence is considered a hoax.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.500
 Because then, only the bumpkins believe in them.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:37:00.500
 Only the people out in the fields believe that these creatures exist.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:09.500
 And when you hunt humans, your best weapon is their ignorance of your existence.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:16.500
 A deer that is shot is a deer that does not know what a gun looks like.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:27.500
 And a human who is devoured by a pitch taco is a human who believes that they don't exist in the first place.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.500
