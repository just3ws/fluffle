00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 A bizarre conspiracy in one of my favorites personally involving the

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.820
 Star Wars trilogy. Are there really two Luke Skywalker's? And then the question

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.780
 about UFOs, what are they, where do they come from? Has puzzled people for decades.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 However, a recently declassified document from Britain may have all the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 answers we need today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:12.220
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.380
 host Jason Carvin or I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.820
 too. Let's talk about two Luke's. I love this conspiracy theory. I heard about

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.020
 this conspiracy theory a long time ago and you know it just kind of gets lost

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.220
 in the maze of my mind to hear about it. I thought it was hilarious. And then

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.700
 recently I got a notification and email on Twitter from @druthersca and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.620
 Druthers goes, thank you for the recommendation, Druthers go, have you

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:49.900
 ever heard of Bigger Luke? And I was like yes, yes I have. A long time ago he was a

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.980
 good friend. Let's explore the world of Bigger Luke. Let's hop on, but you don't

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.900
 have a space vehicle. Let me think here for a second. I'd say Jason

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.820
 Jumper, like jumps in a light speed or a ride to space. That actually sounds like

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.180
 a baby would be in it. Tell you what, you guys come up with a space vehicle for us.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.900
 Whoever has the best suggestion, I'll talk about it. I'll announce it. It'll be

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.020
 totally awesome. But for now, we're going to break into a US facility.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.660
 We're gonna steal their space shuttle. Come on, go, go. I'll cover you. I'm

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.860
 shooting blinks because they are US servicemen. They're like ow, ow. I won't

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.780
 kill you, but I will stop you. And then I accidentally hit one in the head and he's not

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.140
 moving. He's all bloody. You're like Jason, you killed him. I'm like no I didn't, no I

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.580
 didn't. We go, we get in space shuttle fly away. Oh great, great start to an episode.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.500
 You guys are like, getting ready to hold trial for trees? And I'm like no.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.420
 Before we have my trial, we have to go to Tatooine. Space shuttle goes,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.140
 hyperspace, and we're now in a galaxy far far away. I wonder what the official name

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.740
 of the Star Wars galaxy is. I'm sure some nerd knows it is. It's Titanine or

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.020
 something. There has to be a name for it, like Clydo's or something. But anyways,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.900
 it doesn't matter. Nerds, email me on that too, the name of the Star Wars galaxy.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.340
 We're now flying over Tatooine. So we're on Tatooine and we're checking out the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.700
 scene. Now this theory came about because you know there was a time when you

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.220
 would go see a movie, the movie theater, and go whoa that was awesome. And then you

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.340
 might buy a ticket to go see it again, but once it was out of the theater, you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.140
 never saw it again. The movie was gone. But when VCRs came out and then Star Wars

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.540
 was released on VHS in 82, you have the ability to watch the movie over and over

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.900
 and over again. And some people, Chalker, sit down for this news, were obsessed

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.660
 with the movie. I know, I didn't know that until I started researching this

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.420
 story. And so people began watching these movies over and over again, and they're

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.220
 looking for every detail. It's funny, I was thinking about doing this. I saw a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.100
 movie the other night called Identity Theft of a Cheerleader. And it was

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.220
 actually, it was compelling enough that I told my little brother about it. You

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.140
 could tell that everyone, it was for a lifetime channel, movie of the week,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.780
 everyone in the movie, behind the scenes and in front of the camera, gave 110%

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.780
 but it just had a terrible, it had a really low budget and it had that

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.060
 really flat lighting that all like lifetime channel movies have. But I, I,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.460
 it was very, it was funny because it was a really, really good movie. It was like

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.860
 watching a marathon runner run with 80 pounds strapped to his back. Because you

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.420
 could tell everyone was really, really trying but it was just hobbled by the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.620
 format. And I was thinking, I think I might watch that movie just as a thought

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.740
 experiment, watch it 30 nights in a row and see what I pick up on it. Because

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.140
 it's interesting enough and the lead actress, she, it's this 30-year-old woman

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.860
 who pretends to be a cheerleader. And I think I did a story on that actually.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.220
 That's how I found out about this movie. I did a story about that and this movie

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.540
 is based on a true story, but in this movie she's like hitting, she's killing

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.180
 people with a frying pan as well. But he had a really hot actress and everything

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.180
 like that. If I watch this movie for 30 days in a row, I think I would have a

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.860
 bigger cheerleader. Well, I definitely would have some bigger cheerleader

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.420
 interesting dreams, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Okay, let's get back to

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.180
 the topic. People were watching the movie over and over and over again and they

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.740
 started to notice something. In some scenes, Luke is a couple inches taller than

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:31.780
 he is in other scenes. Not extremely giant, but just oddly tall. And they begin to

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.460
 talk to each other and they go, "We know how tall Harrison Ford is normally." And

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.380
 then there are some scenes where Luke is standing next to Harrison Ford. He's

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.060
 always shorter than Harrison Ford, but sometimes he's a little more shorter than

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.460
 he is in other scenes. Now, you figure, maybe he's standing on something different,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.500
 maybe he's leaning in a different way, but they're able to, this group of people,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.420
 and again, back then you'd have to like write letters to each other. There was no

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.980
 internet. You'd meet people that you knew in the area or you would start writing

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.580
 each other because you're part of some sci-fi club through correspondence. People

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.940
 started to say, "Hey, listen, Luke changes sizes. Not every other scene, but it's

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.140
 consistent enough that I think there's two Luke's." Now, some people, and this is

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:24.660
 where people broke into two different camps. Some people say what it is that,

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.060
 yes, there are, he is at different sizes, but sometimes it's a stand-in actor. It's

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.860
 a different actor coming in. And the other group says, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:41.820
 We believe there's actually two Luke skywalkers. There is a short Luke and a

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.900
 tall Luke." And there, sometimes the short Luke will walk around a corner and

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.060
 then the big Luke comes back. So there's actually two Luke skywalkers in the

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.780
 Skywalker movie. And you're thinking, "Jason, that's stupid, but, but, but, but, but,

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.260
 but, but, hold on, hold on, hold on." So Luke is on the Millennium Falcon and he's

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.060
 holding a lightsaber. There's a little droid flying, I know some of you guys know

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.740
 exactly where this is going, this little droid's flying around. Shoot lasers, he's blocking them.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.900
 And that's his first time really using the force, because he's

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.700
 blindfolded and he puts the lightsaber away. And Obi-Wan turns to him and says,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:33.980
 "You've taken your first step into a larger world." Hmm? Hmm? He says that. "When Luke

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.580
 Skywalker first meets Princess Leia, him and Han Solo are addressed up as

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.580
 stormtroopers." And you guys all know this line, she's laying there in that sexy

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.660
 Princess Leia pose. Dwarf comes up, we see two stormtroopers standing there and

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:53.060
 Leia says, "Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?" You're like, "Jason, come on,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.580
 seriously." Okay, here's the thing, here's the thing. The bigger Luke

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:05.260
 theory, I love so much. And to be honest, I don't know if it, they say that it

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.660
 started in 1985, I think it's a lark, I think, which is a live-action role-playing

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.820
 thing. I think it's, I don't know if it really started back in 1985. It could be

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.100
 a parody of conspiracy theories and people who are obsessed with film, because

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.820
 we obviously can't go back and prove that. And people have talked about maybe

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.580
 this was spread on like AOL chat rooms and Yahoo chat rooms back in the day and

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.940
 all the evidence has been destroyed. And that's when you're getting into weirdo

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.420
 conspiracy beliefs. I mean, this is, this is weird enough, but whenever you say, "Oh

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.620
 no, it's totally true, but all the documentation up until this very moment

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:45.420
 was destroyed," you're really kind of losing me there. But that's not all, that's

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.340
 not all, okay? So apparently, I love this so much, because you're never gonna be

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.180
 able to watch this scene again the same way. There's a scene on Impressions

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.780
 Strike's back where Lando, who is considered like he's a professional

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.380
 gambler, so he has an eye for things, right? He can really see the details, he

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.500
 can look for the little things, tell someone's bluffing. He's walking by and

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:12.220
 he sees Luke come around the corner and start shooting. And Lando doesn't

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.740
 really even react to this, because he knows everything's going to hell. He

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.980
 tried, Darth Vader's not holding up his side of the bargain, Luke's coming here to

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.940
 rescue his friends, he just kind of looks at Luke, doesn't really react. But the

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.660
 next time we see Lando look at Luke, Luke's still running around shooting

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:34.140
 people, Lando has this expression, he looks over at Luke and then he kind of

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.540
 goes, "Hmm?" Now even though Luke is doing the exact same thing he was doing just a

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.860
 minute ago, i.e. shooting stormtroopers, the second time he sees him, his expression

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.940
 on his face is like, "Hmm, something's different about him." And then he just walks away.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:53.780
 So bigger Luke theorists believe that that's what he's responding to. He

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.660
 realizes this guy's a few inches tall and he's like, "Hmm, interesting." So here we

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:04.380
 go. Why are there two Luke's? Why are there two Luke's? So, of course you

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.660
 have to have theories. One of them is that Luke is creating a force projection.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.900
 Now this theory does predate the last Jedi. I don't know if it goes all the way

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.020
 back to 1985, but it definitely predates the last Jedi, because I remember reading

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.740
 about it years ago. So it's at least, it's at least 10 years old, if not more.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.820
 And anyways, the idea is that Luke Skywalker, when Princess Leia says,

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.740
 "Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper that heard his feelings?" So he

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.900
 created a holographic version of himself that's bigger, to be in additional

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:39.820
 scenes. That is an okay conspiracy theory, but I love this one even more. So R2D2

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.420
 learned how to clone throughout the prequels, because he's hanging out on

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.340
 Kamino, he's going on all these adventures, especially on the Clone Wars.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.460
 He's going on seven seasons of adventures. He learns how to clone. And he's the only

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.340
 guy who remembers really everything from the beginning to the events of Star Wars.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:02.860
 So he has a cloning facility on Tatooine, and that's why when the ship crashes, or

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.940
 when the escape pod crashes, R2D2 goes in one direction, C3PO goes in the

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.260
 other direction, R2D2 is like, "No, I got to go this way. I'm headed to my cloning

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:15.900
 center." And at that cloning center, he has cloned Bigger Luke. What Bigger Luke

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.580
 is, it's if things get really rough. Bigger Luke can show up and kind of fight

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:26.380
 more, and that way if Luke dies, then the clone will just take over. And so

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.060
 whenever one of the Luke's is getting in too much trouble, they're instantly

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:35.700
 teleported back to the cloning facility, and then the it's instantaneous too. So

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.300
 you'll never know. No one will ever turn around the corner and see it happening.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.820
 Bigger Luke appears, and you go, "That's stupid, Jason." They don't have teleportation

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:49.500
 in Star Wars. They don't ever do... up, up. In A New Hope, Luke, they're talking about

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.700
 getting off the planet tattooing. Luke says, "Not unless you can alter time, speed

00:11:53.700 --> 00:12:00.140
 up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock." So teleportation does exist in the

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:05.780
 Star Wars universe. RTD2 has the key to it. And you go, "Jason, that is genius." Now I

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.180
 didn't come up with that, but that is genius. RTD2 is the key to all of this

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.220
 stuff, but it's just people are grabbing a couple lines or thinking this stuff

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.940
 about R2 and all this stuff. Last Jedi promo shot. There's a picture of Luke's

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:23.820
 Skywalker standing next to RTD2. Mark Hamill himself tweets this. There's a

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.980
 picture of him back in 1977 standing next to RTD2. RTD2 comes up to his belly

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.260
 butt. Then the picture of him for the last Jedi promo shot. RTD2 only comes up to

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:41.700
 his waist. And he tweets, "Have I been growing taller over the years, or has

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:52.980
 RTD2 just been shrinking?" You decide. #largerluketheory. Is there really two

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.900
 Luke's? Did he actually acknowledge the existence of two Luke Skywalker? He also

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:09.580
 said that he hated Ryan Johnson's take on Luke Skywalker in the last Jedi. And so he

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.180
 just called him Jake Skywalker. He played him as a totally different character.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.740
 So now there's even a theory that after the Battle of Indoor, Luke went

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:26.700
 somewhere and his clone became Jake Skywalker. So is there any truth to the

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.900
 fact that there were two Luke Skywalker? So you may have hated the sequel

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:38.260
 trilogy, but no. That's somewhere out there. The smaller Luke, the Luke that we

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.500
 really know and love, is out in the galaxy. The man who died on the rock

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.180
 because he made his hologram appear in front of his nephew or whatever, who fell

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:53.140
 off the rock and disappeared. He's dead. That was Jake Skywalker. Luke Skywalker.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:59.140
 The real Skywalker is still out there walking through the sky. I love that

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.340
 conspiracy theory though, but that took an awful lot of time. So let's return to

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:08.020
 Earth. We're leaving by Tatooine. We see Luke Skywalker. We're like, "Bye Luke!" And

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.820
 he's waving to us. And then we see another Luke in the shadows waving at us.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:17.620
 We're like, "Oh, there is some truth to it." We're back on Earth now. We just land

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.300
 in a space shuttle in a parking lot. We're in Britain. We're headed to Britain.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.180
 This was a really interesting story that I kind of just dumbled across. And it was

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.940
 on an article from the Washington Examiner. It was called, "The real reason the U.S.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:34.140
 government is so secretive about UFOs." And it basically boiled down to this. We

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:40.340
 don't know what they are, so we're trying to figure that out. And we don't want to

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:45.540
 reveal what we already know to the public, because whatever this is could be

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:51.940
 weaponized. So we know a little bit more than the public does about this stuff. So

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.500
 if we release what we know, then China and Russia are like, "Oh, we didn't have

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.060
 those additional pieces of the puzzle." So they're holding on to their pieces of

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.620
 the puzzle, and we're holding on to our pieces of the puzzle, and nobody wants to

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.660
 share. And I'm reading this article, I go, "That makes sense. That makes sense." I

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:11.100
 think, and let me start off by saying this, at this point we kind of have to

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:16.420
 start really making some determinations over what UFOs really are. And from the

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:24.340
 1950s to the 1980s, maybe 90s, like you could say it's space aliens. Like these

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.220
 are crafts from another planet. They're carrying these space aliens and stuff like

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:35.580
 that. But after 50, 60 years, and we don't have any definitive proof, it's really

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:41.620
 moving into Bigfoot territory. Where really, like, we'll find like a footprint,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.300
 like here's melted glass, where I saw a spaceship. And that's an

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.220
 interesting, actually, example. That's the same thing as a Bigfoot footprint at

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.420
 this point. Now, UFOs have the added storytelling advantage. I'm not using

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.300
 storytelling facetiously, but it's a storytelling advantage of you have

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.300
 people interacting with the occupants of the UFOs. But those are very rare. When

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:09.380
 we look at UFO stories overall, I avoid those at this point, because they're so

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.700
 commonplace. As far as like, the average, like, looking up in the sky and seeing the

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.820
 bright lights and seeing the giant object in the sky, is the equivalent of, I saw,

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.580
 I was walking down a hallway and I saw a shadow at the end of the hallway. It's

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.460
 creepy and it's interesting, but it's either there's more interesting stuff,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.500
 especially to talk about on a podcast. That would get super old if I just kept

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.420
 telling you about lights in the sky. But at a certain point, from 1945 till now, we

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.940
 have no definitive proof whatsoever about what UFOs are, any more than we have

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.420
 definitive proof about Bigfoot or even ghosts. I think ghosts are more of a

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.220
 personal paranormal thing, and I think those are far easier to, I don't want to

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.940
 say dispute, but to explain. Even all the ghost stories and demonic stories that

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.780
 I've told, I think probably have a rational explanation that I haven't

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.980
 figured out yet. Now, going back to the story, I find this story absolutely

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.420
 fascinating. I'm reading this Washington Examiner article, I'm like, "Ah, it's

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.180
 fairly interesting, but is it worth really talking about on the show?" Then they

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.220
 have a link to a document, a document created by the British government. Oh,

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.740
 and I want to give a shout out to the author of the article, Tom Rogan, because

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.940
 it really set me on the path and gave me a framework for doing this story. I don't

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.540
 want to plagiarize, but I'm going to be quoting quite a lot of stuff and sources

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.260
 and stuff on this. The military, you know, we did an episode on this a while back

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:36.660
 where Trump was like, "I don't believe in aliens." That was a huge moment for

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.860
 the UFO community. It really was, and I know people kind of brushed it off, but

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.580
 that was to have the president of the United States actively go, "Yeah, they've

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.340
 talked to me about it, but I really don't believe in it." That was massive. That would

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.620
 be the equivalent of the Pope going, "Yeah, I think I don't believe in ghosts.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.260
 Like, yeah, angels and demons, but I think when you die, you're in heaven and

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.740
 hell. Ghosts don't exist." It would be, especially like Catholics who are

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.580
 into the paranormal would be like, "Oh, that sucks. I kind of have to listen to

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:12.220
 this dude." Trump's not the Pope of UFOs, but you know what I mean? Because

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.300
 that's always been the conspiracy theory. Oh, you know, the president goes and he

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.940
 knows he's met with aliens shaking Grey's hands and stuff like that. Trump's like,

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.820
 "No, it didn't happen." Now you could say Trump was lying. He was covering it up, but

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.940
 I mean, like, at a certain, we have to make certain allowances for this stuff. So

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.980
 for Trump to even, I think, I don't want to get too much into that side, but there

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.020
 was a big moment and a lot of people just kind of buried it, but he's like, "Yeah,

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.860
 I don't believe it." So the military, for the most part, just thinks it's something

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.620
 weird that's going on out there. They don't actually think that it's alien.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:49.460
 Alien craft. It's something. So all of that being said, Britain did this big

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.980
 st- every country's done a study on this. India's had to look into it. Iran

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.740
 definitely had to look into it. We did an episode about their nuclear power

00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.580
 plants and UFOs flying around. So any country that has any sort of budget

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.780
 whatsoever is going to look into this stuff. Now, Britain looks into this and

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.180
 they wrote up a report and they classified it, as you would with this type of

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.860
 thing, but eventually the report gets declassified and it is fascinating. The

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.980
 link is in the show notes. It's actually quite a short report. It's called the

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.380
 Unidentified Aerial- that's generally how the United States and

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.460
 Britain will call them. They don't call them UFOs. They call them Unidentified Aerial

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.180
 Phenomenon, which is quite different. Quite different. It sounds like the same

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.020
 terminology, but what we're going to get into, there's a difference between an

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.380
 object and phenomenon. The kite is an object. A phenomenon is some sort of

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.340
 weather event. So I'm going to read some quotes from this investigation from this

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.260
 paper because it's really fascinating the way they're looking at this stuff.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.780
 Here's the first quote talking about foreign governments, Russia and China

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:54.500
 specifically. "Russia, former Soviet republics and Chinese authorities have

00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:01.020
 made a coordinated effort to understand the UAP topic. Several aircraft have

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:06.540
 been destroyed and at least four pilots have been killed chasing UFOs. The

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.300
 importance of the topic has resulted in appointment of astronauts and senior

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.460
 pilots as well as senior scientists to carry out investigations. Russian

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:20.540
 investigators have measured or at least detected fields, which are reported to

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.500
 have caused human effects when they are located close to the phenomenon." The

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.060
 first part is interesting because we have this confirmation that and I don't

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.380
 think it surprises anyone that occasionally a pilot dies chasing these

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:38.340
 unidentified objects, whether it is collisions or they're simply pushing

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.380
 their engine to hard or whatever, but they're saying that because people have

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.740
 died and because jets have been destroyed that other countries take this as

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.780
 seriously as the West does. Now the second part is over there we're talking about

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:57.180
 Russia has detected these fields around this phenomenon. So as they're flying up

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:02.500
 on this object they're able to measure something. Something's coming off of

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:08.020
 these things. Now what is this something? This paper actually thinks that it has the

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.660
 answer for what UFOs are, what the objects in the sky, the bright lights are, but

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.460
 we're gonna get there in a second. So what they're looking at is where do we

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:21.820
 tend to see UFOs? Where do you tend to see UFOs? What they're picking up on is

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:27.140
 they go military bases, nuclear power plants, and you're like oh that's

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.540
 interesting like is it because they're monitoring our bases or something like that?

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.340
 They go, "Hey let us finish, let us finish dude." Nuclear powered aircraft carriers,

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:41.300
 battle fleets out in the ocean, still military. Cars in the middle of nowhere

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:47.980
 planes 20,000 feet or higher in the air. So how do you get the car in the middle

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.380
 of nowhere versus the nuclear powered aircraft carrier in the middle of the

00:21:52.380 --> 00:22:00.900
 ocean? Britain thinks that the phenomenon is some sort of plasma charge that is

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:08.500
 created in the atmosphere around isolated electronic events. Basically that's why

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.740
 we see them in the areas we see them, the lone car driving in the middle. That's

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.540
 why you don't see for the most part UFOs in downtown Chicago, but when you have a

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.380
 car driving through the middle of Kentucky at night, the glowing object

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.540
 following the car or appearing off in the distance whether it's small or big, it's

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:33.900
 some sort of plasma charge. It's not from another dimension, it's not a spacecraft,

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.820
 there's no one on it, it's simply there. They said the black triangle which is

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.100
 very common, it has the lights on the end, it's like a triangle, there's a light on

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:49.380
 each corner of the triangle, they say that is a very common, the plasma charge

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.300
 can actually block out light in the middle and make lights appear around it.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.900
 So it looks like a massive object, but what you're really seeing is basically

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:04.980
 three plasma balls that are distorting everything else around it. Can these

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.820
 things be interacted with? They said when we're looking at it during their

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:14.940
 investigation they said they found 100 unexplained Royal Air which is the

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.340
 British Air Force's Royal Air Force, 100 unexplained Royal Air Force fatal

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.340
 accident reports, 100 planes that crashed, not passenger jets but like fighter

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.620
 jets and transport planes and stuff like that, that crashed and they have no no

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:34.500
 known reason why. They said these accidents don't seem like they hit

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.100
 something physical, maybe maybe they hit a bird and we detected maybe with

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:43.380
 something so small we didn't detect it, but they go it could have been flying and

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:49.540
 it hit plasma, it hit this electrical charge in the middle of the sky and the

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.860
 plane goes down and no one can radio for it, no can report it, the plane crashes

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.900
 completely unexplained. Now those hundred accidents were over the course of

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.860
 decades, so it wasn't like within the course of a year or anything like that,

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.820
 but just looking back, they had all these unexplained accidents, a hundred of

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.580
 them, and they go maybe it's this phenomenon and that would explain too

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.780
 why fighter jets in other countries have been knocked out of the sky by these

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.660
 things as well. It'd also be why you can't catch up to them because it's a

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:25.680
 electrical phenomenon and you're creating it. The UFO doesn't exist unless the

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.060
 plane is in the sky or the aircraft carrier is on the ground and going to

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:35.380
 the whole thing about the tic-tac UFO flying around that Nimitz battle fleet

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.620
 back in I think it was 2016, may have been even farther back, that's just when the

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.900
 story came out. Imagine the pure electrical field around that battle

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:51.340
 group, that group had the greatest sensor net ever to exist on the planet, that was

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:56.140
 the entire point of that exercise was to test out how that fleet worked together

00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.740
 and we have never, never in the history of the planet Earth have there been that

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:07.140
 many tools and high-tech things to observe. He created a perfect bubble around

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.060
 the fleet, they knew everything that was going on, so that's why the theory was

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:16.060
 that the tic-tac was either a black ops from the United States or from another

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.620
 government, they wanted to see if the object they built could beat the greatest

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:29.860
 eye ever invented by the human race or all of that electricity created this

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:36.300
 phenomenon. So Russia says that they can measure some sort of field around

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.940
 these plasma objects right and let me go a little bit more into the plasma thing

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.140
 here too to give you a little more idea of this isn't just some magical new

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.740
 electricity they've made up, let me read you this quote. The researchers note that

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.380
 plasmas may be formed by more than one set of weather and electrically charged

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.900
 conditions and then it goes on to say it could also be a meteor that's coming into

00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.140
 the atmosphere and doesn't burn up completely but basically shoots off

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.140
 this electrical burst and then it continues here. These plasma formations

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.380
 are also theorized to have the effect of refracting light between themselves

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.660
 producing the appearance of black polygonal shape with the lights of the

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:18.740
 corners caused by self-generated plasma coloration. So that's going back to the

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.900
 black triangle thing. So there has been old studies as well where the government

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:28.260
 was trying to line up, they're basically trying to create giant holograms on the

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.380
 sky using plasma it's goes back to the whole project blue beam thing which we

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:38.060
 did an episode on and they wanted a way to add voices to it so you can make a

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.260
 religious figure appear over a battlefield tell people no no don't do

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.740
 that don't do that very least freak them out and the most you might end the battle

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.540
 or end the war. So we've been working with plasma I'm sure other governments have

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:56.780
 as well to direct it as a hologram in the sky and what the British paper is

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.660
 saying is that nature is already doing that for us it's just random and this is

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.180
 where I was going before I interrupted myself with the Russian effect the

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.460
 Russian was detecting the field around these plasma charges here's a

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.100
 continuing of this quote and this is fascinating they've been able to study

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:18.180
 this on the ground quote local fields of this type and this is a plasma field and

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:22.060
 they said they don't know if it's electric electromagnetic field they said

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.140
 we could be some sort of other unknown type of energy that this is good that

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.100
 these plasma charges give off but what we've been able to conclude on earth

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.380
 experimenting with plasma back to the quote here local fields of this type

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:39.740
 have been medically proven to cause responses in the temporal lobes of the

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:45.740
 human brain these results in the observer sustaining his or her own vivid

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:50.780
 but mainly incorrect description of what is experienced this is suggested to be a

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.900
 key factor in influencing the more extreme reports found in the media and

00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:04.980
 are clearly believed by the quote-unquote victims what if this is true this

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:10.660
 could be the biggest discovery when was this article written so the article Tom

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.780
 Rogan wrote just came out in December 2019 but the paper that he's talking

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:24.860
 about came out in 2006 this is possibly the end of all UFO ology and possibly

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:32.580
 even paranormal activity a plasma field is generated and it messes with your

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:39.860
 head and gives you false memories it would be the greatest weapon of war

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:46.580
 you don't bleed no bones are breaking no one dies but you can change their mind

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.980
 they actually believe stuff that didn't happen kids playing soccer and Russia

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:58.020
 see a bunch of robots land in the middle of the park hallucination Betty and

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.820
 Barney Hill driving down the road and a bright light appears above them and they

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:09.020
 have this wild tale to tell about being up on a spaceship hallucination a group

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.700
 of paranormal investigators walking in with their electrical equipment or

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:19.380
 maybe just some flashlights in an abandoned insane asylum and it's

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:27.060
 electrically charged and plasma is formed and hallucination set it now to be

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:32.620
 fair generally plasma charges don't form that low to the ground so would it be

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.580
 like you're on the second floor of an insane asylum and on the third floor

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:42.540
 there's a glowing ball but I mean if there is a phenomenon that is created by

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:47.820
 man because they're using electricity they're you they're unleashing this

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:53.180
 force of nature they're basically they're the humanity using technology is the

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:59.900
 flint to ignite something that's already possibly there it explains so much why

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.460
 the UFO phenomenon really took off after we started dropping nukes it wasn't

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.460
 because aliens saw the nukes and wanted to come down and help us out or they were

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:12.140
 worried about us it's that the sky is more charged now than it ever was all

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:17.860
 that carbon dating stuff doesn't work after 1945 because everything's

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.980
 irradiated if you want to have metal to build Geiger counters like you have to

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:27.420
 dig up boats from World War one when Germany scuttled their navy because

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:32.580
 everything else is completely irradiated everything's charged makes so much sense

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:38.420
 and makes sense why people see UFOs in the middle of nowhere it's because

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.740
 there there's nothing there and they're charging the area not with any sort of

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.380
 spiritual energy but with actual energy and it's interacting it's an

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.780
 atmospheric phenomenon that's messing with people's head this is a game changer

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:57.140
 if this is true this is a game changer because it not only explains not only

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.600
 explains UFOs explains everything explains ghosts and Bigfoot and

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.420
 cryptids and all of that stuff does Bigfoot rustle around in the woods

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.940
 unless there's a human there to observe it now you could go back let's play

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.580
 devil's advocate the natives who were here and native and you can go back

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.900
 and there's cryptid stories way way back you know hundreds of years and stuff

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.980
 like that the natives here who had stories of the yet seen Bigfoot and

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:25.260
 things like that they weren't carrying around Walkmans they didn't have palm

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:32.560
 pilots on them so yes that's true but also when you look back at native

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.200
 populations they weren't talking a lot about UFOs oh you can show me some

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.720
 Egyptian hieroglyphic with the helicopter on it that all that stuff has been

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.720
 debunked I know ancient aliens is a big show but I think on my fifth episode I

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.520
 had a link to a documentary called ancient aliens debunked it's like six

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:55.580
 hours long I recommend all of you guys to watch it it really really just takes

00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:00.340
 the wind out of all of those theories the Nazca lines explains super in detail

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:06.380
 explains all of that stuff the UFO phenomenon I recently did an episode on

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.300
 airships but again that was kind of like a lot of people think that was yellow

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.180
 journalism a lot of people think that was newspapers just making up stories

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:22.480
 because that's what they did back then that's what they do now so does this end

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:31.640
 is this the answer to all paranormal questions I don't know I don't know it

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:37.020
 may be they may be onto something they may be wrong this might be able to

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:41.480
 explain some UFO encounters and not all of them it may be able to explain

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.700
 everything we don't know but the idea of false memories being put in your head

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:51.300
 is always a scary one the one thing we can cling on to is the reality we've

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:57.780
 constructed and so if it can be intruded upon by a natural phenomenon at any

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:04.640
 point in time what can you believe maybe it's not the truth is out there when

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:16.480
 we're looking for aliens maybe the truth is in here in us our own brains the

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:24.080
 truth is realizing that this is all a plasma charge dilution you are the only

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:33.080
 person who's really there this voice this podcast it's just an echo that you've

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:40.880
 created in your own mind and and if that is a case you have a duty to keep on

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:49.680
 living because once you die the hallucination is over and the rest of

00:33:49.680 --> 00:34:00.120
 us disappear into nothingness save us you're our only hope dead rabbit radio

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:27.680
 I feel swift here for new flex superglue what's truly amazing is that our flex

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:33.160
 superglue is so strong that just one drop virtually welds itself to the surface

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:39.240
 and can lift over three tons forget those old superglues get the one that's new

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:45.800
 flex superglue go to flexceoproducts.com/3tonleft to learn more

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:53.000
 about how one drop lifted three tons for demonstration purposes only
