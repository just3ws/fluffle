 A man finds himself pulled into the bowels of hell and it turns out that hell

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 isn't what you thought it was. It is eternal torment but we'll get to that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.060
 story. It's quite odd. I was a little disappointed. I was a little disappointed

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.620
 how hell turned out. And then we meet a young boy who has a terrifying dream of

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:05.180
 a blood-soaked bathroom. But that's all it was right. A dream. Well that's what he

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.540
 thought until as an adult he found himself walking into that exact same

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.820
 bathroom. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.900
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.700
 host Asa Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.440
 day too. I hope you guys had an awesome weekend. Hope it was lots and lots of fun.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.900
 We got a lot of stuff to cover sure we're gonna get started right away. First off

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.980
 someone who always knows how to have fun whether it's the weekend or not is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.860
 today's book buyer. I think I need to give you guys an official title. I got a new

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.820
 book sent to me so everyone get on your feet and give a round of applause for

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.420
 Tayshana. Woohoo yeah walk on in Tayshana bringing that book cart and all of them

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.540
 books. Tayshana recently purchased off my Amazon wishlist the book about the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.020
 history of Blockbuster video called Built to Fail. The inside story of

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.380
 Blockbuster's incredible bust. I actually got this book. Thank you so much

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.620
 Tayshana. I got this book as I was leaving to go to the doctor to get my

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.460
 COVID medication. They put me on some pretty gnarly antivirals and they locked

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.820
 me. They locked me. Let's not exaggerate but I did have to sit in this pod outside

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.620
 of the medical center for a while and I read like half the book so it was a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.060
 great timing. And I love Blockbuster. I love those video stories. It's a really

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.660
 interesting book. The answer it starts off by saying I'm sure you think that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.100
 Blockbuster failed because of Netflix. That's what everybody thinks. That's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.140
 what even Blockbuster executives think. The reason why it fell apart was because

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.420
 Netflix came around and knocked him off but that is not the case. That is not

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.140
 the case. The book does a really good job detailing the fall of Blockbuster

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.220
 video and that was a big part of my childhood. So thank you Tayshana for

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.860
 sending me that book. You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode. If you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.140
 guys can't support the show if you guys can't buy me books that's totally fine.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.540
 It really really is. Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio. That helps

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.460
 out so so much and I see you guys doing it. I see you guys talking about it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.260
 online so that is absolutely fantastic. Tayshana let's go ahead and I'm gonna

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.220
 toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy. We're gonna leave behind Dead

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.220
 Rabbit Command. We're gonna drive all the way out to Michigan.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.220
 [imitates gunfire]

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.400
 And we're not gonna be spending a lot of time in Michigan so if you're hoping to

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.220
 go see all the tourist sites in Michigan are there any? Probably not. But if you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.420
 were hoping to see those things walk around you're like well that's about it.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.060
 Nothing historical happened here. That's we're not gonna be here for long. Don't

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.180
 worry because we're actually going to hell. We're going to hell. I'm sure that's far

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.740
 more entertaining than Michigan but we have to make a stop here because we're

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.380
 about to meet a priest named Gerald Johnson. And Gerald Johnson recently

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.120
 posted this story on TikTok about the time he went to hell. I know it's a little

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.560
 weird, right? There's gonna be a lot of questions you have about this. I actually

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.560
 think he probably did really experience something. It is kind of weird that if

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.880
 you had happened to plummet through multiple dimensions and found yourself in

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.480
 the one known as hell you would post about it on TikTok. Maybe he's given

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.440
 sermons on this. I don't think the first thing he did when he came back to life

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.060
 was like give me my phone. I have to release a one minute long video on this.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.260
 He probably talked to his congregation and things like that. We know about it

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.820
 because of his TikTok videos. It's gone viral the time he went to hell. I mean if

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.900
 anything's gonna go viral, right? It's the story of a priest who went to hell and

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.460
 came back. Gerald Johnson said back in 2016 he had a heart attack. Michigan was

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.020
 just too exciting for him and he's like I can't take it anymore. He had a heart

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.840
 attack and he said I felt my soul leaving my body. This was it. I was

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.920
 done and it was time for me to go up and sit with the Lord in heaven because I'd

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.280
 done nothing but good works on earth. I dedicated my life to Christ. So that's

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.680
 part of the deal, right? I did that. So now I get to go to heaven but what he

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.640
 realized very quickly was that he was headed in the wrong direction. So he

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.620
 says that hell, literal hell, the dimension that souls go to be tormented

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:44.380
 until the end of time, is in the middle of the earth. He goes that's true. There's

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.980
 not a molten core there. Well it is probably pretty hot down there but he

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.820
 goes you actually go through the planet. You're like going through like the

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.780
 crust. You're like going through the mantle and all that stuff. It's just like

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.720
 you're bored. You're looking at your watch as you're passing dinosaur

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.680
 skeletons and then finally he found himself in hell and he couldn't figure

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.680
 out why he was down here. He should have gone to heaven. All of the good works

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.880
 he's done. Why is he in hell? Just the theory, just the idea right now of a

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.920
 priest going to hell, that in and of itself is fascinating. The end near death

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.840
 experiences being negative is also super fascinating because we see most

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.460
 near death experiences are heavenly or this peaceful utopia, pure bliss. We did

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.260
 a whole episode on negative near death experiences. I'll put that in the show

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.740
 notes but we're about to meet a man we've already met him. We're waving

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.020
 goodbye to his soul. He's getting dragged in hell. My demons are like see you later

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.700
 man. We're taking the watch off of his body. He's getting pulled into hell but

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:55.320
 he goes on to say the things I saw down there were quote indescribable which I

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.360
 would imagine. I was saying about this the other day. I will be disappointed if

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:08.680
 the afterlife has a floor. I was looking at some image, some some fractal version of

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.120
 the afterlife and there was a floor and I go I'll be really disappointed that

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:20.840
 when I die and I go to the world after this one if there's ground I want nothing

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:29.300
 underneath me. I just want to fly around and not land but knowing that there's

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.220
 ground is a limiter. Even if I could fly through the ground I'm like I'm just

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.780
 underground. It's kind of boring. Like are there tunnels down here? I don't know but

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.940
 I don't want there to be any ground. Does that make sense? That might be the weirdest thing

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.380
 you've ever said on this fly to gas and you said a lot. If I die and all of a

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.120
 sudden like I'm standing on a cloud I'm gonna be like what's in this cloud? What's

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.780
 in this cloud? This is my first thing not where all my loved ones. Did we win the

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.400
 war against the insectoids? When I die the first thing I'm gonna ask is what's

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.860
 in this cloud? Swimming around in it. They're like are you destroying our

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:11.960
 firmament? No ground. I don't want any dirt. Not that I'm against dirt but what

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.640
 I'm saying is ground is a limiter. So if I die and then I just appear on a

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.640
 slightly more peaceful earth I'm gonna be kind of bummed out. I mean I love earth.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:26.600
 But I wonder just how abstract things are. So when he said what I saw was

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.560
 indescribable I go no ground no ground right? There was a ground down there. I

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.940
 think me and Mr. Johnson I don't know if he goes by Father Johnson but because I

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.300
 don't believe he's a Catholic priest but me and Gerald Johnson where we

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:47.000
 differ I think is that when I say indescribable I would think it's so

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.700
 abstract that the human mind... there's no words in any known language that can

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:59.920
 explain what's in front of me. Like it is truly indescribable. He then goes on

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:07.440
 though to describe in relatively... I mean it's just it's underwhelming.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.780
 I was a long way to say I was like oh that's hell. Sounds kind of lame. Now again

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.580
 if you were there and you knew you're gonna be there for all of eternity you'd

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.820
 be the most horrific place to be. It was indescribable but then he tells us he

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.600
 gives us two anecdotes from hell. One is terrifying but still a little

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.660
 underwhelming. He says when he's down there he goes everything is spoken of

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:40.160
 telepathically. You instinctively know what's going on everywhere. Now that's

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.520
 cool that's cool detail right that would be something I would think would happen

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:48.000
 in the afterlife. The limitations of language. Why would those be a thing in

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.640
 the after? Most people probably had their tongues ripped out the first time they

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.160
 showed up there but anyways he comes down he goes I knew all this stuff

00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:02.180
 instantly telepathically he goes I saw I saw a demon. He didn't explain what the

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.700
 demon looked like was it like a really cool demon was it CGI look like a guy in

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:12.180
 a rubber suit we don't know but anyways he saw a demon walking by.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.820
 Which ever is there that's kind of funny right you're just like oh no I'm in hell and he was like hey

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:25.200
 hey Jerry this demon walks by and he has a human pet. He said there was a human

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:33.040
 walking on all fours like a dog his eyes bulging out of his head and this demon

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.720
 had a leash around his neck and was walking him like a dog and the dude's

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.040
 skin was completely burned off it was just all like just open sores muscle

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.580
 tissue being exposed to the element and he's crawling on the ground his eyes

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:53.700
 bulging out of his head and the demon is walking him like a dog and he goes I

00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:01.300
 telepathically knew that this is creepy like again you can hear like Jason that dog fart was

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:07.700
 pretty creepy too. I thought this was creepier. He said I knew that when that

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:14.560
 man was born on earth that demon who's now walking him like a dog that demon

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:24.400
 was sent up there to torment him from babyhood to adulthood to death. This

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.240
 demon had followed this man around from the time that he was a child to the time

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:36.000
 that he died constantly tempting him constantly leading him from the path of

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.800
 salvation and the demon had won. The demon had broken this man over the course

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:49.460
 of his life and now this man will forever be a slave in hell to this demon and

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.660
 he goes that's how demons work if they can earn your soul if they can constantly

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.180
 keep you off the right path of why you were put here on earth in the first

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:05.180
 place they have you as their slave forever in hell. I was like that's really

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.220
 cool that's really cool world-building I had never heard that theory before and

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.260
 obviously demons tempting people that's nothing new but the idea that the demon

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.900
 gets something out of it other than just satisfaction of leading people astray

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.840
 it was the fact that they earned that soul in hell I was like wow that's really

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:30.940
 creepy but I also keep picturing this guy walking on his hands and knees now see

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:36.460
 if I went to hell like here's the thing like I would imagine things way

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:42.740
 grosser the goal is and what what you can imagine and please don't say what is

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.980
 gonna come out of your mouth because I'm sure it's horrific so not what you

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.220
 imagine it's what's really down there if I saw a man walking on all fours

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.460
 flame on fire right it's gonna all been burned off and a demon had a leash around

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.780
 his neck I would wonder I'd go hey demon why does he still

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.460
 I'm hoping the demons out there like a we didn't think about that wouldn't it be

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:09.500
 better instead of him walking on his hands and his knees why don't you cut off

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.100
 his calves so then he's walking on like open stumps as well because a dog doesn't

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:20.620
 have long legs you know you know he walks on all fours if those little little

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.020
 I'm just gonna get the legs I'm just giving the claim right I care of it like I

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:32.340
 would assume or turn him into a dog turn him into Snoopy or something turn him

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.860
 into a dog but with a human brain and he's constantly like no no I used to be

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.860
 a man I used to be a man and now I'm now I'm Snoopy in hell there's way worse

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.780
 stuff you know what I mean so I mean it's like that is really cool world

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:52.140
 building the fact that the demons earn your soul but it like listen just to be

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.460
 clear I don't want to walk I want to walk on all fours for all of eternity

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.380
 that would suck but I think it would be way worse if I was walking on like open

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:06.460
 stumps yes Jason you're right you're right demons aren't cruel enough well if

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:12.140
 you think that we got one other place to visit because this guy listed two places

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:18.700
 one he saw a dog walk by and not not a dog he saw a man acting like a dog walk

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:25.540
 by I also thought that some people's fetish they read that they used to be

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.060
 really good people and now they're like just start messing stuff up they're

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.460
 like pushing kids over and then they're like alright I'm gonna be one of those

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.500
 dog people for eternity rough rough that you know like people are into that some

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.420
 people are into that there's another part of hell that he went to that is all

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:51.540
 music all music all the time it's very interesting I remember there it is

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.900
 stated that Lucifer I don't know if it's actually in the Bible but I it might be

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:02.180
 but I remember growing up that loot hearing that Lucifer was the angel of

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:08.380
 music and there was always a group of Christians who believed that music

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.940
 itself was satanic that's interesting thing is music is such a part of the

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:20.860
 human condition any baby any baby at all will start moving to a rhythm it's just

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.780
 part of the human condition there's a demon behind him dancing he's like oh

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.340
 we're gonna have a fun time when you're in hell as an adult dog but anyways you

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.660
 as babies dance everyone has some sense of rhythm to them far the human

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.020
 condition but I've also heard that Lucifer is the angel of music like all

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:43.260
 music comes from Satan even Christian music I actually want to do a little

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.740
 more research on that I might do a that is a topic one of these days because

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:53.580
 it's fascinating anyways this part of hell is the musical part of hell but

00:15:53.580 --> 00:16:02.580
 it's demons singing the songs and you're trapped there and you have to listen to

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:10.020
 demons sing these songs all the time I mean this is a dog walking around on

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.180
 hot coals for the rest of time

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:19.500
 sitting there listening to music you're like okay this is bad but it's not that

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.900
 bad you're pointing out of that guy he names here's the problem I remember my

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.860
 dad said this my dad's Southern Baptist minister growing up he goes don't ever

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.820
 describe heaven or hell he goes most religions don't really go into detail

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.260
 with the afterlife because the thing is is it gets outdated really really

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.660
 quickly if you had a religion today if Southern Baptists were using the

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:50.860
 definition of heaven based on statements made in 30 AD it would be

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.380
 completely outdated it would be stuff like you'll sit there and you'll see wheat

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.260
 fields as far as the eye can see and all of the all of in date trees you could

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:04.660
 ever imagine people now I don't want any of that stuff I'm glue I have a gluten

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:10.220
 intolerance and I hate olives so you can't really go into detail of what

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.660
 heaven and hell is because they did the terms just become outdated and I think

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:19.460
 that's the thing here too you can detail hell and you can go there's a satanic

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:27.220
 symphony there to punish people specifically who listen to secular

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.940
 music on earth and didn't listen to music that uplifted God's message so now

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.140
 they're trapped here but he names the songs like if you just leave it at that

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.900
 you're like oh that'd be horrible to hear a bunch of demons your horrific

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:48.180
 cacophony of guttural noises no they're actually singing don't worry be happy

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.540
 what you imagine would get kind of old after the one billionth time don't worry

00:17:53.540 --> 00:18:00.260
 be happy and apparently also Rihanna's song umbrella which has long been rumored

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:08.060
 to be a love song written to Lucifer to begin with but I mean like that it's

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.580
 just for the novelty alone right it would be like going to see like the

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:17.620
 Chuck E cheese band do their version of like a virgin by Madonna right just the

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.620
 novelty of it sure it's gonna sound terrible but it would be something you

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.340
 could say it was so weird I went to check your cheese the other night they were

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:31.380
 playing like a virgin you're like what so that's that's it was all that he could

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.060
 tell us about hell he might have other stuff that truly is indescribable he it

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.560
 was like a very short tiktok video and he says just talking about it makes his

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.020
 nauseous oh I guess I should wrap up this story I was like oh and he's still in

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.060
 hell to this day he's tiktok in room hell he said that while he's in hell and

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.380
 he's listening to this horrific music he's like no no Bob McFerrin what have

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.060
 you done to my soul he starts to get really mad at God and he's like God I

00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:01.420
 was your servant on earth why did you send me to hell and God reaches down and

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.100
 picks him up and is pulling him out of hell and he goes I thought this was

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.220
 interesting because this this is true I think for everybody he goes you did good

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:18.580
 stuff but you hated your enemies not only did you hate your enemies you in

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:25.220
 your heart wished that I would punish them you wanted divine eternal

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:30.180
 punishment against people who had simply wronged you over on the galactic scale

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.420
 fairly minor things you're not on earth to wish my punishment upon other people

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:42.340
 I've forgiven you if you can't forgive them then you are you truly forgiven

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:49.300
 because basically like a life lesson and brought back to life he said go forth

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:56.020
 and tell the tiktokers what happened here it's an interesting story I think

00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:00.860
 he had some experience I'm not saying that he's making it up or he's a fraud or

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.300
 anything like that I think you probably did have some sort of experience they do

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.300
 have negative non-death experiences I just thought it was fascinating one that

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.820
 you had a man of the cloth get thrown to hell and then also just like yeah I

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:17.380
 feel like that hell was a little underwhelming I guess I just thought it

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.740
 was going to be there's gonna be like more pizzazz or something like that or

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:28.740
 even just scarier right what would be scarier to you you die that's already

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.300
 terrifying quit couldn't mention he that's sometimes we're all gonna die you

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:40.420
 die and then you find yourself walking on all fours you're on fire your skin's

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.060
 been seared off and there's a demon has at least around your neck now again some

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.660
 of you guys you're like you like that stuff you're totally into it what's

00:20:47.660 --> 00:21:00.940
 scarier though that or you die and it's pitch black you can't see anything I

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.500
 think you guys know where this is going like imagine it's in the pitch black

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.060
 forget being able to see other stuff because then you can be like hey Johnny

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.380
 you see he's being treated like a pony a demon's riding them you're like that

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.900
 guy's way way worse off than I am I'm just walking that guy has a demon on his

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.540
 back you're pitch black you think you're all alone there's no one around you and

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:25.300
 like your skin is falling off you can actually feel it melting off of you and

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.820
 you're trying to keep it out of your mouth and out of your eyes and stuff like

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:35.060
 that and you're just like screaming and then okay I'll just stop it's like it

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:41.300
 is going for another five minutes I was like and then the maggots you can feel

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:46.380
 the last meal you ate before you died rotting in your dead corpse of a stomach

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:53.660
 and then the maggots are like filling you up you're like that's what that's

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.980
 what hell that's what I would imagine hell was like right you can feel your

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:06.300
 body decaying in the grave and then okay I just thought there'd be more

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:13.100
 bizarre if hell is just people walking on all fours listening to bad pop songs

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:23.820
 that's not that's not too bad that's not between bursting in the darkness your

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:29.140
 body just being exposed the elements is millions of maggots hatch it comes

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:34.440
 out of your inner and sore listening to don't worry be happy I think I think

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:41.500
 father Jerry Johnson had I think his hell is probably better

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.300
 Tashauna let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonic after we're leaving

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.180
 behind hell we have a new pets we have this don't bring them on the helicopter

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:57.060
 I don't want to save his eyes are bulging out we're gonna save this guy

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.220
 we're taking this guy out of hell Tashauna fly us out of hell we're gonna

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:13.100
 head all the way out to a house in the suburbs so we're walking out of the

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:18.180
 carbonicopter and we see this house looks like every other house in the area

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.900
 we don't have a location for this story we don't really have a time period as

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:27.020
 well or names this was posted online by someone going by the name emotional

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:33.180
 crests one two seven two we're gonna go ahead and call her Carla one day Carla

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:40.340
 sitting at home alone with her stepdad we're gonna call him Tony now Tony's the

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.340
 stepdad he's a relatively recent addition to this family he's been with

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:49.900
 him for a couple years you have Tony you have Carla you have Carla's mom Carla's

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:57.380
 little brother that was the family unit for years until Tony showed up and they've

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.300
 gotten married at this point Carla and Tony Tony and the mom have got married at

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.740
 this point and he's officially part of the family and they're making it work

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:11.180
 they're really making it work but one day mom's gone little brother's gone it's

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:17.420
 just Tony and Carla sitting on a couch watching television watching a movie

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:23.260
 middle of the movie Tony goes you want to hear something just crazy like I've

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.180
 told your mom about this and I don't really think she believed it that much

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:36.940
 or I don't know I don't know but this story is insane this story is so crazy

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:42.300
 now who's gonna turn down an offer like that right you're sitting at home alone

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.540
 with someone and they go hey you want to hear something insane Carla goes sure

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:54.020
 yeah what do you got for me Tony says when I was a boy I was a boy this is

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.740
 long before I met your mom long before you and your brother were even born

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:13.860
 really when I was a boy I had a nightmare I woke up into the dream and I

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:18.060
 walked through the house wasn't the house that I lived in as a boy never been

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:23.780
 there before I walked through this house and I find myself in the bathroom of

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.420
 that house

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:36.300
 and in this bathroom there's a witch or it's to be more specific a witchy

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.980
 looking woman that's how he really described it was a woman who looked

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:45.140
 like a witch but I'm standing in this bathroom and there's this witch standing

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:51.460
 there and she's laughing maniacally and he goes Carla this is the weird thing I

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:58.340
 had that dream and it's terrified me so much I remembered the exact details

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.900
 about the bathroom including the pattern of the bathroom tiles on the floor like

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:09.820
 it terrified me I thought about that dream for years and years went by and I

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:16.300
 started dating your mom you remember that old house you guys lived in the house

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.980
 you guys lived in when me and your mom started dating Carlos like yeah I

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:26.980
 remember that Tony goes I remember the first time I came over to that house when

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:33.660
 I went into the bathroom of that house that was the bathroom from my dream it

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:42.020
 was the exact same bathroom I saw years before I even met your mom long before

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:48.020
 you two were even born I had this dream that I was in the bathroom at your old

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.500
 house Carlos like that is insane that's an insane story like what are the

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:57.380
 chances of that where you like seeing the future coincidence like how many

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:04.940
 different layouts of bathrooms can you have that is quite odd Tony goes that's

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:12.100
 not the insane part Tony said when I was a kid I had this dream that I walked

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:19.420
 into a bathroom bathroom that I didn't recognize until years later when I swung

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:24.700
 by your old house had a dream that I was in this bathroom and inside the bathroom

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:32.420
 was a witchy-looking woman laughing maniacally and the bathtub in that

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:42.620
 bathroom was filled to the brim with blood and I look into that bathtub and

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:54.860
 floating in the bathtub of blood was three severed human heads

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:07.020
 the witchy woman is cackling her laugh is echoing through this small bathroom

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:15.660
 as I'm looking down at these three heads floating in a pool of blood now when I

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:23.420
 had that dream as a young boy I didn't know who those three heads belong to but

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:35.540
 eventually years later I recognized them they were the heads of your mother your

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.620
 brother and you

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:47.460
 Tony said I never told you guys that story I didn't even tell your mom that

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:52.020
 story as long as you guys lived at that old house never told you because I

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:58.220
 figured it would terrify you freak out right but since we've moved I've told

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.780
 your mom now I've told you wait for the little brother to come home I'll tell him

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:08.060
 to you guys I've told your mother I've told you I don't know what it means

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:13.820
 really it's just a horrifying nightmare I knew exactly the bathroom that I saw

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:20.100
 in my dream when I walked into in real life and then one day dawns on me I

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.980
 recognized those heads it was you guys

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:32.140
 Carla said she goes I did end up asking my mom if she had ever heard this story

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:41.060
 and the mom responded yeah he told me about that but didn't seem to offer any

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:48.740
 other sort of read on how she felt about the situation was she concerned did she

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.780
 brush it off did she think he was joking and that's the other thing Carla goes she

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:59.140
 goes I don't know if he's messing with me like he could just be making this up

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.780
 to push my buttons I mean you know everyone wants to be a severed head in

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:08.180
 a bloody bathtub is he making it up to push my buttons if that's the case why

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.460
 would he tell my mom about it did he make it up as a joke did he make it up to

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:21.180
 scare me or is it real and she goes really either way it's terrifying like

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:27.300
 if he's just joking it's a pretty terrifying joke but if he's telling the

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:36.180
 truth it's a fascinating story right there's some key details missing again

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:41.980
 we don't know really the age that he had the dream was he like seven doesn't

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:47.060
 matter if he's seven or 27 the fact is he had a premonition it's interesting

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.340
 because it's half of a premonition right he was able to visit a bathroom that he

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:55.560
 wouldn't see until the future he was able to recognize the severed heads in the

00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:01.260
 blood that he wouldn't meet until the future but he hasn't chopped off their

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:07.620
 heads so it was a premonition of something that just some of the details

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:12.500
 were real but what's interesting about this story I read this was posted online

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:19.500
 and kind of the kind of the gist I was getting from Carla was this is really

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:29.300
 creepy but at least we don't live there anymore so the danger has passed other

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.620
 than the fact that you may have a stepdad who if he's joking is telling a

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:38.700
 terrible joke it's actually kind of funny if he's joking but you know to the kid

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.540
 we don't know how old she is either but the idea I guess kind of is that the

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.660
 dangers past and even he felt like that like he did not tell him about this while

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:55.580
 they stayed at that old house he waited until they moved on and now I listen

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.820
 let's look at the story from his point of view I'm sure he was absolutely

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:05.100
 terrified when he first had the nightmare but then meeting a woman and joining

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:10.900
 her family and becoming part of that family and having that image in the

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.580
 back of your head that you saw their bloodied heads float around in a bathtub

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.740
 full of blood you're like do you take her I do and then you go to kiss the

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.660
 bride it's like you're just imagining a severed head with a bridal veil on like

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.740
 did he have flashbacks to this the kids are like let's go to the water park he's

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:34.460
 like no no it's red dye day at the water park they should totally do that when

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.780
 they just put red dye everywhere my point is is though is his point of view

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:43.980
 once they moved out of the house he probably figured the threat was gone

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:48.700
 whatever it was right was he the one who chopped their heads off did the witchy

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:53.780
 woman chop their heads off was it symbolic was it literal it doesn't matter

00:32:53.780 --> 00:33:01.100
 we don't live there anymore the danger has passed but has it it's not like that

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.900
 house was blown to smithereens it's not like the new owner came in and did a

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:13.460
 complete remodel on the bathroom they just moved out that same house from that

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:20.140
 dream may be sitting there bathroom completely untouched just because they

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.460
 don't live in the house anymore doesn't mean the premonition won't come true

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:33.820
 just means it didn't come true then was the dream a warning of something that

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:40.540
 could happen to this family once he entered their lives and more terrifying

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:49.340
 is this dream a warning of what he himself may do to this family if you had

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:59.060
 that dream and then years later you met that family in real life would you ever

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:05.420
 let your guard down because on the one hand it could be that this family was

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:11.460
 butchered by a third party but on the other hand there's such a layer of

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:17.340
 malevolence to this story that it almost seems like Tony himself is the

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:26.500
 murderer I don't know why I get that feeling but I feel that that's what this

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:35.500
 story is describing this young boy is not seeing the work of some maniac well

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:44.740
 he is but he's the maniac everything about it just feels so deeply personal

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:54.580
 and the threat has not passed this is a prophetic dream the threat has not

00:34:54.580 --> 00:35:01.660
 passed if anything it's become more of a reality because now Tony is a part of

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:13.780
 the family forever I'm not saying Tony is a murderer I'm not saying Tony has

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:21.220
 these dark thoughts when he's sitting with his family I'm not saying that

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:31.300
 someday Tony is gonna slaughter his wife and his two stepchildren not saying

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:40.620
 any of that but if it did happen that's the kind of dark and evil twist ending

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:48.060
 that would cause a witch to cackle with glee

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:58.220
