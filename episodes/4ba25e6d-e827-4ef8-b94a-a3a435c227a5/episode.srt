7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:39,340
 A man finds himself pulled into the bowels of hell and it turns out that hell

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:47,340
 isn't what you thought it was. It is eternal torment but we'll get to that

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,060
 story. It's quite odd. I was a little disappointed. I was a little disappointed

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,620
 how hell turned out. And then we meet a young boy who has a terrifying dream of

11
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:05,180
 a blood-soaked bathroom. But that's all it was right. A dream. Well that's what he

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:12,540
 thought until as an adult he found himself walking into that exact same

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,820
 bathroom. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,900
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

15
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,700
 host Asa Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great

16
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,440
 day too. I hope you guys had an awesome weekend. Hope it was lots and lots of fun.

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,900
 We got a lot of stuff to cover sure we're gonna get started right away. First off

18
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,980
 someone who always knows how to have fun whether it's the weekend or not is

19
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,860
 today's book buyer. I think I need to give you guys an official title. I got a new

20
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,820
 book sent to me so everyone get on your feet and give a round of applause for

21
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,420
 Tayshana. Woohoo yeah walk on in Tayshana bringing that book cart and all of them

22
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:06,540
 books. Tayshana recently purchased off my Amazon wishlist the book about the

23
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,020
 history of Blockbuster video called Built to Fail. The inside story of

24
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,380
 Blockbuster's incredible bust. I actually got this book. Thank you so much

25
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,620
 Tayshana. I got this book as I was leaving to go to the doctor to get my

26
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,460
 COVID medication. They put me on some pretty gnarly antivirals and they locked

27
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,820
 me. They locked me. Let's not exaggerate but I did have to sit in this pod outside

28
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,620
 of the medical center for a while and I read like half the book so it was a

29
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,060
 great timing. And I love Blockbuster. I love those video stories. It's a really

30
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,660
 interesting book. The answer it starts off by saying I'm sure you think that

31
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,100
 Blockbuster failed because of Netflix. That's what everybody thinks. That's

32
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,140
 what even Blockbuster executives think. The reason why it fell apart was because

33
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,420
 Netflix came around and knocked him off but that is not the case. That is not

34
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,140
 the case. The book does a really good job detailing the fall of Blockbuster

35
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,220
 video and that was a big part of my childhood. So thank you Tayshana for

36
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,860
 sending me that book. You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode. If you

37
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,140
 guys can't support the show if you guys can't buy me books that's totally fine.

38
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,540
 It really really is. Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio. That helps

39
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,460
 out so so much and I see you guys doing it. I see you guys talking about it

40
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,260
 online so that is absolutely fantastic. Tayshana let's go ahead and I'm gonna

41
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,220
 toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy. We're gonna leave behind Dead

42
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,220
 Rabbit Command. We're gonna drive all the way out to Michigan.

43
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,220
 [imitates gunfire]

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,400
 And we're not gonna be spending a lot of time in Michigan so if you're hoping to

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,220
 go see all the tourist sites in Michigan are there any? Probably not. But if you

46
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,420
 were hoping to see those things walk around you're like well that's about it.

47
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,060
 Nothing historical happened here. That's we're not gonna be here for long. Don't

48
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,180
 worry because we're actually going to hell. We're going to hell. I'm sure that's far

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,740
 more entertaining than Michigan but we have to make a stop here because we're

50
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,380
 about to meet a priest named Gerald Johnson. And Gerald Johnson recently

51
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:16,120
 posted this story on TikTok about the time he went to hell. I know it's a little

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,560
 weird, right? There's gonna be a lot of questions you have about this. I actually

53
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,560
 think he probably did really experience something. It is kind of weird that if

54
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,880
 you had happened to plummet through multiple dimensions and found yourself in

55
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,480
 the one known as hell you would post about it on TikTok. Maybe he's given

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,440
 sermons on this. I don't think the first thing he did when he came back to life

57
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,060
 was like give me my phone. I have to release a one minute long video on this.

58
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,260
 He probably talked to his congregation and things like that. We know about it

59
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,820
 because of his TikTok videos. It's gone viral the time he went to hell. I mean if

60
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,900
 anything's gonna go viral, right? It's the story of a priest who went to hell and

61
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,460
 came back. Gerald Johnson said back in 2016 he had a heart attack. Michigan was

62
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,020
 just too exciting for him and he's like I can't take it anymore. He had a heart

63
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,840
 attack and he said I felt my soul leaving my body. This was it. I was

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,920
 done and it was time for me to go up and sit with the Lord in heaven because I'd

65
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,280
 done nothing but good works on earth. I dedicated my life to Christ. So that's

66
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,680
 part of the deal, right? I did that. So now I get to go to heaven but what he

67
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,640
 realized very quickly was that he was headed in the wrong direction. So he

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,620
 says that hell, literal hell, the dimension that souls go to be tormented

69
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:44,380
 until the end of time, is in the middle of the earth. He goes that's true. There's

70
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,980
 not a molten core there. Well it is probably pretty hot down there but he

71
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,820
 goes you actually go through the planet. You're like going through like the

72
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,780
 crust. You're like going through the mantle and all that stuff. It's just like

73
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,720
 you're bored. You're looking at your watch as you're passing dinosaur

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,680
 skeletons and then finally he found himself in hell and he couldn't figure

75
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,680
 out why he was down here. He should have gone to heaven. All of the good works

76
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,880
 he's done. Why is he in hell? Just the theory, just the idea right now of a

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,920
 priest going to hell, that in and of itself is fascinating. The end near death

78
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,840
 experiences being negative is also super fascinating because we see most

79
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,460
 near death experiences are heavenly or this peaceful utopia, pure bliss. We did

80
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,260
 a whole episode on negative near death experiences. I'll put that in the show

81
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,740
 notes but we're about to meet a man we've already met him. We're waving

82
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,020
 goodbye to his soul. He's getting dragged in hell. My demons are like see you later

83
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,700
 man. We're taking the watch off of his body. He's getting pulled into hell but

84
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,320
 he goes on to say the things I saw down there were quote indescribable which I

85
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,360
 would imagine. I was saying about this the other day. I will be disappointed if

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:08,680
 the afterlife has a floor. I was looking at some image, some some fractal version of

87
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,120
 the afterlife and there was a floor and I go I'll be really disappointed that

88
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,840
 when I die and I go to the world after this one if there's ground I want nothing

89
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:29,300
 underneath me. I just want to fly around and not land but knowing that there's

90
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,220
 ground is a limiter. Even if I could fly through the ground I'm like I'm just

91
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,780
 underground. It's kind of boring. Like are there tunnels down here? I don't know but

92
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,940
 I don't want there to be any ground. Does that make sense? That might be the weirdest thing

93
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,380
 you've ever said on this fly to gas and you said a lot. If I die and all of a

94
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,120
 sudden like I'm standing on a cloud I'm gonna be like what's in this cloud? What's

95
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,780
 in this cloud? This is my first thing not where all my loved ones. Did we win the

96
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,400
 war against the insectoids? When I die the first thing I'm gonna ask is what's

97
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,860
 in this cloud? Swimming around in it. They're like are you destroying our

98
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,960
 firmament? No ground. I don't want any dirt. Not that I'm against dirt but what

99
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,640
 I'm saying is ground is a limiter. So if I die and then I just appear on a

100
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,640
 slightly more peaceful earth I'm gonna be kind of bummed out. I mean I love earth.

101
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,600
 But I wonder just how abstract things are. So when he said what I saw was

102
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,560
 indescribable I go no ground no ground right? There was a ground down there. I

103
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,940
 think me and Mr. Johnson I don't know if he goes by Father Johnson but because I

104
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,300
 don't believe he's a Catholic priest but me and Gerald Johnson where we

105
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,000
 differ I think is that when I say indescribable I would think it's so

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,700
 abstract that the human mind... there's no words in any known language that can

107
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:59,920
 explain what's in front of me. Like it is truly indescribable. He then goes on

108
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,440
 though to describe in relatively... I mean it's just it's underwhelming.

109
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,780
 I was a long way to say I was like oh that's hell. Sounds kind of lame. Now again

110
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,580
 if you were there and you knew you're gonna be there for all of eternity you'd

111
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,820
 be the most horrific place to be. It was indescribable but then he tells us he

112
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,600
 gives us two anecdotes from hell. One is terrifying but still a little

113
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,660
 underwhelming. He says when he's down there he goes everything is spoken of

114
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:40,160
 telepathically. You instinctively know what's going on everywhere. Now that's

115
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,520
 cool that's cool detail right that would be something I would think would happen

116
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,000
 in the afterlife. The limitations of language. Why would those be a thing in

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,640
 the after? Most people probably had their tongues ripped out the first time they

118
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,160
 showed up there but anyways he comes down he goes I knew all this stuff

119
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:02,180
 instantly telepathically he goes I saw I saw a demon. He didn't explain what the

120
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,700
 demon looked like was it like a really cool demon was it CGI look like a guy in

121
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,180
 a rubber suit we don't know but anyways he saw a demon walking by.

122
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,820
 Which ever is there that's kind of funny right you're just like oh no I'm in hell and he was like hey

123
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:25,200
 hey Jerry this demon walks by and he has a human pet. He said there was a human

124
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:33,040
 walking on all fours like a dog his eyes bulging out of his head and this demon

125
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,720
 had a leash around his neck and was walking him like a dog and the dude's

126
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,040
 skin was completely burned off it was just all like just open sores muscle

127
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,580
 tissue being exposed to the element and he's crawling on the ground his eyes

128
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,700
 bulging out of his head and the demon is walking him like a dog and he goes I

129
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:01,300
 telepathically knew that this is creepy like again you can hear like Jason that dog fart was

130
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,700
 pretty creepy too. I thought this was creepier. He said I knew that when that

131
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,560
 man was born on earth that demon who's now walking him like a dog that demon

132
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:24,400
 was sent up there to torment him from babyhood to adulthood to death. This

133
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,240
 demon had followed this man around from the time that he was a child to the time

134
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,000
 that he died constantly tempting him constantly leading him from the path of

135
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,800
 salvation and the demon had won. The demon had broken this man over the course

136
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,460
 of his life and now this man will forever be a slave in hell to this demon and

137
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,660
 he goes that's how demons work if they can earn your soul if they can constantly

138
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,180
 keep you off the right path of why you were put here on earth in the first

139
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:05,180
 place they have you as their slave forever in hell. I was like that's really

140
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,220
 cool that's really cool world-building I had never heard that theory before and

141
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,260
 obviously demons tempting people that's nothing new but the idea that the demon

142
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,900
 gets something out of it other than just satisfaction of leading people astray

143
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,840
 it was the fact that they earned that soul in hell I was like wow that's really

144
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,940
 creepy but I also keep picturing this guy walking on his hands and knees now see

145
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,460
 if I went to hell like here's the thing like I would imagine things way

146
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:42,740
 grosser the goal is and what what you can imagine and please don't say what is

147
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,980
 gonna come out of your mouth because I'm sure it's horrific so not what you

148
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,220
 imagine it's what's really down there if I saw a man walking on all fours

149
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,460
 flame on fire right it's gonna all been burned off and a demon had a leash around

150
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,780
 his neck I would wonder I'd go hey demon why does he still

151
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,460
 I'm hoping the demons out there like a we didn't think about that wouldn't it be

152
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,500
 better instead of him walking on his hands and his knees why don't you cut off

153
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,100
 his calves so then he's walking on like open stumps as well because a dog doesn't

154
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,620
 have long legs you know you know he walks on all fours if those little little

155
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,020
 I'm just gonna get the legs I'm just giving the claim right I care of it like I

156
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:32,340
 would assume or turn him into a dog turn him into Snoopy or something turn him

157
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,860
 into a dog but with a human brain and he's constantly like no no I used to be

158
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,860
 a man I used to be a man and now I'm now I'm Snoopy in hell there's way worse

159
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,780
 stuff you know what I mean so I mean it's like that is really cool world

160
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,140
 building the fact that the demons earn your soul but it like listen just to be

161
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,460
 clear I don't want to walk I want to walk on all fours for all of eternity

162
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,380
 that would suck but I think it would be way worse if I was walking on like open

163
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:06,460
 stumps yes Jason you're right you're right demons aren't cruel enough well if

164
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:12,140
 you think that we got one other place to visit because this guy listed two places

165
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:18,700
 one he saw a dog walk by and not not a dog he saw a man acting like a dog walk

166
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:25,540
 by I also thought that some people's fetish they read that they used to be

167
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,060
 really good people and now they're like just start messing stuff up they're

168
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,460
 like pushing kids over and then they're like alright I'm gonna be one of those

169
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,500
 dog people for eternity rough rough that you know like people are into that some

170
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,420
 people are into that there's another part of hell that he went to that is all

171
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:51,540
 music all music all the time it's very interesting I remember there it is

172
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,900
 stated that Lucifer I don't know if it's actually in the Bible but I it might be

173
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,180
 but I remember growing up that loot hearing that Lucifer was the angel of

174
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:08,380
 music and there was always a group of Christians who believed that music

175
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,940
 itself was satanic that's interesting thing is music is such a part of the

176
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:20,860
 human condition any baby any baby at all will start moving to a rhythm it's just

177
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,780
 part of the human condition there's a demon behind him dancing he's like oh

178
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,340
 we're gonna have a fun time when you're in hell as an adult dog but anyways you

179
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,660
 as babies dance everyone has some sense of rhythm to them far the human

180
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,020
 condition but I've also heard that Lucifer is the angel of music like all

181
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,260
 music comes from Satan even Christian music I actually want to do a little

182
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,740
 more research on that I might do a that is a topic one of these days because

183
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,580
 it's fascinating anyways this part of hell is the musical part of hell but

184
00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:02,580
 it's demons singing the songs and you're trapped there and you have to listen to

185
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:10,020
 demons sing these songs all the time I mean this is a dog walking around on

186
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,180
 hot coals for the rest of time

187
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:19,500
 sitting there listening to music you're like okay this is bad but it's not that

188
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,900
 bad you're pointing out of that guy he names here's the problem I remember my

189
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,860
 dad said this my dad's Southern Baptist minister growing up he goes don't ever

190
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,820
 describe heaven or hell he goes most religions don't really go into detail

191
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,260
 with the afterlife because the thing is is it gets outdated really really

192
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,660
 quickly if you had a religion today if Southern Baptists were using the

193
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:50,860
 definition of heaven based on statements made in 30 AD it would be

194
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,380
 completely outdated it would be stuff like you'll sit there and you'll see wheat

195
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,260
 fields as far as the eye can see and all of the all of in date trees you could

196
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,660
 ever imagine people now I don't want any of that stuff I'm glue I have a gluten

197
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,220
 intolerance and I hate olives so you can't really go into detail of what

198
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,660
 heaven and hell is because they did the terms just become outdated and I think

199
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,460
 that's the thing here too you can detail hell and you can go there's a satanic

200
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:27,220
 symphony there to punish people specifically who listen to secular

201
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,940
 music on earth and didn't listen to music that uplifted God's message so now

202
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,140
 they're trapped here but he names the songs like if you just leave it at that

203
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,900
 you're like oh that'd be horrible to hear a bunch of demons your horrific

204
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:48,180
 cacophony of guttural noises no they're actually singing don't worry be happy

205
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,540
 what you imagine would get kind of old after the one billionth time don't worry

206
00:17:53,540 --> 00:18:00,260
 be happy and apparently also Rihanna's song umbrella which has long been rumored

207
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:08,060
 to be a love song written to Lucifer to begin with but I mean like that it's

208
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,580
 just for the novelty alone right it would be like going to see like the

209
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,620
 Chuck E cheese band do their version of like a virgin by Madonna right just the

210
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,620
 novelty of it sure it's gonna sound terrible but it would be something you

211
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,340
 could say it was so weird I went to check your cheese the other night they were

212
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:31,380
 playing like a virgin you're like what so that's that's it was all that he could

213
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,060
 tell us about hell he might have other stuff that truly is indescribable he it

214
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,560
 was like a very short tiktok video and he says just talking about it makes his

215
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,020
 nauseous oh I guess I should wrap up this story I was like oh and he's still in

216
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,060
 hell to this day he's tiktok in room hell he said that while he's in hell and

217
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,380
 he's listening to this horrific music he's like no no Bob McFerrin what have

218
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,060
 you done to my soul he starts to get really mad at God and he's like God I

219
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:01,420
 was your servant on earth why did you send me to hell and God reaches down and

220
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,100
 picks him up and is pulling him out of hell and he goes I thought this was

221
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,220
 interesting because this this is true I think for everybody he goes you did good

222
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:18,580
 stuff but you hated your enemies not only did you hate your enemies you in

223
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:25,220
 your heart wished that I would punish them you wanted divine eternal

224
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,180
 punishment against people who had simply wronged you over on the galactic scale

225
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,420
 fairly minor things you're not on earth to wish my punishment upon other people

226
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:42,340
 I've forgiven you if you can't forgive them then you are you truly forgiven

227
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,300
 because basically like a life lesson and brought back to life he said go forth

228
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:56,020
 and tell the tiktokers what happened here it's an interesting story I think

229
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,860
 he had some experience I'm not saying that he's making it up or he's a fraud or

230
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,300
 anything like that I think you probably did have some sort of experience they do

231
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
 have negative non-death experiences I just thought it was fascinating one that

232
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,820
 you had a man of the cloth get thrown to hell and then also just like yeah I

233
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,380
 feel like that hell was a little underwhelming I guess I just thought it

234
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,740
 was going to be there's gonna be like more pizzazz or something like that or

235
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,740
 even just scarier right what would be scarier to you you die that's already

236
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,300
 terrifying quit couldn't mention he that's sometimes we're all gonna die you

237
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:40,420
 die and then you find yourself walking on all fours you're on fire your skin's

238
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,060
 been seared off and there's a demon has at least around your neck now again some

239
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,660
 of you guys you're like you like that stuff you're totally into it what's

240
00:20:47,660 --> 00:21:00,940
 scarier though that or you die and it's pitch black you can't see anything I

241
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,500
 think you guys know where this is going like imagine it's in the pitch black

242
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,060
 forget being able to see other stuff because then you can be like hey Johnny

243
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,380
 you see he's being treated like a pony a demon's riding them you're like that

244
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,900
 guy's way way worse off than I am I'm just walking that guy has a demon on his

245
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,540
 back you're pitch black you think you're all alone there's no one around you and

246
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,300
 like your skin is falling off you can actually feel it melting off of you and

247
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,820
 you're trying to keep it out of your mouth and out of your eyes and stuff like

248
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:35,060
 that and you're just like screaming and then okay I'll just stop it's like it

249
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:41,300
 is going for another five minutes I was like and then the maggots you can feel

250
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,380
 the last meal you ate before you died rotting in your dead corpse of a stomach

251
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:53,660
 and then the maggots are like filling you up you're like that's what that's

252
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,980
 what hell that's what I would imagine hell was like right you can feel your

253
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:06,300
 body decaying in the grave and then okay I just thought there'd be more

254
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:13,100
 bizarre if hell is just people walking on all fours listening to bad pop songs

255
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:23,820
 that's not that's not too bad that's not between bursting in the darkness your

256
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,140
 body just being exposed the elements is millions of maggots hatch it comes

257
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,440
 out of your inner and sore listening to don't worry be happy I think I think

258
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,500
 father Jerry Johnson had I think his hell is probably better

259
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,300
 Tashauna let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonic after we're leaving

260
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,180
 behind hell we have a new pets we have this don't bring them on the helicopter

261
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:57,060
 I don't want to save his eyes are bulging out we're gonna save this guy

262
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,220
 we're taking this guy out of hell Tashauna fly us out of hell we're gonna

263
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:13,100
 head all the way out to a house in the suburbs so we're walking out of the

264
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,180
 carbonicopter and we see this house looks like every other house in the area

265
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,900
 we don't have a location for this story we don't really have a time period as

266
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,020
 well or names this was posted online by someone going by the name emotional

267
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:33,180
 crests one two seven two we're gonna go ahead and call her Carla one day Carla

268
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:40,340
 sitting at home alone with her stepdad we're gonna call him Tony now Tony's the

269
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,340
 stepdad he's a relatively recent addition to this family he's been with

270
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,900
 him for a couple years you have Tony you have Carla you have Carla's mom Carla's

271
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:57,380
 little brother that was the family unit for years until Tony showed up and they've

272
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,300
 gotten married at this point Carla and Tony Tony and the mom have got married at

273
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,740
 this point and he's officially part of the family and they're making it work

274
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,180
 they're really making it work but one day mom's gone little brother's gone it's

275
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,420
 just Tony and Carla sitting on a couch watching television watching a movie

276
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,260
 middle of the movie Tony goes you want to hear something just crazy like I've

277
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,180
 told your mom about this and I don't really think she believed it that much

278
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:36,940
 or I don't know I don't know but this story is insane this story is so crazy

279
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:42,300
 now who's gonna turn down an offer like that right you're sitting at home alone

280
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,540
 with someone and they go hey you want to hear something insane Carla goes sure

281
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:54,020
 yeah what do you got for me Tony says when I was a boy I was a boy this is

282
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,740
 long before I met your mom long before you and your brother were even born

283
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:13,860
 really when I was a boy I had a nightmare I woke up into the dream and I

284
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,060
 walked through the house wasn't the house that I lived in as a boy never been

285
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:23,780
 there before I walked through this house and I find myself in the bathroom of

286
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,420
 that house

287
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:36,300
 and in this bathroom there's a witch or it's to be more specific a witchy

288
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,980
 looking woman that's how he really described it was a woman who looked

289
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,140
 like a witch but I'm standing in this bathroom and there's this witch standing

290
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:51,460
 there and she's laughing maniacally and he goes Carla this is the weird thing I

291
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:58,340
 had that dream and it's terrified me so much I remembered the exact details

292
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,900
 about the bathroom including the pattern of the bathroom tiles on the floor like

293
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:09,820
 it terrified me I thought about that dream for years and years went by and I

294
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:16,300
 started dating your mom you remember that old house you guys lived in the house

295
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,980
 you guys lived in when me and your mom started dating Carlos like yeah I

296
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:26,980
 remember that Tony goes I remember the first time I came over to that house when

297
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:33,660
 I went into the bathroom of that house that was the bathroom from my dream it

298
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:42,020
 was the exact same bathroom I saw years before I even met your mom long before

299
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:48,020
 you two were even born I had this dream that I was in the bathroom at your old

300
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,500
 house Carlos like that is insane that's an insane story like what are the

301
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,380
 chances of that where you like seeing the future coincidence like how many

302
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:04,940
 different layouts of bathrooms can you have that is quite odd Tony goes that's

303
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:12,100
 not the insane part Tony said when I was a kid I had this dream that I walked

304
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:19,420
 into a bathroom bathroom that I didn't recognize until years later when I swung

305
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,700
 by your old house had a dream that I was in this bathroom and inside the bathroom

306
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:32,420
 was a witchy-looking woman laughing maniacally and the bathtub in that

307
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:42,620
 bathroom was filled to the brim with blood and I look into that bathtub and

308
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:54,860
 floating in the bathtub of blood was three severed human heads

309
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:07,020
 the witchy woman is cackling her laugh is echoing through this small bathroom

310
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:15,660
 as I'm looking down at these three heads floating in a pool of blood now when I

311
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:23,420
 had that dream as a young boy I didn't know who those three heads belong to but

312
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:35,540
 eventually years later I recognized them they were the heads of your mother your

313
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,620
 brother and you

314
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:47,460
 Tony said I never told you guys that story I didn't even tell your mom that

315
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,020
 story as long as you guys lived at that old house never told you because I

316
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:58,220
 figured it would terrify you freak out right but since we've moved I've told

317
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,780
 your mom now I've told you wait for the little brother to come home I'll tell him

318
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:08,060
 to you guys I've told your mother I've told you I don't know what it means

319
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:13,820
 really it's just a horrifying nightmare I knew exactly the bathroom that I saw

320
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,100
 in my dream when I walked into in real life and then one day dawns on me I

321
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,980
 recognized those heads it was you guys

322
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:32,140
 Carla said she goes I did end up asking my mom if she had ever heard this story

323
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:41,060
 and the mom responded yeah he told me about that but didn't seem to offer any

324
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:48,740
 other sort of read on how she felt about the situation was she concerned did she

325
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,780
 brush it off did she think he was joking and that's the other thing Carla goes she

326
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:59,140
 goes I don't know if he's messing with me like he could just be making this up

327
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,780
 to push my buttons I mean you know everyone wants to be a severed head in

328
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,180
 a bloody bathtub is he making it up to push my buttons if that's the case why

329
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,460
 would he tell my mom about it did he make it up as a joke did he make it up to

330
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:21,180
 scare me or is it real and she goes really either way it's terrifying like

331
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,300
 if he's just joking it's a pretty terrifying joke but if he's telling the

332
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:36,180
 truth it's a fascinating story right there's some key details missing again

333
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,980
 we don't know really the age that he had the dream was he like seven doesn't

334
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:47,060
 matter if he's seven or 27 the fact is he had a premonition it's interesting

335
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,340
 because it's half of a premonition right he was able to visit a bathroom that he

336
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,560
 wouldn't see until the future he was able to recognize the severed heads in the

337
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,260
 blood that he wouldn't meet until the future but he hasn't chopped off their

338
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,620
 heads so it was a premonition of something that just some of the details

339
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,500
 were real but what's interesting about this story I read this was posted online

340
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 and kind of the kind of the gist I was getting from Carla was this is really

341
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:29,300
 creepy but at least we don't live there anymore so the danger has passed other

342
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,620
 than the fact that you may have a stepdad who if he's joking is telling a

343
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:38,700
 terrible joke it's actually kind of funny if he's joking but you know to the kid

344
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,540
 we don't know how old she is either but the idea I guess kind of is that the

345
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,660
 dangers past and even he felt like that like he did not tell him about this while

346
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:55,580
 they stayed at that old house he waited until they moved on and now I listen

347
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,820
 let's look at the story from his point of view I'm sure he was absolutely

348
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:05,100
 terrified when he first had the nightmare but then meeting a woman and joining

349
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,900
 her family and becoming part of that family and having that image in the

350
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,580
 back of your head that you saw their bloodied heads float around in a bathtub

351
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,740
 full of blood you're like do you take her I do and then you go to kiss the

352
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,660
 bride it's like you're just imagining a severed head with a bridal veil on like

353
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,740
 did he have flashbacks to this the kids are like let's go to the water park he's

354
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:34,460
 like no no it's red dye day at the water park they should totally do that when

355
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,780
 they just put red dye everywhere my point is is though is his point of view

356
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:43,980
 once they moved out of the house he probably figured the threat was gone

357
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,700
 whatever it was right was he the one who chopped their heads off did the witchy

358
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,780
 woman chop their heads off was it symbolic was it literal it doesn't matter

359
00:32:53,780 --> 00:33:01,100
 we don't live there anymore the danger has passed but has it it's not like that

360
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,900
 house was blown to smithereens it's not like the new owner came in and did a

361
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:13,460
 complete remodel on the bathroom they just moved out that same house from that

362
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:20,140
 dream may be sitting there bathroom completely untouched just because they

363
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,460
 don't live in the house anymore doesn't mean the premonition won't come true

364
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:33,820
 just means it didn't come true then was the dream a warning of something that

365
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:40,540
 could happen to this family once he entered their lives and more terrifying

366
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:49,340
 is this dream a warning of what he himself may do to this family if you had

367
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:59,060
 that dream and then years later you met that family in real life would you ever

368
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:05,420
 let your guard down because on the one hand it could be that this family was

369
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:11,460
 butchered by a third party but on the other hand there's such a layer of

370
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:17,340
 malevolence to this story that it almost seems like Tony himself is the

371
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:26,500
 murderer I don't know why I get that feeling but I feel that that's what this

372
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:35,500
 story is describing this young boy is not seeing the work of some maniac well

373
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:44,740
 he is but he's the maniac everything about it just feels so deeply personal

374
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:54,580
 and the threat has not passed this is a prophetic dream the threat has not

375
00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:01,660
 passed if anything it's become more of a reality because now Tony is a part of

376
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:13,780
 the family forever I'm not saying Tony is a murderer I'm not saying Tony has

377
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:21,220
 these dark thoughts when he's sitting with his family I'm not saying that

378
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:31,300
 someday Tony is gonna slaughter his wife and his two stepchildren not saying

379
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:40,620
 any of that but if it did happen that's the kind of dark and evil twist ending

380
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:48,060
 that would cause a witch to cackle with glee

381
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:58,220
