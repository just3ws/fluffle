1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What happens when aliens make first contact with someone who has radical beliefs?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we take a look at the story of a young nurse simply going about her day.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But after she treats a burn patient, the next seven months become a tale of demonic possession, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a safe and fun Halloween.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We did do the Halloween livestream on YouTube and then the next day I did a follow up to it as well.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Those are both available on the YouTube channel. I'm not gonna put them as podcast episodes. The audio quality's not up to snuff.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 If someone was listening to the podcast for the first time and discovered those, they're gonna be like, "That's weird."

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Why does he keep, why are there long sections of him just silence? Because I'm dodging cars or I'm pointing at something in the distance that people can see.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So if you want to check those out, you can check out the YouTube videos. So that is that.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And now we're gonna go ahead and get started with the episode. So oh no, no, no, no, we're not.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We got two patrons, two new patrons. Thank you guys, thank you very much for all of this.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 First one is Jen vs. Infinity, the long time listener of the show. She's been listening to it for quite a while.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I see her pop up in the comments fairly regularly. So thank you very much, Jen.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Secondly, we have Moonman. Moonman. He didn't add all the extra O's I did, but Moonman.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So thank you Moon, thank you Jen, Jen vs.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And let's go ahead and get started with the episode. Really appreciate the patronage.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And if you can't support the show via Patreon, that's okay. Just get the word out about the show. Really, really helps a lot.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Let's go ahead and hop into Jason. Let's hop into the carboner copter actually. We haven't used this in a while.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 No, we haven't used the dead rabbit dirgeable in a while. Get on board the dead rabbit dirgeable. You're like, dang it.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I wanted to ride on the copter. I'm like, nope, it's my show. It's my ride. I don't know why all of a sudden I'm Rosco P. Co-Train.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Or any Southerner, really. Get on. Come on, hurry up. Get on the dirgeable. We're taking off.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Now we're going to fly from Oregon. We're flying out to Pennsylvania, right?

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 The year is 2017 and we're going to land in this big field. That noise was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom again.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I don't know what a dirgeable sounds like. That's the wind. We just poke a little hole in it slowly deflates.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 We land, takes about an hour to get, move the dirgeable balloon out of the way. We crawl out.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And I'm like, you know you're going to pump that back up, right? You're like, dang it.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But we're there and we're in the middle of a field and there's a bunch of like, Mufon scientists, researchers, collaborators, standing in this field late at night.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Now Mufon stands for the Mutual UFO Network, which I don't know if you can have an acronym and an acronym.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Mufon should be Mutual Unidentified Flying Object Network. I don't think you can have, just add a letter at the beginning and end of an existing acronym.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Like what's a real acronym? Like laser, which is light amplification system, eradicates, radicals, whatever.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And then you just can't add a G on it and be, oh we're laser. We're good laser. No, it doesn't work that way. I don't think so at least.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 So anyways, when everyone's just standing staring at me in the field, they're like, dude why are you going off on this rant about Mufon?

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Look, there's a UFO descending out of the night sky. It's like, oh yeah, that's way more important. Does it have any lasers on it?

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 It's all, this UFO is landing, right? Now the door opens up. This alien walks out.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Walks out all like noble prints. I don't even know what that means. He's strutting a bit, I guess he walks out.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Now, in this group of scientists and collaborate, I don't know why I'm using the word "collaborate" in this group of scientists and researchers and stuff like that.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 One of them, his name is John Ventray. John Ventray, he is the president or the CEO of the, he's the state director of the Pennsylvania branch of Mufon.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 He's who he is, as Jason looks at his notes and he walks up to this alien and he extends his hand and he says, "Now just so we're not confused, just so we're not confused about the next five minutes of what I'm about to say,

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 this didn't actually happen. Obviously we're not there. A UFO did not land in Pennsylvania and John Ventray did not shake his hand and no one walked princely.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 But John Ventray is a state director of the Pennsylvania Mufon. It's a real organization and they're dedicated to finding proof of aliens and contacting them and all sorts of stuff.

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So he didn't say this to an alien directly. He wrote this on Facebook. He wrote the following, what am I about to say, he wrote the following on Facebook.

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 But I want you to imagine him saying it's when alien, because this guy's job was to research this stuff. Are aliens real? Are there more advanced civilizations out there? Is there someone or something trying to make contact with us?

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 It is a weighty responsibility to try to contact other beings. You really just don't let anyone become a priest or minister or rabbi or what are the other ones called?

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Clarek, well and whatever the other swamis or whatever. Anyway, the point is, you usually have to go through some sort of training because basically you're talking to gods and ghosts and spirits, right?

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 You don't want your aunt doing it and when your aunt does it, she's messing around with a Ouija board and the next thing you know she's killing your cat.

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 They have to have some semblance of training because they're talking to deities or trying to interpret the word of deities or just you know whatever. So you don't want just anybody in charge of the Pennsylvania move on.

48
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Because what if these guys are the first people to meet aliens is what this whole setup is. So I'm getting at, okay. Here we are. He's getting ready to shake this dude's hand and John Ventre says this.

49
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Netflix announced the new anti-white show Dear White People that promotes white genocide. I canceled my account. Do the same.

50
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Shake and shake and this alien, aliens looking nervous. Like what is this guy talking about? He continues, I don't find this funny.

51
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 The last thing blacks want is for white males to organize and that's not too far away. White males are the absolute target of the government with illegal affirmative action and at this point me and you are looking at each other in the field and we're like what in the world is going on here?

52
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I'm looking at you and you're looking at me and everyone is super nervous but John Ventre, he's on a roll dude. He at this point he pulls out a literal soap box, gets on top of it while shaking his hand the whole time which violates the 14th amendment and the Supreme Court refuses to hear the case because they know it does.

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 The media also attacks us constantly, constantly with interracial couples in every show and commercial and we're like oh no dude, can this get any worse?

54
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 At this point other aliens are kind of poking their head out of the ship and they're like what's going on? What's taking this so long? This is usually pretty like take me to your leader. Why is our alien leader blushing?

55
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 How? We didn't even know our species could get embarrassed. John Ventre continues, the media also attacks us constantly with interracial couples in every show and commercial and portraying white males as incompetent.

56
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Everything this world is was created by Europeans and Americans. Not the fact that Americans are technically Europeans really if you go far enough back but it was created by Europeans and Americans, effing blacks.

57
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Okay, do not grab, do not take this audio clip and just be like dead rabbit radio is totally racist. This is the voice of John Ventre. We're not even, we're almost done and it gets worse.

58
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 We're almost done and it's not even as bad as it's going to get.

59
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 But let's go ahead and let's do the coup de gras here. So John Ventre is writing this and he's also telling this alien leader and we're just like oh my gosh, first contact dude this is really bad.

60
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 He goes, effing blacks didn't even have a calendar, a wheel or a numbering system until the Brits showed up.

61
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And you and I look at each other and we're like okay well that was bad but it could have been a whole lot and then he continues. Google serotonin by race, IQ by race and violent crime by race and then compare that to the effing message the media portrays.

62
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Time to turn off the TVs.

63
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Now the reason why I'm covering this story is for a couple of reasons. The main one though, I think it's funny, I think it's funny that somebody who actually like is trying to find more advanced races in the galaxy is a racist.

64
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 I find that bizarre, I find that very very bizarre because what happens when the aliens start googling IQ by species and humans are the lowest on the alien scale and they're like what, they didn't even have hyperdrive till we showed up.

65
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Those backward but so that's weird in and of itself but really alien UFO mythology all that stuff it's kind of broken down into two overarching myths.

66
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Either one, the aliens out there are preparing to go to war with us humanity and it's us versus them.

67
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 It's humans versus the evil alien empires, reptilians and their workers and the grays and they're abducting us and we are a global community.

68
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Or there is a universal brotherhood out there of alien species that want us to join their brotherhood and elevate us psychically and spiritually and the powers that be the Illuminati, Deep State whatever you want to call them are keeping us from contacting these aliens.

69
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Both of those are completely incompatible with the statement Google IQ by race.

70
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Both of those, what happens, Independence Day did not have them all flying around and then who was the dude, not Steve Gutenberg, Jeff Goldblum.

71
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 The end of that movie was not Jeff Goldblum making the virus and getting in the ship, he's like okay we're gonna fly the ship in, we're gonna take care of this and it's Will Smith getting in the ship too.

72
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 He's like whoa no no no, we got a white pilot, where's the president?

73
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Can we get someone in here? Anyone?

74
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I googled him, I googled his IQ guys and all the scientists are like it's the only one we got and he's like I hope you're one of the good ones.

75
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Completely incompatible with any overarching UFO myth.

76
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Now obviously if someone's just racist, if some guy's just racist on the street corner I'm like what, how are we supposed to fight the aliens together?

77
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Because he's just gonna think I'm crazier than he is. But when someone is the head of a state chapter of a UFO investigation group and actively dislikes or I would go so far as to say hates black people, right?

78
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 He got triggered by this television show and now he actually is like telling people that they're not like us.

79
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It was basically the first part you can say whatever, maybe the show's anti-white, I don't know anything about the show. I've never watched the show, never watched the movie, I'm vaguely aware of the controversy surrounding it.

80
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 But by the end of that it's basically it's us versus them, it's where that email or that Facebook post goes.

81
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 It's incompatible with any belief in aliens or UFOology. It is so bizarre to me to think that someone can share both the belief in hope that humanity is not alone in the universe, that there are other species out there.

82
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Either looking to help us achieve greatness or attack us and we have to unite together to fight them.

83
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And at the same time completely dismiss an entire ethnic group, an entire race of people.

84
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I find that as bizarre as a story like Mormon Bigfoot, to be honest, that you could hold both beliefs at the same time and not see the irony in it.

85
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Humanity must unite except for those billion people.

86
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Humanity will ascend to the next spiritual level except for those guys. No blacks allowed on the mothership.

87
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Which is basically kind of ironic since that's what, damn it, that joke fell apart. What's that guy's name? George Clinton, dang it!

88
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I'm keeping that one in. But anyways, George Clinton's mothership parliament, funk, funkadelic, geez, Jason.

89
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 My point is, I find the idea that someone could hold these two beliefs at the same time just as bizarre as so much of the other stuff that we cover.

90
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Because to me it's completely incompatible. He still works there, by the way. And I'm not going to get into cancel culture or all that stuff, but they lost, so he got fired and then came back as a volunteer and it still does a bunch of the same stuff.

91
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And they lost a ton of people. They go, "I do not want to work with an organization that supports this dude. That's repugnant beliefs. I'm not going to support it."

92
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And that's where we're at right now. And you have a guy who's looking up at the night sky for other races, but can't even consider to embrace his own species that's standing right next to him.

93
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Absolutely bizarre. Absolutely bizarre, I believe. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story, though.

94
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Next story, we're going to leave behind a creepy mind and delve into a creepy...what rhymes with mind?

95
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Not what rhymes with mind, but what rhymes with mind and is relevant to the story. We're going to leave behind a creepy...clospital and end up in a creepy hospital. A "clospital" is a slang term for a field in Pennsylvania.

96
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Bet you didn't know that. You learned something today, right? We're going to a hospital in...let's see where is this at. Arkansas!

97
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It's actually in a place called Seer Sea Arkansas, or...Cirkey Arkansas. Now I'm going to say if it is Seer Sea Arkansas, it's kind of creepy.

98
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Because Seer Sea was that woman who turned dudes into pigs back in the day. That story...I know I'm talking about this all the time.

99
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 It terrifies me stories where people turn into stuff they don't want to. Technically turning into stuff...I mean it's not like a boy turns into a man.

100
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And he could be like, "But if I don't want to grow up, that doesn't scare me. I don't want to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us Kid. That's Song of the Moon. No!"

101
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 So just let him stay a boy. It's turning into other species or inanimate objects. And I'm always wondering where I got that fear from.

102
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I talked before about that Doctor Who episode that apparently I made up. I remember it vividly, but no one else remembers it about all the Doctor Who's got together.

103
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 This was like in the 80s. All the Doctor Who's got together and fought some bad guy. He got turned into a statue, but he was still alive. That scared me.

104
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Willow scared me when that witch turned everyone into a pig. That really terrified me.

105
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 The story of Seercy on the island of the Greek island. I think it was Jason in the Argonauts. Maybe in the past life I was Jason and I saw all my buddies get turned into pigs.

106
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 But I don't know what childhood trauma I had. Maybe I'm not really a human. Maybe I used to be a puppy and I got magically transformed into a human.

107
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I don't know. That is just as viable as any of those other ones. But for whatever reason I hate it when people get turned in.

108
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 It has nothing to do with the story I'm about to tell, by the way. Just the fact that the city is named Seercy, Arkansas.

109
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I should see if I can find stories about people turned into stuff. I can stir will, but then I realized I don't live in fairy tales so that might actually be impossible.

110
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 I was feed 10 people who turned into animals with photos. So it's November 2006. We're in Seercy, Arkansas.

111
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 There's a young woman there named Amy Stamatis. She's laying in a hospital bed. Beep, beep, beep. That's not a bus backing up.

112
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 That's her little heart rate monitor. Beep, beep. And apparently needs to be tuned. Beep, beep. And she's just sitting there kind of like, uhhhh.

113
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 She's not a zombie. She's not a zombie. She's just not doing too well. She's paralyzed from the waist down.

114
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And even though she can't move her legs, she keeps having these dark, intrusive thoughts. She ended up in the hospital bed. Former nurse, by the way.

115
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So it's possible that when she was like, "Oh, I know this room. Many a patient have been in this room. I've been in this room many times before."

116
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Or it could be a toilet for hospitals and the ones she worked at. I'm not for sure. But former nurse now paralyzed from the waist down.

117
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 She was sitting on a window sill, right? And she's just enjoying the sun, hoping it would wash out the dark, intrusive thoughts in her head.

118
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 And then all of a sudden she fell and hit the pavement and broke her back. Broke a bunch of ribs. And when they found her, her arms and her legs weren't broken.

119
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And she didn't try to brace for impact. Which almost seems impossible. Like, I get it. People kill themselves. Unfortunately, they do it all the time.

120
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 But usually, even when they jump, they're like, "That was bad." Like, usually the people who survived the suicide attempts for a while go, "Whew."

121
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 That wasn't fun. And then depending on other factors that are going on, they either never do it again or they keep committing suicide or keep attempting to commit suicide until they die.

122
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Not even a natural reaction to put her arms out or to try to put her legs out. She falls and smashes her back.

123
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 She says, "I didn't jump. I didn't jump." As they're loading her into the ambulance at the scene, "Something pushed me. I swear I didn't jump."

124
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Now, I don't know why she turned into Clint Eastwood from Gran Torino after the accident, but apparently that is the case.

125
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 So now she's in the hospital and she's trying to make sense of what's happened in her life.

126
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 April 2006, so seven months earlier, Amy is a happy-go-lucky young nurse. She's dancing around the hospital.

127
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 She didn't get a lot of work done. She's too busy dancing. You know, the way that it works, they're like, "Amy, get back to work."

128
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 She's like, "I'm having a feeling. I'm making up a song so I don't get a copyright violation."

129
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And she's dancing through the hospital, right? She's doing a little shuffle. I need to have a dead rabbit dance.

130
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Anyway, she's dancing. She's doing a little moonwalking through. She's bumping into other nurses who are doing their job.

131
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 They're like, "Ahh!" They get stuck with a bunch of needles. They're carrying a tray full of fentanyl, injected fentanyl.

132
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And she bumps into one. They're like, "Ugh!" That would be actually a pretty funny movie or a scene, a funny scene in a movie.

133
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 If the whole movie was just her bumping into people. Nah.

134
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But I could watch a scene in a comedy. Farley Brothers hit me up. I got hilarious jokes that involve opioids.

135
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Anyways, to the point... This is a really grim story, actually.

136
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 The point is, is that she's in the hospital. She's having the time of her life. And they go, "Amy, Amy."

137
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Karma the frog apparently wears to the hospital. "Amy, Amy Statmitus."

138
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 "Go to the emergency room. We got a patient for you to move."

139
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Because, you know, usually they call nurses over the loudspeakers.

140
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 So Amy goes down to the emergency room and there's a burn victim there. And they're like, "Can you put this guy in a room?"

141
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 "Can you take care of this guy? Put him in a room." A hospital room may have to be specific.

142
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Last time she just wheeled him out across the way, left him in someone's apartment. She's like, "Oh yeah, hospital room."

143
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 So she wheels him through the hospital. She's dancing the whole time. The bed's rocking. She's surfing on the bed.

144
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 She gets to the room. She gets to the room, right?

145
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 So she gets to the room, she's taking care of him. And then she's on the other side of the hospital.

146
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 She's like, "What?" She kind of thinks, "What? How did I... Wait, what? How did I get here?"

147
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And she's kind of like looking around. It's not a wing of the hospital she normally goes to.

148
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 It's definitely not the wing of the hospital she was just in. She finds herself standing in the hospital.

149
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And she starts to try to remember. She goes, "I remember leaving his room and then I just walked around."

150
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Like, just started making loops around the hospital, walking all over the hospital.

151
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 But why? I don't even remember doing that. Like, I vaguely remember doing that.

152
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And I must have done that because I'm here. But I just don't get it.

153
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 This is one of her quotes after this.

154
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 "After I took care of him, my mind went out the window. I was just blank."

155
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 This was actually her final day at the hospital. She could not go to work after this.

156
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 She could not concentrate at all.

157
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 She felt like her brain was actively rebelling against her. She couldn't even do simple tasks.

158
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Talking about like brushing your teeth. Like, it was basically like she went into the room with the burn victim,

159
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 a normal person, and came out someone who was suffering some form of mental disability.

160
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 A permanent brain fog had come over her.

161
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 She also was physically fit. She was a marathon runner. That was her hobby.

162
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 She loved seeing something 26.5 miles away and saying, "I'm gonna get there. Watch me go."

163
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Now she can barely walk. Now she can't because she's paralyzed.

164
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 But before she gets paralyzed, she was having a hard time moving in a straight line.

165
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So she starts going to the hospital and they are running test after test after test.

166
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And they're like, "Obviously something's wrong with you."

167
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 But we don't know what it is. So they say, "We're gonna give you this antipsychotic medicine.

168
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 We're gonna give you this medicine. We're gonna give you that medicine."

169
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 They're trying to figure out what it is. They don't know if it's all in her head.

170
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 They don't know if she has some sort of muscle disease.

171
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But whatever it is, it's acting incredibly fast.

172
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 She says, "I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown."

173
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And the doctor's like, "Well, let's go that route."

174
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So that's when they start giving her all of these medications to try to get her back to normal.

175
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And nothing is working at all. And now she's hearing voices in her head.

176
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And they won't go away.

177
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Now she's married. Her loved ones are concerned. Her friends are concerned.

178
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 She ends up going to a big party with her in-laws.

179
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 In the middle of the party, starts taking her clothes off.

180
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 People are like, "Amy, what are you doing? Why are you..."

181
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 I don't know if she was laughing like the Joker.

182
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 But she was definitely taking her clothes off. That was true.

183
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And she was volatile. She would get angry at the drop of a hat.

184
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 She went back to visit some friends of the hospital and just started flipping out on them.

185
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And it kind of culminated in her husband taking her to Michigan to go to the Mayo Clinic.

186
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And while she was there, she broke free from the doctors. She takes off running.

187
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 She goes up a giant parking garage, like a parking structure.

188
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Gets to the eighth store and threatens to jump to the point where the police had to show up

189
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 and them and the husband had to talk her off of the ledge.

190
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 So it wasn't like she was just up there going, "I'm going to jump."

191
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And the doctor's like, "Don't do it."

192
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And she's like, "Yeah, I guess I won't."

193
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It went on long enough that there was a place presence and they had to do all that stuff.

194
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 So you go, "Well, that's interesting because in November 2006,

195
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 he told me she fell out of a window.

196
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 She had already climbed to a height to threaten to kill herself."

197
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 But she didn't kill herself or she didn't jump off the parking structure.

198
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 That definitely would have killed her.

199
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And two, she swore still that she did not jump out of that window. She got pushed.

200
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 So now we're standing, it's November. We're all caught up with the story.

201
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 It's November 2006.

202
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 We are standing in the hospital room of Amy.

203
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 We're wearing our big old lab coats.

204
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It's me and you, got Moonman.

205
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I think he's actually getting into the sharps cabinet and getting some needles.

206
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And then Jen versus Infinity is there as well.

207
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 She's actually the supervising doctor. She's making sure I do my job right.

208
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And I'm kind of nervous. I keep looking at her.

209
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 But anyways, and then I'm like Moonman, dude, that's fentanyl. Don't inject that.

210
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I had a friend who did that.

211
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I had a friend who used to break into sharp containers and...

212
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 There, I mean, there's doing drugs and then there's doing half used drugs from other people who are dying.

213
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Like, blech.

214
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Anyways, I love her. She's a really good friend of mine.

215
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 But talk about risky, dude.

216
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Anyways, so the point is, you guys are all looking at me as I'm taking notes.

217
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Moonman's putting the sharps container back down.

218
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 He's like, "Yeah, that is kind of disgusting."

219
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And I was like, "It is, isn't it?"

220
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And Jen's just kind of shaking her head.

221
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 The fact that I repeal that as I'm a doctor.

222
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Anyways, the point is, is that we are in a room and I go...

223
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 So I'm sure you guys are all thinking that this is some sort of medical story.

224
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I think you guys are thinking that this is something involving medicine.

225
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 But it's not.

226
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Watch this.

227
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And I point to the door.

228
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And right when I point to the door, a couple people walk in.

229
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And you're like, "Whoa, it's almost like he knew what was coming.

230
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 It's almost like he read an article on this."

231
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Cindy Lawson walks in with a church group.

232
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Amy, Amy's church group.

233
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 This isn't just some random roaming church group like the Warriors.

234
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 They just move from hospital to hospital looking for converts.

235
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Amy's church group, they actually invited Cindy Lawson to show up.

236
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And she walks into the room and she looks at Amy.

237
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 And she sees surrounding this young broken woman, paralyzed from the waist down.

238
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Demons crawling around her.

239
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And now we see them too.

240
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Ah, la, la, la.

241
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Moving around.

242
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And Cindy Lawson is a exorcist for the Pentecostal church.

243
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And she walks up to Amy and she begins to question who's in there.

244
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 She basically goes right into exorcism mode.

245
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And she starts to use the name of Jesus to drive the demons out of her.

246
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Drive the demons out of Amy.

247
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And Amy said she started to feel almost an immediate kind of relief

248
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 that Jesus was now in this room with her.

249
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And they continued to do this exorcism.

250
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 It wasn't a full on like your baby's rotten hell exorcism stuff spinning around.

251
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Everyone's having to hold her down.

252
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 It was basically almost seemed like an informal like, "Hi, my name's Cindy.

253
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Demons leave Jesus's here."

254
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And the demons are like, "Oh, they just started running out."

255
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Very, very weak-willed demons.

256
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Which are good. The best kind of demons you want are the ones that will run away right away.

257
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 But Amy says that it worked.

258
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Amy says they'd been treating her for all of this stuff for so long

259
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 and they thought that she had this super rare neurological disease.

260
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 But once she had that little exorcism, when Cindy Lawson came into her life

261
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 she actually felt the voices go away and the intrusive thoughts leave.

262
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And now she says she's healthy both mentally and spiritually.

263
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Physically, still not doing that great.

264
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Because, you know, can't move from the waist down.

265
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 But there's two interesting things to this.

266
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 One, there's that old thing of how many people have mental illnesses

267
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 that could really be demonic possession.

268
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Or, to flip that, how many demonic possession stories in the past

269
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 were actually legitimate mental illnesses that people must stick for demons.

270
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 The second thing, and really the creepiest thing about the story,

271
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 whatever happened to the burned man?

272
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Like, I mean, I think the suggestion is that she wasn't involved

273
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 and she wasn't like, worshiping the dark forces.

274
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 She wasn't like, oh yeah, on all my breaks I played Charlie Charlie.

275
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 She seemed to be fairly normal in society.

276
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And then a man who was burned up shows up at the hospital.

277
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 She takes care of them.

278
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And then this nightmare begins.

279
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Where's the burned dude?

280
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 You know, I don't know, 250 episodes ago,

281
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 I did an episode about solar plexus clown gliders.

282
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Or the belief that there are demonic entities that can move from body to body

283
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 that can actually suck out your will to live.

284
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 A parasite, an interdimensional parasite.

285
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And I talked about an experience that I may have had with one of those things.

286
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Now, I'm not saying that's what she suffered from.

287
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 It seems like what she suffered from was far darker.

288
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 But it still does seem like some sort of parasite.

289
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 How did this guy get burned?

290
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Who was he? Where was he from?

291
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Was he also some happy-go-lucky guy just moving about life, doing his thing?

292
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And then something got attached to him.

293
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And then one day he woke up on the other side of town and he's like, how did I get here?

294
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 What am I doing here?

295
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 And then the thoughts began.

296
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 The voices got louder.

297
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And then he had an accident, burning his body up, landing him in the hospital.

298
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And at that point, whatever urged him to do those things, or to be put into those situations,

299
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 found a new victim, a young married nurse full of joy and life, and took over her existence.

300
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Maybe the exorcism didn't drive it away.

301
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Maybe it just wanted to leave anyways its target was taken out.

302
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 It had done what it wanted to.

303
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 It destroyed another life.

304
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 So if you're ever sick or injured, you need to go to the hospital.

305
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Make sure you don't go to one in Searcy, Arkansas.

306
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Because somewhere in that city is a hospital.

307
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And somewhere in that hospital is a room.

308
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And in that room is a malevolent force, just waiting to take over your body and destroy it.

309
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 It feeds on human life.

310
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 It feeds on human pain.

311
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And it's looking for its next meal.

312
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
