WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.080
 The world ends in the coolest way possible.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.960
 And then we take a look at the Gifted and Talented Education Program.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.360
 Some people say it's a program that helps young kids

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.960
 who are gifted and talented achieve their dreams.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.600
 Others say it's a twisted mind-scape used to control the future.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.120
 Today on Dead Ravver Radio.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.600
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.320
 Hey, everyone.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.960
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravver Radio.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.120
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.040
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.560
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.280
 It's the start of season 10.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.160
 It's crazy when this season's done.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.400
 We'll be at episode 500.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.960
 Isn't that crazy?

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.240
 We're just going to keep checking along, like a choo-choo train,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.600
 the conspiracy train.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.200
 How come I don't have a train?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.480
 If I ever come up with a train, the Carpenter Caboose?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.440
 We'll think about that.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.840
 But while we're thinking about that,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.720
 we've got to say thank you to one of our newest Patreon.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.360
 We got Caleb.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.760
 Caleb in the house.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.080
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.640
 Really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.040
 Let's get him on board that Carpenter Caboose.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.880
 That just sounds wrong, because the Caboose is the end, right?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.720
 Whatever.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.760
 We're a backwards train.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.120
 Let's hop on board the Carpenter Caboose, Caleb.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.280
 You are going to be piling in it.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.320
 You're like, "Dude, I can't see from back here."

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.400
 Yeah, yeah, you'll figure it out.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.280
 So anyways, as Caleb is shoveling coal

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.760
 into our brand new vehicle, the Carpenter Caboose,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.840
 we are headed out to Rostov-on-Don.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.880
 That's in Russia.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.240
 It's October 7th, 1989.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.320
 It's midnight.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.440
 There's like a full moon in the sky.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.600
 Don't look that up.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.800
 If you find out there's not a full moon on October 7th, 1989,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.240
 like in some sort of like National Geographic

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.080
 Farm Resolomon Act nonsense, don't even mouth me.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.800
 Just for visual, right?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.880
 Just for, you're like, "Jason, that's factually incorrect."

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.120
 Yeah, but it's a beautiful factually incorrect image.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.960
 Full moon.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.600
 I don't know why it's making wind noises,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.280
 but it's doing it.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.600
 That was in the Farm Resolomon Act.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.800
 Look that up.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.640
 Moon.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.880
 And there's a young woman named Valentina Boldina

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.840
 walking on the street.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.720
 She's walking on the street

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.360
 and she sees two glowing orbs.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.000
 Right now that's weird, right?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.280
 You don't expect to see orbs

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.840
 when you're leaving your place of work.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.240
 Unless you work at orbs arrest

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.840
 and you're like, "Bye orbs.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 Seize these orbs.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.760
 I don't know why you would be saying goodbye

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.200
 to the merchandise you sell.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.920
 No one's walking out of toys arrest me.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.920
 I'm like, "See you later, toys.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.960
 See you tomorrow.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.840
 I can't wait to sell more of you."

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.920
 And apparently you're Mickey Mouse as well

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.760
 in that scenario.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.160
 The little orbs are flying down.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.200
 Now one of the orbs turns into the shape of a human.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.080
 She's just like, "What in the world is going on?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.680
 I should not be walking around at night.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.520
 It's a midnight.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.680
 She's walking around the outskirts of the city.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.760
 She sees these two orbs.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.280
 One of them shapeshifts into a human.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.080
 And then the other orb just goes

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.960
 (imitates engine)

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.080
 and starts like shining lights on the human.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.200
 Weird.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.840
 She's bringing her own disco ball with you.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.280
 (imitates engine)

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.520
 And the humanoid is just standing there.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.960
 And then the other one's just (imitates engine)

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.160
 And that's the end of that.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.640
 That's not the end of the whole story,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.240
 but that's the end of that part of the story.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.520
 She just goes home.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.920
 Couple days later, she's at home.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.760
 She's laying in bed.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.680
 It's nighttime.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.480
 Now she's not ready to go to sleep,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.600
 but she's having a hard time with life in general.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.720
 Because ever since she saw that little impromptu disco show,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.080
 terrible splitting migraines has a hard time staying awake.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.680
 And then she's laying in bed and her lights go off.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.240
 Bedroom light, (imitates engine)

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.120
 all the lights in her house go off.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.360
 Now, she's probably like, "Oh, this is great.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.320
 "I'm already super sick.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.840
 "I can't stay awake.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.760
 "I can't stay awake.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.920
 "I'm like all lethargic, my head's splitting.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.320
 "And now I gotta go and I gotta screw in a bunch of light bulbs,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.800
 "check the fuse box and stuff like that.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.000
 "My life stinks."

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.080
 But before she can really start to think about that,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.880
 there's a huge crash of lightning outside her house.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.440
 But no sound.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.360
 No sound.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.680
 There's just a big bright light going,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.600
 (imitates explosion)

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.440
 right outside her house.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.760
 Illuminates her room for a minute.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.040
 Totally scares her.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.440
 And then, guess who floats into her room?

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.600
 Don't you, don't guess.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.440
 There's actually an answer.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.680
 I don't wanna hear a bunch of people being like,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.840
 "Ronald McDonald."

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.800
 Oh, it's not Ron McDonald.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 It's the original ghost, not a ghost.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.320
 It's the original alien that appeared

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.920
 doing the disco show a couple days ago.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.640
 And this glowing figure just,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.200
 (imitates explosion)

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.920
 just kind of floats into her room.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.960
 And this time, it's no longer a humanoid shape

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.000
 that she's kind of seeing off in the distance.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 We get an actual description of what this thing looks like.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Here's the description.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.960
 It's this hot chick.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.040
 I'll jump to the, I'll just jump to the end.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.880
 It's a hot chick.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.120
 She's this tall, really curvy brunette.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.640
 I mean, that's fine, I guess.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.800
 But she's this tall, really curvy brunette

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.000
 with big dark eyes.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.980
 Not like creepy alien dark eyes,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.280
 but like Kim Kardashian dark eyes.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.900
 And she had shiny black hair.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.320
 She was pale skin and stuff like that.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.600
 And she had on a skin tight coveralls.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.480
 So she had like on a skin tight spacesuit.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.480
 Pretty sexy alien, right?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.200
 If anyone's going to walk into your bedroom

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.560
 after giving you migraines

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.920
 and turning you into a zombie who can't stay awake,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.040
 it better be a hot chick.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.800
 Hot chick floats into her room.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.000
 Valentina's lying there in bed, just totally.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.840
 (groans)

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.160
 She'll totally super sick.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.080
 She's like, "Oh no, I didn't have time to put on my makeup.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.080
 Oh, it looks so ugly."

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.760
 And the alien's like, "I'm not worried about that."

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.200
 I came from another star system.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.480
 You are quite ugly by our standards,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.240
 even if you didn't wear makeup, but don't worry about that.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.840
 The alien goes on to tell this story to Valentina.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.280
 She says, "They're from a place known as the blue star."

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.880
 Sounds like a strip club, but it's not.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.240
 This refers to an alien thing.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.960
 It's because an alien's saying it, right?

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.920
 If an alien came down to you and been like,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.000
 "I'm from Chevron," you're not gonna be like,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.960
 "What, the guest station down the street?

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.560
 You know Billy?"

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.080
 I mean, obviously it means something.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.000
 Blue star, though, sounds again like a strip club.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.440
 But you would assume because an alien's saying it,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.000
 they're referring to an actual blue star.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.480
 Valentina, her first question out of her mouth is,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.800
 "Why are you here?"

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.440
 And this alien woman says this.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.440
 We have some quotes.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.760
 Quote, "To take you with me, do you want to come?

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.440
 You will not regret it."

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.560
 This alien says, "Hey, do you want to come with us?"

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.160
 Which, it's a pretty good selling point at this point.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.200
 This woman's dying, right?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.200
 For the past couple of days,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.120
 she had horrible migraines and can't stay awake

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.960
 and an alien's like, "Come on, come on, you go."

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.320
 Anywhere's better than where she's at right now,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.700
 which will actually end up being,

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.120
 that's a very true statement.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.960
 But she's, the woman's like, "No, I don't want to go."

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.720
 And she's totally petrified,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.960
 despite the fact that she's super, super sick.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.520
 She feels the aliens are giving this to her.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.040
 So she's like, "No, I don't want to go with you.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.400
 So you can give me worse migraines on our planet.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.120
 Migraines are considered orgasms."

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.600
 No, this is awful.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.160
 Just want to stay here.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.920
 And the alien goes, "Watch this."

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.800
 And then a giant view screen appears

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.240
 in Valentina's bedroom.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.740
 That's kind of cool, right?

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.160
 She refused to go on the ship,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.500
 but they brought the ship technology to her.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.700
 That's pretty polite.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.380
 A view screen appears in,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.140
 and I know you're going chasing this woman,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.520
 obviously, is having some sort of fever dream.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.240
 She's in bed, she's been sick for three days,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.660
 and alien shows up and now the alien's magical.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.680
 She's obviously having some sort of delirium.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.840
 Let me just finish this story, skeptic Joe.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.840
 The giant magical screen appears in the Valentina's bedroom,

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.540
 and it shows images of an alien planet.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.640
 Supposedly the alien planet the alien's from, right?

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.060
 That wouldn't make sense.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.040
 The alien could be tricking her

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.980
 and showing her like a really cool planet

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.860
 that's near their planet, near the blue star,

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.960
 but not the one they're taking to her, not migraineopolis.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.740
 But she starts, we'll assume it's the alien's homeworld

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.180
 that the alien's not some con man.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.840
 You see this, on this view screen,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.800
 Valentina sees this beautiful alien landscape

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.720
 with just beautiful lakes.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.920
 She said that the lakes looked like,

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.600
 the color was mother of pearl.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.880
 She actually doesn't look that appetizing.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.720
 That looks kinda good.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.240
 They would look unclean to a human.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.480
 If you saw like a cloudy white lake, I'm like,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.280
 "Ugh, no thanks, ugh."

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.360
 That's gross, I'm not swimming in that.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.160
 You get out, you're all covered in white goo, uh-uh.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.160
 Then she sees these large, like, virgin fields of grass.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.060
 There's no buildings is what that means.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.220
 It doesn't mean that the grass doesn't procreate.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.760
 It means that it's just like, "It's just grass,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.820
 grass as far as the eye can see."

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.780
 Which to you and me would be super boring, right?

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.460
 Eventually you'd wanna run into something,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.780
 like at least some patch of dirt.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.860
 You'd be like, "Oh, that's exciting.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.580
 There's the pictures mound out here."

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.340
 But anyways, grass as the eye can see,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.860
 virgin grass as far as the eye can see,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.980
 creamy white soup, lakes, that's gross.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.960
 And then that doesn't sell Valentina.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.080
 She, Valentina does say it's one of the most beautiful

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.820
 images she's ever seen in her life.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.280
 Like, she's absolutely mind-boggling.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.780
 She sees these sea, this sea of the white film,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.000
 ugh, and all this virgin grass and stuff like that.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.560
 And then, but that doesn't make the sale.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.780
 That doesn't make the sale, right?

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.880
 This is the alien's ace in the hole.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.920
 This is alien, so basically the alien woman showed up,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.460
 gave her crippling migraines.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.960
 That might've been accidental.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.800
 Then breaks into her house, says, "Come home with me.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.800
 You won't regret it."

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.640
 And then the Valentina's like, "No."

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.280
 And then the alien goes, "Well, look how beautiful

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.360
 my planet is."

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.040
 I shift from side to side when she says,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.960
 "My planet, it's the planet next door."

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.680
 And still doesn't sell Valentina.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.040
 And then this is where we get to what's important to us

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.520
 as humans, as homo sapiens.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.680
 This is the most important part of this story.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.240
 So then the alien goes, "Okay, ping."

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.240
 And then the view screen dims and it comes back

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.140
 to a human city.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.180
 So now she's seeing a vision of Earth.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.340
 So it's like this human city.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.860
 And Valentina wasn't able to identify if it was Seattle

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.300
 or San Francisco or Kiev or anything like that.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.700
 What is Aries?

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.700
 But what she sees is this human city and a giant monster.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.780
 (growling)

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.100
 Knocking over buildings, (growling)

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.240
 stepping on stuff.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.640
 And then another giant monster sweeps down into the city.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.540
 (growling)

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.440
 grabs a skyscraper, rips it into, (growling)

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.000
 people are running down the street,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.380
 creatures of immense magnitude.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.720
 (panting)

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.960
 Chasing them down, grabbing humans underneath their claws,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.800
 ripping them. (growling)

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.520
 One looks right at the camera, charges the camera.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.520
 She sees the end of the world will not be through fire

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.380
 or storm, it will be through massive monsters

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.180
 that are going to destroy our man-made cities

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.380
 with their bare hands.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.580
 And the alien goes, this is the future of Earth.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.220
 This is the future of Earth.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.260
 This is her, should we have a quote

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.620
 from these horrible images,

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.220
 and admittedly pretty badass images, right?

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.420
 Here's these quotes.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.700
 Here is what awaits the Earth.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.020
 We are shielding you from this,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.040
 but we are not omnipotent.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.440
 Remember that.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.160
 I give you three days, and then I will come for you.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.460
 So now, Valentina, it's not just,

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.940
 hey, you got a horrible migraine,

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.080
 why don't you come visit my place for a while?

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.080
 Now, it's listen, monsters are going to destroy your cities.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.960
 Giant, all those monster movies you ever saw,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.120
 talk about predictive programming,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.040
 mothrides, real, all of these creatures

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.720
 are actually going to destroy human civilization.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.640
 And we can hold them off, but we can't stop them forever.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.300
 I'm gonna give you three days to think about them.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.860
 Alien fades from view.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.040
 I'm assuming the view screen faded from view as well,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.160
 because I don't think she spent the next three days

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.480
 not going into her bedroom,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.680
 because it's just snuff films of monsters eating people.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.900
 She's like, where's the remote?

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.900
 Where's the remote?

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.560
 She's sleeping in the living room.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.200
 She can hear the, ah!

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.160
 It's the 18th day of the monsters

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.800
 attacking all of civilization.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.300
 And we're still, no, ah!

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.440
 She hears all of the,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.580
 she would not have a hard time staying awake at that point,

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.240
 knowing that in the other room,

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.260
 people are being murdered in the future.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.900
 Three days pass, Valentina.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.200
 I'm assuming her migraines have gone away this point too.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.520
 Now she's probably just puking up blood from anxiety,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.240
 but we don't have any more notice

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.180
 of her having the migraines.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.460
 But three days pass, and all of a sudden,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.160
 she feels a tingling, or what she calls quote,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.600
 signals in her brain.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.520
 Ah, ah, ah.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.280
 And you're like, Jason, that is,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.860
 the biggest piece of evidence that this woman

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.620
 is having some sort of neurological disorder, okay?

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.020
 You're saying this woman,

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.860
 the story is probably true in the sense that this woman

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.140
 has some sort of neurological problem,

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.580
 'cause she was exposed to some Russian technology

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.140
 that was bright lighting it causing

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.780
 an instant tumor in her brain.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.820
 She's hallucinating, obviously, Jason,

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.740
 and now she's having signals in her brain.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.140
 That's, that's but a reasonable answer, right?

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.260
 There's something physically wrong with her brain,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.600
 but we're not looking at the reasonable answer.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.520
 We're gonna do the cool one, the sci-fi one.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.140
 So she has these signals in it,

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.440
 she feels these signals in her brain,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.520
 ah, and Valentina all of a sudden feels her body

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.620
 like almost force herself to lay down.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.940
 And then she, whoo, now she starts floating around her house.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.340
 She's like knocking over vases and stuff like that.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.520
 She's floating around her house.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.960
 She's, they're not doing it on purpose.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.620
 She's not like, oh, it's my one o'clock float time.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.840
 She's floating around the house,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.920
 and then all of a sudden her house morphs

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.620
 into this long, dark corridor.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.420
 So she's floating down this hallway,

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.980
 and she hears the voice of the alien woman in her head.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.500
 And we have another quote.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.540
 These are always interesting

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.260
 when we have these exact quotes from these things.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.020
 We have this quote here, quote,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.420
 "We want to help you.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.660
 "Here we already have many people like you.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.100
 "When no one remains on earth,

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.340
 "everything will start from the beginning,

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.500
 "here in this place.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.580
 "We will do that, and for that purpose,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.040
 "we need you."

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.700
 Then bam, Valentina sitting on her couch,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.100
 in her house, totally alone.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.320
 It's an interesting story.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.520
 I mean, obviously the first thing is,

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.760
 it could be completely made up.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.240
 It was, I got it from ThinkAbout@Docs.com.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.400
 They got it from a place called Cosmo Letts.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.040
 It's a newspaper in Russia at the time

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.520
 that dealt with UFO stuff.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.040
 It was also documented in a 20th century

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.600
 Chronicle of Unexplained Phenomenon,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.440
 a book published in Moscow in 1998.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.740
 So she could be totally making it up.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.220
 Someone else could have made it up.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.820
 Those are all obvious things that can happen.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.060
 Could be some sort of biological,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.460
 like I said, some sort of tumor,

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.980
 some sort of mental breakdown, things like that.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.580
 But, and that's all fair to discuss,

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.380
 but this story's gone on a long time,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.660
 so we're actually gonna wrap it up

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.500
 with the ending that we like,

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.420
 which is the science fiction ending.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.220
 You go, it's weird that the alien's trying

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.860
 to get her to come, and then when they finally do get her,

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.940
 she basically doesn't have a choice.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.940
 She starts floating down the hallway,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.680
 and then they give that little speech to her,

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.720
 that they need her, that the world is going

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.440
 to be emptied of humans, and this place she's in

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.840
 will be the birth of a new cycle, a new race,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.860
 the new set of human.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.120
 Then she appears back on her couch.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.720
 I think there's two ways to look at that.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.680
 One is that they decided they didn't need her.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.120
 Like she went on that journey,

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.240
 she was floating down that thing.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.840
 She either, they said, you know what?

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.000
 We don't need her to deposit her back on earth.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.680
 She refused again to go.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.480
 She was so afraid of the unknown.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.340
 She refused again to go, and she doesn't remember

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.260
 that part in the aliens.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.480
 They're like, just cut her loose, we'll find someone else.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.420
 She ends up back on the couch.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.540
 It's possible the whole thing may be a near-death experience.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.540
 I think the scary, other than the fact

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.060
 that monsters are eventually going to destroy the world,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.300
 which is really cool.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.780
 Like if we're going, if the world is going to end,

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.500
 I want it to end with monsters crushing cities,

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.460
 'cause that would be a sight to behold.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.060
 I want a meteorite attack.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.460
 That'd be okay, 'cause it'd be kind of cool, I guess,

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.100
 to watch, but monsters attacking the planet,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.240
 you'd be able to stretch it out as long as possible.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.660
 You'd be fighting them in the streets,

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.560
 and you have military, and eventually giant robots,

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.100
 and stuff, power rangers, and all that.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.540
 That's cool.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.300
 It would suck, though, to be showing a vision

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.340
 of how the world was going to be destroyed,

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.840
 and then taking aboard an alien ship,

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.320
 and the next thing you know, you're back on your couch.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.460
 So you would think, wait a second,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.680
 you just showed me that the world's going to be destroyed,

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.300
 and I was special, but now I'm back on this couch.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.580
 What gives?

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.160
 Now here's my theory.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.440
 This is creepy.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.540
 Valentina Valdina is an alien clone.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.000
 The real her is in this realm,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.760
 swimming in these mother of pearl lakes.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.760
 The clone left behind in her place is such a perfect clone.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.640
 She doesn't know she's a clone.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.480
 She believes that all of the life leading up to being placed

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.880
 back on that couch was her life.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.760
 This woman who was built on an alien spacecraft,

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.660
 so no one would notice that Valentina was missing.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.120
 All of a sudden, sitting on a couch,

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.620
 back filled with all these memories

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.700
 leading up to this event.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.840
 True memories, but not a real person,

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.820
 and that clone doesn't know that it's not human,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.180
 and is so distraught with these experiences

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.160
 that have been programmed into its alien brain,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.240
 it calls up a UFO researcher.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.880
 So something's happened to me.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.720
 Never suspecting for a minute

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.100
 that the real Valentina is safe and sound

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.080
 near the blue star preparing for the destruction of Earth

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.400
 while her clone was sent here to be sacrificed

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.840
 with the other seven billion humans.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.560
 But again, if you're gonna get killed by anything,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.460
 you might as well be giant monsters.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.800
 Caleb, let's get out of the Carpenter Caboose.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.660
 I'm Natasha the Keys of the Carpenter Copter.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:01.660
 We are flying out to middle of USA, Kansas.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:06.320
 (mimics car engine)

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.580
 We're flying over a bunch of farmland,

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.940
 bunch of like wheat and stuff like that,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.020
 corns everywhere, and we're flying over it,

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.020
 and we're just landing in a ordinary school,

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.940
 landing right in their playground.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.940
 Tetherballs are getting cut by the rotor blades,

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.940
 they're flying everywhere,

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.860
 we're purposely landing on the four square courts.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.260
 Just mess it up, let's hop out of this Carpenter Copter.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.420
 Now, this is a conspiracy theory

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.740
 that's been going on for a long time,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.780
 and it's actually a request from a listener named George.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.260
 So thank you so much, George,

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.360
 for recommending this.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.240
 This is a story that's been around a long time.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.840
 Now, let's go ahead and hook up one of those tetherballs.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.880
 I feel bad that I wrecked them all,

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.840
 'cause I really like tetherball.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.120
 We're gonna play tetherball a bit

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.920
 while I'm giving you the introduction for this story.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.680
 So let's see how good your skills are.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.120
 (whooshing)

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.560
 So, and before we get started,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.120
 let me give you some quick background here,

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.600
 some quick background.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.360
 The GATE program is called Gifted and Talented Education.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.360
 It is a program to take kids that have higher IQ

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.980
 or are more skilled in certain areas.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.900
 They are then put into a,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.860
 for one hour a week,

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.420
 they're put in their own classroom

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.540
 to work with other gifted kids.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.000
 It's also called Tag, Talented and Gifted.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.020
 It's called different things in different states,

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.580
 and there's programs like this all over the world.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.420
 So that is what the GATE program is.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.540
 That's a quick overview of it.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.140
 Let's talk about what the actual conspiracy theory is

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.420
 as well, and I am not adding this in

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.340
 after I've already added the episode

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.880
 and realized that I left out some key details.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.560
 So the fact that this sounds different,

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.720
 it's just magic, it's just magic, okay?

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.220
 This is not an edit fix.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.420
 The conspiracy theory that we're gonna be talking about

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.840
 is this, there are a series of traits

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.800
 that people who are in these programs seem to share.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.240
 And the conspiracy theory started off with the idea

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.080
 that people who were chosen to be in these

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.360
 gifted and talented programs had some sort of other odd

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.320
 biological or social markers that also identified them

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.900
 to be in these programs.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.640
 The conspiracy theory quickly shifted from that

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.520
 to the fact that the people who were in these

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.780
 GATE programs were being identified to be gifted

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.300
 and talented young kids, but they were too talented.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.680
 They were too gifted.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.760
 And the group, the shadowy group that actually ran

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.160
 the GATE program wiped their memories clean

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.020
 because a lot of things, a lot of the kids

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.820
 who went to these GATE programs don't remember being in GATE.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.360
 They remember being in GATE, but they don't remember

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.680
 what was actually in the classroom.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.220
 So the conspiracy theory starts off with,

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.200
 isn't it weird, I did a survey online

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.040
 of all these traits of people who had been in the GATE program

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.840
 and it quickly morphed into a Illuminati Control narrative.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.800
 Where the reason why we were chosen to be in GATE programs

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.140
 in the first place was because we posed a threat

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.400
 to the New World Order and so they took us

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.460
 and they wiped our brains.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.080
 That is the conspiracy theory in a nutshell.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.960
 And then you're gonna hear me, I go into more detail

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.580
 as far as that goes, but I realize I neglected

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.760
 to actually tell you what I was building up to.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.680
 So the conspiracy theory we're gonna talk about

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.000
 involves gifted and talented education programs

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.880
 and the fact that people are being pulled out

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.840
 of their classes, being mind wiped

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.080
 so they don't pose a threat to the coming New World Order.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.720
 That is the conspiracy theory, which I managed

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.240
 to talk about for 20 minutes.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.980
 It's never actually explained it, so there you go.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.700
 Let's go ahead, we're traveling back in time

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.980
 to when I recorded this episode, here we go.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.700
 So this is a conspiracy theory that's fairly new.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.260
 It really goes back to about 2009, 2010.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.380
 It really started a game traction on a forum

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.460
 called Godlike Productions.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.380
 It's also where the nobody came from.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.820
 We discussed the nobody last week, I believe it was,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.700
 the last week of season nine.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.800
 On Godlike Productions, there was a user back in 2010

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.200
 who went by the name Jane Gray,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.160
 who originally started this thing saying,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.200
 here's a list of all of these traits

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.040
 that seem to be universal among people

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.600
 who go to the gate program.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.760
 So get out your pencils or pins or tablets

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.740
 for you young whippersnappers,

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.480
 however you wanna keep tally of the stuff.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.760
 You go, well, Jason, I didn't go to gate, why should I?

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.360
 It's actually probably more interesting

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.280
 if you didn't go to the gate program,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.640
 if you meet these things, right?

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.960
 So you'll be our control group.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.100
 Now I changed schools every two years.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.660
 Let me say this up front too.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.860
 I know I've kind of been winding.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.880
 I changed schools every two years.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.780
 I never joined a gate program.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.100
 I was never in gate.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.940
 However, I did do an episode way back in the day.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.140
 It was episode 201 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.860
 It's called The Dragon.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.540
 And it, although I was never actually in the gate,

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.340
 and I recommend listening to that episode

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.260
 after listening to this one.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.140
 I think you might appreciate it more after this one.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.680
 But even though I was never in a gate program,

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.600
 I was in a similar type program.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.400
 That's really the only way I can identify it.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.400
 I remember when I was a kid, they talked about gate,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.280
 but we moved every two or three years.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.880
 So they, I was getting identified to be in gate programs,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.600
 but I never was 'cause I was moving around too much.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.920
 It's the parent's choice of whether or not

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.360
 to put the kids in the gate program.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.880
 However, when I was at a elementary school,

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.380
 at the Strawberry Point Elementary School in Mill Valley,

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.660
 an interesting thing happened, a gate-esque thing happened,

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.700
 where I was taken out of my class once a week

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.260
 to go to this cubicle, and that's all I remember.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.980
 It's all I remember.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.700
 So I recommend listening to episode 201.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.820
 It doesn't, you don't have to,

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.740
 but I think it's an interesting companion piece

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.800
 to this story.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.700
 So I was not in the gate program.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.660
 I was identified to go into the gate program,

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.220
 but I never went.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.700
 But anyways, here's the thing.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.660
 Get ready, guys.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.700
 Gate program or not,

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.140
 let's take a look at some of these things.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.820
 Do you have blue eyes or hazel eyes?

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.080
 That's a pretty huge swath of the human population, right?

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.660
 But that seems to be a sign most people in the gate program

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.060
 have blue or hazel eyes.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.640
 Oxypital buns, that's where you got a little bump

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.000
 on the back of your skull.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.840
 You got that?

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.660
 I mean, I have a skull.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.100
 I don't think I have that bun.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.980
 The Oxypital bun is apparently the math bump,

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.220
 which I obviously don't have 'cause I despise math.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.480
 Birth complications.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.480
 Birth complications.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.740
 Either born premature, born extremely late,

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.540
 or born not breathing.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.180
 So, and I guess I should say this.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.120
 I have hazel eyes.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.380
 I don't have an Oxypital bun.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.740
 I was born, I had a heart attack as a baby.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.100
 My mom says that's not true,

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.220
 but my doctor was like, no, no, no.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.500
 When you were born, you flatlined.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.500
 We had to bring you back to life.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.460
 So you're listening to a podcast from a zombie, bro.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.780
 Near-death experiences, particularly drowning,

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.100
 I had that.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.020
 Lack of memory of the gate program.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:47.860
 Definitely had that.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.960
 And again, what I was in was not gate,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.760
 but it was something, technically it was speech therapy

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.400
 is what they actually was billed as.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.520
 It was me and this girl,

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.280
 and we were taken into a cubicle,

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.720
 and then I don't remember anything.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.880
 I have no memory of it.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.920
 Listen to episode 201, 'cause the story's just not me going,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.160
 "I don't remember."

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.720
 Like, there's an interesting conclusion to it,

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.560
 but I don't wanna give it away.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.920
 And it's not important to this episode anyways,

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.360
 but lack of memory of gate.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.560
 That's something that always stood out to me

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.440
 whenever I went to speech therapy.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.320
 I don't remember anything.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.460
 I can obviously talk much better now.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.140
 Windows were covered in the gate classroom.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.320
 That was the same for me.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.800
 Now we get to tendency to being followed,

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.080
 tracked, abducted by aliens or other humans.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.920
 What?

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.860
 Where do these people live?

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.360
 No, I haven't had that.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.180
 A law enforcement being extremely lenient

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.000
 and easy during chance encounters.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.680
 Absolutely.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.780
 I mean, I've had my tangles with law enforcement,

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.240
 but for the most part, it's been,

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.640
 like, have a good day, officer.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.480
 You too, sir.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.180
 So that one is true.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.040
 But see, this is where we start to get to stuff

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.800
 that's kind of biased, right?

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.720
 Because then you get to stuff like early,

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.720
 lots of drug use in teenage years.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.000
 Drug experimentation.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.320
 So not just drug use, but you're like,

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.200
 "I wanna test the limits of my psychedelic mind,"

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.160
 stuff like that.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.080
 An interest in paranormal phenomenon is one of them.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.320
 Forehead scars.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.100
 Early speech therapy is actually one of them listed

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.860
 like I was born into.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.140
 Migraines, maybe Valentina was one of these things.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.740
 The thing with the lenient law enforcement,

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.020
 early psychedelic use or drug experimentation,

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.700
 that if you weren't, if it wasn't lenient police,

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.780
 you weren't on godlike productions, right?

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.020
 If you were into drugs and the police nabbed you

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.020
 and they threw the book at you,

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.940
 and then you do five years for trafficking marijuana

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.560
 in federal prison, then you come out,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.480
 you're not on godlike productions.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.320
 That's important to look at,

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.940
 'cause you're listing things that if they're wrong,

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.200
 guesses, they're not gonna pop up in the stats.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.860
 It's one of those things of saying

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.480
 100 people who jump off the Grand Canyon die.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.600
 That's true, right?

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.440
 But then there could be a guy

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.120
 who jumps off the Grand Canyon, flies away.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.440
 Okay, that's a bad analogy, but you know what I mean.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.480
 The guy who flies away, let's say the 100th person,

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.600
 99 people jump off the Grand Canyon and die.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.340
 Don't do this, don't do this.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.340
 But then the 100th person jumps off the Grand Canyon

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.580
 and flies away and goes to the blue star.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.980
 The stats would still always show

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.740
 that 100% of the people who jumped off the,

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.620
 jumped off the Death Canyon, what is it?

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.700
 Not the Death Canyon, 100 people jump,

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.140
 it's the new name of it, we said petition change.org.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.300
 100 people who jump off the Grand Canyon die.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.940
 It never accounts for the fact

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.860
 of the person who flies away and goes to the blue star.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.300
 There's a stupid analogy, but my point is, is that,

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.900
 yes, police have been lenient on me

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.400
 because if they weren't lenient on me

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.360
 and they caught me with weapons in my car

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.600
 or caught me for going so far over the speed limit

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.960
 or caught me for driving uninsured with no registration

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.160
 and causing a car accident,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.040
 and all of those things happened

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.560
 and they were just like, yeah, whatever.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.520
 If they didn't happen, I wouldn't be on Godlike Productions.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.920
 I would be in jail or prison.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.920
 You see how that works.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.000
 And the other thing is interested in paranormal phenomenon.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.060
 It's on a paranormal board.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.100
 So everyone who is, was in the gate program

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.000
 and is on the paranormal board are like,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.840
 (gasps)

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.140
 that's me, that's right, it's a bias thing.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.360
 If this was on Barstool Sports website,

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.420
 then you get a bigger cross-section of people.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.780
 And that was another thing they said,

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.460
 none of these gate people ever reported

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.300
 being involved in sports at all.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.700
 We're playing tetherball, so we're athletes.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.140
 So we're not part of that either, but no sports at all.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.900
 And then we get into probably the weirdest thing,

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.840
 Israeli art student girlfriends.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.120
 Apparently that's super common

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.600
 among people who went to the gate program

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.640
 that they all somehow met a girl

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.780
 who was an Israeli art student.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.720
 Now, millions of people have been through

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.040
 the gate program over the years.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.440
 So technically, if this part of it was true,

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.440
 you'd have more people who have an Israeli art girlfriend

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.360
 than there are citizens of Israel.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.880
 So again, I mean, maybe that seems to be

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.140
 like an outlier thing.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.820
 Like 10% of the people have Israeli art student girlfriends.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.860
 And that's weirder than the average.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.260
 I don't, so, this is where I'm starting to think

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.480
 this was a joke, right?

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.220
 But this, I remember reading this,

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.580
 this took off really, really quickly.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.020
 And a lot of people were running with this

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.380
 and going, (gasps)

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.660
 I also have migraines.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.100
 And I used to have a crush on an Israeli art student girl.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.800
 So maybe that's the same thing.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.960
 And the cops have been really lenient on me

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.960
 when I was stalking that girl.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.920
 But this one really took off.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.600
 So people started looking into this.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.440
 And really what it is, it's a list of traits

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.660
 that if you meet half of them,

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.880
 you qualify to be an interesting and unique person.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.480
 This is one of those conspiracy theories

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.920
 that is based on ego,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.200
 which are the most cunning of all conspiracy theories, right?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.480
 This conspiracy theory is telling you,

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.440
 you gifted it and talented education student,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.600
 that there's something different about you.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.860
 Even as an adult.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.560
 So people started looking into what this could be.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.100
 Some people say that it's the government

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.300
 looking for the next wave of leaders.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.700
 That's probably the most realistic one.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.620
 That a, and I talked about this a couple times

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.620
 on the show before, if a government,

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.620
 a government's goal is to do two things,

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.580
 to maintain the future of said government

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.020
 and to create the next generation of taxpayers.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.260
 That's it.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.780
 This is 100% it.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.200
 That's all any world government wants to do.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.200
 They wanna keep being around

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.040
 and they wanna have the next generation of taxpayers.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.580
 And when you look at world politics through that lens,

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.560
 you'll see so many things make sense.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.760
 So many things make sense that we attribute

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.560
 hostile or bad action to.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.760
 They wanna be around in a hundred years

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.360
 and they wanna have taxpayers next year.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.800
 That's 100% how governments operate.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.200
 So you would wanna identify gifted children

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.860
 in your population.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.800
 So you can have the next generation of scientists,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.080
 of chemists, of architects, of engineers,

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:06.920
 stuff like that.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.840
 You wanna go, because it wasn't they were putting

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.680
 in their own schools.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.760
 It wasn't Professor Xavier showing up

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.760
 pulling them out of schools.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.600
 They were just giving a little bit extra

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.800
 high level training.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.900
 They were just, and let's go back to the thing too

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.780
 about people not remembering things.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.840
 It's funny because there's two different sides of this.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.740
 Some people go, I don't remember anything.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.800
 And then other people go, oh, I remember all of these

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.360
 programs we did and it was like these weird

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.480
 social experiments.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.320
 So what is it?

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.620
 Is it that people don't remember it?

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.780
 Or that people remember weird experiments going on?

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.060
 Again, it kinda breaks down there.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.820
 But a government does wanna identify gifted people

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.660
 in their population.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.760
 No doubt.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.020
 No doubt.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.820
 Now, generally it's a federal program

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.100
 and then the states are in charge of it

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.340
 and the states go to the school districts.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.980
 And some school districts don't have money

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.620
 to have these programs.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.620
 They still have to identify them for the state to go,

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.780
 yeah, we have this amount of gifted kids in our program,

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.660
 but this one kid is really gifted at tetherball.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.140
 I'm looking out the window right now, dude.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.200
 This dude's super buff and he's just hitting that ball.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.040
 You have that.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.600
 Then you have a group of people who believe

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.440
 that it's private nonprofit organizations

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.800
 that are trying to control the world.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.960
 Here's where we get to the whole Illuminati thing.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.880
 They wanna control the world.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.960
 So what they're doing is they're identifying

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.460
 these gifted kids and they're doing MK Ultra type

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.080
 experiments to them in these classrooms.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.600
 So the brains don't work.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.480
 These kids are going to be the future leaders of the world.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.680
 They're gonna be the John Connors.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.480
 And you have these evil organizations

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.740
 in the shadows being like, oh no,

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.500
 we know that someday this new generation will rise up

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.700
 and they'll destroy us.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.700
 What can we do?

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.300
 Well, we could kill them.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.860
 That'd be the best option, but no, no, no, no,

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:44.660
 we're going to engage in a decade long program,

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.660
 decades long.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.100
 This started back in like the 1950s, gay program.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.100
 We're gonna do this.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.860
 And what we're gonna do is we're gonna identify these kids

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.700
 and then we're gonna wipe their brains

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.940
 and turn them into total losers as adults.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.880
 That's our plan, us Illuminati dudes.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.760
 That's actually conspiracy theory that's going around that.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.680
 The program is set up to dumb down the future generations.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.880
 Here's the problem with that.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.760
 One, it's completely illogical,

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.040
 but here's the problem with that.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.680
 If we follow that core,

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.160
 fluoride's already supposed to be dumb on us down.

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.360
 Chemtrails are already supposed to be dumb on us down.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.200
 There's already all these conspiracy vaccines

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.160
 supposed to give us autism.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.320
 There's already all of these other conspiracy theories

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.560
 that are supposed to accomplish the same thing.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.340
 Why would a private organization go,

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.400
 "No, no, no, we want some of that.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.780
 We saved some of that brainwashing for me."

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.140
 And set up this program that started back like in 1954

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.020
 to do the same thing that's already happened to the gen--

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.180
 I don't believe it's happening.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.460
 I don't believe that the chemtrails and the fluoride

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.660
 and the vaccines are doing this stuff.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.220
 But if you believe in the conspiracy theories,

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.820
 which most people don't believe in just one,

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.060
 most people believe in multiple ones.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.540
 There's like a shared universe.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.220
 Why would a private group try doing this on their own?

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:57.160
 There's way easier ways to eliminate the leaders of the world.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.040
 It's the way they eliminate the current leaders of the world,

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.120
 which is through assassination or just buying them out.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.960
 That'd be way easier, right?

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.480
 Than trying to start this huge program

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.000
 where people are gonna fall through the cracks

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.840
 and stuff like that.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.200
 And there are people who go out of gate programs

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.720
 and go on to be successful.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.120
 This conspiracy theory points towards the people

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.200
 who went to gate programs and aren't successful.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.120
 See the reason why they're not successful?

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.760
 'Cause the Illuminati got to them.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.140
 So we'll finish, we'll go back to that one

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.900
 'cause that's a very interesting conspiracy theory.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.540
 But there's another conspiracy theory

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.380
 and this was so interesting

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.140
 'cause I was researching this back in March

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.140
 before coronavirus shut everything down.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.820
 Back when I was able to do Jiu Jitsu,

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.700
 I would pack up my computer, go do Jiu Jitsu,

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.700
 go to a coffee shop and just read nonsense

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.180
 for three or four hours.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.500
 I read this website called barbarism.net.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.160
 They keep this guy wrote this article called

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.900
 conspiracy theory gifted and talented

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.060
 equals product research and development.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.420
 This is written by an author, he writes this article

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.220
 and he says, "I remember going into..."

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.220
 And this article was back in 2009

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.460
 so it actually predates the Godlike production thing.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.260
 And he writes this article and he says that

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:10.260
 his theory was that gate was run by private corporations.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.140
 So not like private non-profits,

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.620
 but for-profit companies.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.780
 And he tells a story about this kid.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.760
 It might have been him.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.020
 I'm having a hard time remembering

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.700
 and we'll get to why I'm having a hard time remembering

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.480
 in a second, but we'll say it's him

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.320
 for the sake of argument.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.580
 He is in a gate program when he's a kid.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.100
 And these people come in and there's like

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.860
 his normal gate teacher there,

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.500
 but then someone else comes in,

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.020
 starts talking about the hula hoop.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.300
 It says, "Do you guys like hula hoops?"

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.340
 And the kids are like, "No, boo, hula hoops, relay."

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.620
 And this is like back in the 80s.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.940
 Hula hoops suck.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:37.940
 And the guys like starts crying.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.860
 It's like, "Okay, well, maybe don't be so mean next time,

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.700
 but how could we make the hula hoop better?

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.840
 Let's all come up with an idea to make a hula hoop better."

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.020
 So the kids get around and they start thinking about it,

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.620
 doing like these gifted kids,

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.960
 putting their brains together and they go,

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.280
 "What about a hula hoop that counted

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.280
 how many times it went around you?

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.080
 You put a little counter on it."

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.160
 And the man's like, "That's stupid."

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.360
 And he leaves.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.960
 And then a couple of years later,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.960
 this guy said he saw on television

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.240
 advertising a whammo hula hoop that had a counter on it.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.360
 So his conspiracy theory was that these,

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.760
 'cause some schools don't have gate programs

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.720
 'cause you do have to have an extra teacher,

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.440
 an extra facility, all this stuff.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.000
 His theory was that the gate programs exist

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.420
 and they're funded by private companies

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.580
 and they do product testing.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.300
 So all of these mental games and stuff like that,

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.420
 it's a way to refine toys or products for kids.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:34.340
 That makes far more sense than the Illuminati.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.980
 It makes less sense than the government wanting to identify

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.460
 and nurture the smartest of their population,

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.980
 but it kind of falls right.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.260
 It's definitely more believable

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.540
 than the Illuminati trying to ruin your life.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.740
 Now the thing is, is like I said,

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.700
 I was researching this before March.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.260
 When I was getting ready for season 10,

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.920
 I go, I'm gonna do that story.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.240
 I really like that story.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.120
 The website's gone.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.840
 The article still exists.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.960
 You'll see links for it floating around.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.320
 I have the link, it's in the show notes.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.720
 I have the headline of the article.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.880
 I read the article.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.240
 It took my notes.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.280
 The article's gone.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.840
 It's not even in the wayback machine.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.160
 I went to the wayback machine, it's not there.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.040
 You're like, Jason, obviously a conspiracy.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.840
 Well, the website had been around since 2009.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.480
 He abandoned, the article was from 2009.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.340
 And the last article he wrote was still a few years ago.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.220
 And it was like, I'm moving to medium.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.540
 It's been a hard time hosting this website.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.380
 So in that article, it wasn't written.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.220
 It wasn't written.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.060
 Oh no, they have a gun to me.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.580
 The coronavirus is coming and I'm deleting my site

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.820
 'cause I know too much about WAMO.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.820
 I think it was a website that he had.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.780
 That particular page didn't get indexed

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.900
 by the wayback machine, which happens.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.460
 The website is now gone.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.900
 And it was just a weird timing thing.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.940
 It's one of those things that had I not researched

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.920
 the story before the site really disappeared.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.600
 I would have just thought, oh, it's a dead link.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.200
 But because I was able to do it,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.720
 and then the site goes down.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.480
 It does make it a little more conspiratorial,

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.280
 but I don't remember if he was the one in the gate class

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.760
 or he was reporting on a friend or a friend of a friend

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.600
 and stuff like that.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.700
 I just remember reading the article, taking the notes,

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.520
 obviously not very detailed notes,

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.880
 and then the website disappearing.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.700
 So that is where we stand with that.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.520
 Now, my belief obviously is that it is just

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.440
 a government-run program that has a financial interest.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.500
 And finding the next generation of geniuses out there.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.640
 But that's not a super sexy conspiracy theory, right?

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.280
 And neither is the WAMO one,

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.700
 even though that one again is more realistic.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.480
 If I was a private company, I would totally do that.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.340
 If I was a company that made products for kids,

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.420
 you would totally, it's free focus group.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.340
 It's 100% a free focus group.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.620
 Well, it's not free 'cause you pay the school,

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.420
 but you have unfettered access to the brains of kids.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.160
 And not even a mad scientist has that.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.720
 You can honestly go, what do you think of this product?

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.760
 What do you think about this product?

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.540
 But let's take a look at the real meat

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.220
 of the conspiracy theory, and that's the fact that

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.860
 this controlling body is using it

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.260
 to neutralize future leaders.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.960
 That is extremely egotistical, right?

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.880
 You were in Gates or TAG or whatever program you were in.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.580
 A teacher identified you as being gifted.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.260
 The principal, you're sitting there with your parents.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.580
 The principal is talking to them,

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.580
 saying what an amazing kid you are.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.960
 How special you feel, and you should feel special.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.560
 We should all, we are all special inside.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.560
 But when an outsider's saying it,

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.040
 this person has gifts, we wanna put 'em in this program,

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.040
 things are set, right?

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.400
 But then as life goes on, we realize

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.320
 that's just not the way the world works.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.400
 And even special people, even gifted people,

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.760
 make mistakes, unfortunate circumstances happen to them.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.440
 They get lazy, a combination of the three.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.500
 And you go, oh man, I really wish I could be an author.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.820
 Really wish I could write that book.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:53.140
 One, you can, you totally can write that book

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.380
 or write that song or start that podcast.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.860
 There's nothing stopping you, but you.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.540
 And definitely what's not stopping you

00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.740
 is not the Illuminati.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.660
 You're brained and getting raced when you're in the sixth grade

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.820
 and that's what's keeping you in your dead-end job

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.580
 that you're in right now.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.820
 You just work, work, work, and there's no longer any,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.940
 this is the big trick with being an adult or being older

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.200
 because it gets the same thing.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.720
 No one cares to help you out

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.480
 until you're successful already.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.800
 Now of course you'll have family and friends

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.280
 that help you out, but nobody cares

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.120
 that you're thinking about writing a novel.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.720
 Nobody cares that you're thinking about starting a podcast.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.600
 You have to do those things, work really, really hard,

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.840
 get successful, and then the world will care.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.960
 But until then, you're just like everybody else.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.620
 And you have to work super, super hard at it.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.460
 I've been doing this podcast a daily show,

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.940
 Bustin' My Butt, 449 episodes.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.160
 I'm seeing growth.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.420
 Or we could go back in time two years.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.080
 And I go, well my brain got wiped

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.660
 when I was in the sixth grade.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.980
 I had this weird experience

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.620
 where I was in this bizarre school program

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.300
 that I don't remember.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.700
 The reason why I'm working dead-end jobs

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.900
 and I wanna be an author but I can't write my books

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.560
 and because the Illuminati is keeping me down.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.760
 I could have had that mindset, right?

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.160
 Or I could have said, you know what?

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.680
 I'm a creative person.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.680
 Nobody cares.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.920
 Everyone's a creative person.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.840
 You have to put out product.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.840
 Start my podcast.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.400
 Start my podcast two years ago.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.320
 We are here now.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.160
 You're listening to me.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.960
 You never would have heard me before this moment, right?

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.640
 You have to work incredibly hard.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.560
 When you're a kid, it's different.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.240
 A teacher will say that kid's gifted.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.080
 Boom, he's gifted.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.140
 You get this label gifted.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.020
 You're in the gate program.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.360
 You're meeting other kids who are smart.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.220
 You feel special as an adult.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.840
 That doesn't happen until you're already successful.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.940
 Neil deGrasse Tyson would just be a guy

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.860
 writing stuff down on a chalkboard somewhere.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.120
 If he didn't work super hard

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.360
 and eventually gets successful to the point that now,

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.480
 they're like, hey, we wanna do a show about science.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.340
 Let's get that dude.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:09.000
 He didn't just wake up one day and go famous, successful.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.140
 You got to work super hard at it.

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.100
 And this conspiracy theory says,

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.020
 no, you don't.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.740
 This conspiracy theory says you were destined for greatness.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.240
 And the reason you're not great

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.760
 is because an outside organization stole that from you.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.540
 It absolves you of your sin.

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.760
 And the greatest sin that humans can have is laziness.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.740
 There are a lot of people who are trapped in the rat race.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.920
 They're just doing the same thing every day.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.420
 They wake up, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.040
 Wake up, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.380
 They do that all the time.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.560
 And I think a good chunk of the population,

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.340
 although they aspire to do better,

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.340
 they don't know how to go about it.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.560
 Or they don't think they're good enough to do it.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.640
 I think a good chunk of the population,

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.640
 they're not happy with that existence,

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.120
 but they don't know what else to do.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.980
 Everything else involves way too much chance.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.900
 So they just keep doing it and hope for the best.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.420
 Then you have a smaller part of the population

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.980
 who strives super, super hard

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.120
 to realize their dreams.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.700
 That's the part that everyone else looks up at

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.460
 and goes, "I wanna do that.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.740
 "It looks too hard, too chancey.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.020
 "What if I do it and fail?

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.060
 "What if I do it and I'm successful?"

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.920
 Nah, too scary.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.540
 And then you have people that were told as children

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.800
 that they were gifted and special,

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.940
 and now they're working at a coal center,

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.460
 or Jiffy Luga, or they're a teacher.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.180
 And I'm not knocking those professions.

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.660
 If you work at Jiffy Luga,

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.180
 when someone brings their car in,

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.340
 you're the most important person

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.340
 that dude's gonna meet that day.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.740
 They need your help.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.420
 They need your expertise.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.820
 So I'm not knocking those jobs.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.900
 But you have a group of people who have no idea

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.300
 how to achieve their dreams.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.580
 You have people who work really hard

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:53.420
 to achieve their dreams.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.380
 And then you have people, a smaller group of people,

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.420
 who are told as children,

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.660
 "You will be the future of this country."

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.940
 But for whatever reason,

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:04.460
 either because of personal decisions,

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.340
 unforeseen circumstances,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.380
 these future leaders of the world

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.780
 didn't fulfill the potential that their teacher saw

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:12.720
 and their parents saw

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.820
 and their principal saw in all this.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.420
 For them, waking up, working, coming home, watching TV,

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.340
 that is a prison sentence.

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.300
 It's a prison sentence

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.980
 because they were promised so much more in life.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.420
 So you could easily say,

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.500
 "Listen, I made some decisions early on

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.020
 in my teenage and college years that weren't smart.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.100
 And I think now, it might be harder

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.980
 now that I'm 34, but with hard work,

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.660
 I can start working towards my goals."

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:42.740
 It's gonna be hard.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.860
 I might have to change my job.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.220
 I might have to move.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.700
 I might have to do these things that are scary,

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.420
 but I want to be the person that I thought I would be

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.580
 when I was in the sixth grade.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.020
 I have these dreams to be, I wanna be an author,

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.780
 I wanna be a musician or a scientist or whatever.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:02.420
 Or you could say, "I'm stuck in this situation

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.940
 because my brain was wiped by the Illuminati,

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.300
 that I was supposed to be a leader of tomorrow.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.300
 And I was such a threat to the power base

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:18.060
 that it took me into a room and wiped my memory clean."

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:22.100
 The second scenario obviously sounds completely insane.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.700
 But there's a group of people who believe that.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.620
 There's a sizable group of people who believe that.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.700
 And the thing is, is this conspiracy theory

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.860
 is going to get bigger every single year.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.100
 Because every single year there are gonna be people

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.780
 who are hitting 25, 30, 40 years old.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:41.100
 And they're realizing that they're not gifted and talented.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.340
 They're just like the rest of us.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.780
 And they're gonna be looking for answers

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.820
 as to why life didn't work out the way they thought it would.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.860
 They could take the answer that,

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.740
 "My life can be as awesome as I think it is,

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:53.940
 but it's gonna take some hard work,

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.660
 it's gonna take some risk."

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.420
 Or they can say, "My life sucks

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.500
 'cause I was too great for the powers that be

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.940
 to allow to move about unrestricted."

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.820
 Living a life that is unfulfilling

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.540
 is the scariest story of all.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.140
 But if you can give yourself an excuse

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.860
 for why your life is the way it is,

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:19.420
 you will continue down that gray path until the end.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:25.980
