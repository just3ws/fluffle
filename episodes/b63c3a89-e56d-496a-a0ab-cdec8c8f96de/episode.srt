1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,080
 The world ends in the coolest way possible.

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,960
 And then we take a look at the Gifted and Talented Education Program.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,360
 Some people say it's a program that helps young kids

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,960
 who are gifted and talented achieve their dreams.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,600
 Others say it's a twisted mind-scape used to control the future.

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,120
 Today on Dead Ravver Radio.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,600
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,320
 Hey, everyone.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,960
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravver Radio.

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,120
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,040
 I'm having a great day.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,280
 It's the start of season 10.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,160
 It's crazy when this season's done.

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,400
 We'll be at episode 500.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,960
 Isn't that crazy?

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,240
 We're just going to keep checking along, like a choo-choo train,

31
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,600
 the conspiracy train.

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,200
 How come I don't have a train?

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,480
 If I ever come up with a train, the Carpenter Caboose?

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,440
 We'll think about that.

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,840
 But while we're thinking about that,

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,720
 we've got to say thank you to one of our newest Patreon.

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,360
 We got Caleb.

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,760
 Caleb in the house.

39
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,080
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

40
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,640
 Really, really helps out a lot.

41
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,040
 Let's get him on board that Carpenter Caboose.

42
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,880
 That just sounds wrong, because the Caboose is the end, right?

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,720
 Whatever.

44
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,760
 We're a backwards train.

45
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,120
 Let's hop on board the Carpenter Caboose, Caleb.

46
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,280
 You are going to be piling in it.

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,320
 You're like, "Dude, I can't see from back here."

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,400
 Yeah, yeah, you'll figure it out.

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,280
 So anyways, as Caleb is shoveling coal

50
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,760
 into our brand new vehicle, the Carpenter Caboose,

51
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,840
 we are headed out to Rostov-on-Don.

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,880
 That's in Russia.

53
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,240
 It's October 7th, 1989.

54
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,320
 It's midnight.

55
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,440
 There's like a full moon in the sky.

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,600
 Don't look that up.

57
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,800
 If you find out there's not a full moon on October 7th, 1989,

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,240
 like in some sort of like National Geographic

59
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,080
 Farm Resolomon Act nonsense, don't even mouth me.

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,800
 Just for visual, right?

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,880
 Just for, you're like, "Jason, that's factually incorrect."

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,120
 Yeah, but it's a beautiful factually incorrect image.

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
 Full moon.

64
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,600
 I don't know why it's making wind noises,

65
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,280
 but it's doing it.

66
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,600
 That was in the Farm Resolomon Act.

67
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,800
 Look that up.

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
 Moon.

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,880
 And there's a young woman named Valentina Boldina

70
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,840
 walking on the street.

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,720
 She's walking on the street

72
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
 and she sees two glowing orbs.

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,000
 Right now that's weird, right?

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,280
 You don't expect to see orbs

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,840
 when you're leaving your place of work.

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,240
 Unless you work at orbs arrest

77
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,840
 and you're like, "Bye orbs.

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
 Seize these orbs.

79
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,760
 I don't know why you would be saying goodbye

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
 to the merchandise you sell.

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,920
 No one's walking out of toys arrest me.

82
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
 I'm like, "See you later, toys.

83
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,960
 See you tomorrow.

84
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,840
 I can't wait to sell more of you."

85
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,920
 And apparently you're Mickey Mouse as well

86
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,760
 in that scenario.

87
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,160
 The little orbs are flying down.

88
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,200
 Now one of the orbs turns into the shape of a human.

89
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,080
 She's just like, "What in the world is going on?

90
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,680
 I should not be walking around at night.

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,520
 It's a midnight.

92
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,680
 She's walking around the outskirts of the city.

93
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,760
 She sees these two orbs.

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,280
 One of them shapeshifts into a human.

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,080
 And then the other orb just goes

96
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,960
 (imitates engine)

97
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,080
 and starts like shining lights on the human.

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,200
 Weird.

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,840
 She's bringing her own disco ball with you.

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
 (imitates engine)

101
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,520
 And the humanoid is just standing there.

102
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,960
 And then the other one's just (imitates engine)

103
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,160
 And that's the end of that.

104
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,640
 That's not the end of the whole story,

105
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,240
 but that's the end of that part of the story.

106
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
 She just goes home.

107
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,920
 Couple days later, she's at home.

108
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,760
 She's laying in bed.

109
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,680
 It's nighttime.

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,480
 Now she's not ready to go to sleep,

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,600
 but she's having a hard time with life in general.

112
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,720
 Because ever since she saw that little impromptu disco show,

113
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,080
 terrible splitting migraines has a hard time staying awake.

114
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,680
 And then she's laying in bed and her lights go off.

115
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,240
 Bedroom light, (imitates engine)

116
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,120
 all the lights in her house go off.

117
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,360
 Now, she's probably like, "Oh, this is great.

118
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,320
 "I'm already super sick.

119
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,840
 "I can't stay awake.

120
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,760
 "I can't stay awake.

121
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,920
 "I'm like all lethargic, my head's splitting.

122
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,320
 "And now I gotta go and I gotta screw in a bunch of light bulbs,

123
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,800
 "check the fuse box and stuff like that.

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
 "My life stinks."

125
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
 But before she can really start to think about that,

126
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,880
 there's a huge crash of lightning outside her house.

127
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,440
 But no sound.

128
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,360
 No sound.

129
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
 There's just a big bright light going,

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,600
 (imitates explosion)

131
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,440
 right outside her house.

132
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,760
 Illuminates her room for a minute.

133
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,040
 Totally scares her.

134
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,440
 And then, guess who floats into her room?

135
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,600
 Don't you, don't guess.

136
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
 There's actually an answer.

137
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,680
 I don't wanna hear a bunch of people being like,

138
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,840
 "Ronald McDonald."

139
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,800
 Oh, it's not Ron McDonald.

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
 It's the original ghost, not a ghost.

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,320
 It's the original alien that appeared

142
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,920
 doing the disco show a couple days ago.

143
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,640
 And this glowing figure just,

144
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,200
 (imitates explosion)

145
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,920
 just kind of floats into her room.

146
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,960
 And this time, it's no longer a humanoid shape

147
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,000
 that she's kind of seeing off in the distance.

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 We get an actual description of what this thing looks like.

149
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Here's the description.

150
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,960
 It's this hot chick.

151
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,040
 I'll jump to the, I'll just jump to the end.

152
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,880
 It's a hot chick.

153
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,120
 She's this tall, really curvy brunette.

154
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,640
 I mean, that's fine, I guess.

155
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,800
 But she's this tall, really curvy brunette

156
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,000
 with big dark eyes.

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,980
 Not like creepy alien dark eyes,

158
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,280
 but like Kim Kardashian dark eyes.

159
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,900
 And she had shiny black hair.

160
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,320
 She was pale skin and stuff like that.

161
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,600
 And she had on a skin tight coveralls.

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,480
 So she had like on a skin tight spacesuit.

163
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
 Pretty sexy alien, right?

164
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,200
 If anyone's going to walk into your bedroom

165
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,560
 after giving you migraines

166
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,920
 and turning you into a zombie who can't stay awake,

167
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,040
 it better be a hot chick.

168
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,800
 Hot chick floats into her room.

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,000
 Valentina's lying there in bed, just totally.

170
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
 (groans)

171
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,160
 She'll totally super sick.

172
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,080
 She's like, "Oh no, I didn't have time to put on my makeup.

173
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
 Oh, it looks so ugly."

174
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,760
 And the alien's like, "I'm not worried about that."

175
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,200
 I came from another star system.

176
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,480
 You are quite ugly by our standards,

177
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,240
 even if you didn't wear makeup, but don't worry about that.

178
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,840
 The alien goes on to tell this story to Valentina.

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,280
 She says, "They're from a place known as the blue star."

180
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,880
 Sounds like a strip club, but it's not.

181
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,240
 This refers to an alien thing.

182
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,960
 It's because an alien's saying it, right?

183
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,920
 If an alien came down to you and been like,

184
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,000
 "I'm from Chevron," you're not gonna be like,

185
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,960
 "What, the guest station down the street?

186
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,560
 You know Billy?"

187
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,080
 I mean, obviously it means something.

188
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,000
 Blue star, though, sounds again like a strip club.

189
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,440
 But you would assume because an alien's saying it,

190
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,000
 they're referring to an actual blue star.

191
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,480
 Valentina, her first question out of her mouth is,

192
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,800
 "Why are you here?"

193
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,440
 And this alien woman says this.

194
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
 We have some quotes.

195
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,760
 Quote, "To take you with me, do you want to come?

196
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,440
 You will not regret it."

197
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,560
 This alien says, "Hey, do you want to come with us?"

198
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,160
 Which, it's a pretty good selling point at this point.

199
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,200
 This woman's dying, right?

200
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
 For the past couple of days,

201
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,120
 she had horrible migraines and can't stay awake

202
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,960
 and an alien's like, "Come on, come on, you go."

203
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,320
 Anywhere's better than where she's at right now,

204
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,700
 which will actually end up being,

205
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,120
 that's a very true statement.

206
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,960
 But she's, the woman's like, "No, I don't want to go."

207
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,720
 And she's totally petrified,

208
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,960
 despite the fact that she's super, super sick.

209
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,520
 She feels the aliens are giving this to her.

210
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,040
 So she's like, "No, I don't want to go with you.

211
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,400
 So you can give me worse migraines on our planet.

212
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,120
 Migraines are considered orgasms."

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,600
 No, this is awful.

214
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,160
 Just want to stay here.

215
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,920
 And the alien goes, "Watch this."

216
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,800
 And then a giant view screen appears

217
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
 in Valentina's bedroom.

218
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,740
 That's kind of cool, right?

219
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,160
 She refused to go on the ship,

220
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,500
 but they brought the ship technology to her.

221
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,700
 That's pretty polite.

222
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,380
 A view screen appears in,

223
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,140
 and I know you're going chasing this woman,

224
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,520
 obviously, is having some sort of fever dream.

225
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,240
 She's in bed, she's been sick for three days,

226
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,660
 and alien shows up and now the alien's magical.

227
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,680
 She's obviously having some sort of delirium.

228
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,840
 Let me just finish this story, skeptic Joe.

229
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,840
 The giant magical screen appears in the Valentina's bedroom,

230
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,540
 and it shows images of an alien planet.

231
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,640
 Supposedly the alien planet the alien's from, right?

232
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,060
 That wouldn't make sense.

233
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,040
 The alien could be tricking her

234
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,980
 and showing her like a really cool planet

235
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,860
 that's near their planet, near the blue star,

236
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,960
 but not the one they're taking to her, not migraineopolis.

237
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,740
 But she starts, we'll assume it's the alien's homeworld

238
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,180
 that the alien's not some con man.

239
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,840
 You see this, on this view screen,

240
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,800
 Valentina sees this beautiful alien landscape

241
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,720
 with just beautiful lakes.

242
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,920
 She said that the lakes looked like,

243
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,600
 the color was mother of pearl.

244
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,880
 She actually doesn't look that appetizing.

245
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,720
 That looks kinda good.

246
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,240
 They would look unclean to a human.

247
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,480
 If you saw like a cloudy white lake, I'm like,

248
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,280
 "Ugh, no thanks, ugh."

249
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,360
 That's gross, I'm not swimming in that.

250
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,160
 You get out, you're all covered in white goo, uh-uh.

251
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,160
 Then she sees these large, like, virgin fields of grass.

252
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,060
 There's no buildings is what that means.

253
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,220
 It doesn't mean that the grass doesn't procreate.

254
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,760
 It means that it's just like, "It's just grass,

255
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,820
 grass as far as the eye can see."

256
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,780
 Which to you and me would be super boring, right?

257
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,460
 Eventually you'd wanna run into something,

258
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,780
 like at least some patch of dirt.

259
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,860
 You'd be like, "Oh, that's exciting.

260
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,580
 There's the pictures mound out here."

261
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,340
 But anyways, grass as the eye can see,

262
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,860
 virgin grass as far as the eye can see,

263
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,980
 creamy white soup, lakes, that's gross.

264
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,960
 And then that doesn't sell Valentina.

265
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,080
 She, Valentina does say it's one of the most beautiful

266
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,820
 images she's ever seen in her life.

267
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,280
 Like, she's absolutely mind-boggling.

268
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,780
 She sees these sea, this sea of the white film,

269
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,000
 ugh, and all this virgin grass and stuff like that.

270
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,560
 And then, but that doesn't make the sale.

271
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,780
 That doesn't make the sale, right?

272
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,880
 This is the alien's ace in the hole.

273
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,920
 This is alien, so basically the alien woman showed up,

274
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,460
 gave her crippling migraines.

275
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,960
 That might've been accidental.

276
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,800
 Then breaks into her house, says, "Come home with me.

277
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
 You won't regret it."

278
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,640
 And then the Valentina's like, "No."

279
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,280
 And then the alien goes, "Well, look how beautiful

280
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,360
 my planet is."

281
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,040
 I shift from side to side when she says,

282
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,960
 "My planet, it's the planet next door."

283
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,680
 And still doesn't sell Valentina.

284
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,040
 And then this is where we get to what's important to us

285
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,520
 as humans, as homo sapiens.

286
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,680
 This is the most important part of this story.

287
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,240
 So then the alien goes, "Okay, ping."

288
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,240
 And then the view screen dims and it comes back

289
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,140
 to a human city.

290
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,180
 So now she's seeing a vision of Earth.

291
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,340
 So it's like this human city.

292
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,860
 And Valentina wasn't able to identify if it was Seattle

293
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,300
 or San Francisco or Kiev or anything like that.

294
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,700
 What is Aries?

295
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,700
 But what she sees is this human city and a giant monster.

296
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,780
 (growling)

297
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,100
 Knocking over buildings, (growling)

298
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,240
 stepping on stuff.

299
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,640
 And then another giant monster sweeps down into the city.

300
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,540
 (growling)

301
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,440
 grabs a skyscraper, rips it into, (growling)

302
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,000
 people are running down the street,

303
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,380
 creatures of immense magnitude.

304
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,720
 (panting)

305
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,960
 Chasing them down, grabbing humans underneath their claws,

306
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,800
 ripping them. (growling)

307
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,520
 One looks right at the camera, charges the camera.

308
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,520
 She sees the end of the world will not be through fire

309
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,380
 or storm, it will be through massive monsters

310
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,180
 that are going to destroy our man-made cities

311
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,380
 with their bare hands.

312
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,580
 And the alien goes, this is the future of Earth.

313
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,220
 This is the future of Earth.

314
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,260
 This is her, should we have a quote

315
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,620
 from these horrible images,

316
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,220
 and admittedly pretty badass images, right?

317
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,420
 Here's these quotes.

318
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,700
 Here is what awaits the Earth.

319
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,020
 We are shielding you from this,

320
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,040
 but we are not omnipotent.

321
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,440
 Remember that.

322
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,160
 I give you three days, and then I will come for you.

323
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,460
 So now, Valentina, it's not just,

324
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,940
 hey, you got a horrible migraine,

325
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,080
 why don't you come visit my place for a while?

326
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,080
 Now, it's listen, monsters are going to destroy your cities.

327
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,960
 Giant, all those monster movies you ever saw,

328
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,120
 talk about predictive programming,

329
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,040
 mothrides, real, all of these creatures

330
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,720
 are actually going to destroy human civilization.

331
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,640
 And we can hold them off, but we can't stop them forever.

332
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,300
 I'm gonna give you three days to think about them.

333
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,860
 Alien fades from view.

334
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,040
 I'm assuming the view screen faded from view as well,

335
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,160
 because I don't think she spent the next three days

336
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,480
 not going into her bedroom,

337
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,680
 because it's just snuff films of monsters eating people.

338
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,900
 She's like, where's the remote?

339
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
 Where's the remote?

340
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,560
 She's sleeping in the living room.

341
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,200
 She can hear the, ah!

342
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,160
 It's the 18th day of the monsters

343
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,800
 attacking all of civilization.

344
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,300
 And we're still, no, ah!

345
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,440
 She hears all of the,

346
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,580
 she would not have a hard time staying awake at that point,

347
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,240
 knowing that in the other room,

348
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,260
 people are being murdered in the future.

349
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,900
 Three days pass, Valentina.

350
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,200
 I'm assuming her migraines have gone away this point too.

351
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,520
 Now she's probably just puking up blood from anxiety,

352
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,240
 but we don't have any more notice

353
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,180
 of her having the migraines.

354
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,460
 But three days pass, and all of a sudden,

355
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,160
 she feels a tingling, or what she calls quote,

356
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,600
 signals in her brain.

357
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,520
 Ah, ah, ah.

358
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,280
 And you're like, Jason, that is,

359
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,860
 the biggest piece of evidence that this woman

360
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,620
 is having some sort of neurological disorder, okay?

361
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,020
 You're saying this woman,

362
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,860
 the story is probably true in the sense that this woman

363
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,140
 has some sort of neurological problem,

364
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,580
 'cause she was exposed to some Russian technology

365
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,140
 that was bright lighting it causing

366
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,780
 an instant tumor in her brain.

367
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,820
 She's hallucinating, obviously, Jason,

368
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,740
 and now she's having signals in her brain.

369
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,140
 That's, that's but a reasonable answer, right?

370
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,260
 There's something physically wrong with her brain,

371
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,600
 but we're not looking at the reasonable answer.

372
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,520
 We're gonna do the cool one, the sci-fi one.

373
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,140
 So she has these signals in it,

374
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,440
 she feels these signals in her brain,

375
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,520
 ah, and Valentina all of a sudden feels her body

376
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,620
 like almost force herself to lay down.

377
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,940
 And then she, whoo, now she starts floating around her house.

378
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,340
 She's like knocking over vases and stuff like that.

379
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,520
 She's floating around her house.

380
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,960
 She's, they're not doing it on purpose.

381
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,620
 She's not like, oh, it's my one o'clock float time.

382
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,840
 She's floating around the house,

383
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,920
 and then all of a sudden her house morphs

384
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,620
 into this long, dark corridor.

385
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,420
 So she's floating down this hallway,

386
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,980
 and she hears the voice of the alien woman in her head.

387
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,500
 And we have another quote.

388
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,540
 These are always interesting

389
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,260
 when we have these exact quotes from these things.

390
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,020
 We have this quote here, quote,

391
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,420
 "We want to help you.

392
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,660
 "Here we already have many people like you.

393
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,100
 "When no one remains on earth,

394
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,340
 "everything will start from the beginning,

395
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,500
 "here in this place.

396
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,580
 "We will do that, and for that purpose,

397
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,040
 "we need you."

398
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,700
 Then bam, Valentina sitting on her couch,

399
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,100
 in her house, totally alone.

400
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,320
 It's an interesting story.

401
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,520
 I mean, obviously the first thing is,

402
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,760
 it could be completely made up.

403
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,240
 It was, I got it from ThinkAbout@Docs.com.

404
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,400
 They got it from a place called Cosmo Letts.

405
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,040
 It's a newspaper in Russia at the time

406
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,520
 that dealt with UFO stuff.

407
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,040
 It was also documented in a 20th century

408
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,600
 Chronicle of Unexplained Phenomenon,

409
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
 a book published in Moscow in 1998.

410
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,740
 So she could be totally making it up.

411
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,220
 Someone else could have made it up.

412
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,820
 Those are all obvious things that can happen.

413
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,060
 Could be some sort of biological,

414
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,460
 like I said, some sort of tumor,

415
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,980
 some sort of mental breakdown, things like that.

416
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,580
 But, and that's all fair to discuss,

417
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,380
 but this story's gone on a long time,

418
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,660
 so we're actually gonna wrap it up

419
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,500
 with the ending that we like,

420
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,420
 which is the science fiction ending.

421
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,220
 You go, it's weird that the alien's trying

422
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,860
 to get her to come, and then when they finally do get her,

423
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,940
 she basically doesn't have a choice.

424
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,940
 She starts floating down the hallway,

425
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,680
 and then they give that little speech to her,

426
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,720
 that they need her, that the world is going

427
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
 to be emptied of humans, and this place she's in

428
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,840
 will be the birth of a new cycle, a new race,

429
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,860
 the new set of human.

430
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,120
 Then she appears back on her couch.

431
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,720
 I think there's two ways to look at that.

432
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,680
 One is that they decided they didn't need her.

433
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,120
 Like she went on that journey,

434
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,240
 she was floating down that thing.

435
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,840
 She either, they said, you know what?

436
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,000
 We don't need her to deposit her back on earth.

437
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,680
 She refused again to go.

438
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,480
 She was so afraid of the unknown.

439
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,340
 She refused again to go, and she doesn't remember

440
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,260
 that part in the aliens.

441
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,480
 They're like, just cut her loose, we'll find someone else.

442
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,420
 She ends up back on the couch.

443
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,540
 It's possible the whole thing may be a near-death experience.

444
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
 I think the scary, other than the fact

445
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,060
 that monsters are eventually going to destroy the world,

446
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,300
 which is really cool.

447
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,780
 Like if we're going, if the world is going to end,

448
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,500
 I want it to end with monsters crushing cities,

449
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,460
 'cause that would be a sight to behold.

450
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,060
 I want a meteorite attack.

451
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,460
 That'd be okay, 'cause it'd be kind of cool, I guess,

452
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,100
 to watch, but monsters attacking the planet,

453
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,240
 you'd be able to stretch it out as long as possible.

454
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,660
 You'd be fighting them in the streets,

455
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,560
 and you have military, and eventually giant robots,

456
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,100
 and stuff, power rangers, and all that.

457
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,540
 That's cool.

458
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,300
 It would suck, though, to be showing a vision

459
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,340
 of how the world was going to be destroyed,

460
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,840
 and then taking aboard an alien ship,

461
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,320
 and the next thing you know, you're back on your couch.

462
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,460
 So you would think, wait a second,

463
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,680
 you just showed me that the world's going to be destroyed,

464
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,300
 and I was special, but now I'm back on this couch.

465
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,580
 What gives?

466
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,160
 Now here's my theory.

467
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,440
 This is creepy.

468
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,540
 Valentina Valdina is an alien clone.

469
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,000
 The real her is in this realm,

470
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,760
 swimming in these mother of pearl lakes.

471
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,760
 The clone left behind in her place is such a perfect clone.

472
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,640
 She doesn't know she's a clone.

473
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,480
 She believes that all of the life leading up to being placed

474
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,880
 back on that couch was her life.

475
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,760
 This woman who was built on an alien spacecraft,

476
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,660
 so no one would notice that Valentina was missing.

477
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,120
 All of a sudden, sitting on a couch,

478
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,620
 back filled with all these memories

479
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,700
 leading up to this event.

480
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,840
 True memories, but not a real person,

481
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,820
 and that clone doesn't know that it's not human,

482
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,180
 and is so distraught with these experiences

483
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,160
 that have been programmed into its alien brain,

484
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,240
 it calls up a UFO researcher.

485
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,880
 So something's happened to me.

486
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,720
 Never suspecting for a minute

487
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,100
 that the real Valentina is safe and sound

488
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,080
 near the blue star preparing for the destruction of Earth

489
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,400
 while her clone was sent here to be sacrificed

490
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,840
 with the other seven billion humans.

491
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,560
 But again, if you're gonna get killed by anything,

492
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,460
 you might as well be giant monsters.

493
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,800
 Caleb, let's get out of the Carpenter Caboose.

494
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,660
 I'm Natasha the Keys of the Carpenter Copter.

495
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,660
 We are flying out to middle of USA, Kansas.

496
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,320
 (mimics car engine)

497
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,580
 We're flying over a bunch of farmland,

498
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,940
 bunch of like wheat and stuff like that,

499
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,020
 corns everywhere, and we're flying over it,

500
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,020
 and we're just landing in a ordinary school,

501
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,940
 landing right in their playground.

502
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,940
 Tetherballs are getting cut by the rotor blades,

503
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
 they're flying everywhere,

504
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,860
 we're purposely landing on the four square courts.

505
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,260
 Just mess it up, let's hop out of this Carpenter Copter.

506
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,420
 Now, this is a conspiracy theory

507
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,740
 that's been going on for a long time,

508
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,780
 and it's actually a request from a listener named George.

509
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,260
 So thank you so much, George,

510
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,360
 for recommending this.

511
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,240
 This is a story that's been around a long time.

512
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,840
 Now, let's go ahead and hook up one of those tetherballs.

513
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,880
 I feel bad that I wrecked them all,

514
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,840
 'cause I really like tetherball.

515
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,120
 We're gonna play tetherball a bit

516
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,920
 while I'm giving you the introduction for this story.

517
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,680
 So let's see how good your skills are.

518
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,120
 (whooshing)

519
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,560
 So, and before we get started,

520
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,120
 let me give you some quick background here,

521
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,600
 some quick background.

522
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,360
 The GATE program is called Gifted and Talented Education.

523
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,360
 It is a program to take kids that have higher IQ

524
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,980
 or are more skilled in certain areas.

525
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,900
 They are then put into a,

526
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,860
 for one hour a week,

527
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,420
 they're put in their own classroom

528
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,540
 to work with other gifted kids.

529
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,000
 It's also called Tag, Talented and Gifted.

530
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,020
 It's called different things in different states,

531
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,580
 and there's programs like this all over the world.

532
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,420
 So that is what the GATE program is.

533
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,540
 That's a quick overview of it.

534
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,140
 Let's talk about what the actual conspiracy theory is

535
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,420
 as well, and I am not adding this in

536
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,340
 after I've already added the episode

537
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,880
 and realized that I left out some key details.

538
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,560
 So the fact that this sounds different,

539
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,720
 it's just magic, it's just magic, okay?

540
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,220
 This is not an edit fix.

541
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,420
 The conspiracy theory that we're gonna be talking about

542
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,840
 is this, there are a series of traits

543
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,800
 that people who are in these programs seem to share.

544
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,240
 And the conspiracy theory started off with the idea

545
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,080
 that people who were chosen to be in these

546
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,360
 gifted and talented programs had some sort of other odd

547
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,320
 biological or social markers that also identified them

548
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,900
 to be in these programs.

549
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,640
 The conspiracy theory quickly shifted from that

550
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,520
 to the fact that the people who were in these

551
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,780
 GATE programs were being identified to be gifted

552
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,300
 and talented young kids, but they were too talented.

553
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,680
 They were too gifted.

554
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,760
 And the group, the shadowy group that actually ran

555
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,160
 the GATE program wiped their memories clean

556
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,020
 because a lot of things, a lot of the kids

557
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,820
 who went to these GATE programs don't remember being in GATE.

558
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,360
 They remember being in GATE, but they don't remember

559
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,680
 what was actually in the classroom.

560
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,220
 So the conspiracy theory starts off with,

561
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,200
 isn't it weird, I did a survey online

562
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,040
 of all these traits of people who had been in the GATE program

563
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,840
 and it quickly morphed into a Illuminati Control narrative.

564
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,800
 Where the reason why we were chosen to be in GATE programs

565
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,140
 in the first place was because we posed a threat

566
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,400
 to the New World Order and so they took us

567
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,460
 and they wiped our brains.

568
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,080
 That is the conspiracy theory in a nutshell.

569
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,960
 And then you're gonna hear me, I go into more detail

570
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,580
 as far as that goes, but I realize I neglected

571
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,760
 to actually tell you what I was building up to.

572
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,680
 So the conspiracy theory we're gonna talk about

573
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,000
 involves gifted and talented education programs

574
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,880
 and the fact that people are being pulled out

575
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,840
 of their classes, being mind wiped

576
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,080
 so they don't pose a threat to the coming New World Order.

577
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,720
 That is the conspiracy theory, which I managed

578
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,240
 to talk about for 20 minutes.

579
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,980
 It's never actually explained it, so there you go.

580
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,700
 Let's go ahead, we're traveling back in time

581
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,980
 to when I recorded this episode, here we go.

582
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,700
 So this is a conspiracy theory that's fairly new.

583
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,260
 It really goes back to about 2009, 2010.

584
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,380
 It really started a game traction on a forum

585
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,460
 called Godlike Productions.

586
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,380
 It's also where the nobody came from.

587
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,820
 We discussed the nobody last week, I believe it was,

588
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,700
 the last week of season nine.

589
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,800
 On Godlike Productions, there was a user back in 2010

590
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,200
 who went by the name Jane Gray,

591
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,160
 who originally started this thing saying,

592
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,200
 here's a list of all of these traits

593
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,040
 that seem to be universal among people

594
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,600
 who go to the gate program.

595
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,760
 So get out your pencils or pins or tablets

596
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,740
 for you young whippersnappers,

597
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,480
 however you wanna keep tally of the stuff.

598
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,760
 You go, well, Jason, I didn't go to gate, why should I?

599
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,360
 It's actually probably more interesting

600
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,280
 if you didn't go to the gate program,

601
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,640
 if you meet these things, right?

602
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,960
 So you'll be our control group.

603
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,100
 Now I changed schools every two years.

604
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,660
 Let me say this up front too.

605
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,860
 I know I've kind of been winding.

606
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,880
 I changed schools every two years.

607
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,780
 I never joined a gate program.

608
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,100
 I was never in gate.

609
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,940
 However, I did do an episode way back in the day.

610
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,140
 It was episode 201 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

611
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,860
 It's called The Dragon.

612
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,540
 And it, although I was never actually in the gate,

613
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,340
 and I recommend listening to that episode

614
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,260
 after listening to this one.

615
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,140
 I think you might appreciate it more after this one.

616
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,680
 But even though I was never in a gate program,

617
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,600
 I was in a similar type program.

618
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,400
 That's really the only way I can identify it.

619
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
 I remember when I was a kid, they talked about gate,

620
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,280
 but we moved every two or three years.

621
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,880
 So they, I was getting identified to be in gate programs,

622
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,600
 but I never was 'cause I was moving around too much.

623
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,920
 It's the parent's choice of whether or not

624
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,360
 to put the kids in the gate program.

625
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,880
 However, when I was at a elementary school,

626
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,380
 at the Strawberry Point Elementary School in Mill Valley,

627
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,660
 an interesting thing happened, a gate-esque thing happened,

628
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,700
 where I was taken out of my class once a week

629
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,260
 to go to this cubicle, and that's all I remember.

630
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,980
 It's all I remember.

631
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,700
 So I recommend listening to episode 201.

632
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,820
 It doesn't, you don't have to,

633
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,740
 but I think it's an interesting companion piece

634
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,800
 to this story.

635
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,700
 So I was not in the gate program.

636
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,660
 I was identified to go into the gate program,

637
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,220
 but I never went.

638
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,700
 But anyways, here's the thing.

639
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,660
 Get ready, guys.

640
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,700
 Gate program or not,

641
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,140
 let's take a look at some of these things.

642
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,820
 Do you have blue eyes or hazel eyes?

643
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,080
 That's a pretty huge swath of the human population, right?

644
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,660
 But that seems to be a sign most people in the gate program

645
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,060
 have blue or hazel eyes.

646
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,640
 Oxypital buns, that's where you got a little bump

647
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,000
 on the back of your skull.

648
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,840
 You got that?

649
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,660
 I mean, I have a skull.

650
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,100
 I don't think I have that bun.

651
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,980
 The Oxypital bun is apparently the math bump,

652
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,220
 which I obviously don't have 'cause I despise math.

653
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,480
 Birth complications.

654
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
 Birth complications.

655
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,740
 Either born premature, born extremely late,

656
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,540
 or born not breathing.

657
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,180
 So, and I guess I should say this.

658
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,120
 I have hazel eyes.

659
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,380
 I don't have an Oxypital bun.

660
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,740
 I was born, I had a heart attack as a baby.

661
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,100
 My mom says that's not true,

662
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,220
 but my doctor was like, no, no, no.

663
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,500
 When you were born, you flatlined.

664
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
 We had to bring you back to life.

665
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,460
 So you're listening to a podcast from a zombie, bro.

666
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,780
 Near-death experiences, particularly drowning,

667
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,100
 I had that.

668
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,020
 Lack of memory of the gate program.

669
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,860
 Definitely had that.

670
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,960
 And again, what I was in was not gate,

671
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,760
 but it was something, technically it was speech therapy

672
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,400
 is what they actually was billed as.

673
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,520
 It was me and this girl,

674
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,280
 and we were taken into a cubicle,

675
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,720
 and then I don't remember anything.

676
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,880
 I have no memory of it.

677
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,920
 Listen to episode 201, 'cause the story's just not me going,

678
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,160
 "I don't remember."

679
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,720
 Like, there's an interesting conclusion to it,

680
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,560
 but I don't wanna give it away.

681
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,920
 And it's not important to this episode anyways,

682
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,360
 but lack of memory of gate.

683
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,560
 That's something that always stood out to me

684
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,440
 whenever I went to speech therapy.

685
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,320
 I don't remember anything.

686
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,460
 I can obviously talk much better now.

687
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,140
 Windows were covered in the gate classroom.

688
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,320
 That was the same for me.

689
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,800
 Now we get to tendency to being followed,

690
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,080
 tracked, abducted by aliens or other humans.

691
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,920
 What?

692
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,860
 Where do these people live?

693
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,360
 No, I haven't had that.

694
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,180
 A law enforcement being extremely lenient

695
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,000
 and easy during chance encounters.

696
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,680
 Absolutely.

697
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,780
 I mean, I've had my tangles with law enforcement,

698
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,240
 but for the most part, it's been,

699
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,640
 like, have a good day, officer.

700
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,480
 You too, sir.

701
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,180
 So that one is true.

702
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,040
 But see, this is where we start to get to stuff

703
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,800
 that's kind of biased, right?

704
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,720
 Because then you get to stuff like early,

705
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
 lots of drug use in teenage years.

706
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,000
 Drug experimentation.

707
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,320
 So not just drug use, but you're like,

708
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,200
 "I wanna test the limits of my psychedelic mind,"

709
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,160
 stuff like that.

710
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,080
 An interest in paranormal phenomenon is one of them.

711
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,320
 Forehead scars.

712
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,100
 Early speech therapy is actually one of them listed

713
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,860
 like I was born into.

714
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,140
 Migraines, maybe Valentina was one of these things.

715
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,740
 The thing with the lenient law enforcement,

716
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,020
 early psychedelic use or drug experimentation,

717
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,700
 that if you weren't, if it wasn't lenient police,

718
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,780
 you weren't on godlike productions, right?

719
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,020
 If you were into drugs and the police nabbed you

720
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,020
 and they threw the book at you,

721
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,940
 and then you do five years for trafficking marijuana

722
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,560
 in federal prison, then you come out,

723
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,480
 you're not on godlike productions.

724
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,320
 That's important to look at,

725
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,940
 'cause you're listing things that if they're wrong,

726
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,200
 guesses, they're not gonna pop up in the stats.

727
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,860
 It's one of those things of saying

728
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,480
 100 people who jump off the Grand Canyon die.

729
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,600
 That's true, right?

730
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,440
 But then there could be a guy

731
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,120
 who jumps off the Grand Canyon, flies away.

732
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,440
 Okay, that's a bad analogy, but you know what I mean.

733
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,480
 The guy who flies away, let's say the 100th person,

734
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,600
 99 people jump off the Grand Canyon and die.

735
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,340
 Don't do this, don't do this.

736
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
 But then the 100th person jumps off the Grand Canyon

737
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,580
 and flies away and goes to the blue star.

738
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,980
 The stats would still always show

739
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,740
 that 100% of the people who jumped off the,

740
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,620
 jumped off the Death Canyon, what is it?

741
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,700
 Not the Death Canyon, 100 people jump,

742
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,140
 it's the new name of it, we said petition change.org.

743
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,300
 100 people who jump off the Grand Canyon die.

744
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,940
 It never accounts for the fact

745
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,860
 of the person who flies away and goes to the blue star.

746
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,300
 There's a stupid analogy, but my point is, is that,

747
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,900
 yes, police have been lenient on me

748
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,400
 because if they weren't lenient on me

749
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,360
 and they caught me with weapons in my car

750
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,600
 or caught me for going so far over the speed limit

751
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,960
 or caught me for driving uninsured with no registration

752
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,160
 and causing a car accident,

753
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,040
 and all of those things happened

754
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,560
 and they were just like, yeah, whatever.

755
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,520
 If they didn't happen, I wouldn't be on Godlike Productions.

756
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,920
 I would be in jail or prison.

757
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
 You see how that works.

758
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,000
 And the other thing is interested in paranormal phenomenon.

759
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,060
 It's on a paranormal board.

760
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,100
 So everyone who is, was in the gate program

761
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,000
 and is on the paranormal board are like,

762
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,840
 (gasps)

763
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,140
 that's me, that's right, it's a bias thing.

764
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,360
 If this was on Barstool Sports website,

765
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,420
 then you get a bigger cross-section of people.

766
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,780
 And that was another thing they said,

767
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,460
 none of these gate people ever reported

768
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,300
 being involved in sports at all.

769
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,700
 We're playing tetherball, so we're athletes.

770
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,140
 So we're not part of that either, but no sports at all.

771
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,900
 And then we get into probably the weirdest thing,

772
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,840
 Israeli art student girlfriends.

773
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
 Apparently that's super common

774
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,600
 among people who went to the gate program

775
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,640
 that they all somehow met a girl

776
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,780
 who was an Israeli art student.

777
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,720
 Now, millions of people have been through

778
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,040
 the gate program over the years.

779
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,440
 So technically, if this part of it was true,

780
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,440
 you'd have more people who have an Israeli art girlfriend

781
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,360
 than there are citizens of Israel.

782
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,880
 So again, I mean, maybe that seems to be

783
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,140
 like an outlier thing.

784
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,820
 Like 10% of the people have Israeli art student girlfriends.

785
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,860
 And that's weirder than the average.

786
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,260
 I don't, so, this is where I'm starting to think

787
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,480
 this was a joke, right?

788
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,220
 But this, I remember reading this,

789
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,580
 this took off really, really quickly.

790
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,020
 And a lot of people were running with this

791
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,380
 and going, (gasps)

792
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,660
 I also have migraines.

793
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,100
 And I used to have a crush on an Israeli art student girl.

794
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,800
 So maybe that's the same thing.

795
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,960
 And the cops have been really lenient on me

796
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
 when I was stalking that girl.

797
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,920
 But this one really took off.

798
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,600
 So people started looking into this.

799
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,440
 And really what it is, it's a list of traits

800
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,660
 that if you meet half of them,

801
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,880
 you qualify to be an interesting and unique person.

802
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,480
 This is one of those conspiracy theories

803
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,920
 that is based on ego,

804
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,200
 which are the most cunning of all conspiracy theories, right?

805
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,480
 This conspiracy theory is telling you,

806
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,440
 you gifted it and talented education student,

807
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,600
 that there's something different about you.

808
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,860
 Even as an adult.

809
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,560
 So people started looking into what this could be.

810
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,100
 Some people say that it's the government

811
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,300
 looking for the next wave of leaders.

812
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,700
 That's probably the most realistic one.

813
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,620
 That a, and I talked about this a couple times

814
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,620
 on the show before, if a government,

815
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,620
 a government's goal is to do two things,

816
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,580
 to maintain the future of said government

817
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,020
 and to create the next generation of taxpayers.

818
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,260
 That's it.

819
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,780
 This is 100% it.

820
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,200
 That's all any world government wants to do.

821
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
 They wanna keep being around

822
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,040
 and they wanna have the next generation of taxpayers.

823
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,580
 And when you look at world politics through that lens,

824
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,560
 you'll see so many things make sense.

825
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,760
 So many things make sense that we attribute

826
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,560
 hostile or bad action to.

827
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,760
 They wanna be around in a hundred years

828
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,360
 and they wanna have taxpayers next year.

829
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,800
 That's 100% how governments operate.

830
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,200
 So you would wanna identify gifted children

831
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,860
 in your population.

832
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,800
 So you can have the next generation of scientists,

833
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,080
 of chemists, of architects, of engineers,

834
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,920
 stuff like that.

835
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,840
 You wanna go, because it wasn't they were putting

836
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,680
 in their own schools.

837
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,760
 It wasn't Professor Xavier showing up

838
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
 pulling them out of schools.

839
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,600
 They were just giving a little bit extra

840
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,800
 high level training.

841
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,900
 They were just, and let's go back to the thing too

842
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,780
 about people not remembering things.

843
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,840
 It's funny because there's two different sides of this.

844
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,740
 Some people go, I don't remember anything.

845
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,800
 And then other people go, oh, I remember all of these

846
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,360
 programs we did and it was like these weird

847
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,480
 social experiments.

848
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,320
 So what is it?

849
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,620
 Is it that people don't remember it?

850
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,780
 Or that people remember weird experiments going on?

851
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,060
 Again, it kinda breaks down there.

852
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,820
 But a government does wanna identify gifted people

853
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,660
 in their population.

854
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,760
 No doubt.

855
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,020
 No doubt.

856
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,820
 Now, generally it's a federal program

857
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,100
 and then the states are in charge of it

858
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,340
 and the states go to the school districts.

859
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,980
 And some school districts don't have money

860
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,620
 to have these programs.

861
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,620
 They still have to identify them for the state to go,

862
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,780
 yeah, we have this amount of gifted kids in our program,

863
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,660
 but this one kid is really gifted at tetherball.

864
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,140
 I'm looking out the window right now, dude.

865
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,200
 This dude's super buff and he's just hitting that ball.

866
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,040
 You have that.

867
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,600
 Then you have a group of people who believe

868
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,440
 that it's private nonprofit organizations

869
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,800
 that are trying to control the world.

870
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,960
 Here's where we get to the whole Illuminati thing.

871
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,880
 They wanna control the world.

872
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,960
 So what they're doing is they're identifying

873
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,460
 these gifted kids and they're doing MK Ultra type

874
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,080
 experiments to them in these classrooms.

875
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,600
 So the brains don't work.

876
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,480
 These kids are going to be the future leaders of the world.

877
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,680
 They're gonna be the John Connors.

878
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,480
 And you have these evil organizations

879
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,740
 in the shadows being like, oh no,

880
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,500
 we know that someday this new generation will rise up

881
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,700
 and they'll destroy us.

882
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,700
 What can we do?

883
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,300
 Well, we could kill them.

884
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,860
 That'd be the best option, but no, no, no, no,

885
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,660
 we're going to engage in a decade long program,

886
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
 decades long.

887
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,100
 This started back in like the 1950s, gay program.

888
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,100
 We're gonna do this.

889
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,860
 And what we're gonna do is we're gonna identify these kids

890
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,700
 and then we're gonna wipe their brains

891
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,940
 and turn them into total losers as adults.

892
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,880
 That's our plan, us Illuminati dudes.

893
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,760
 That's actually conspiracy theory that's going around that.

894
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,680
 The program is set up to dumb down the future generations.

895
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,880
 Here's the problem with that.

896
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,760
 One, it's completely illogical,

897
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,040
 but here's the problem with that.

898
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,680
 If we follow that core,

899
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,160
 fluoride's already supposed to be dumb on us down.

900
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,360
 Chemtrails are already supposed to be dumb on us down.

901
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,200
 There's already all these conspiracy vaccines

902
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,160
 supposed to give us autism.

903
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,320
 There's already all of these other conspiracy theories

904
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,560
 that are supposed to accomplish the same thing.

905
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,340
 Why would a private organization go,

906
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,400
 "No, no, no, we want some of that.

907
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,780
 We saved some of that brainwashing for me."

908
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,140
 And set up this program that started back like in 1954

909
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,020
 to do the same thing that's already happened to the gen--

910
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,180
 I don't believe it's happening.

911
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,460
 I don't believe that the chemtrails and the fluoride

912
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,660
 and the vaccines are doing this stuff.

913
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,220
 But if you believe in the conspiracy theories,

914
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,820
 which most people don't believe in just one,

915
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,060
 most people believe in multiple ones.

916
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,540
 There's like a shared universe.

917
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,220
 Why would a private group try doing this on their own?

918
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,160
 There's way easier ways to eliminate the leaders of the world.

919
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,040
 It's the way they eliminate the current leaders of the world,

920
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,120
 which is through assassination or just buying them out.

921
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,960
 That'd be way easier, right?

922
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,480
 Than trying to start this huge program

923
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,000
 where people are gonna fall through the cracks

924
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,840
 and stuff like that.

925
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,200
 And there are people who go out of gate programs

926
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,720
 and go on to be successful.

927
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,120
 This conspiracy theory points towards the people

928
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,200
 who went to gate programs and aren't successful.

929
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,120
 See the reason why they're not successful?

930
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,760
 'Cause the Illuminati got to them.

931
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,140
 So we'll finish, we'll go back to that one

932
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,900
 'cause that's a very interesting conspiracy theory.

933
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,540
 But there's another conspiracy theory

934
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,380
 and this was so interesting

935
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,140
 'cause I was researching this back in March

936
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,140
 before coronavirus shut everything down.

937
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,820
 Back when I was able to do Jiu Jitsu,

938
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,700
 I would pack up my computer, go do Jiu Jitsu,

939
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
 go to a coffee shop and just read nonsense

940
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,180
 for three or four hours.

941
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,500
 I read this website called barbarism.net.

942
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,160
 They keep this guy wrote this article called

943
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,900
 conspiracy theory gifted and talented

944
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,060
 equals product research and development.

945
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,420
 This is written by an author, he writes this article

946
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,220
 and he says, "I remember going into..."

947
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,220
 And this article was back in 2009

948
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,460
 so it actually predates the Godlike production thing.

949
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,260
 And he writes this article and he says that

950
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:10,260
 his theory was that gate was run by private corporations.

951
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,140
 So not like private non-profits,

952
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,620
 but for-profit companies.

953
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,780
 And he tells a story about this kid.

954
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,760
 It might have been him.

955
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,020
 I'm having a hard time remembering

956
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,700
 and we'll get to why I'm having a hard time remembering

957
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,480
 in a second, but we'll say it's him

958
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,320
 for the sake of argument.

959
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,580
 He is in a gate program when he's a kid.

960
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,100
 And these people come in and there's like

961
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,860
 his normal gate teacher there,

962
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,500
 but then someone else comes in,

963
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,020
 starts talking about the hula hoop.

964
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,300
 It says, "Do you guys like hula hoops?"

965
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,340
 And the kids are like, "No, boo, hula hoops, relay."

966
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,620
 And this is like back in the 80s.

967
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,940
 Hula hoops suck.

968
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,940
 And the guys like starts crying.

969
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,860
 It's like, "Okay, well, maybe don't be so mean next time,

970
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,700
 but how could we make the hula hoop better?

971
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,840
 Let's all come up with an idea to make a hula hoop better."

972
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,020
 So the kids get around and they start thinking about it,

973
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,620
 doing like these gifted kids,

974
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,960
 putting their brains together and they go,

975
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,280
 "What about a hula hoop that counted

976
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,280
 how many times it went around you?

977
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,080
 You put a little counter on it."

978
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,160
 And the man's like, "That's stupid."

979
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,360
 And he leaves.

980
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,960
 And then a couple of years later,

981
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
 this guy said he saw on television

982
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,240
 advertising a whammo hula hoop that had a counter on it.

983
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,360
 So his conspiracy theory was that these,

984
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,760
 'cause some schools don't have gate programs

985
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,720
 'cause you do have to have an extra teacher,

986
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,440
 an extra facility, all this stuff.

987
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,000
 His theory was that the gate programs exist

988
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,420
 and they're funded by private companies

989
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,580
 and they do product testing.

990
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,300
 So all of these mental games and stuff like that,

991
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,420
 it's a way to refine toys or products for kids.

992
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,340
 That makes far more sense than the Illuminati.

993
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,980
 It makes less sense than the government wanting to identify

994
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,460
 and nurture the smartest of their population,

995
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,980
 but it kind of falls right.

996
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,260
 It's definitely more believable

997
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,540
 than the Illuminati trying to ruin your life.

998
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,740
 Now the thing is, is like I said,

999
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,700
 I was researching this before March.

1000
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,260
 When I was getting ready for season 10,

1001
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,920
 I go, I'm gonna do that story.

1002
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,240
 I really like that story.

1003
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,120
 The website's gone.

1004
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,840
 The article still exists.

1005
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,960
 You'll see links for it floating around.

1006
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,320
 I have the link, it's in the show notes.

1007
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,720
 I have the headline of the article.

1008
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,880
 I read the article.

1009
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,240
 It took my notes.

1010
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,280
 The article's gone.

1011
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,840
 It's not even in the wayback machine.

1012
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,160
 I went to the wayback machine, it's not there.

1013
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,040
 You're like, Jason, obviously a conspiracy.

1014
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,840
 Well, the website had been around since 2009.

1015
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,480
 He abandoned, the article was from 2009.

1016
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,340
 And the last article he wrote was still a few years ago.

1017
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,220
 And it was like, I'm moving to medium.

1018
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,540
 It's been a hard time hosting this website.

1019
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,380
 So in that article, it wasn't written.

1020
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,220
 It wasn't written.

1021
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,060
 Oh no, they have a gun to me.

1022
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,580
 The coronavirus is coming and I'm deleting my site

1023
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,820
 'cause I know too much about WAMO.

1024
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,820
 I think it was a website that he had.

1025
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,780
 That particular page didn't get indexed

1026
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,900
 by the wayback machine, which happens.

1027
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,460
 The website is now gone.

1028
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,900
 And it was just a weird timing thing.

1029
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,940
 It's one of those things that had I not researched

1030
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,920
 the story before the site really disappeared.

1031
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,600
 I would have just thought, oh, it's a dead link.

1032
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,200
 But because I was able to do it,

1033
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,720
 and then the site goes down.

1034
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,480
 It does make it a little more conspiratorial,

1035
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,280
 but I don't remember if he was the one in the gate class

1036
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,760
 or he was reporting on a friend or a friend of a friend

1037
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,600
 and stuff like that.

1038
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,700
 I just remember reading the article, taking the notes,

1039
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,520
 obviously not very detailed notes,

1040
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,880
 and then the website disappearing.

1041
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,700
 So that is where we stand with that.

1042
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,520
 Now, my belief obviously is that it is just

1043
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,440
 a government-run program that has a financial interest.

1044
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,500
 And finding the next generation of geniuses out there.

1045
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,640
 But that's not a super sexy conspiracy theory, right?

1046
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,280
 And neither is the WAMO one,

1047
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,700
 even though that one again is more realistic.

1048
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,480
 If I was a private company, I would totally do that.

1049
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,340
 If I was a company that made products for kids,

1050
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,420
 you would totally, it's free focus group.

1051
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,340
 It's 100% a free focus group.

1052
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,620
 Well, it's not free 'cause you pay the school,

1053
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,420
 but you have unfettered access to the brains of kids.

1054
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,160
 And not even a mad scientist has that.

1055
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,720
 You can honestly go, what do you think of this product?

1056
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,760
 What do you think about this product?

1057
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,540
 But let's take a look at the real meat

1058
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,220
 of the conspiracy theory, and that's the fact that

1059
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,860
 this controlling body is using it

1060
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,260
 to neutralize future leaders.

1061
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,960
 That is extremely egotistical, right?

1062
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,880
 You were in Gates or TAG or whatever program you were in.

1063
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,580
 A teacher identified you as being gifted.

1064
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,260
 The principal, you're sitting there with your parents.

1065
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,580
 The principal is talking to them,

1066
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,580
 saying what an amazing kid you are.

1067
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,960
 How special you feel, and you should feel special.

1068
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,560
 We should all, we are all special inside.

1069
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,560
 But when an outsider's saying it,

1070
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,040
 this person has gifts, we wanna put 'em in this program,

1071
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
 things are set, right?

1072
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,400
 But then as life goes on, we realize

1073
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,320
 that's just not the way the world works.

1074
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,400
 And even special people, even gifted people,

1075
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,760
 make mistakes, unfortunate circumstances happen to them.

1076
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,440
 They get lazy, a combination of the three.

1077
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,500
 And you go, oh man, I really wish I could be an author.

1078
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,820
 Really wish I could write that book.

1079
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,140
 One, you can, you totally can write that book

1080
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,380
 or write that song or start that podcast.

1081
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,860
 There's nothing stopping you, but you.

1082
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,540
 And definitely what's not stopping you

1083
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,740
 is not the Illuminati.

1084
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,660
 You're brained and getting raced when you're in the sixth grade

1085
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,820
 and that's what's keeping you in your dead-end job

1086
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,580
 that you're in right now.

1087
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,820
 You just work, work, work, and there's no longer any,

1088
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,940
 this is the big trick with being an adult or being older

1089
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,200
 because it gets the same thing.

1090
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,720
 No one cares to help you out

1091
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,480
 until you're successful already.

1092
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,800
 Now of course you'll have family and friends

1093
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,280
 that help you out, but nobody cares

1094
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,120
 that you're thinking about writing a novel.

1095
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,720
 Nobody cares that you're thinking about starting a podcast.

1096
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,600
 You have to do those things, work really, really hard,

1097
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,840
 get successful, and then the world will care.

1098
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,960
 But until then, you're just like everybody else.

1099
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,620
 And you have to work super, super hard at it.

1100
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,460
 I've been doing this podcast a daily show,

1101
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,940
 Bustin' My Butt, 449 episodes.

1102
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,160
 I'm seeing growth.

1103
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,420
 Or we could go back in time two years.

1104
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,080
 And I go, well my brain got wiped

1105
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,660
 when I was in the sixth grade.

1106
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,980
 I had this weird experience

1107
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,620
 where I was in this bizarre school program

1108
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,300
 that I don't remember.

1109
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,700
 The reason why I'm working dead-end jobs

1110
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,900
 and I wanna be an author but I can't write my books

1111
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,560
 and because the Illuminati is keeping me down.

1112
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,760
 I could have had that mindset, right?

1113
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,160
 Or I could have said, you know what?

1114
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,680
 I'm a creative person.

1115
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,680
 Nobody cares.

1116
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,920
 Everyone's a creative person.

1117
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,840
 You have to put out product.

1118
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
 Start my podcast.

1119
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,400
 Start my podcast two years ago.

1120
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,320
 We are here now.

1121
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,160
 You're listening to me.

1122
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,960
 You never would have heard me before this moment, right?

1123
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,640
 You have to work incredibly hard.

1124
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,560
 When you're a kid, it's different.

1125
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,240
 A teacher will say that kid's gifted.

1126
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,080
 Boom, he's gifted.

1127
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,140
 You get this label gifted.

1128
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,020
 You're in the gate program.

1129
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,360
 You're meeting other kids who are smart.

1130
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,220
 You feel special as an adult.

1131
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,840
 That doesn't happen until you're already successful.

1132
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,940
 Neil deGrasse Tyson would just be a guy

1133
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,860
 writing stuff down on a chalkboard somewhere.

1134
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,120
 If he didn't work super hard

1135
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,360
 and eventually gets successful to the point that now,

1136
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,480
 they're like, hey, we wanna do a show about science.

1137
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,340
 Let's get that dude.

1138
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,000
 He didn't just wake up one day and go famous, successful.

1139
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,140
 You got to work super hard at it.

1140
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,100
 And this conspiracy theory says,

1141
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,020
 no, you don't.

1142
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,740
 This conspiracy theory says you were destined for greatness.

1143
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,240
 And the reason you're not great

1144
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,760
 is because an outside organization stole that from you.

1145
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,540
 It absolves you of your sin.

1146
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,760
 And the greatest sin that humans can have is laziness.

1147
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,740
 There are a lot of people who are trapped in the rat race.

1148
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,920
 They're just doing the same thing every day.

1149
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,420
 They wake up, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed.

1150
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,040
 Wake up, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed.

1151
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,380
 They do that all the time.

1152
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,560
 And I think a good chunk of the population,

1153
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,340
 although they aspire to do better,

1154
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,340
 they don't know how to go about it.

1155
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,560
 Or they don't think they're good enough to do it.

1156
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,640
 I think a good chunk of the population,

1157
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,640
 they're not happy with that existence,

1158
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,120
 but they don't know what else to do.

1159
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,980
 Everything else involves way too much chance.

1160
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,900
 So they just keep doing it and hope for the best.

1161
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,420
 Then you have a smaller part of the population

1162
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,980
 who strives super, super hard

1163
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,120
 to realize their dreams.

1164
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,700
 That's the part that everyone else looks up at

1165
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,460
 and goes, "I wanna do that.

1166
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,740
 "It looks too hard, too chancey.

1167
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,020
 "What if I do it and fail?

1168
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,060
 "What if I do it and I'm successful?"

1169
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,920
 Nah, too scary.

1170
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,540
 And then you have people that were told as children

1171
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,800
 that they were gifted and special,

1172
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,940
 and now they're working at a coal center,

1173
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,460
 or Jiffy Luga, or they're a teacher.

1174
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,180
 And I'm not knocking those professions.

1175
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,660
 If you work at Jiffy Luga,

1176
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,180
 when someone brings their car in,

1177
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,340
 you're the most important person

1178
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,340
 that dude's gonna meet that day.

1179
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,740
 They need your help.

1180
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,420
 They need your expertise.

1181
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,820
 So I'm not knocking those jobs.

1182
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,900
 But you have a group of people who have no idea

1183
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,300
 how to achieve their dreams.

1184
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,580
 You have people who work really hard

1185
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,420
 to achieve their dreams.

1186
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,380
 And then you have people, a smaller group of people,

1187
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,420
 who are told as children,

1188
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,660
 "You will be the future of this country."

1189
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,940
 But for whatever reason,

1190
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,460
 either because of personal decisions,

1191
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,340
 unforeseen circumstances,

1192
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,380
 these future leaders of the world

1193
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,780
 didn't fulfill the potential that their teacher saw

1194
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,720
 and their parents saw

1195
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,820
 and their principal saw in all this.

1196
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,420
 For them, waking up, working, coming home, watching TV,

1197
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,340
 that is a prison sentence.

1198
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,300
 It's a prison sentence

1199
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,980
 because they were promised so much more in life.

1200
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,420
 So you could easily say,

1201
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,500
 "Listen, I made some decisions early on

1202
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,020
 in my teenage and college years that weren't smart.

1203
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,100
 And I think now, it might be harder

1204
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,980
 now that I'm 34, but with hard work,

1205
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,660
 I can start working towards my goals."

1206
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,740
 It's gonna be hard.

1207
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,860
 I might have to change my job.

1208
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,220
 I might have to move.

1209
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,700
 I might have to do these things that are scary,

1210
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,420
 but I want to be the person that I thought I would be

1211
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,580
 when I was in the sixth grade.

1212
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,020
 I have these dreams to be, I wanna be an author,

1213
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,780
 I wanna be a musician or a scientist or whatever.

1214
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:02,420
 Or you could say, "I'm stuck in this situation

1215
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,940
 because my brain was wiped by the Illuminati,

1216
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,300
 that I was supposed to be a leader of tomorrow.

1217
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,300
 And I was such a threat to the power base

1218
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:18,060
 that it took me into a room and wiped my memory clean."

1219
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,100
 The second scenario obviously sounds completely insane.

1220
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,700
 But there's a group of people who believe that.

1221
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,620
 There's a sizable group of people who believe that.

1222
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,700
 And the thing is, is this conspiracy theory

1223
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,860
 is going to get bigger every single year.

1224
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,100
 Because every single year there are gonna be people

1225
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,780
 who are hitting 25, 30, 40 years old.

1226
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,100
 And they're realizing that they're not gifted and talented.

1227
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,340
 They're just like the rest of us.

1228
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,780
 And they're gonna be looking for answers

1229
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,820
 as to why life didn't work out the way they thought it would.

1230
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,860
 They could take the answer that,

1231
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,740
 "My life can be as awesome as I think it is,

1232
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,940
 but it's gonna take some hard work,

1233
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,660
 it's gonna take some risk."

1234
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,420
 Or they can say, "My life sucks

1235
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,500
 'cause I was too great for the powers that be

1236
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,940
 to allow to move about unrestricted."

1237
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,820
 Living a life that is unfulfilling

1238
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,540
 is the scariest story of all.

1239
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,140
 But if you can give yourself an excuse

1240
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,860
 for why your life is the way it is,

1241
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,420
 you will continue down that gray path until the end.
