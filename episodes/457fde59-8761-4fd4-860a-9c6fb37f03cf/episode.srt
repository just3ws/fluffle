1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Vampire Week ends with two vampiric stories. You're like Vampire Week, I didn't know what you're doing that.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Well, we were. First off, we take a look at a man who can promise you, today, that he can make you a vampire for $500.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And then we travel to Mexico to look at a vampire legend that is so obscure most Mexicans have never ever heard of it before.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Even though this vampire kills a baby every month. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 [Laughs]

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Welcome back to another devilish episode of Dead...

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Never mind, I'm not gonna do that.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 It's Friday. That sounded... that sounded oddly weird. I remember doing that before.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 It's Friday. I'll say it in a deeper, more serious voice.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend. Don't forget, we are doing our six weeks to a better you.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Now it's five weeks to a better you.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 June 15th, let's get some goals accomplished.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Last week, I cut down my calories because I'm all about my fitness right now.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I cut 900 calories out of my daily life. I feel great. I'm losing weight. I'm lifting.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Let's see how better your life can be. June 15th.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You're like, dude, it is creeping up very rapidly. But remember, last week, six weeks to a better you.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I want to see you at a better place in life. I'm gonna be in a better place in life.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 We're all going to be four more awesome than we were on May 1st. Come June 15th.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 But anyways, let's go ahead and move. You're like, dude, I didn't know I was gonna have so much pressure.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I just wanted to hear a ghost story or a vampire story during Vampire Week that I just announced.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 I was doing vampire stories a lot this week, but I didn't want to make it a vampire week.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Because I don't think I talked about them on Wednesday or something like that.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 But anyways, we are going to take a look at some vampires.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 First off, we're gonna say thank you to one of our legacy Patreons, Ivan M.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Ivan, thank you so much for supporting the show. That really, really helps a lot.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 You are going to be our captain for this episode.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, you know what I'm gonna say. That's fine too.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 So Ivan, let's go ahead and fire up that carbonicopter. We are flying out to India.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Because that is where this seems to be centered. We're flying out to India.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 You're like, Jason, that's a super big country. You just can't say, "Next stop India."

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Like, I have to have directions. Ivan, Ivan, okay.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And I don't know the specifics of Ivan. Just fly, just hover around India for a while.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 We'll figure it out. Because apparently, you actually may have encountered one of these.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 There is a post that's floating around the internet.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Some people may say it's copypasta. Some people may say it's creepypasta.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Some people may say it's a scam. Here we go.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 This is on, this was posted, the original time I saw it, this was posted on the Facebook page.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 For the South Atlantic news agency. It's written by a man named Keith Braden.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Keith Braden writes this. And it is broken English.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 So we're just gonna have to straddle through a bit of this.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I'm a vampire. And I know you will be surprised to think that.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 How I can write articles on the site if I am a vampire.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I am quite shocked. I didn't know vampires could use computers.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But Keith proved me wrong. Here we continue.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I can change anytime, any day to either human or vampire.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Yes, it is true. How I become a vampire with the help of the Hindu priest.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And then he has this helpful email address.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 VampirelordTransformerChanging@gmail.com. That's very nice.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I thought they might have their own server. You know, being undead creatures that feed on humans.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But no, just Gmail. If you want to write that down, it's VampirelordTransformerChanging@gmail.com.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 He goes on to say that technically he's a demon called a Pisatch.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 A Pisatch. It's like an Indian version, an East Asian version of the vampire.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 It's a far cry from Twilight. If you wanted to like meet up with this dude.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Want him to turn you into a vampire. Just let you know, they don't necessarily drink human blood.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 They eat flesh. That's a huge difference, right?

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 There is something romantic about the young maiden being in her bedroom.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 She's combing her hair. The windows open.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Someone crawls through the window. Okay, so it's less romantic when you start to think about the real world applications of it.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 But in old timey England, instead of like some creepy dude crawling through your bedroom window, it's mist.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 That's not creepy, right? It's mist.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And the woman's combing her long brown hair.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I picture her looking like that chick from the Phantom of the Opera. Christine Diaye, she's combing her hair.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And then the mist forms behind her. And it's a handsome pale man with fangs.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 But she doesn't see, see, because she's in the mirror. But her blood gets cold.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And she feels the hairs on the back of her neck. Stick up one by one. The chill moves. It moves through her soul.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 She wants to turn around, but she doesn't. She wants to scream, but she hopes that he stays.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 The vampire bears his fangs and she feels his warm breath on her naked neck.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That's hot, right? Now, let me retell that story with this dude's version of the vampire.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Chicks combing her hair. Dude breaks in the window. Eats her flesh.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 That's not romantic. That's not hot. And you're like, Jason, neither was the other one.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Because the other one also was borderline. It was borderline. But at least the girl's flesh was still there, right?

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 She just got a little puncture mark on her neck. Also, these guys bulging veins, red eyeballs.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Yeah, you're not Edward. You can email Transformer--what was it?

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Vampire lore TransformerChangein@gmail.com. Do not expect that you're going to look like Brad Pitt.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 You might look like Brad Pitt after he's been on Mars with no space suit for a while.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 But no, otherwise you will not look like Brad Pitt.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 But before you email this guy, he has some more information for you.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 He says, "I will not tell you my exact location, but I will tell you how to become a vampire.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 My English is not so good, so excuse me." It's weird that he's mentioning that now.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 So we get it, dude. Like, that--I wasn't reading the rest of this email being like,

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 "There's something wrong with my eyes. Do I have like late onset dyslexia?"

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Oh, English isn't his first language. Sorry, I should have figured that out.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Myself, the five previous paragraphs. But you're thinking, Jason, are you making fun of this guy because he can't--

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 No, I don't have a problem that he has a hard time writing English.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But that--so the joke isn't that. That's a clue, actually. That's a clue.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So he says, "My English is not so good, so excuse me." And then he goes on, "If you become a vampire,

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 you can still be an ordinary man, but you will get more power." This is a weird set.

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 So when you think of vampires, assuming you're not thinking of a flesh-eating vampire,

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 you're thinking of regular vampires. What's the power set you think of?

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 If you're trying to imagine yourself as a vampire, what would you, uh, you know, fly?

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Obviously, for me, turning into a misson, going into Christine Diaye's bedroom, what was the power set?

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 This is what he--this is his pitch to us before we emailed the Empire Lord Transformer changing.

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 "If you become a vampire, you can still be an ordinary man, but you will get more power."

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Okay, that's cool.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 "And gain more height." I never thought of vampires as particularly tall.

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 If honestly, I think I've always imagined vampires to be, like, normal height?

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Like, not super tall or super short, just kind of like a dude floating around?

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 I've never thought of, "Oh, no, look at, like, I've never seen a basketball player and be like, 'Yep, he's probably a vampire.'"

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Like, I've never concluded those two.

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 But apparently, that's what this guy wants.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 We go on.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 "You will become much younger than your mates of the same age." I have no idea what that means.

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Me and my buddies are all 23. I get--I become a flesh-eating demon.

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I'm a foot taller, and now I look like I'm 16? Like, I don't get that.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 "If we're all the same age, how can I become younger than them?"

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Wouldn't I just become younger in general?

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 But anyways, anyways, the powers of the Dark Lords confound us all.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 You will never become bald, as well.

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Which is interesting, because if you're already bald, how does that work? Do you grow hair?

114
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 But I don't know.

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I guess if you're a flesh-eating demon with bulging veins and giant red eyes, I'm sure you can grow some follicles.

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And--so you're saying, "Jason, Jason, you're nitpicking. You're being a nitpicker."

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Who doesn't want to be a little bit taller? Who doesn't want to be a little bit younger?

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Who doesn't want to have a full head of hair?

119
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Fair, fair. Your mileage may vary on that.

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 But then we get to the last line.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 But you already became one of these vampires. You already sold it, so you're taller, you're younger, you have a head full of hair.

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And here's--this is not a selling point, guys.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Because what he's trying to do is he's trying to get money from us.

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Apparently, if you email Vampire Lord TransformerChanging@gmail.com, he'll ask you for $500 for a vial of his blood,

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 which you are then to drink, and then you become a vampire.

126
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Now, that's disgusting, and it's--most likely break several biomedical waste laws.

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 But apparently, you send the $500 and you never get the blood.

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And then they add--they--oh, it's caught up in customs. You know, those anti-vampire people working at ICE.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 They'll stop everything, so then you send them another $500 and they never hear from them again.

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 But, Keith Braden goes on to say, "You're gonna get more power. You're gonna get taller. You're not gonna be bald anymore."

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And here's the last part. "You don't need any sex. You will always satisfied."

132
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So what are you supposed to do? You're taller, you're powerful, you're younger, you have a head full of hair.

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 You can't use any of that to get a chick? Who cares if I'm taller if just dudes are like, "Hey, you're tall."

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 It doesn't make any sense. So anyways, but--and I don't even understand, you will always--you will always satisfied.

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So does that mean you're just constantly, like, walking around in a constant state of orgasm?

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 You don't need any sex because every waking moment of your life, which that would get old quick, right?

137
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 But anyways, I could go on and on with this guy's ridiculous email.

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 He does direct us to go to a website called HowToBecomeARealVampire.Weebly.com

139
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 'cause again, if you are one of the forsaken souls trapped between damnation and paradise, you're gonna use Weebly, right?

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 You're gonna use a pre-formatted website. It's defunct. You go there, there's nothing there.

141
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Apparently, the ancient ones can't pay their $6.99 ISP hosting bill.

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 But here's the thing. I could go on and on. That was posted back on October 23rd, 2015 by a guy named Keith Braden.

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Now, there's tons of these out there. I found one from someone named Roland, and he talks about how he wanted to become a vampire,

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 and he got his from VampiresCreedLodge@gmail.com.

145
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And then his girlfriend Vicky shows up, or Victoria, I guess. I shouldn't be that familiar with her. I've never met her.

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 But she also talks about another place. She also talks about VampiresCreed, and that's where she names specifically its $500 to get the blood and everything like that.

147
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And they got it, and it took them 30 minutes, and they became vampires. And then I found this one.

148
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 This one, those were published in 2017. The first one I went over, Keith Braden won. That was October 23rd, 2015.

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So this has been going on for a couple of years. Listen to this one. This one's from 2016.

150
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Being a vampire has certain limitations. There can also be a ton of fun.

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Your extra strengths and abilities can make you successful in almost every endeavor you participated.

152
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And before you know it, the money and acquaintances will come streaming in. That's a good sales pitch. That's a really, really good sales pitch.

153
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 This was, I don't remember exactly what website I found this on, but this was in 2016.

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 You can build wealth and gain prestige and notoriety, and attempt things you may never have considered as a human.

155
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 One thing you will definitely have more of is time. Beef up your education and learn all you wanted to.

156
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Travel the world to see things most people only ever see on TV.

157
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 This is, again, a really, really good sales pitch. This is starting to make me want to eat human flesh.

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 This is going to be especially fun if you turn to share your life with one of us.

159
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Let us show you the wonders of the world. Learn new languages, go skydiving or scuba dive with the sharks.

160
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Visit the African safari. You no longer need to be scared of nature or wildlife.

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 You will have become the world's strongest predator. Have fun with it.

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And your life as a vampire can be more fulfilling than you ever dreamed.

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Explore, experiment, experience, and get excited. There's a big world out there with lots to see and do, and as a vampire, you can do it all.

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 If willing and never ready to be a full-blooded vampire with powers and mighty great skills, then these is the opportunity for you to get transformed and turned into a vampire.

165
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And then he gives you a couple emails you can contact. It's still a scam, right?

166
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But he gives you an email you can contact. kathbrayden@gmail.com

167
00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Kath Brayden in 2015 left a barely coherent English as his second language post, and yet a year later is pitching the same sales deal,

168
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 but speaking as if he spent the past year mastering the English language. It's not just the grammar works, but the imagery is evocative.

169
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 It's not no bald, have hair, be tall. It's... imagine you're in the jungle. You have nothing to fear. You are the alpha predator.

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Now it's possible that kathbrayden is just the name that different writers use to run this scam.

171
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Or... it's very interesting in this email, out of all the stuff he lists. All these activities you can do as a vampire, one of them stuck out, right?

172
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Learn new languages.

173
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Is kathbrayden actually a vampire? Did we actually watch the evolution of a young man who just recently become a vampire?

174
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 He was a native to India. Types out this email on behalf of his Lord Vampire. His Vampire Lord Transformer Changing at gmail.com.

175
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And then in the year in between with his vampire skills learned English more fluently than a lot of English speakers.

176
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Possible it's a dumb scam email that's the most likely answer. But we may have actually seen what being turned into a flesh-eating demon can do.

177
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Because if you don't need to sleep, why not learn another language in between skydiving and scuba diving?

178
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Lots of diving involved when you're a vampire, obviously. Let's go to move on to our next story. You're like, "Jason, are you seriously?"

179
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 You gotta admit that's weird, right? You gotta admit that's weird.

180
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Because I've read so many of these and kathbrayden had two of them. One was written like a bunch of gibberish and the other one was a college level description of...

181
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 So, you know, you guys can just say, "Jason, you just spent 15 minutes talking about scam emails and that was fine. But then when you try to convince me that someone actually turned into a vampire because they can type better late, hey man, I'm just asking questions.

182
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I'm just asking questions. Is it possible that kathbrayden really turned into a vampire and can now write incredibly well?

183
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Stranger things have happened. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

184
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Ivan, I want you to fire up that carbonicopter. We're headed out to Mexico. This is an interesting one. It's one of the things I like most about cryptids and ghosts and spirits is government involvement.

185
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But before we get to that, let's bring that carbonicopter down. We are flying over Laxcala State in central Mexico.

186
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Most of this information I got from a website called MexicoUnexplained.com and specifically this article was written by Robert Bitto.

187
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 So I want to give him credit. It's a really cool website. I've gotten some good stuff from there. We're flying down low over the Laxcala State or the Tlaxa-cala State.

188
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 It's one of the two. But Ivan knows where it's at. He's bringing that helicopter nice and low. We're flying over the valley.

189
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Now this legend is so obscure most people in Mexico have never even heard of it. It predates the Spaniards coming to Mexico. It's super old.

190
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 There is a vampire known as the Tlalipuche. The lali part is an Aztec word for "to illuminate". I don't know what the "puche" is.

191
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Tlalipuche means "to" and I tried to look it up and it had a bunch of urban dictionary stuff. You can imagine what people refer to as a "puche".

192
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 But Tlalipuche was the name for this vampire woman. Almost always a woman. And that's funny because last week we talked about the Korean ghost that's almost always a woman.

193
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 We postulated that maybe if we looked at it most ghosts are women. There's a minority of male ghosts. And I think if we looked in the world of cryptids we may see something similar to that.

194
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And it's a witch. I don't know if witches normally are... This is an interesting one because she kind of blurs the lines.

195
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It's not a witch in the sense that we think of as a witch. It's a subspecies of human. It's a shapeshifter that you are simply born one.

196
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But not like the old tradition where your grandmother was a witch and I'm a witch and now you two are... No, you can go eight generations, zero witches born.

197
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 But then you are cursed to be a Tlalipuche. You don't know it until you hit puberty. And for three days your soul leaves your body.

198
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And at that time the family has to come together and realize that they now have one of these wretched spirits in their house.

199
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Now from a sociological output that kind of makes sense that we have more female versions of these that happens at puberty.

200
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 That you are starting to see these hormonal changes going on in women, young girls. And maybe it was just an excuse to kick them out of the house.

201
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 They are like, "Ah, get out of here. You are probably a witch. Kick them out of the house. Go live with someone else."

202
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 So that's possible. But in these small villages in this central Mexican state, it was a time of great fear.

203
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 When your child hits puberty you don't know if they are going to become one of these creatures.

204
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Because these creatures have a power set. The biggest one is that they are shapeshifters.

205
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Now they can shapeshift into anything. They can shapeshift into a tick or a flea to sneak past guards.

206
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 They can turn into a wolf. They can turn into a larger animal. But 75% - this is again, now this is where we get into just bizarre myths.

207
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Bizarre weirdness. They can turn into any type of animal and really I didn't see any limitations.

208
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 They can turn into a pail of water if they wanted to. But 75% of the time when they shapeshift they become a turkey.

209
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And they are glow-in-the-dark turkey. Whenever they shapeshift they will not just turn into a flea.

210
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 They will turn into a glow-in-the-dark flea. So when they turn into a wolf it's glowing. That's pretty menacing.

211
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 A glow-in-the-dark flea you wouldn't even notice it, right?

212
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 A glow-in-the-dark wolf would give you nightmares. "Glow-in-the-dark turkey."

213
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Like I want to eat that. I would want to eat that. It's out of curiosity to see if my poop would glow in the dark too.

214
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 But anyway 75% of the time it's a glow-in-the-dark turkey. Because these things can be born into any family at any given time,

215
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 sometimes they'll go to war with each other. They have hunting grounds. They're solitary. They do not have the whole like,

216
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 "Oh, witches unite. Let's all hold hands. Pray to mumra." None of that stuff.

217
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 They have hunting grounds. If two are in the same city one of them is either leaving or getting murdered by the opposing witch.

218
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Because they have a very, very specialized diet. Now they're not just witches, but remember this is vampire week.

219
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 They're vampire witches. They don't eat flesh like Kate Brayden. They drink blood. However, they have to kill a baby a month to stay alive.

220
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 That's a doomsday clock. That's a curse. That's an absolute curse. Like, you know, my scenario in the beginning where like,

221
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 "Listat is like flying through your window." Some people find that sexy. I don't know. I might if I'm a vampire.

222
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 But I'm not. It's not sexy. But I haven't eaten a baby a month at all. And there's no work around to that.

223
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 If they go a month without eating a baby, they die. And you don't want to die. So they eat babies. That's horrific.

224
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 You know, when angels sitting around on Buffy being like, "Oh, I can't. I don't want to drink human blood."

225
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 You're like, "Dude, just drink a little bit of human blood." Like, it's not going to kill you. It might kill your victim.

226
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 But you know, just drink the blood of bad guys and stuff like that. There's no bad babies. There's no like, there are no bad boy babies.

227
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Although that is the name of my new band, Bad Boy Babies.

228
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 To do the transformation, it's where they can transform their bodies. But to do it, they have this unique ritual.

229
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 First, they have to go into their kitchen and start a fire, which is always a bad way to start a ritual, right?

230
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 That is the reason your parents aren't kicking you out of the house because you're a hard to handle teenager.

231
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It's because you keep setting fires. But once a month, you set a little fire in your kitchen and you walk into it.

232
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 You sit down. You pull your legs off. And then you turn into a turkey and walk away.

233
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Once you're a turkey, you can shape shift into other stuff. But then your legs are just sitting by this fire.

234
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 That makes your legs vulnerable. And sometimes people will try to destroy the legs to prevent you from turning back into a human.

235
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 But that's just bizarre. You're walking into a house. You're like, "Hey, has anyone seen Nancy?"

236
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 "Oh, are you kidding me?" You see two legs sitting in the kitchen. The kitchen's on fire.

237
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 You're like, "Guys, come on. We've got to do something about this unholy creature living under this roof."

238
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 "But she's your daughter. I don't care. She's a turkey."

239
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Okay, fine. You sit down. You watch television for a while until you hear the turkey. You see the glow outside.

240
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 I don't know why making fun of this turkey just ain't a baby. The guy would be like, "Oh, my daughter's coming home."

241
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 "Oh, wait. My daughter just ate someone else's daughter." But anyways, the turkey has this ritual.

242
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Well, it will find a baby in a house. And then it will have to fly. Oh, yeah, it can fly as a turkey.

243
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 This turkey can fly around. Which, I mean, that's nothing. It's already taken its legs off and glow in the dark.

244
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I can allow a turkey to fly around. Turkey has to fly over the house, making the shape of a cross, which is weird.

245
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Because normally crosses and vampires don't go well together, but this one has to make the sign of the cross.

246
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Then it will sneak into your house. It's looking at your baby. If it can't get into the house, that was a weird way to say that.

247
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 If it can't get into the house, it can turn into the flea or the tick and slide underneath your door.

248
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And once it's in your house, you're doomed. Actually, once it knows you have a baby in your house, you're already doomed.

249
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 You can stay up all night long waiting for this thing. But once it's in your house, it will release a noxious knockout gas.

250
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 It'll put everyone in the house to sleep. And then the turkey will walk up to the crib, turn back into a human, now the legs are back on.

251
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And will kill your child and then sneak out. If you are able to prevent it from getting in the house, because it's interesting,

252
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 even though this story predates the Spaniards, it has a connection to Western vampires.

253
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Garlic keeps it away. You can put a steak through its heart, wooden steak through its heart to kill it.

254
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 You have to get pretty close to it, though, obviously, to do that.

255
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Which you could say that's cultural contamination from the West, or you could say that those things actually do affect vampiric life forms,

256
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 and that's why you can have a culture, an ocean away that has similar things.

257
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 But anyways, you can stick a steak through its heart if you get close enough, but it also can turn into anything.

258
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 If you're able to keep it out of your house, a lot of times it will then destroy your crops.

259
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 It will transform into a wolf and eat your cows, or transform into a donkey and step all over your crops,

260
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 which technically you could probably do that as a wolf or even a flying turkey.

261
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 But it will basically, it's coming for your kid and it has to eat a kid a month.

262
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And if it can't eat your kid, if you're able to keep it away, it will destroy everything.

263
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Now this thing, there's a great scene in the original Alien where they're talking about the xenomorph, they find it has acid for blood,

264
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 and one of the characters goes, "It's a hell of a defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it."

265
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And that's true. Something that actually can do more damage as it's dying is, that's an amazing defense mechanism.

266
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 This thing, this thing gives the xenomorph a run for its money.

267
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 This thing also has some hilarious ways to kill it though.

268
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 One of the things I always joke about cryptids where I'm like, "Oh yeah, you know, and there's just cryptid in Brazil.

269
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Like if it's coming at you, you don't show your shiny teeth or you lay on the ground, and it just always this weird stuff.

270
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Take your left shoe off and throw it under their right foot and then..."

271
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 This is the perfect example of that.

272
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 To take out one of these creatures, like to stick it through the heart, or to decapitate it, which is another way to kill it,

273
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 you can't do it in combat. You have to freeze it in place.

274
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And once these guys are frozen, if you can freeze them, anything can kill them, technically.

275
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Like if they're frozen, you could shoot them with a shotgun.

276
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 But if they're not frozen and they're coming at you, it's a weird catch.

277
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 You have to decapitate them or stick them with a wood and stake.

278
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 If they're frozen, you can still use those things. They don't become immune to that.

279
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 They're like, "Ah, wood is now my strength."

280
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 But once they're frozen, they're actually completely vulnerable.

281
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 You can chop them over the chainsaw if you can get close enough.

282
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Which you could, because they're frozen, but I mean, that doesn't still mean you should walk around with chainsaws.

283
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 You have to freeze it in place. Here's a couple different ways to do that.

284
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Take a white handkerchief, put a rock in it, tie it, and then throw it at her.

285
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 A hitster, she'll freeze in place, and then you take your time, chop its head off.

286
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Take your hat off, whoop whoop whoop.

287
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Put it on the ground with the top of the hat touching the ground.

288
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 You take a knife out, you stab the hat.

289
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Freezes are in place. That's just weird. Those are both weird things that can...

290
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Whatever part of the legend, like if you made that up, someone would be like,

291
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 "So, Papa, how do we stop these things?" And he's like, "Well, little one, you uh...

292
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 He's looking around the room, he sees a hat, and he's like, "You take a hat, and uh...

293
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 He looks over, sees a knife, and then you take a knife, and then he looks down to the ground, and he's like, "Uh..."

294
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 So I mean, like, did you just make it up? Or if these things are real, how did they figure it out?

295
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 How many times were they like, "Oh no, she's coming," and they threw their hat on the ground and get murdered?

296
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And the next guy was like, "Oh no, no, she's coming." He takes his hat off the ground,

297
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 and then throws a knife at the hat and gets murdered, and then, eventually, over the course of 10,000 years,

298
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 through human evolution, the person evolves to the point where they know,

299
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 "Oh, if I take my hat off and put a knife through it, then she freezes in place."

300
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Just like vultures learning how to drop turtles.

301
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Then, this is my favorite one. This is my favorite one to stop this one,

302
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 because it's honestly the most troublesome one. However, if you don't have a handkerchief, you don't have a hat,

303
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 and you're trying to stop one of these things from killing you, because they do kill humans as well.

304
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 They just need to kill a baby a month. They can kill as many people as they want.

305
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 They just have to kill at least one baby a month to survive.

306
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 You may not have a handkerchief. You may not have a hat, but you know what I can almost guarantee you having is a pair of pants.

307
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 So, if you ever see one of these things coming at you, what you do is you take your pants off,

308
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 which is not a good defense strategy, right? You take your pants off.

309
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 You then have to pull, while this creature is coming at you, right?

310
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 You take your pants off, which already takes a while.

311
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Take your pants off, you pull one leg through. So now one leg is inside out.

312
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 So now you basically have the two legs going long ways.

313
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And then you throw a matter. Throw your jeans at her.

314
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 One leg's normal, the other leg's inside out, and it hits her.

315
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 She freezes in place. It would honestly be quicker to just go to a hat store and buy a hat.

316
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Right? Because there's no scenario where you're being chased by a creature that serves the Dark Lord,

317
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 and you're going to have time to take your pants off.

318
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Just taking your pants off alone takes a while.

319
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I think it at least takes me like 30 seconds to take my pants off.

320
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And that's standing still. If I'm being chased, it's going to take more.

321
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And then usually, 30 seconds with my shoes already off, if I've got to take my shoes off too, we're looking at like a minute and a half.

322
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 You know how fast turkeys fly, dude? They don't.

323
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 But I mean, you know how fast vampire witch turkeys fly faster than a minute and a half?

324
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 But here's the thing. You go, "Okay, you talking about defense mechanisms, take your pants off, throw it at her, throw in handkerchiefs full of rocks and stuff like that?"

325
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 That's not a big deal. Here's the problem.

326
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 You throw it at her, throw the jeans at her, you chop her head off, you save your baby, you save the people in your house.

327
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Now you become one.

328
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 That's the second way this can happen. You can be born one, and if you kill one, you have to eat a baby a month until you either can't live with yourself anymore.

329
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Somebody else kills you.

330
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 That is a defense mechanism. I don't think I've ever come across a cryptid.

331
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I don't think I've ever come across that outside of fiction, where if you kill the creature, you become the creature.

332
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 There actually is a really good movie called "Don't Kill It" starring Dolph Lundgren.

333
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 It was dope. It felt like it should have been the pilot for a television series. You should check it out.

334
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 "Dead Rabbit Recommends Don't Kill It."

335
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 But yeah, it was the same thing. In that one, if you kill the demon, you get possessed by the demon.

336
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And it was an interesting movie. I liked it. I watched it when I was trapped in the airport when that massive snowstorm hit.

337
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 But this is... I don't want to say this is real life, because this is a possibly fictional creature, but in the legend, this is real life.

338
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 So if it's sneaking into your house, you have to make a judgment call.

339
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 You can try to keep it out of your house. You can possibly kill your kid.

340
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 But if you kill it, then you simply become one of them yourselves. Now you are hungering for the blood of the innocent.

341
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And it's like an addiction. You can say, "Well, I just won't do it. I'll just die after that first month, but the hunger becomes so intense."

342
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 You'll find yourself setting a little fire in your kitchen while the family is asleep, taking your legs off, transforming into a glowing turkey to find your own feast.

343
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Interesting cryptid all around, but it becomes an even more bizarre story in the 1950s.

344
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 At Lux Call Estate in Central Mexico, you had a state official just checking paperwork, stamp and stuff, stamp, put it away, stamp, put it away.

345
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 This state worker is going through death certificates, birth certificates, things like that, from villages in his state.

346
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And he starts to notice something on birth certificates. Now it was on all sorts of birth certificates.

347
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I don't know if other people had this, but it was mostly babies were having their cause of death on their birth certificate.

348
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Chupadou Poor Labruja. What? This must be a typo and he looks at another birth certificate.

349
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Chupadou Poor Labruja. In English, that means "sucked by the witch."

350
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 He reports it to his superiors. He's like, "Hey, we're getting some weird death certificates from a couple villages."

351
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 And he shows them to them. "What? Sucked by a witch? What's going on?"

352
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 They looked through them and it was mostly babies, but there were some adults, some teenagers.

353
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 So they sent state officials out there. They sent them out to the villages.

354
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 "Hey, what's going on? We see that you're writing down that these people are being killed by witches."

355
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Because again, this is a super obscure legend. Up here, if there's a death certificate that's said, "ripped apart by Sasquatch,"

356
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 the county commissioner would be like, "What's a Sasquatch?" I mean, you wouldn't believe it.

357
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 He wouldn't be like, "Oh, okay, it's done. Put it away." He wouldn't believe it, but he'd at least know what it was.

358
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 The state officials, they're like, "We don't even know what you're talking about. There's a witch sucking people out here."

359
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 And the villagers would tell them about this glowing turkey that was flying around.

360
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And they basically state officials started an investigation. What happened was you were finding these babies and these adults.

361
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 These bodies were being found with severe bruising and discoloration of the upper body.

362
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And the time of death was usually at night.

363
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 And when someone in a corner was taking a look at these bodies, they're like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night, probably got attacked by the witch."

364
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 So they put on their--and now they had been filling out these death certificates with that for a while.

365
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And people were just processing them, not looking at them. It wasn't until some state worker took a double look and started going through the files and finding a lot of these.

366
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 The state investigators got involved and eventually they said, "Listen, we understand your small town, you have your rural superstitions and all that stuff.

367
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 We're not going to tell you what to do, what to put on your death certificates, but if you put, sucked by a witch, on another death certificate, we're going to come out and we're going to investigate it.

368
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 And we're going to do that for every single time you put that on your death certificate.

369
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 We're going to send a team out, we're going to send out some police officers, they're going to interview everybody, we're going to find out what's going on.

370
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 So what do you want to do? After that, that stopped appearing on death certificates.

371
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Now, there could be a couple reasons what was going on.

372
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 One, it's possible that this was a natural death and you had this town that was superstitious and the corner was putting down, sucked by a witch.

373
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Possible.

374
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 You have an idea that there is a witch, a shape-shifting glow-in-the-dark turkey flying around killing people and these were accurate death certificates.

375
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 It's not put on there anymore. The police aren't going out there to investigate these deaths, but it doesn't mean that the deaths stopped.

376
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 It just means they stopped being reported in the way that they were being reported.

377
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 It's possible that they just didn't want to have the investigators come out because the townspeople knew how things would play out.

378
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 They keep putting sucked by a witch. They know that the witch is killing them and they keep putting that down and some police investigators come out to get the whole story.

379
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 They begin interviewing families, they begin pestering witnesses trying to get to the truth.

380
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 The townspeople already know the truth, they don't need a police investigation.

381
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 There's a vampire witch there. She's been there for a long time.

382
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 The police would eventually find her, try to kill her. She'd get away.

383
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Maybe she murders them and back up arrives. Maybe they continue to pursue her until finally they kill her and justice is served.

384
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 The townspeople would know what was going to happen next.

385
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 And even though their town would be safe, that young police officer who did manage to take this witch down goes back to his hometown, goes back to his old life.

386
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And then a month later, late at night, in his house back in the big city, he begins to develop a taste for the blood of a child.
