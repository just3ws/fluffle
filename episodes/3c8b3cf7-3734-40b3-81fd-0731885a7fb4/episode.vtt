00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 Finding suitable mental health medications can be a challenge.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.360
 The Genesight Test may help.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.620
 Did you know that genetics can play an important role in gaining insight on how a person may

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.640
 respond to various medications?

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.340
 Understanding this may help reduce medication trial and error.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.920
 Genesight is a genetic test that analyzes variations in DNA.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.960
 It shows how genes may affect someone's metabolism or responds to medications commonly prescribed

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.400
 to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.800

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 A "mericle drug" is on the market, but could it be used to control the human population?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.640
 And then we travel back to the year 1923 to visit a log cabin.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.260
 It's been a long abandon, holding nothing but a skeleton and torment from beyond the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.560
 grave today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:59.240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.360
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.960
 I'm drenched in sweat.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.200
 Yes, it's if you've been listening since episode 1.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320
 It's summertime and I'm recording with no fans on.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 We're also taking a break from Alien Disclosure Week as well, but we will finish it up tomorrow

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880
 with the New York Times.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.440
 They're going to take a look at those New York Times articles about you put disclosure

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.040
 very, very weird information in there that not a lot of people are noticing or at least

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 talking about.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.200
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Wyemop.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 Gene Mab.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.720
 Wyemop, thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.400
 She actually recommended a story to me today about Jack Parsons.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.080
 It's funny, I've read about Jack Parsons a lot.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.240
 I don't really think I've mentioned him on the show.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.480
 He was the guy who was a big part of JPL, big part of early American rocket technology

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.680
 and a super weirdo occultist dude who used to run around with L. Ron Hubbard and I think

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.280
 was Bing and his wife or L. Ron Hubbard was Bing and Jack Parsons' wife or something

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 like that.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.200
 And so yeah, if I can find a really cool, because I've read a lot about him, if I can

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.680
 find a cool new angle to really talk about and she kind of led me on to want to look

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.680
 into it, we may end up talking about Jack Parsons if you're familiar with that.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.960
 I'm looking for a new angle on it though.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.280
 That all being said, Queen Mab, thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.440
 You're going to be our person behind the cockpit pilots, what they normally called.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.880
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's okay too.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.580
 Just help get the word out about the show.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.880
 Talk about it online, talk about it to your friends.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.240
 That also really, really helps out a lot.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.360
 So Queen Mab, let's hop into Jason's Loppy.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.800
 We're going to go for a little drive.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.720
 First off, we're going to drive to a local hospital.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.240
 A local hospital and it's bustling with activity.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.320
 We walk in and there's people sitting around with broken legs.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.200
 It's like something you'd see in like an episode of ER.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.400
 There's like a guy with his arm in a sling.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.000
 And then I guess people dying because it's a hospital and the baby's being born.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.240
 So you know the universe balances out.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.160
 But we're here for a specific reason.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.280
 This guy is being brought in by authorities and they're like, "Hey, we got a call.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.520
 This guy wants to kill himself.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.480
 This guy is trying to kill himself."

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.320
 So we're like, "Oh, that's weird."

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.320
 That's weird that they said that out loud and we can identify this guy.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.480
 But we follow Queen Mab, myself and you are also welcome.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.760
 HIPPA laws be damned.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.760
 We walk into this guy's room.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.480
 This guy is completely despondent.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.640
 He's going to kill himself.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.880
 And the doctor goes, "Hmm, I have this thing right here.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.600
 It'll cure your illness."

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.320
 And he pulls out a little nasal spray bottle and he sticks it up the guy's nose and he

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.840
 goes, "Psst, psst."

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.040
 And then he puts it in the other nostril, "Psst, psst."

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.160
 Gives him two sprays and the guy goes, "Whoa, dude.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 Whoa, what?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.440
 I totally don't want to kill myself now."

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.480
 "Doc, that's amazing."

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.240
 Doctors like, "This isn't the end.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240
 You need to do therapy.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.440
 We need to look at some other stuff."

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.000
 But it is amazing.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.680
 The doctor holds out the soul inhaler for us to see.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.440
 This stuff is real.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.440
 It's not only...

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.440
 So here's the thing.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.200
 We always hear about, like Elon Musk just talked about putting a chip in people's brains

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.400
 so they can control their mood.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.280
 That's like a theoretical thing they're working on.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280
 What I just described to you is real.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.760
 Not only is it real, it's in use today.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.240
 It's from Johnson & Johnson's.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.240
 It's called Spravado.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.880
 And it is a nasal.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.760
 It's an incredibly rapid release antidepressant.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.280
 Most antidepressants take a couple weeks to build up.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.480
 But this stuff, "Psst, psst."

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.480
 It's a rapid...

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.240
 I mean, that's faster than fast.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.560
 They're like, "Get out of the way, fast-acting antidepressant.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.840
 I'm a rapid antidepressant."

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.840
 Spravado.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.880
 They came up with it back in the '90s, but back in March 2019, the FDA said, "We approve

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.880
 this.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.240
 You can actually use this on people."

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.280
 Trump's really wanted it to be in use at VA hospitals.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.000
 We have a horrible suicide epidemic with our veterans here in the United States.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.240
 It's absolutely tragic.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.000
 It's heartbreaking.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.920
 And when the history books are written about the COVID crisis, long after everything has

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.880
 settled down, I think one of the things we're going to see is accurate suicide statistics.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.360
 I think no one's really reporting those yet.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.160
 Maybe we don't have the numbers to really match them, but even before COVID, we were

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.560
 seeing suicide rate going up 30% in the past 10 years.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.880
 In the article from Medical Express that was written about this, the article was, "Nasal

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.720
 spray approved for treating suicidal people."

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.880
 This was written by Cynthia Coons.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.760
 It specifically said, "Because COVID-19 has caused a massive increase in depression."

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.320
 I think when we're really honest about the COVID crisis and the cost of everything that's

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.640
 been going on, we're going to find just massive suicide rates, which is tragic.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.120
 So, Sprovato, they really want to start using this stuff now.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.800
 Since March, 6,000 people, since March of 2019, 6,000 people have been treated with this.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.120
 You're suicidal.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.720
 They sprayed up your nose.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.760
 You're not suicidal, right now, at least.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.400
 It can be a long-term thing that you're dealing with depression and things like that.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.800
 So I read that and I thought, "That's amazing."

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.200
 But then the little conspiracy theorist thing popped up in my head.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.440
 As a drug, this is great.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.240
 A possible short-term cure for a very serious illness.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.560
 But then I thought, "Hmm, I'll stroke my little beard.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.600
 Queen Mab, let's hop back in there, Jason Jalapy.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.120
 We're going to travel to the year 2025 right at the same hospital."

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.120
 But now it looks like something out of New Detroit.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120
 It's straight up Robocop.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.240
 There's like graffiti on the top floor.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.560
 We're like, "How did they do that?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.560
 How did they get way up there?"

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.560
 There's a bunch of punks.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.560
 They're like, "What?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.960
 Yeah, they have the green mohawks with the spikes and stuff like that.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.800
 And their spikes have spikes.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.800
 It's the craziest thing.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.440
 A genetically modified hair in the year 2025."

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.160
 We see people being dragged forcibly into the hospital by the police.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
 And the police are like, "What?

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.400
 You don't follow whatever laws we're talking about?

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.600
 It's the year 2025.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.080
 You don't eat yogurt on Sundays."

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.080
 And the guy's like, "No, it's disgusting.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.080
 I never eat yogurt."

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.360
 And they're like, "Uh-huh."

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.160
 And you see the doctor, but now he's wearing a black leather medical coat.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.400
 He's all evil looking.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.960
 And he pulls out a little black colored nasal spray.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.840
 And he puts it up your nose and you're like, "No, no.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.840
 I'll never eat yogurt."

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.640
 Oh, whatever you say, master.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.640
 Whatever you say.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.080
 Apparently now you just become a goon.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.400
 This is what I was thinking.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.160
 It's a fast releasing antidepressant.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.760
 But what happened?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.480
 If you were to cap fully on to cover up for spiked mohawk, what would stop the government

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.560
 from being like, "You're a dissident.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.440
 You're not following what the government does.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.600
 We're going to spray this up your nose."

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.600
 Is that alarmist?

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.760
 Is that alarmist?

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.760
 It would work though.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.360
 Like let's say you were out protesting against the government.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.600
 And they're like, "Mmm-mm."

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.840
 They have just a giant cannon that's in the shape of a nasal spray bottle.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.520
 Two cops have to jump up and down on it and it's all "psh, psh, psh" into the crowd.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520
 They're like, "Uhhh."

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.200
 And then they're just peaceful.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.760
 To put a chip in someone's brain, like that's really hard to do against your will, right?

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.760
 You're like, "No, no.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.000
 You'll never take me alive."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.240
 And then like in the ambulance, "What?

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.240
 No way."

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.120
 And then they're dragging you in the operating room, "Uhhh."

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.720
 And then they're putting the oxygen mask on you, like slapping it away.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.840
 It would take hours to do, right?

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.720
 Or they could just come to your house and spray you in the nose with it.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.480
 Or my idea where they're jumping up and down on it.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.600
 Entire neighborhoods get fumigated.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.320
 Fast acting antidepressant.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.040
 It's great for people who need it.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:44.240
 But what's to stop the brutal totalitarians of the year 2025 from using it against us

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.800
 as a weapon of war?

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.360
 So let me explain a little bit about what this is.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.840
 This far into the segment.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.440
 People are like, "What is this man he's talking about?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.760
 There's no magical stuff."

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.760
 It's ketamine.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.800
 Technically, it's a cousin or a relative to ketamine.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.080
 It's maybe like a sister-in-law to ketamine.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.760
 But it's a drug people now use just to get blotto, right?

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.600
 They want to go to the k-hole.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.040
 It's horse tranquilizer, but for your nose.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.040
 And you go, "Shh."

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.840
 And it basically gets you high.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.120
 You get instantly sedated and you just kind of just want to go with the flow, man.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.320
 You just want to eat pancakes.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.560
 It's that.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.760
 And it's very expensive.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.120
 It starts at $4,700 a month.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.760
 You get a little spray bottle of it.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.680
 In Britain, they've already said it's too expensive.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.440
 If you're currently using it with your doctor's permission, we'll pay for it, but we're not

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.760
 allowing anyone else to use it.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.400
 In America, they want to make it more open than that.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.480
 But so that's what I should have explained that all earlier.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.040
 What's interesting is when I was reading this article, I came across this sentence after

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.560
 I had already imagined my Robocop-esque future with a bunch of robots dragging us out of our

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.560
 houses.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.080
 They're spraying ketamine right in our faces.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080
 They go to the Kentucky Derby.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.280
 The horses are all falling asleep, but one of them is wearing a gas mask.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.360
 They're like, "Good ol' Gassy wins again."

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.800
 Everyone's like, "Oh, why do I always bet against Gassy?

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.960
 I know the robots are going to show up."

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.680
 After I had already imagined that future, when I was rereading the article, I came across

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.680
 this sentence.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.320
 "In its studies, Johnson and Johnson found those who got the drug had a rapid reduction

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.360
 in the severity of their thinking.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:24.320
 Although the results didn't differ in a statistically significant way from patients given a placebo."

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.000
 That's an interesting little thing.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.200
 It's not saying that it doesn't work.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.720
 It's saying that if you walked up to someone and just sprayed them with a nasal spray that

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.320
 just had water in it, it would also statistically have a chance of snapping them out of whatever

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.720
 deep despair they're in at that moment.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.480
 Again, suicide ideation is a long-term thing.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.080
 Sanitary killer shelf is a long-term thing.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.800
 Therapy has to be included in this.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.600
 But this obviously helps in some fashion.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.880
 They have made it available.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.680
 However, we must keep it out of the hands of the Robocops of the world.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.800
 Because once Elon Musk invents those, it's the last annual here.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.440
 We've always been afraid of the New World Order.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.320
 You never knew you were supposed to be afraid of the Nose World Order.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:17.320
 Huh?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.760
 Let's go ahead and hop on that carbon helicopter.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.600
 We're leaving behind the futuristic Hellscape of 2025.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.160
 They're trying to shoot mis-status.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.480
 But luckily, the wind is at our fronts.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.480
 Is that a good thing?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.840
 That means it's blowing it away from us?

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:36.320
 The Robocops are like, "Probably shouldn't have built nose receptors in me."

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.520
 We're flying away.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.040
 We're going back to old-timey Nevada.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.320
 Old-timey Eureka Nevada, to be precise.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.720
 It's the year 1871.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.920
 This was actually a request from Kent Allard.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.960
 So Kent, thank you so much for this story.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.320
 It's a great story.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320
 He sent this to me.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.480
 He also sent me another story that it's going to take me a long time to do.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.160
 But it's one that I had lost.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.440
 It's a story that I had long before I was doing the podcast.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.560
 Probably back in 2011, 2012, I read this amazing story online.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.280
 I don't even know how I'm going to present it to you.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.680
 I thought it was gone forever, because you know how the internet can be.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680
 But no, he found it.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.400
 So hats off to you with that, too, Kent Allard.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.800
 We're flying low over the Nevada desert.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.200
 Look out for that canyon.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.720
 And there's a little wood cabin.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.960
 Just stand in there.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.840
 Been all deserted and stuff.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.840
 Wind.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.840
 Sand.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.040
 Sand doesn't make a noise, so I had no sound effect for that.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.920
 But we're walking across the sand.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.920
 [Sounds of sand]

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.800
 And we walk into this cabin.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.800
 [Sounds of sand]

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.360
 And there is a pirate in there.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.360
 Arr, matey.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.360
 It's time for me to leave.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.360
 And he leaves.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360
 And we're like, OK.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:50.160
 And we also see-- the pirate didn't happen, but we also see a skeleton just sitting there.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.920
 Technically, skeletons wouldn't sit there, right?

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.640
 It would just be like a pile of bones.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.520
 Maybe the skull's on the table, and the rib cage is in the chair, and then there's just

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.240
 a bunch of random bones sitting on the ground.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.240
 But you get the point, right?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.880
 Even if you just saw a skull, you would be like, well, where's the rest of the bones?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.720
 You understand it's a dead human.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.640
 We're walking around this log cabin, and you lean against it.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.880
 You go after a long day of meeting a pirate in a room full of a skeleton.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.080
 You kind of lean against the wall.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.080
 Arr, this is exactly how I expected my Thursday to be.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.120
 And you feel something kind of like nudge against your elbow.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.120
 You're like, well, that's weird.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:26.880
 And you turn around, and you see a piece of paper pushed into the space between the logs.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.560
 This is actually a real letter that was found in a log cabin in Eureka, Nevada.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.720
 This was published in a newspaper called The Crisfield Times.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.980
 It was in the August 18th, 1923 edition.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:43.120
 This is compiled from a book called History of Crisfield and surrounding areas of Maryland's

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.120
 Eastern Shore.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.640
 This is a newspaper in Crisfield, Maryland.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.160
 So we start reading this letter.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.120
 We sit down altogether.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.120
 We're reading this letter.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:58.160
 After four years of wandering, I am back in the cabin, which I built six years ago.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:05.760
 Surely, those six years of hell should go toward the final reckoning.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.200
 That's a way to start a letter, right?

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.680
 Like that gets your attention right there.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.600
 There's a skeleton in a room.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.600
 There's a letter in the wall.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.600
 Right there.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.600
 Life sucks.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.520
 But maybe it's a down payment on the damnation that is awaiting me.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.520
 Dude.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.000
 Unfortunately, this guy is not an author.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.720
 He's a pile of bones, but we'll find out why he's a pile of bones.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.600
 He continues with the letter with this, "I wonder if anyone will ever read this, or will

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.880
 it rot beside me?

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.660
 Seems that I could lie down easier if I write out that which I could not dare to whisper

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.320
 since I did it."

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.880
 He goes on to say that his name is Les Singleton.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.000
 So we turn to the skeleton and go, "Hi, Les.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.520
 His name is Les Singleton.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.640
 He was born in Crisfield, Maryland."

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.040
 That's why they're reporting it in that newspaper.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.760
 He enlisted in the Confederacy and suffered two wounds during the war.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.640
 And then eventually his parents died.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:04.200
 Confederacy lost the war and he was looking around the burning remnants of Maryland and

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.480
 he goes, "So he goes to Nevada."

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.680
 He ends up in Eureka in the year 1871.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:15.000
 And he gets a job as a feeder at a furnace in Richmond.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.960
 So a feeder, despite if you Google "feeder" today, which is someone who feeds another

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.920
 human until they become immobile and then feeds them more.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.640
 That's one of the worst fetishes.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.280
 Okay, that's not true.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.280
 There's a lot worse.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.280
 But that one's bad.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.120
 So, but basically it's already been burned in my head so as I'm reading this article

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.360
 I just imagine this man throwing cheeseburgers into an 800 pound person's mouth.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.520
 But that's not what he's doing because that fetish wasn't around back then.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.360
 They didn't have enough food to have that.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.800
 He is a feeder at a furnace in Richmond.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.520
 And he's sitting there, he's throwing coal with a shovel.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.400
 He makes that noise for eight hours a day.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.000
 Throwing it into the furnace, the fire.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Burning it up.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 He's like, "This isn't a bad job.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.880
 It's just making me awfully hungry for cheeseburgers.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.480
 The big boilers looks like a giant fat dude."

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.400
 It's like, "Someday people will pay money to watch me do this."

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.720
 So anyways, while he's imagining the future of the internet, his coworker, John Murphy,

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.960
 is a total jerk to him.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.080
 He's constantly berating him, pushing him around, which is not something you...

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.280
 It's bad enough to have a workplace bully when you're near a giant furnace.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.920
 That's not especially where you don't want someone of whole pranks.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.320
 But they're dropping hot coals down your overalls.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.920
 You're like, "Ow, ow, ow!"

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.600
 And it sounds funny, but really you're suffering third degree burns on your spine.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600
 Ah!

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.800
 Guys, constantly picking on him, though.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.800
 John Murphy's constantly picking on Les Singleton.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.080
 And then one day it escalates to physical violence.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.240
 John actually slaps Les Singleton and Les Singleton falls to the ground.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.240
 He's like, "Ahh!"

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.800
 Which would, if I imagine, is super hot.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.480
 He falls hands first right into the coals.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.480
 "Ahh!

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.920
 I should get up a little bit faster than I am, but I'm going to get up slowly so I can

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.720
 contemplate my revenge."

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:15.920
 Because at this point, he says, "Murphy signed his death warrant then and there."

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.960
 So his letter, he's detailing all this stuff.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.760
 And the second that hands relate on him, he's like, "I was going to kill this dude.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.760
 There was no- This dude was not walking away from this."

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.480
 But the thing is, is that John Murphy could tell that he finally pushed Lil Les Singleton

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.840
 too far.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.840
 Les did nothing.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.560
 And John Murphy starts going, "Dude, what are you going to do, man?

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.080
 Like I just pushed you.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.080
 Look at your hands.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.080
 Look at your hands.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.520
 They're all smoldering, little like smokes coming out of them.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.240
 Cartoon smoke lines are coming out of your hands right now, bro.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.240
 What are you going to do?

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240
 What are you going to do, man?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.240
 Huh?

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.240
 What are you going to do?

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.320
 And Les Singleton just is staring at him."

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.800
 Here's another quote from his letter.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:00.640
 "He taunted me for being a coward, and I restrained myself with the greatest difficulty.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.320
 Consoling myself with thoughts of the terrible revenge I would wreak upon him.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320
 The idea struck me.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:14.080
 It would be an easy matter to strike him on the head and throw his body into the furnace.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.880
 Detection would be impossible."

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.400
 So imagine now Les Singleton is staring at John Murphy, right?

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.680
 And he's imagining that speech in his head.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:28.160
 But in real life, it's just John Murphy going, "He taunted me for being a coward, and I restrained

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.520
 myself with the greatest difficulty.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.200
 Consoling myself with thoughts of the terrible revenge I would wreak upon him.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200
 The idea struck me.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.520
 It would be an easy matter to strike him on the head and tell him to come out here to

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.520
 laugh at you."

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.080
 I can just imagine those two things happening at once.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.680
 You had that inner monologue, he's just seething.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.280
 Steam's coming out of his ears, steam's coming off of his hands, and then just this dude pointing

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.800
 and laughing.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.360
 Two weeks later though, Les has his chance.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.680
 He looks around, huh?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.560
 And he, bonk, hits him on the back of the head with a shovel so hard that it kills him.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.400
 Now, knowing modern science, he probably didn't kill him, which makes the next thing even

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.880
 more gruesome.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.760
 It probably knocked him out.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.240
 I mean, I don't know, maybe modern shovels you get at Home Depot are a lot lighter than

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.960
 the shovels they had.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.960
 Back in 1871, your grandpa's like, "What?

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.960
 These shovels today suck.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.800
 Back of my day, a shovel weighed a thousand pounds."

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.560
 Probably knocked him unconscious.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.360
 Probably didn't kill him though.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.840
 So when he picks up John Murphy's body and throws him into the furnace, there's a pretty

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.040
 good chance that he was still alive when his body began to burn in the fire.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.440
 Let's go back to this letter here.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440
 I really love the letter.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.680
 I love, because I love the way that he's described everything.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.520
 I love manifestos to begin with.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.120
 I kind of collect them.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.480
 I love the language that he uses.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:57.160
 That's why I'm really referencing this letter a lot, but quote, "The next day was truly

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160
 hell.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:05.800
 It seemed as if every shovelful I flung into the feed hole of the furnace struck on Murphy's

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:13.880
 body and the bubbling of the blast took itself a speech and upbraided me for my wickedness."

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.240
 When barring out time came, I try to look that up.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.240
 I don't know what that means.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.480
 I'm imagining that's when you're like pulling out the stuff you've been smelting based

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.880
 on the context of this next sentence.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:29.080
 When barring out time came, it seemed I was raking human bones instead of clinkers of

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.080
 iron.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.480
 Hallucination fixed itself upon my brain and I saw Murphy materialize that every part

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.880
 of the furnace.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:43.600
 I got such a mania for looking into the feed hole that I soon became incapacitated for

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.720
 further work.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:51.440
 Then I built this cabin and went into the charcoal burning business.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.320
 That's the last part's not a joke.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.320
 That actually happened.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.760
 If I was being tormented by the flames, if I burned a man alive or dead, it doesn't

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.760
 matter.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.120
 If I killed a man and hit his body in the flames, every time I'm doing something flame-related

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.520
 I see him out of the corner of my eye wanting a cigarette.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.680
 There's a little tiny jawn on the match head shaking his finger at me.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:15.520
 I would not be like, "Oh man, I'm having such horrible visions at the feeder factory or

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.960
 wherever I work.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.200
 All those flames, they remind me of that man I murdered.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.080
 I'm going to go get a job at another flame-related place.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.840
 I'm going to go get a job at a crematory."

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840
 Not a good idea.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.840
 He could have done something else.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.120
 That doesn't need to work in and out, obviously.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.400
 He ends up kind of wandering around.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.160
 He says he goes back east, which I'm assuming he ends up back at Chrisfield, Maryland, which

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.360
 is where he's from.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.280
 So he says this, "I went back east where I wandered for four years.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:49.520
 But no matter where I went, I saw Murphy just before my eyes, sitting in a white hot blast

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.280
 taunting me.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.480
 I came back to Eureka and paid the furnace a visit."

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.480
 That's where he want to go, right?

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.440
 "Oh man, those good old days, you're all nostalgic for that time you murdered a man."

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.560
 You're like, "Oh dude, it was so fun growing up.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.680
 Listen to that '90s music, that 1890s music.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.400
 Oh, so great."

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:13.760
 They had the back country boys, though.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.160
 [laughs]

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.960
 Brittany Musket doesn't even make, well, you know, like Spears is a weapon.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960
 Musket's a weapon.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.680
 Well, let's see if I can come up with anyone, anything else.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.680
 Fiona Appleseed.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.680
 He's like, "Johnny Appleseed?

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.680
 Does that even make sense?

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.680
 No, give me one more.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.680
 Give me one more.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.680
 Let me think."

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.680
 The moment's gone.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.680
 The moment's gone.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:41.680
 Okay, so anyways, maybe you can email me.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.680
 You're '90s, 1890s band.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.680
 What are we even talking about?

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.080
 We're talking about a man who's murdered someone.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.080
 Anyways, he's nostalgic for the good old days.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.640
 The good old days of that time he murdered is bully.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.280
 I came back to Eureka, I'm just thinking of '90s.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.160
 I came back to Eureka and paid the furnace of visit.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.440
 Although it was shut down, I saw Murphy there grinning at me.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:14.000
 I could feel my reason slipping, so I went to town and bought some Ladanum, which is

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.920
 basically morphine.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.160
 It was super, super potent morphine.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.160
 It was a tincture.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.120
 Two to three teaspoons would kill you.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.320
 It's a deadly dose, and it came in a little bottle of it.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.080
 They'd be like, "We trust you.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.760
 We trust you with this hardcore medicine that you're not going to use it to commit suicide."

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.360
 A lot of people in the 19th century used it.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.920
 I imagine it would just put you to sleep, but anyway, I actually didn't plan that.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.920
 That's interesting.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.880
 We started off with suicide prevention, and now this dude's killing himself.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.200
 So he has this little bottle.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.720
 He's sitting in the cabin where we're at, where we're going to be in the future.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.080
 He's sitting there, and he's finishing out this letter.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.280
 As soon as I finish writing, I will take the poison and lay down in the bunk.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.280
 Wait a second.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.280
 Why was the skeleton actually?

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.280
 I guess I made that detail up.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.280
 I don't think the skeleton was sitting.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:03.960
 I just imagine the skeleton was sitting at a table writing a letter that wouldn't be

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.320
 the most comfortable place to kill yourself, right?

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.480
 You're like, "I'm going to take this poison that's going to put me to sleep until I die.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.680
 I'm going to sit up.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.480
 I'm going to go running a marathon until I fall over."

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.480
 That would make sense.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.480
 I guess I should finish reading this.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.600
 I did finish reading it, but for whatever reason, I just imagine when they said they

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.560
 found a skeleton, I guess I always imagined that my skeleton would be sitting down.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.400
 I sit way more than I sleep, right?

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.400
 I just imagine a skeleton was sitting in the chair.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.040
 That's why I had that whole thing at the beginning about how a skeleton is just sitting there.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.120
 Then you would see a whole skeleton if it was in the bed.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.920
 So, moral of the story is, detail is important.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.920
 Here we go.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.840
 As soon as I finish writing on this table that I'm sitting at, Jason, I will take the

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.960
 poison and lay down in the bunk.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.880
 I will lay here and rot and vermin will feast on me.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:08.800
 I am sure I cannot go to a worse hell than I've been in for the last six years.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.320
 He took that letter, he wrote it out at his table, as people do.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.440
 Then he got up, he stuffed it into the wall of his cabin, took the poison, laid down and

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.440
 died.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.000
 Now, tell me if this is in a spoiler headline.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.680
 That was a great story, right?

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.840
 It's kind of a great ghost story.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.040
 It's a story, a true crime story of revenge.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.480
 This guy was just pushing him to the edge, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.040
 The edge wasn't a metaphorical edge.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.480
 It was literally the edge that would push him into a furnace.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.400
 He goes, "Hey, it's either you or me, buddy."

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.360
 He couldn't live with a guilt, but this is the whole headline.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.800
 This is the whole headline.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.600
 Note that Skeleton's side reveals tale of murder, apparition and suicide.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.600
 That's not bad, right?

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.520
 Oh, I'm not finished.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.640
 Confession is found in cabin after 40 years.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:59.840
 Victim says he was born in Christfield, located in Nevada at close of Civil War, killed man

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.080
 and threw body in furnace, returned to cabin after years of wandering in East.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.160
 Why do I even have to read the article at that point?

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.240
 You've told me everything, but I didn't want to read that to you in the beginning because

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.720
 obviously that spoils a lot of the stuff.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.080
 What's interesting about the story is that this letter is found.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.800
 It's then forwarded to the people of Christfield, Maryland, and they report it in their newspaper.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.240
 They end up asking, they want to know more about the story.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.920
 When they send reporters out west to talk to people who lived in Eureka at the time,

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.960
 this was a documented event.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.320
 People who had lived in Eureka, the old timers were sitting in their rocking chair, which

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.920
 was the height of technology back then.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.440
 Look at this amazing chair, Elon Musk invented it.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.840
 They're going back and forth, back and forth, and the reporter's like, "That's an amazing

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.040
 story too, man invents rocking chair."

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.400
 I'll get to that next week.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.680
 But do you remember anything about Les Singleton and John Murphy?

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.360
 And they talked to these people, all these old timers all over town, and no one in town

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.120
 knew either of those people.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.560
 They knew about the furnace.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.160
 They had heard about the story afterwards, but they go, "No, we've never known of a

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.280
 Les Singleton or a John Murphy."

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.160
 Now, he said he lived there for years.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.160
 People were like, "Nope."

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.240
 And it's a small town.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.120
 Nobody ever knew anything about either of these guys, which makes me think there's an even

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.360
 more tragic tale to this story.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.120
 We don't know what wounds Les Singleton suffered fighting in the Civil War, but it's possible.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.240
 Some of them were brain damage or mental damage, right?

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:38.440
 It's possible that John Murphy never existed, that Les Singleton never worked at the furnace.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.800
 But he thought that he did.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.480
 He thought that he was being berated by someone.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:49.120
 He thought he was being pushed through the edge, and he thought he murdered somebody.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:55.120
 And trapped in that mental delusion, he had created a reality in his own head that nobody

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.760
 else knew of.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:02.320
 He just wasn't real, and he travels across the country, being haunted by the spirit of

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.920
 a man who never existed.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.640
 And in the end, suffering from years of brain damage, he ends up in a cabin in the middle

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.400
 of Eureka, the cabin that he remembers building.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.200
 But it's just an old abandoned cabin in the middle of nowhere.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:24.840
 As he writes a letter, a ghost of a man that never existed sits across from him, smiling.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.560
 You deserve what you get, Les.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.120
 You deserve this.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.480
 You deserve everything.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:38.480
 In those last moments still haunting, Les takes a swig of morphine, sets it down, puts

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.080
 the note on the wall, and dies.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:47.760
 Fearful of burning in hell for his sins that he never committed.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.080
 Is this the story of a man who was so small in life that he could exist in a community

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.640
 for years and people just don't remember him?

00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:03.480
 Or is it the story of a man who was driven mad by war, by unrelated killings, by unrelated

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.320
 strife, by unrelated depression?

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.720
 And as those thoughts built up in his mind, it created a reality of its own, one where

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:16.000
 he finally stood up against the bullies of the world and killed one.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:42.400
 But in the end, even that imaginary sin was too much for Les Singleton to live with.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:49.400
 It's not the end.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:57.720
 It's the end.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:05.400
 Chicago's seen it all, but it's never experienced anything quite like this.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:12.120
 A two-day racing and music festival featuring the chain smokers, Miranda Lambert, the black

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.240
 crows, and Charlie Crockett.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:20.880
 It's NASCAR in the streets of Chicago and so much more.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.720
 The Chicago Street Race Weekend, July 1st and 2nd.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.920
