 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 - Today is a special episode of Dead Rav Radio.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.040
 We're gonna take a look at one story,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.480
 and that is the story of the Book of Giants,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.800
 a book that was considered too weird

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.600
 to be included in the Bible.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.560
 In Genesis, there is a brief section

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.640
 that mentions the flood that destroyed

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.680
 all of the evil men in the world,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.160
 but there was an entire book telling the backstory

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.760
 of what happened, involving giants, rogue angels,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.760
 and the battle so epic,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.240
 the scale has never been matched

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.400
 at any other point in history.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.840
 We'll explore that and more today on Dead Rav Radio.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.420
 (upbeat music)

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.200
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.320
 of Dead Rav Radio.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.280
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.440
 I got some Patreons.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.600
 I set up my Patreon account yesterday,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.720
 and I got some.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.840
 I wanna say thank you to Elkie, Dave H, Dave Carr,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.240
 Scott Stewart, and Chris Kilborn

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.720
 for supporting the show.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 That's really, really awesome.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 And I wanna say, just so you guys don't think

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.880
 I'm wasting your money, I bought this book.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.760
 Let me read you the description of it.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.640
 What is the agenda and purpose

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.200
 of all of this alien activity?

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.360
 Why do they hate humanity and work in the darkness?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.640
 Are we prepared to face them?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.040
 The war started over 6,000 years ago,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.960
 I'm assuming this was written by a hardcore creationist.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.800
 The story started over 6,000 years ago.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.040
 Now, it is more evident with the increasing violence

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.400
 and deaths, what forces are behind it.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.600
 You can't escape if you are human.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.800
 They come to eat your flesh and drink your blood.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.480
 There is only one weapon that will destroy them.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.240
 Discover it before it's too late.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.960
 That is the description for this book.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.160
 I have found no reviews on it whatsoever.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.520
 It came out two years ago.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.880
 It's self-published.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.680
 It's called "Gay Aliens, The Great Deception."

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.160
 And oddly enough, there's copies of the book

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.520
 that are listed as "Gay Aliens, The Great Reception."

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.560
 So I don't know if he originally had a typo,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560
 but I ordered that book.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.720
 Thank you, Patreons, for allowing me to buy this $11 book.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.200
 So I will read "Gay Aliens."

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.680
 I hope, I'm assuming it's him saying

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.360
 that aliens are turning people gay.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.600
 I'm going to assume that's just based on the title,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.960
 but that, I don't know.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.840
 Based on that title and that description,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.760
 it could literally be anything.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.320
 But yeah, so "Gay Aliens, The Great Deception."

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.920
 I will let you guys know when I get it,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.760
 if it's any good.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.280
 Spoiler alert, it won't be,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.200
 but I at least assume it will be hilarious.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.080
 And it's in paperback.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.040
 There wasn't even a Kindle,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.800
 so I get to have a book sitting on my bookshelf

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.360
 with that title.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.520
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.080
 Now, our first story does require a bit of an introduction.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.760
 And I'm going to keep this as brief as possible,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.320
 because it's basically, it's a history lesson.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.320
 I recorded one version of it, it was 10 minutes long,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.160
 it was totally born.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.640
 Okay, back in Bible times, there was a guy named Enoch.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.040
 And he went on these adventures,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.360
 and he wrote about them in this book

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.640
 called "The Book of Enoch."

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.360
 Now, this is pre-flood

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.600
 when Enoch was kicking about back there, right?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.360
 And he has this, his book is weird.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.160
 I might do an episode on just his book.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.960
 He goes into space, he's hanging out with angels.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.920
 He's doing all these wacky adventures, right?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.440
 He's very, very well-respected man in the region.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.480
 And he's in like the Jewish lineage.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.680
 So he's a real person.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.280
 He has mentioned several times

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.000
 throughout the old and the New Testament.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.640
 He was related to Noah, I believe, as well.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.200
 But real guy shows up.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.320
 But anyways, he says he went on all these adventures.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.280
 And he also is a main character in the book.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.000
 We're going to look at "The Book of Giants,"

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.320
 which takes place pre-flood as well.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.000
 Now, back in the, like, I think it was like 400 AD

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.520
 when they were kind of putting the Bible together.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.640
 Jesus is gone, they're putting the Bible together.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.600
 When they're having this huge voting council,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.800
 they get to the Book of Enoch and the Book of Giants

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.120
 and they're like, "No, no, you cannot put these books

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.960
 in the Bible.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.680
 We have talking snakes, we have buildings being blown up

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.440
 by trumpet horns, but this is just ridiculous."

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.440
 So they took it out and it pretty much disappeared

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.200
 'cause people stopped studying it,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.400
 people stopped talking about it.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.040
 And back then, you didn't have the internet archive.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.040
 It was just gone.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.400
 They did end up, centuries later, there was half of it,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400
 a version of half of it, found in China.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.960
 It was written in Aramaic, but it was found in China.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.800
 And they're like, "Oh, look, it has Enoch in it.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.360
 This is related to the Book of the Bible.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.880
 This is probably, we've heard references

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.360
 to the Book of Giants, this is probably it."

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.640
 In the 1940s, two dudes are knocking about in the Middle East.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.480
 They walked into a cave by the Dead Sea

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.360
 and found a bunch of books of the Bible

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.360
 that were written between like 300 BC and 200 AD.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.600
 Preserved in jars.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.120
 And in those jars, you had like real books of the Bible

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.400
 or canonical books of the Bible,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.640
 like you had like Genesis and Acts, whatever.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.920
 You had all the goodies, you had all the goodies.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.320
 But you also had the Book of Giants.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.800
 The first half, it starts to decay halfway through.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.880
 So people have looked at it and they go,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.640
 "This is really, really weird.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.680
 Probably shouldn't have been in the Bible.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.400
 It just is just too weird."

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.920
 But I said Enoch is mentioned throughout the Bible.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.000
 Elements of this story I'm about to tell you

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.560
 are mentioned throughout the Bible.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.560
 And in Genesis, the Book of Genesis, it says,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.080
 "Hey, listen, there was a time when some angels came down

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.240
 and started having sex with humans.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.520
 And that, I love this quote.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.480
 So let me read you this real quick.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.400
 "When human beings began to increase in number on the earth

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.240
 and daughters were born to them,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.000
 the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.680
 were beautiful and they married any of them that they chose.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.440
 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.400
 and also afterward, when the sons of God went

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.800
 to the daughters of humans and had children by them,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.480
 they were the heroes of old, men of renown."

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.080
 So that's just a little part of Genesis.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.960
 And then it goes on to say, God said,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.360
 "This is not what I wanted.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.320
 This isn't working.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.520
 Humans are too wicked now.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.720
 I'm gonna cause a flood."

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.240
 And then he goes, "Yo, Noah."

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.920
 And Noah looks up in the sky and God is mimicking,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.760
 building a boat.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.240
 And Noah's like, "Oh yeah, I should do that.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.400
 He's just playing Fortnite all day long."

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.680
 God said, "Come on, man.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.720
 Build that boat."

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.880
 He's like, "I'll do it tomorrow."

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.680
 The ultimate procrastinator.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.560
 So that's it.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.600
 But the book of giants explains,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.080
 there's eight verses in Genesis that tell that story.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.320
 The book of giants explains, step by step, what happened.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.040
 Way more than a flood.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.360
 Way, way more than a flood.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.320
 So let's hop on board the carboner copter,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.200
 strap in, 'cause this one's gonna be nuts.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.160
 We are going back in time to the Middle East.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.560
 Coming over.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.720
 Nice little town.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.080
 Everything's made of clay, except the people

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.920
 and the animals.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.640
 All the buildings are made of clay.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.240
 Candles are flying over it's nighttime, right?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.720
 Now, the reason why we're here is,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.520
 this is the story of the book of giants.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.320
 God says, "Actually, you know what?

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.160
 Let's go to heaven.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.400
 Let's go and sit in this meeting.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.300
 We're going all over the place for this one."

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.480
 We're floating on a cloud.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.320
 We're floating on a cloud.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.360
 We're in a giant meeting.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.400
 God's sitting there smoking a giant cigar.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.640
 He's seated at a table with 200 angels.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.920
 And he's like, "Listen, guys, project earth is going great.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.600
 But I think we need to do a little bit of more

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.000
 on the blue marble."

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.240
 Pulls down pie chart.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.000
 He's like, "Listen, this is how many people

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 are on the planet.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.360
 This is how many of them are morally good.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.160
 I need you, my angels, my watchers,"

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.320
 as the humans know you, "to go down there

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.360
 and show them what needs to be done."

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.920
 Takes a couple puffs of cigar.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.240
 And now the leader of this group of watchers is Shemihaaza.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.560
 Now, I should say right now that every angel

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.320
 sitting in this boardroom,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.760
 this is long after Lucifer tried overthrowing God

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.400
 and there was a giant war in heaven.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.120
 It was the ultimate act of rebellion.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.320
 And God took Lucifer and one third of the angels

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.760
 and cast them out of heaven.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.600
 This is way after this.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.280
 There was a massive war in this alternate dimension

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.440
 before time and space had actually even crystallized

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.560
 into a real thing.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.080
 Everyone sitting in this meeting fought in that war.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.680
 Okay, there's not a single person of this 200 man team

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.320
 that does not know what happens if you don't follow the rules.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.480
 Some of them may even be like,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.000
 "Oh man, you know, I really like Lucifer.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.840
 He's a really cool guy.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.680
 Too bad he went nuts."

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.680
 And they're like, "Yeah, you know, just forget it."

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.460
 But they all remember that, okay?

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.920
 Just remember that as a thing

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.600
 that's gonna happen throughout the story.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.560
 So Shemihaaza and his homeboys are like,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.320
 "We will go to earth and do what you say."

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.960
 And God goes, "And,"

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.960
 they're all leaving out the door, he stops them,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.560
 "Whatever you do, do not bang them."

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.160
 And they're like, "Why would you even suggest that?"

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.080
 He is omnipotent.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.840
 He does kind of know what's going to happen next.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.000
 But Shemihaaza's like, "Of course not, dude.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.280
 Humans are gross."

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.760
 So then, (whooshing)

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.520
 200 angels fly down earth.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.000
 And they do what God says.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.920
 They start teaching people how to be good people.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.360
 They're picking up old ladies and dusting them off.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.680
 And then they're repairing the clay houses.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.520
 And they're like, "You know,

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.960
 you probably could use some wood in this house."

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.400
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, maybe."

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.920
 Giving them advice and stuff like that.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.800
 And we're watching this whole thing.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.720
 We're just eating apples.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.720
 We're having a good time watching these angels

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.480
 do what angels do.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.040
 But then, as the angels are helping like,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.480
 build a barn or whatever,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.200
 this woman walks out of her house.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200
 And Shemihaaza's like,

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.880
 "Oh God, his eyes get super big.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.360
 They're all bouncing out tongue."

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.840
 (laughing)

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.760
 It falls instantly in love with human females.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.720
 And we, at this point, we saw me eating our apples

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.640
 'cause we know something bad's gonna happen.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.280
 And it spreads.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.360
 The angels are just amazed

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.000
 at how beautiful human females are.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 And to be fair, human females are quite beautiful.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.040
 So they start banging the women.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.200
 Now that is bad enough

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.080
 because you're basically creating

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.620
 a half human, half angel baby.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.080
 But it doesn't stop there.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.320
 When God is talking about destroying the world,

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.320
 I think anyone who's familiar with the story of Noah,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.800
 but if you aren't, when he's talking about destroying

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.560
 the world, it's not just that

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.340
 there's a bunch of half human, half angels.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.200
 He does, in the Bible, it uses the term,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.880
 they were the mighty heroes, the heroes of renown,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.060
 they're mighty warriors.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.360
 It wasn't just that.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.600
 When you look at the book of giants,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.440
 there's a phrase that's used over and over again.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.160
 The women prostituted themselves.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.920
 Like, "Oh God, we didn't see none of that.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.640
 We saw a woman walk out of her house.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.560
 A guy turned into a cartoon fox for a minute

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.680
 and then they started banging."

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.240
 But what was going on is the women were basically saying,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.280
 "I will have sex with you, but I want power.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.280
 I want knowledge.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.780
 I want to know what you know."

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.060
 And what we see in the book of giants

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.100
 is there are phrases saying that

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.700
 they were taught the secrets of the universe.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.260
 You have these celestial beings that existed before

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.380
 the universe even had shape.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.100
 And they're on first date.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.500
 And the girl goes, "So, what are you doing?"

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.500
 He's like, "Oh, I'm a watcher.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.220
 You know, I help build barns and stuff like that."

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.740
 And she goes, "Do you know how to stop time?"

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.380
 And he would.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.920
 He may not have the necessary power to be able to do that,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.980
 but he would go, "Yeah, actually, I do know how it's done."

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.120
 And he'd start explaining how black holes work

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120
 and all sorts of stuff.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.920
 They taught them the dark arts.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.680
 They taught them basically how to be a witch.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.240
 And in return, the women had their babies.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.920
 That is the beginning of the wickedness.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.920
 You have angels no longer.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.360
 They're teaching people, you know, give a penny, take a penny.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.280
 They're teaching them this is how you raise the dead

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.480
 to impress these women.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.360
 And the women in turn were banging them.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.520
 And the babies were described as giants.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.720
 Now, sometimes they were literal giants.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.140
 They were just massive people.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.780
 One of them supposedly was 450 feet tall,

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.300
 which out of all the details of the story,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.300
 even the ones I want to tell later,

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.140
 I think that's the most unbelievable thing.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.260
 Some of them, they were giant just in that context meant

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.580
 immensely strong, mighty.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.060
 So these children were heroes.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.980
 Gilgamesh, the hero from the Mesopotamian mythology,

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.420
 is listed as a Nephilim in the book of giants.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.220
 So he's this mighty, mighty hero.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.420
 These people like Hercules, which is the same story,

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.060
 a human and a god having a baby,

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.840
 causes people to be superhuman.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.400
 We're not talking Superman level,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.500
 but we're talking Captain America level,

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.640
 to Hulk level type heroes.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.640
 We are now reading the newspaper,

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.440
 'cause a couple generations are passing this time.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.000
 We luckily don't age, otherwise we'd be dust by this.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.720
 We're reading the Daily Clay.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.280
 It's the only newspaper in town.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.640
 And it's just story after story about these great heroes

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.440
 who are going out and slaying enemies

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.360
 and bashing lions open, picking mountains up

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.200
 and throwing them around.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.600
 Just insane stuff.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.880
 Your newspaper is a comic book.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.860
 There's no pictures back then.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.820
 They didn't know how to draw.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.500
 So it's just words, like regular book.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.900
 But anyways, the point is, is that

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.740
 all of these great adventures are going on,

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.940
 but power corrupts.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.740
 And these watchers and their witch wives

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.040
 and their mighty, mighty kids decide,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.620
 why are we protecting humans?

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.420
 We are the dominant species on this planet.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.180
 They cannot fight against us.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.820
 'Cause there would be wars.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.940
 You'd have one of these Nephilim,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.640
 which was the half human, half angel.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.240
 You'd have one of these Nephilim

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.380
 just massacre thousand people in a battle.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.000
 You could not stop these guys.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.640
 And they go, why are we fighting,

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.860
 why are we even fighting for these guys?

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.400
 We should just be ruling them.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.160
 So then this is when we pack up and leave town.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.300
 Most people do.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.200
 And this is happening all over the region.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.240
 The watchers begin to enslave humans.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.240
 Now, again, all of this stuff is really like

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.840
 cliche sci-fi fantasy stuff.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.600
 But for thousands of years, people,

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.040
 this was a book of the Bible.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.340
 People believed this existed.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.740
 It wasn't until a couple people voted it out

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.540
 that it stopped being part of the canon.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.280
 Anyways, let's step back into this.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.520
 We're running out of town.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.680
 We're getting the carbonar copter flying away.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.480
 And if you're human, you're enslaved.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.840
 If you're lucky, most likely they just bash their head.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.840
 They began to take over large parts of the region.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.340
 And then power corrupts.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.920
 They begin to go to war with each other.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.240
 So now you have different angels

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.800
 and their superhuman children fighting other angels

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.880
 and superhuman children for control of a ravine

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.800
 or farmland or whatever.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.360
 And normal humans could no longer live in this area.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.640
 It was just too chaotic.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.080
 Enter Enoch.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.760
 So Enoch is, Enoch is a totally weird dude.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.080
 He has a few, he's almost a superhuman in his own aspect,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.320
 but he's basically like God's messenger,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.840
 God's homeboy on the planet earth.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.040
 Enoch is watching all of this, right?

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.480
 And it gets to the point where the watchers basically go,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.480
 "You know what?

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.480
 "We're just gonna start eating people.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.360
 "Like we're tired of keeping slaves

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.840
 "and we're tired of just killing them.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.440
 "We're gonna start eating people."

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.280
 So the watchers begin to eat people.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.560
 So now we're not even slaves.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.880
 We're just dumb animals ready to be devoured.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.520
 At that point, Enoch calls up God and says,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.840
 "Hey, you need to do something about this, right?

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.960
 "You need to do something about this.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.520
 "You kind of caused this in the first place."

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.840
 God, God, again, first he's a business,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.080
 first he's really proactive working a business meeting.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.240
 It's maybe been 150, 200 years since this all started.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.200
 In that period of time,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.600
 God has become a total deadbeat dad.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.680
 He wants nothing to do with what's going on on earth.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.560
 Enoch goes, "Listen, you have an army,

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.320
 "you have an immeasurable army.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.800
 "You have 200 angels

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.040
 "and thousands of wives

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.600
 "and who knows tens of thousands of superhuman children

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.200
 "running around the area.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.440
 "You gotta do something about this."

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.120
 And God, God tells Enoch, "No, you.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.520
 "You go do something.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.000
 "I'm just gonna sit here on my big fluffy couch.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.840
 "I'm retired."

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.720
 And Enoch goes, "So let's go on a walk with Enoch.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.440
 "We're gonna walk with Enoch

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.920
 "and we're going to enter the camp of the giants

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.160
 "with Shemi Haaza.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.920
 "And we're standing now,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.840
 "we're flanked by a bunch of angels

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.160
 "and a bunch of hot witches.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.000
 "There's some human kids."

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.040
 And Enoch goes, "Listen, you guys need to stop.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.160
 "You guys need to stop."

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.920
 And we're like, "That's all you're gonna say?"

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.440
 And Enoch kind of puts his hand up.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.320
 He's like, "Oh, give me a second, give me a second.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.360
 "You need to stop.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.360
 "Because if you don't stop now,

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.400
 "God's gonna destroy all of you."

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.120
 Shemi Haaza's like, "Oh, God can't destroy."

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.240
 Actually, no, at that point in reality,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.760
 Shemi Haaza was like, "Uh-oh."

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.440
 Because again, they have seen what happens

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.120
 to angels when they go rogue.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.680
 But Shemi Haaza dismisses Enoch,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.000
 gets him out of there, we all get thrown out on her butts,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.240
 and he doubles down.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.140
 They begin holding secret occult meetings

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.760
 on the top of this mountain in the region.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.800
 They would figure out,

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.080
 they were basically now uniting themselves.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.320
 So the war between the watchers and their children

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.600
 was going to have to come to an end.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.480
 They would have to provide a united front

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.440
 because they know what's going to happen.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.820
 There's one version of the story.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.660
 This was one that,

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.120
 because I had to read a bunch of articles on this,

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.160
 I wasn't able to verify this in other versions,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.020
 but there's one article I read

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.360
 that when they were on that mountain,

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.640
 they were in contact with Azazel,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.600
 which was another name for Satan, for Lucifer.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.640
 And they were basically saying,

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.600
 "Well, if God's going to destroy us,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.480
 "if we don't stop and we don't wanna stop,

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.000
 "maybe Satan will help us out

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.420
 "with that sweet, sweet satanic power."

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.800
 So they've totally just,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.340
 God said, "Stop doing it."

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.940
 And they totally went in the opposite direction.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.180
 So at this point,

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.620
 God finally gets up off the couch

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.380
 and just makes them have bad nightmares.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.940
 Like, again, he can totally end it at any point.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:58.980
 He gives them bad nightmares.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.020
 So the sons of Shemi Haza one night,

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.800
 they woke up and they had this horrible dream.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.980
 So they hold another meeting 'cause this kid's dream.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.260
 And he says, "This is what I dreamt."

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.740
 He goes, "I dreamt I was walking through a garden

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.860
 "and there was 200 trees in the garden."

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.380
 And then an emperor came down.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.520
 Like a burning fireball.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.940
 And the other watchers, this dream,

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.900
 that sounds kind of like just a basic surreal

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.160
 lynchian type dream,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.680
 but it really concerned the watchers

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.220
 that he had this dream.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.140
 So they said, "Listen, there's one person

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.980
 "that you can talk to.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.080
 "He's the smartest person on the planet.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.320
 "Go talk to him and ask him what the dream means."

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.880
 His name's Enoch.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.880
 So one of these mighty warriors comes to Enoch.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.980
 Enoch's little shack, we're just hanging out there.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.220
 Guy walks in and he goes,

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.680
 "Hey, you might know me from killing

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.380
 "all those bears the other day,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.460
 "but Enoch, I have to ask you about this dream."

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.820
 So he describes the dream to Enoch

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.700
 and Enoch's just sitting there drinking his tea.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.220
 Enoch is around 300 years old at this point.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.780
 I should have mentioned that earlier.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.440
 Enoch is a very, very old and wise man.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.020
 He's drinking his tea and he goes,

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.820
 "I know exactly what that dream means."

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.060
 The 200 trees represent women,

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.280
 not the watchers themselves.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.100
 They represent the women, the wives.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.000
 And those trees were watered by corrupt gardeners

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.480
 who are the watchers.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.760
 And the fruit, those trees were bearing

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.480
 was poisonous fruit and that's you, the Nephilim.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.120
 The emperor coming down on the throne is your destruction.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.000
 You are going to be destroyed first by fire

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.960
 and then by flood.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.800
 You will be wiped off this planet.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.880
 The warrior goes back, tells Shemi Haza,

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.000
 "Shemi Haza comes to Enoch and goes,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.480
 "is there any way we can stop this?"

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.540
 And Enoch goes, "Nope, you've interfered

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.660
 "with the normal plan.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.320
 "You had all these babies.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.620
 "You can't have this race on this planet.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.040
 "You just can't.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.620
 "You're not allowed to."

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.100
 Shemi Haza is like, "If we pray."

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.520
 And Enoch's like, "Nope, it doesn't matter.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.860
 "You should pray for forgiveness

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.700
 "is you're going to die,

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.660
 "but there is nothing you can do

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.700
 "to stop your death at this point."

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.620
 And Shemi Haza is like, "That's not funny.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.700
 "I thought you were gonna insert a joke there."

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.900
 And Enoch's like, "No, no jokes during that part.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.360
 "I can dab on you before I leave.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.340
 "Will that make you feel better?"

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.660
 Shemi Haza's like, "Kinda."

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.620
 So Enoch dabs on him and he leaves.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.160
 Shemi Haza goes, "That was kind of cringy,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.740
 "but it didn't make me feel a little bit better

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.900
 "because now he knows that not only is he doomed,

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.420
 "but his children are doomed.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.660
 "But like everyone who has their back against the wall,

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.000
 "you figure maybe I can make one last ditch effort."

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.740
 So he gets all of the other Watchers together,

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.740
 all of their witchwives, all of their children,

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.860
 so they have this massive army

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.500
 and they're hanging out by this mountain

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.460
 where they worshiped Azazel.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:52.100
 And so everyone on this battlefield

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.420
 under Shemi Haza's control has superpowers.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.860
 They would be the equivalent of if the X-Men

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.580
 and the Justice League and the villains,

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.500
 the Legion of Doom, whatever,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.840
 all of them were in one plateau.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.820
 So of course, nobody's going to fight these guys

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.140
 except for God, right?

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.100
 So, but God, again, is the deadbeat dad of this story.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.100
 He doesn't do anything, directly, at least.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.020
 So he calls up his buddy Raphael.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.460
 He gets Raphael up there and Raphael's an archangel

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.500
 and he's like, "I need you to clean up a mess for me."

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.820
 Raphael's like, "Another one?"

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.100
 And God's like, "Yes, yes."

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.460
 But this one will be particularly exciting

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.980
 if you ever wanted to fight a bunch of superhumans.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.240
 Today's the day, Raph's like,

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.160
 "Ah, it sounds kinda cool, doesn't it?"

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.840
 God's like, "I know, it actually is kinda cool.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.320
 It sucks that I gotta wipe all these people out."

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.840
 But they've polluted the gene pool on Earth.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.160
 So Raphael is like, "I gotta assemble a team.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.720
 I gotta put my crew together, God."

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.520
 And God's like, "Go ahead and do that."

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.320
 So Raphael goes into the ranks of heaven and he goes,

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.480
 "I want you and you and you."

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.320
 That's it.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.720
 Everyone's like, "That's all you're taking."

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.040
 They know what's going on down there, Raph's like,

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.540
 "I think we got this, right?"

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:08.020
 So he brings down Michael, Gabrielle, and Uriel,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.380
 which are all archangels.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.620
 So you have four archangels versus 200 angels,

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.660
 all these witches and a bunch of giants.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.060
 Again, all of these angels have fought

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.740
 during the war in heaven.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.980
 And these particular four that are coming down

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.220
 were the generals.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.120
 They were basically, if you put Conor McGregor,

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.280
 General Patton, and Superman in a blender,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.240
 these guys would be Superman level heroes.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.260
 You put them in a blender, the blender would break,

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.000
 but out of the ruins of the blender would come Raphael.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 So they come flying down into this giant field

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.060
 where all these people are assembled, come down.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.560
 I guess they wouldn't go,

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.240
 it sounds like they're just coming through a wind tunnel.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.280
 Big old angel wings, they swoop down,

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.880
 land on the battlefield.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.920
 And they're like, it's time to go, Shemihausa.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.840
 Shemihausa's like, "No!"

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.440
 Now we can get into the dramatic,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.760
 (mimics drumming)

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.160
 the war drums are coming and Shemihausa's sweating.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.180
 All of the angels are sweating at this point.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.820
 All the watchers are sweating.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.360
 The kids, the superheroes and their wives,

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.520
 don't real, they're just like,

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.600
 "Look at, there's four of them versus all of us.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.720
 We're going to win."

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.880
 But the watchers know these guys.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.480
 They're like, "Uh-oh."

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.640
 (mimics drumming)

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.840
 War drums, (mimics drumming)

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.240
 giants roaring in the distance, 450 foot tall giant.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.800
 (mimics drumming)

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.680
 Now we're hiding behind a rock.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.640
 We're watching this battle.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.920
 We're hiding behind this rock.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.720
 And, and I should say now, Enoch is gone.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.800
 And he's not anywhere near this battlefield.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.400
 And not only is he not near this battlefield,

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.840
 he's still the carpenter copter.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.840
 So we are stuck on the ground.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.920
 We're like hiding behind a rock.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.480
 We are basically two hobbits on this massive battlefield.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.480
 Raphael pulls out a flaming sword,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.640
 making sure he doesn't catch his wings on fire, takes off.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.320
 (mimics gunfire)

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.120
 Anyways, dramatic music.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.720
 (mimics gunfire)

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.880
 And you have these four angels being to basically carve

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.880
 their way through this sea of super humans.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.160
 Now, and carve would be a good way to put it

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.920
 'cause they're just decimating these guys.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.760
 But four of anything versus these numbers,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.720
 it's not a cakewalk.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.840
 These angels are cutting down these dudes,

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.640
 fighting these other angels,

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.480
 chopping off the heads of a couple witches,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.640
 shooting off witty one-liners.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.520
 All this fair and love and gore,

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.240
 split dudes, guts open.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:51.000
 I can't think of a pun for a giant.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.160
 Anyways, he doesn't say anything,

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.800
 just steps the giant in the stomachs.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.040
 Giant falls on a bunch of people.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.800
 Anyways, they're chopping all these people up,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.080
 but they are outnumbered.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080
 They are outnumbered.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.600
 And over the course of the battle,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.960
 they're not doing too well.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.320
 They're really not doing too well.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.040
 Enoch is gone and we're stuck there.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.840
 And then that is when the tide of battle turns.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.240
 Enoch wasn't, Enoch, God is constantly just not

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.800
 paying attention to anything that's going on.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.440
 Enoch, however, goes, you know what?

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.440
 I'm gonna go take care of some stuff, dude.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.280
 I'm gonna go take care of some stuff.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.480
 The angels are holding their own,

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.480
 but the wheel of the battle is slowly turning against them.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.440
 That is when throughout the valley, you hear a...

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.100
 (ominous music)

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:47.640
 And at that point, this isn't the Book of Giants.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.080
 I thought this was an incredible detail.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.080
 At that point, 400,000 humans from across the globe

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.000
 have assembled on this battlefield.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 An army of 400,000 men has been drafted up.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.960
 The legends went out that today is the day

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.640
 we destroy the giants.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.920
 Today is the day we take back earth.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.900
 And that cry went out.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.560
 People would just pick up their spear,

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.400
 leave their village, grab their shield and their sword,

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.580
 get their son to tend the farm

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.960
 as all the adult men left the city.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.960
 And they just came from all over to that field.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.120
 And they didn't just come with swords and shields.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.420
 The Book of Giants is very specific

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.280
 on the weaponry they brought.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.960
 This is part of the fragment from the Book of Giants.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.960
 400,000 righteous came with fire, napatha,

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.720
 and brimstone.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.400
 The biggest weapon they had against these giants was fire.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.920
 You have all of them in one location,

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.640
 and they just begin raining hell down on these mutants.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.440
 Torched the entire area.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.760
 And as they're burning, as these giants are burning,

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.200
 as these witches are being torched,

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.700
 you had wave after wave of humans,

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.080
 totally normal people running in a battle,

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.920
 attacking these super humans,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.340
 taking back for the first time,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.620
 the first time humans were able to fight these guys.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.020
 It took, for archangels on their side,

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.380
 it took surprise attack,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:31.380
 it took thousands and thousands of gallons of napalm

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.380
 and brimstone, big ol' rocks,

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.620
 who guys are putting on a mid-throwing big,

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.500
 heavy rocks of brimstone at 'em.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.340
 People are looking at 'em,

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.620
 he's like, "Are you sure you're not a giant?"

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.140
 He's like, "No, I'm not a giant."

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.340
 Drinks a giant bucket of ale, totally normal.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.180
 They just burnt these monsters to the ground.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.920
 And Sami Haza is watching this whole thing,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.920
 and he knows it's over.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.440
 He knows that there is,

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.880
 the archangels are getting their second wind,

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.040
 400,000 troops are surrounding them,

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.000
 far outstripping his army,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.560
 and there's just no way they're gonna make this.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.200
 So he leaves, he takes off.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.280
 The day is one.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.480
 (breathing heavily)

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.220
 Sharon, after that, Enoch leaves.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.560
 Now, one of the most interesting things about Enoch,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.040
 again, one of the passages that's mentioned

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.980
 in the canonical Bible about him,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.060
 is that Enoch doesn't die.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.380
 Scholars, the way the Bible verse is set up,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.120
 is that he walked with God and then he was no more.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.020
 And that has been believed to be by scholars

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.460
 that he didn't die, he was taken away.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.860
 He's considered to be the only man in history

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.060
 who never died.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.360
 He's in heaven and he's still alive.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.080
 So that's how much of a pimp this dude was.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.000
 That's how, even God's like,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.600
 you know what, I made you do some ridiculous stuff,

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.080
 you didn't get to fly around in space,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.320
 but yeah, you don't gotta die, man.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.640
 I'm gonna give you a bus pass to heaven.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.040
 I'm going to, I guess it's more of like a limo ride,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.920
 it's not even a bus pass.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.280
 You don't even have to die.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.640
 Come hang out with me, just come chill with me.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.400
 Enoch's like, yeah, yeah, that's cool.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.800
 And after Enoch leaves,

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.120
 Raphael visits Samaehaza one last time,

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.260
 lands in front of his hut.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.320
 There's still a few giants left,

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.780
 still a few wives, still a few watchers,

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.340
 but the majority of them were wiped out in this battle.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.820
 But they were still there

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.900
 and they were still interbreeding.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.300
 And so Raphael lands and Samaehaza's sitting there,

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.520
 probably all burned up, probably sitting there,

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.140
 all bandaged up in bed.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.260
 And Raphael says, so Enoch's gone.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.100
 Enoch's gone now.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.000
 Samaehaza's like, is he dead?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.920
 Raphael's like, no.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.400
 But he's in heaven, he's not here anymore.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.000
 Samaehaza's like, that's weird.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.760
 So that's not expecting.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.480
 Raphael's like, yeah, mysterious ways,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.600
 you know all that stuff.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.540
 But I'm telling you this because now

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.680
 it's time for the second part of God's plan.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.860
 There is a flood coming and it will destroy you.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.840
 This is just a message from one angel to another.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.040
 'Cause we fought together.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.660
 I've known you for a billion years, Samaehaza.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.260
 It's time to repent.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.860
 You can't avoid this.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.020
 You've been putting it off all this time.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.420
 You gotta repent.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.980
 Raphael flies away.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.100
 And as he's flying away,

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.780
 little raindrops start falling.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:33.740
 Samaehaza looks outside of his hut

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.340
 and just watches the rainfall.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.260
 (water running)

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.400
 The Great Flood has started.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.000
 So the story's fascinating on server.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.220
 As a narrative, the story I think is really, really

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.780
 fascinating, just as a story.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.700
 But what I, you can pick it apart.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.940
 So I think probably the most interesting takeaway

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.180
 from the story is that people go,

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.740
 well, if the people in biblical times were super wicked

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.940
 and then God destroyed the world,

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.260
 aren't people today probably even more wicked

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.500
 than they were back then?

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.740
 Or have been in periods of time more wicked

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.660
 than they were back then?

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.260
 But it's not the, according to the book of giants,

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.700
 that's not the reason why the flood happened.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.980
 It was the fact that they were being wicked,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:17.180
 but you also had an entire subspecies on earth

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.580
 that was destroying his people.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.020
 Now I know a lot of people are gonna go,

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.180
 wait a second, so 400,000 righteous men showed up

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.940
 at that battlefield and fought off the giants,

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.580
 but then God killed them all with the flood.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.260
 Here's, and I don't wanna get too much

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.940
 into the weeds on this thing, but the Great Flood,

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:36.580
 the Bible is not a history book.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.860
 It is the religious history of the Jewish people.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.020
 When they had the Great Flood, it flooded the region.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.220
 The word, keep saying that the world is,

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.540
 the entire world is flooded.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.340
 It kills all the humans and stuff like that.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.540
 That's not what happened.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.220
 If you look at it in a spiritual,

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.420
 a spiritually historical text,

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.360
 the flood killed everyone in the region,

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.860
 because even the most ardent creationist,

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.420
 I can't imagine, could argue,

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.260
 well they can be ridiculous, but there was absolutely no way.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.420
 I believe there was a Great Flood.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.420
 I believe that Noah built the ark and all that stuff.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.140
 I do not believe for one second

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.580
 that Noah got off the ark with his family,

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.080
 and then a thousand years later,

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.380
 you had a bunch of Chinese people,

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.900
 and they're all descended from Noah.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.060
 That is completely ridiculous.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.540
 There is no, I believe that a giant flood happened,

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.340
 and a select family got on a boat,

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.740
 and the entire region there was wiped out.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.300
 But outside of that region, you'd have people being like,

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.060
 whoo, good thing I was living on this cliff.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.580
 I don't think Noah and his family

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.900
 were the last people left.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.580
 I think elements of the Noah story are a parable.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.940
 I don't think you put two of each animal on the boat.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.420
 Again, that just doesn't make any sense.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.820
 But the idea of someone having a portent

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.260
 of a natural disaster, avoiding said natural disaster,

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.380
 and then reclaiming the land

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.140
 where everyone else was destroyed,

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.280
 I think historically that could have happened.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.780
 I guess in a world where there's giants,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.820
 you could fit two animal, two of each animal on a boat,

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.100
 but anyways, I'm getting too much.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.140
 So those 400,000 people who came to fight the giants,

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.780
 they weren't all then wiped out by the flood.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.460
 They went back to their own regions

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.220
 and continued to prosper.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.940
 When you hear that story, it's funny,

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.920
 'cause again, half of it was a remnants in China,

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.220
 and then they found another chunk of it in the,

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.260
 they found the beginning half in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.420
 There are many elements in the story

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.660
 we've seen in fantasy novels

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:23.060
 that came out before the story of the Book of Giants

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.340
 was readily available.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.700
 Obviously, Lord of the Rings, things like that.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.380
 I think that whether or not the story is true,

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.020
 I think that the story was passed along

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.220
 so much in our culture.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.500
 I think it's become part of our cultural memory,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.700
 where we may not actually remember the story itself,

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:45.260
 but the idea of alien invaders or supernatural beings

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.960
 trying to take over the planet,

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.540
 the idea of getting the entire planet on one battlefield

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.420
 to fight said invaders,

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.820
 the idea of divine intervention

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.020
 in a battlefield working side by side

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.820
 with the good aliens versus the bad aliens.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.500
 You'll see that stuff across sci-fi,

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.540
 you'll see that stuff across fantasy literature,

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.700
 and I think it resonates to us, like Lord of the Rings,

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.700
 is because it's part of our cultural memory.

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.980
 For thousands of years,

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.920
 people believed this story was true,

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.740
 and then you can now read a story in the 1940s

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.460
 about a group of "normal people"

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.580
 siding with a good angel, Gandalf,

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.860
 versus an evil angel you have Sauron

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.060
 who's corrupting the world and everything like that.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.340
 I don't think that he was reading the Book of Giants,

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.740
 and even if he did read the Book of Giants to write that,

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:32.580
 we didn't.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.140
 I think our cultural knowledge of that story

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:39.780
 embedded into us made us more excited to hear that story.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.420
 It was reminding us of those old days.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.920
 I personally would like to believe

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.500
 the Book of Giants is real, because it's awesome.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.060
 I mean, that story is great.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.740
 I love that story.

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.560
 I really would like it to be awesome.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.980
 But, I mean, obviously the logical side of me

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.720
 is it's an interesting parable

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.980
 to explain a horrible natural disaster.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.180
 But still.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.700
 Wouldn't it be great if you knew for a fact

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.940
 that there was a time on this planet

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.540
 where we all united to fight back monsters

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.820
 and reclaim the world for ourselves?

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.700
 This story made me so excited.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.860
 This story?

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.020
 This story got me so excited.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.760
 I thought this story's like an action movie.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.440
 And what does an action movie need?

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.880
 What does every action movie need?

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.520
 It needs a song during the credits

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.120
 that recap the events of the story.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:42.400
 Yo, my name is Enoch, and I'm from another E-Paka.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.600
 Once went to space and I parted with the Ewoks.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.520
 But long ago, the watches came inside.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.600
 Some bitches had a bunch of giant babies

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.540
 turning women, the witches, putting men up in stitches,

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.260
 warfare everywhere.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.060
 They started eating flesh, so I got out of there.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.180
 God sent a dream so they could come to me,

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.980
 and I could perceive what it all means.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.460
 I got 200 trees.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.860
 We got poisonous seeds, and soon you're

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.020
 going to be six feet deep.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.580
 It's war now.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.140
 Get to your battle stages.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.820
 No items, box only.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.580
 Final destination, but we don't fight fair.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.340
 When we come to fight, we come and load it for bear.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.560
 We got angels in the air, break bones and tear.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.840
 Got the giant babies running in fear.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.880
 Get that weak sauce out of here.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.400
 We bringing 400k.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.960
 We shooting fire and flame.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.200
 Boy, you got to know that we're winning that day.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.000
 Up, up, in a way, I went to heaven and stayed.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.880
 And I'm a pimp up there, because I ain't never been slayed.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.400
 My name is Enoch, and I'm from another E-Paka.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.640
 Once went to space and I parted with the Ewoks.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.280
 I got one last thing to say.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.940
 I'm so OG, you'll find my rhymes in a cave.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.140
 Dead Ravaradios, your daily paranormal conspiracy

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.540

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.940
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.980
