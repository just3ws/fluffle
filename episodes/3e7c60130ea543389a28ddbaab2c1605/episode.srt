14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,800
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,200
 - Today is a special episode of Dead Rav Radio.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,040
 We're gonna take a look at one story,

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,480
 and that is the story of the Book of Giants,

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,800
 a book that was considered too weird

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,600
 to be included in the Bible.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,560
 In Genesis, there is a brief section

21
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,640
 that mentions the flood that destroyed

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,680
 all of the evil men in the world,

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,160
 but there was an entire book telling the backstory

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,760
 of what happened, involving giants, rogue angels,

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,760
 and the battle so epic,

26
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,240
 the scale has never been matched

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,400
 at any other point in history.

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,840
 We'll explore that and more today on Dead Rav Radio.

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,420
 (upbeat music)

30
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,200
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,320
 of Dead Rav Radio.

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,280
 I'm having a great day.

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

35
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,440
 I got some Patreons.

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,600
 I set up my Patreon account yesterday,

37
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,720
 and I got some.

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,840
 I wanna say thank you to Elkie, Dave H, Dave Carr,

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
 Scott Stewart, and Chris Kilborn

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,720
 for supporting the show.

41
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
 That's really, really awesome.

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
 And I wanna say, just so you guys don't think

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,880
 I'm wasting your money, I bought this book.

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,760
 Let me read you the description of it.

45
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,640
 What is the agenda and purpose

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,200
 of all of this alien activity?

47
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,360
 Why do they hate humanity and work in the darkness?

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,640
 Are we prepared to face them?

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,040
 The war started over 6,000 years ago,

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,960
 I'm assuming this was written by a hardcore creationist.

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,800
 The story started over 6,000 years ago.

52
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,040
 Now, it is more evident with the increasing violence

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,400
 and deaths, what forces are behind it.

54
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
 You can't escape if you are human.

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,800
 They come to eat your flesh and drink your blood.

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,480
 There is only one weapon that will destroy them.

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,240
 Discover it before it's too late.

58
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,960
 That is the description for this book.

59
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,160
 I have found no reviews on it whatsoever.

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,520
 It came out two years ago.

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,880
 It's self-published.

62
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,680
 It's called "Gay Aliens, The Great Deception."

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,160
 And oddly enough, there's copies of the book

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,520
 that are listed as "Gay Aliens, The Great Reception."

65
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,560
 So I don't know if he originally had a typo,

66
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
 but I ordered that book.

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,720
 Thank you, Patreons, for allowing me to buy this $11 book.

68
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,200
 So I will read "Gay Aliens."

69
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,680
 I hope, I'm assuming it's him saying

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
 that aliens are turning people gay.

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,600
 I'm going to assume that's just based on the title,

72
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,960
 but that, I don't know.

73
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,840
 Based on that title and that description,

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
 it could literally be anything.

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,320
 But yeah, so "Gay Aliens, The Great Deception."

76
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,920
 I will let you guys know when I get it,

77
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,760
 if it's any good.

78
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,280
 Spoiler alert, it won't be,

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,200
 but I at least assume it will be hilarious.

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,080
 And it's in paperback.

81
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,040
 There wasn't even a Kindle,

82
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,800
 so I get to have a book sitting on my bookshelf

83
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,360
 with that title.

84
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,520
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

85
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,080
 Now, our first story does require a bit of an introduction.

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
 And I'm going to keep this as brief as possible,

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,320
 because it's basically, it's a history lesson.

88
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
 I recorded one version of it, it was 10 minutes long,

89
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,160
 it was totally born.

90
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,640
 Okay, back in Bible times, there was a guy named Enoch.

91
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,040
 And he went on these adventures,

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,360
 and he wrote about them in this book

93
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,640
 called "The Book of Enoch."

94
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,360
 Now, this is pre-flood

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,600
 when Enoch was kicking about back there, right?

96
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,360
 And he has this, his book is weird.

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,160
 I might do an episode on just his book.

98
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,960
 He goes into space, he's hanging out with angels.

99
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,920
 He's doing all these wacky adventures, right?

100
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,440
 He's very, very well-respected man in the region.

101
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,480
 And he's in like the Jewish lineage.

102
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,680
 So he's a real person.

103
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,280
 He has mentioned several times

104
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,000
 throughout the old and the New Testament.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,640
 He was related to Noah, I believe, as well.

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,200
 But real guy shows up.

107
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,320
 But anyways, he says he went on all these adventures.

108
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,280
 And he also is a main character in the book.

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,000
 We're going to look at "The Book of Giants,"

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,320
 which takes place pre-flood as well.

111
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,000
 Now, back in the, like, I think it was like 400 AD

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,520
 when they were kind of putting the Bible together.

113
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,640
 Jesus is gone, they're putting the Bible together.

114
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,600
 When they're having this huge voting council,

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,800
 they get to the Book of Enoch and the Book of Giants

116
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,120
 and they're like, "No, no, you cannot put these books

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
 in the Bible.

118
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,680
 We have talking snakes, we have buildings being blown up

119
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,440
 by trumpet horns, but this is just ridiculous."

120
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,440
 So they took it out and it pretty much disappeared

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,200
 'cause people stopped studying it,

122
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
 people stopped talking about it.

123
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,040
 And back then, you didn't have the internet archive.

124
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
 It was just gone.

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
 They did end up, centuries later, there was half of it,

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
 a version of half of it, found in China.

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,960
 It was written in Aramaic, but it was found in China.

128
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,800
 And they're like, "Oh, look, it has Enoch in it.

129
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,360
 This is related to the Book of the Bible.

130
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,880
 This is probably, we've heard references

131
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,360
 to the Book of Giants, this is probably it."

132
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,640
 In the 1940s, two dudes are knocking about in the Middle East.

133
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,480
 They walked into a cave by the Dead Sea

134
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,360
 and found a bunch of books of the Bible

135
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,360
 that were written between like 300 BC and 200 AD.

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
 Preserved in jars.

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,120
 And in those jars, you had like real books of the Bible

138
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,400
 or canonical books of the Bible,

139
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,640
 like you had like Genesis and Acts, whatever.

140
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,920
 You had all the goodies, you had all the goodies.

141
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,320
 But you also had the Book of Giants.

142
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,800
 The first half, it starts to decay halfway through.

143
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,880
 So people have looked at it and they go,

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,640
 "This is really, really weird.

145
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,680
 Probably shouldn't have been in the Bible.

146
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,400
 It just is just too weird."

147
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,920
 But I said Enoch is mentioned throughout the Bible.

148
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,000
 Elements of this story I'm about to tell you

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,560
 are mentioned throughout the Bible.

150
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,560
 And in Genesis, the Book of Genesis, it says,

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,080
 "Hey, listen, there was a time when some angels came down

152
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
 and started having sex with humans.

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,520
 And that, I love this quote.

154
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,480
 So let me read you this real quick.

155
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,400
 "When human beings began to increase in number on the earth

156
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,240
 and daughters were born to them,

157
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,000
 the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,680
 were beautiful and they married any of them that they chose.

159
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,440
 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days

160
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,400
 and also afterward, when the sons of God went

161
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,800
 to the daughters of humans and had children by them,

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,480
 they were the heroes of old, men of renown."

163
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,080
 So that's just a little part of Genesis.

164
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,960
 And then it goes on to say, God said,

165
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,360
 "This is not what I wanted.

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,320
 This isn't working.

167
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,520
 Humans are too wicked now.

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
 I'm gonna cause a flood."

169
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
 And then he goes, "Yo, Noah."

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,920
 And Noah looks up in the sky and God is mimicking,

171
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,760
 building a boat.

172
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,240
 And Noah's like, "Oh yeah, I should do that.

173
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,400
 He's just playing Fortnite all day long."

174
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,680
 God said, "Come on, man.

175
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,720
 Build that boat."

176
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,880
 He's like, "I'll do it tomorrow."

177
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,680
 The ultimate procrastinator.

178
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,560
 So that's it.

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,600
 But the book of giants explains,

180
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,080
 there's eight verses in Genesis that tell that story.

181
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,320
 The book of giants explains, step by step, what happened.

182
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,040
 Way more than a flood.

183
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,360
 Way, way more than a flood.

184
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,320
 So let's hop on board the carboner copter,

185
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,200
 strap in, 'cause this one's gonna be nuts.

186
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,160
 We are going back in time to the Middle East.

187
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,560
 Coming over.

188
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,720
 Nice little town.

189
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,080
 Everything's made of clay, except the people

190
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,920
 and the animals.

191
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,640
 All the buildings are made of clay.

192
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,240
 Candles are flying over it's nighttime, right?

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
 Now, the reason why we're here is,

194
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,520
 this is the story of the book of giants.

195
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,320
 God says, "Actually, you know what?

196
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,160
 Let's go to heaven.

197
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,400
 Let's go and sit in this meeting.

198
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,300
 We're going all over the place for this one."

199
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,480
 We're floating on a cloud.

200
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320
 We're floating on a cloud.

201
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,360
 We're in a giant meeting.

202
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,400
 God's sitting there smoking a giant cigar.

203
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,640
 He's seated at a table with 200 angels.

204
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,920
 And he's like, "Listen, guys, project earth is going great.

205
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,600
 But I think we need to do a little bit of more

206
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
 on the blue marble."

207
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
 Pulls down pie chart.

208
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,000
 He's like, "Listen, this is how many people

209
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 are on the planet.

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,360
 This is how many of them are morally good.

211
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,160
 I need you, my angels, my watchers,"

212
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,320
 as the humans know you, "to go down there

213
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,360
 and show them what needs to be done."

214
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,920
 Takes a couple puffs of cigar.

215
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,240
 And now the leader of this group of watchers is Shemihaaza.

216
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,560
 Now, I should say right now that every angel

217
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,320
 sitting in this boardroom,

218
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,760
 this is long after Lucifer tried overthrowing God

219
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,400
 and there was a giant war in heaven.

220
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,120
 It was the ultimate act of rebellion.

221
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,320
 And God took Lucifer and one third of the angels

222
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,760
 and cast them out of heaven.

223
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,600
 This is way after this.

224
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,280
 There was a massive war in this alternate dimension

225
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,440
 before time and space had actually even crystallized

226
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,560
 into a real thing.

227
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,080
 Everyone sitting in this meeting fought in that war.

228
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,680
 Okay, there's not a single person of this 200 man team

229
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,320
 that does not know what happens if you don't follow the rules.

230
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,480
 Some of them may even be like,

231
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,000
 "Oh man, you know, I really like Lucifer.

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,840
 He's a really cool guy.

233
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,680
 Too bad he went nuts."

234
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
 And they're like, "Yeah, you know, just forget it."

235
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,460
 But they all remember that, okay?

236
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,920
 Just remember that as a thing

237
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,600
 that's gonna happen throughout the story.

238
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,560
 So Shemihaaza and his homeboys are like,

239
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,320
 "We will go to earth and do what you say."

240
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,960
 And God goes, "And,"

241
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
 they're all leaving out the door, he stops them,

242
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,560
 "Whatever you do, do not bang them."

243
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,160
 And they're like, "Why would you even suggest that?"

244
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,080
 He is omnipotent.

245
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,840
 He does kind of know what's going to happen next.

246
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,000
 But Shemihaaza's like, "Of course not, dude.

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,280
 Humans are gross."

248
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,760
 So then, (whooshing)

249
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,520
 200 angels fly down earth.

250
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,000
 And they do what God says.

251
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,920
 They start teaching people how to be good people.

252
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,360
 They're picking up old ladies and dusting them off.

253
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
 And then they're repairing the clay houses.

254
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,520
 And they're like, "You know,

255
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,960
 you probably could use some wood in this house."

256
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,400
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, maybe."

257
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,920
 Giving them advice and stuff like that.

258
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,800
 And we're watching this whole thing.

259
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,720
 We're just eating apples.

260
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
 We're having a good time watching these angels

261
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
 do what angels do.

262
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
 But then, as the angels are helping like,

263
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,480
 build a barn or whatever,

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,200
 this woman walks out of her house.

265
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
 And Shemihaaza's like,

266
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,880
 "Oh God, his eyes get super big.

267
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,360
 They're all bouncing out tongue."

268
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,840
 (laughing)

269
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,760
 It falls instantly in love with human females.

270
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,720
 And we, at this point, we saw me eating our apples

271
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
 'cause we know something bad's gonna happen.

272
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,280
 And it spreads.

273
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,360
 The angels are just amazed

274
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,000
 at how beautiful human females are.

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And to be fair, human females are quite beautiful.

276
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,040
 So they start banging the women.

277
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
 Now that is bad enough

278
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,080
 because you're basically creating

279
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,620
 a half human, half angel baby.

280
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,080
 But it doesn't stop there.

281
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,320
 When God is talking about destroying the world,

282
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
 I think anyone who's familiar with the story of Noah,

283
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,800
 but if you aren't, when he's talking about destroying

284
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
 the world, it's not just that

285
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,340
 there's a bunch of half human, half angels.

286
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,200
 He does, in the Bible, it uses the term,

287
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,880
 they were the mighty heroes, the heroes of renown,

288
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,060
 they're mighty warriors.

289
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,360
 It wasn't just that.

290
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,600
 When you look at the book of giants,

291
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,440
 there's a phrase that's used over and over again.

292
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,160
 The women prostituted themselves.

293
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
 Like, "Oh God, we didn't see none of that.

294
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,640
 We saw a woman walk out of her house.

295
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,560
 A guy turned into a cartoon fox for a minute

296
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,680
 and then they started banging."

297
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,240
 But what was going on is the women were basically saying,

298
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,280
 "I will have sex with you, but I want power.

299
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
 I want knowledge.

300
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,780
 I want to know what you know."

301
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,060
 And what we see in the book of giants

302
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,100
 is there are phrases saying that

303
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
 they were taught the secrets of the universe.

304
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,260
 You have these celestial beings that existed before

305
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,380
 the universe even had shape.

306
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,100
 And they're on first date.

307
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,500
 And the girl goes, "So, what are you doing?"

308
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
 He's like, "Oh, I'm a watcher.

309
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,220
 You know, I help build barns and stuff like that."

310
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,740
 And she goes, "Do you know how to stop time?"

311
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,380
 And he would.

312
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,920
 He may not have the necessary power to be able to do that,

313
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,980
 but he would go, "Yeah, actually, I do know how it's done."

314
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,120
 And he'd start explaining how black holes work

315
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
 and all sorts of stuff.

316
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,920
 They taught them the dark arts.

317
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,680
 They taught them basically how to be a witch.

318
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,240
 And in return, the women had their babies.

319
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,920
 That is the beginning of the wickedness.

320
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
 You have angels no longer.

321
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
 They're teaching people, you know, give a penny, take a penny.

322
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,280
 They're teaching them this is how you raise the dead

323
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,480
 to impress these women.

324
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,360
 And the women in turn were banging them.

325
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,520
 And the babies were described as giants.

326
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,720
 Now, sometimes they were literal giants.

327
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,140
 They were just massive people.

328
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,780
 One of them supposedly was 450 feet tall,

329
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,300
 which out of all the details of the story,

330
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
 even the ones I want to tell later,

331
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,140
 I think that's the most unbelievable thing.

332
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,260
 Some of them, they were giant just in that context meant

333
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,580
 immensely strong, mighty.

334
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,060
 So these children were heroes.

335
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,980
 Gilgamesh, the hero from the Mesopotamian mythology,

336
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,420
 is listed as a Nephilim in the book of giants.

337
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,220
 So he's this mighty, mighty hero.

338
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,420
 These people like Hercules, which is the same story,

339
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,060
 a human and a god having a baby,

340
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,840
 causes people to be superhuman.

341
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,400
 We're not talking Superman level,

342
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,500
 but we're talking Captain America level,

343
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,640
 to Hulk level type heroes.

344
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
 We are now reading the newspaper,

345
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,440
 'cause a couple generations are passing this time.

346
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,000
 We luckily don't age, otherwise we'd be dust by this.

347
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,720
 We're reading the Daily Clay.

348
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,280
 It's the only newspaper in town.

349
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,640
 And it's just story after story about these great heroes

350
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,440
 who are going out and slaying enemies

351
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,360
 and bashing lions open, picking mountains up

352
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,200
 and throwing them around.

353
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,600
 Just insane stuff.

354
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,880
 Your newspaper is a comic book.

355
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,860
 There's no pictures back then.

356
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,820
 They didn't know how to draw.

357
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,500
 So it's just words, like regular book.

358
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,900
 But anyways, the point is, is that

359
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,740
 all of these great adventures are going on,

360
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,940
 but power corrupts.

361
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,740
 And these watchers and their witch wives

362
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,040
 and their mighty, mighty kids decide,

363
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,620
 why are we protecting humans?

364
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,420
 We are the dominant species on this planet.

365
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,180
 They cannot fight against us.

366
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,820
 'Cause there would be wars.

367
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,940
 You'd have one of these Nephilim,

368
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,640
 which was the half human, half angel.

369
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,240
 You'd have one of these Nephilim

370
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,380
 just massacre thousand people in a battle.

371
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,000
 You could not stop these guys.

372
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,640
 And they go, why are we fighting,

373
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,860
 why are we even fighting for these guys?

374
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,400
 We should just be ruling them.

375
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,160
 So then this is when we pack up and leave town.

376
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,300
 Most people do.

377
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,200
 And this is happening all over the region.

378
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,240
 The watchers begin to enslave humans.

379
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,240
 Now, again, all of this stuff is really like

380
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,840
 cliche sci-fi fantasy stuff.

381
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,600
 But for thousands of years, people,

382
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,040
 this was a book of the Bible.

383
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,340
 People believed this existed.

384
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,740
 It wasn't until a couple people voted it out

385
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,540
 that it stopped being part of the canon.

386
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,280
 Anyways, let's step back into this.

387
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,520
 We're running out of town.

388
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,680
 We're getting the carbonar copter flying away.

389
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,480
 And if you're human, you're enslaved.

390
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,840
 If you're lucky, most likely they just bash their head.

391
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,840
 They began to take over large parts of the region.

392
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,340
 And then power corrupts.

393
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,920
 They begin to go to war with each other.

394
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,240
 So now you have different angels

395
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,800
 and their superhuman children fighting other angels

396
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,880
 and superhuman children for control of a ravine

397
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,800
 or farmland or whatever.

398
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,360
 And normal humans could no longer live in this area.

399
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,640
 It was just too chaotic.

400
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,080
 Enter Enoch.

401
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,760
 So Enoch is, Enoch is a totally weird dude.

402
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,080
 He has a few, he's almost a superhuman in his own aspect,

403
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,320
 but he's basically like God's messenger,

404
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,840
 God's homeboy on the planet earth.

405
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,040
 Enoch is watching all of this, right?

406
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,480
 And it gets to the point where the watchers basically go,

407
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480
 "You know what?

408
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
 "We're just gonna start eating people.

409
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,360
 "Like we're tired of keeping slaves

410
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,840
 "and we're tired of just killing them.

411
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,440
 "We're gonna start eating people."

412
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,280
 So the watchers begin to eat people.

413
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,560
 So now we're not even slaves.

414
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,880
 We're just dumb animals ready to be devoured.

415
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,520
 At that point, Enoch calls up God and says,

416
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,840
 "Hey, you need to do something about this, right?

417
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,960
 "You need to do something about this.

418
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,520
 "You kind of caused this in the first place."

419
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,840
 God, God, again, first he's a business,

420
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,080
 first he's really proactive working a business meeting.

421
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,240
 It's maybe been 150, 200 years since this all started.

422
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,200
 In that period of time,

423
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,600
 God has become a total deadbeat dad.

424
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,680
 He wants nothing to do with what's going on on earth.

425
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,560
 Enoch goes, "Listen, you have an army,

426
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,320
 "you have an immeasurable army.

427
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,800
 "You have 200 angels

428
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,040
 "and thousands of wives

429
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,600
 "and who knows tens of thousands of superhuman children

430
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,200
 "running around the area.

431
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,440
 "You gotta do something about this."

432
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,120
 And God, God tells Enoch, "No, you.

433
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,520
 "You go do something.

434
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,000
 "I'm just gonna sit here on my big fluffy couch.

435
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
 "I'm retired."

436
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,720
 And Enoch goes, "So let's go on a walk with Enoch.

437
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,440
 "We're gonna walk with Enoch

438
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,920
 "and we're going to enter the camp of the giants

439
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,160
 "with Shemi Haaza.

440
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,920
 "And we're standing now,

441
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,840
 "we're flanked by a bunch of angels

442
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,160
 "and a bunch of hot witches.

443
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,000
 "There's some human kids."

444
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
 And Enoch goes, "Listen, you guys need to stop.

445
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,160
 "You guys need to stop."

446
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,920
 And we're like, "That's all you're gonna say?"

447
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,440
 And Enoch kind of puts his hand up.

448
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,320
 He's like, "Oh, give me a second, give me a second.

449
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,360
 "You need to stop.

450
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
 "Because if you don't stop now,

451
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,400
 "God's gonna destroy all of you."

452
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,120
 Shemi Haaza's like, "Oh, God can't destroy."

453
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,240
 Actually, no, at that point in reality,

454
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,760
 Shemi Haaza was like, "Uh-oh."

455
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,440
 Because again, they have seen what happens

456
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,120
 to angels when they go rogue.

457
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,680
 But Shemi Haaza dismisses Enoch,

458
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,000
 gets him out of there, we all get thrown out on her butts,

459
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,240
 and he doubles down.

460
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,140
 They begin holding secret occult meetings

461
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,760
 on the top of this mountain in the region.

462
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,800
 They would figure out,

463
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,080
 they were basically now uniting themselves.

464
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,320
 So the war between the watchers and their children

465
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,600
 was going to have to come to an end.

466
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,480
 They would have to provide a united front

467
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,440
 because they know what's going to happen.

468
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,820
 There's one version of the story.

469
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,660
 This was one that,

470
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,120
 because I had to read a bunch of articles on this,

471
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,160
 I wasn't able to verify this in other versions,

472
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,020
 but there's one article I read

473
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,360
 that when they were on that mountain,

474
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,640
 they were in contact with Azazel,

475
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,600
 which was another name for Satan, for Lucifer.

476
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,640
 And they were basically saying,

477
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,600
 "Well, if God's going to destroy us,

478
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,480
 "if we don't stop and we don't wanna stop,

479
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,000
 "maybe Satan will help us out

480
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,420
 "with that sweet, sweet satanic power."

481
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,800
 So they've totally just,

482
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,340
 God said, "Stop doing it."

483
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,940
 And they totally went in the opposite direction.

484
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,180
 So at this point,

485
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,620
 God finally gets up off the couch

486
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,380
 and just makes them have bad nightmares.

487
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,940
 Like, again, he can totally end it at any point.

488
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,980
 He gives them bad nightmares.

489
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,020
 So the sons of Shemi Haza one night,

490
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,800
 they woke up and they had this horrible dream.

491
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,980
 So they hold another meeting 'cause this kid's dream.

492
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,260
 And he says, "This is what I dreamt."

493
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,740
 He goes, "I dreamt I was walking through a garden

494
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,860
 "and there was 200 trees in the garden."

495
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,380
 And then an emperor came down.

496
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,520
 Like a burning fireball.

497
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,940
 And the other watchers, this dream,

498
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,900
 that sounds kind of like just a basic surreal

499
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,160
 lynchian type dream,

500
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,680
 but it really concerned the watchers

501
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,220
 that he had this dream.

502
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,140
 So they said, "Listen, there's one person

503
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,980
 "that you can talk to.

504
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,080
 "He's the smartest person on the planet.

505
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,320
 "Go talk to him and ask him what the dream means."

506
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,880
 His name's Enoch.

507
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,880
 So one of these mighty warriors comes to Enoch.

508
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,980
 Enoch's little shack, we're just hanging out there.

509
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,220
 Guy walks in and he goes,

510
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,680
 "Hey, you might know me from killing

511
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,380
 "all those bears the other day,

512
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,460
 "but Enoch, I have to ask you about this dream."

513
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,820
 So he describes the dream to Enoch

514
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,700
 and Enoch's just sitting there drinking his tea.

515
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,220
 Enoch is around 300 years old at this point.

516
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,780
 I should have mentioned that earlier.

517
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,440
 Enoch is a very, very old and wise man.

518
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,020
 He's drinking his tea and he goes,

519
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,820
 "I know exactly what that dream means."

520
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,060
 The 200 trees represent women,

521
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,280
 not the watchers themselves.

522
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,100
 They represent the women, the wives.

523
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,000
 And those trees were watered by corrupt gardeners

524
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,480
 who are the watchers.

525
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,760
 And the fruit, those trees were bearing

526
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,480
 was poisonous fruit and that's you, the Nephilim.

527
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,120
 The emperor coming down on the throne is your destruction.

528
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,000
 You are going to be destroyed first by fire

529
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,960
 and then by flood.

530
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,800
 You will be wiped off this planet.

531
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,880
 The warrior goes back, tells Shemi Haza,

532
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,000
 "Shemi Haza comes to Enoch and goes,

533
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,480
 "is there any way we can stop this?"

534
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,540
 And Enoch goes, "Nope, you've interfered

535
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,660
 "with the normal plan.

536
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,320
 "You had all these babies.

537
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,620
 "You can't have this race on this planet.

538
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,040
 "You just can't.

539
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,620
 "You're not allowed to."

540
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,100
 Shemi Haza is like, "If we pray."

541
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,520
 And Enoch's like, "Nope, it doesn't matter.

542
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,860
 "You should pray for forgiveness

543
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,700
 "is you're going to die,

544
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,660
 "but there is nothing you can do

545
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,700
 "to stop your death at this point."

546
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,620
 And Shemi Haza is like, "That's not funny.

547
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,700
 "I thought you were gonna insert a joke there."

548
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,900
 And Enoch's like, "No, no jokes during that part.

549
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,360
 "I can dab on you before I leave.

550
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,340
 "Will that make you feel better?"

551
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,660
 Shemi Haza's like, "Kinda."

552
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,620
 So Enoch dabs on him and he leaves.

553
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,160
 Shemi Haza goes, "That was kind of cringy,

554
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,740
 "but it didn't make me feel a little bit better

555
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,900
 "because now he knows that not only is he doomed,

556
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,420
 "but his children are doomed.

557
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,660
 "But like everyone who has their back against the wall,

558
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,000
 "you figure maybe I can make one last ditch effort."

559
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,740
 So he gets all of the other Watchers together,

560
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,740
 all of their witchwives, all of their children,

561
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,860
 so they have this massive army

562
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,500
 and they're hanging out by this mountain

563
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,460
 where they worshiped Azazel.

564
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,100
 And so everyone on this battlefield

565
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,420
 under Shemi Haza's control has superpowers.

566
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,860
 They would be the equivalent of if the X-Men

567
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,580
 and the Justice League and the villains,

568
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,500
 the Legion of Doom, whatever,

569
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,840
 all of them were in one plateau.

570
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,820
 So of course, nobody's going to fight these guys

571
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,140
 except for God, right?

572
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,100
 So, but God, again, is the deadbeat dad of this story.

573
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,100
 He doesn't do anything, directly, at least.

574
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,020
 So he calls up his buddy Raphael.

575
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,460
 He gets Raphael up there and Raphael's an archangel

576
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,500
 and he's like, "I need you to clean up a mess for me."

577
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,820
 Raphael's like, "Another one?"

578
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,100
 And God's like, "Yes, yes."

579
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,460
 But this one will be particularly exciting

580
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,980
 if you ever wanted to fight a bunch of superhumans.

581
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,240
 Today's the day, Raph's like,

582
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,160
 "Ah, it sounds kinda cool, doesn't it?"

583
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,840
 God's like, "I know, it actually is kinda cool.

584
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,320
 It sucks that I gotta wipe all these people out."

585
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,840
 But they've polluted the gene pool on Earth.

586
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,160
 So Raphael is like, "I gotta assemble a team.

587
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,720
 I gotta put my crew together, God."

588
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,520
 And God's like, "Go ahead and do that."

589
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,320
 So Raphael goes into the ranks of heaven and he goes,

590
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,480
 "I want you and you and you."

591
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,320
 That's it.

592
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,720
 Everyone's like, "That's all you're taking."

593
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,040
 They know what's going on down there, Raph's like,

594
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,540
 "I think we got this, right?"

595
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,020
 So he brings down Michael, Gabrielle, and Uriel,

596
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,380
 which are all archangels.

597
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,620
 So you have four archangels versus 200 angels,

598
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,660
 all these witches and a bunch of giants.

599
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,060
 Again, all of these angels have fought

600
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,740
 during the war in heaven.

601
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,980
 And these particular four that are coming down

602
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,220
 were the generals.

603
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,120
 They were basically, if you put Conor McGregor,

604
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,280
 General Patton, and Superman in a blender,

605
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,240
 these guys would be Superman level heroes.

606
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,260
 You put them in a blender, the blender would break,

607
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,000
 but out of the ruins of the blender would come Raphael.

608
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So they come flying down into this giant field

609
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,060
 where all these people are assembled, come down.

610
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,560
 I guess they wouldn't go,

611
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,240
 it sounds like they're just coming through a wind tunnel.

612
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,280
 Big old angel wings, they swoop down,

613
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,880
 land on the battlefield.

614
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,920
 And they're like, it's time to go, Shemihausa.

615
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,840
 Shemihausa's like, "No!"

616
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,440
 Now we can get into the dramatic,

617
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,760
 (mimics drumming)

618
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,160
 the war drums are coming and Shemihausa's sweating.

619
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,180
 All of the angels are sweating at this point.

620
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,820
 All the watchers are sweating.

621
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,360
 The kids, the superheroes and their wives,

622
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,520
 don't real, they're just like,

623
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,600
 "Look at, there's four of them versus all of us.

624
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,720
 We're going to win."

625
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,880
 But the watchers know these guys.

626
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,480
 They're like, "Uh-oh."

627
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
 (mimics drumming)

628
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,840
 War drums, (mimics drumming)

629
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,240
 giants roaring in the distance, 450 foot tall giant.

630
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,800
 (mimics drumming)

631
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,680
 Now we're hiding behind a rock.

632
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,640
 We're watching this battle.

633
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,920
 We're hiding behind this rock.

634
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,720
 And, and I should say now, Enoch is gone.

635
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,800
 And he's not anywhere near this battlefield.

636
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,400
 And not only is he not near this battlefield,

637
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,840
 he's still the carpenter copter.

638
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,840
 So we are stuck on the ground.

639
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,920
 We're like hiding behind a rock.

640
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,480
 We are basically two hobbits on this massive battlefield.

641
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,480
 Raphael pulls out a flaming sword,

642
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,640
 making sure he doesn't catch his wings on fire, takes off.

643
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,320
 (mimics gunfire)

644
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,120
 Anyways, dramatic music.

645
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,720
 (mimics gunfire)

646
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,880
 And you have these four angels being to basically carve

647
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,880
 their way through this sea of super humans.

648
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,160
 Now, and carve would be a good way to put it

649
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,920
 'cause they're just decimating these guys.

650
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,760
 But four of anything versus these numbers,

651
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,720
 it's not a cakewalk.

652
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,840
 These angels are cutting down these dudes,

653
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,640
 fighting these other angels,

654
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,480
 chopping off the heads of a couple witches,

655
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,640
 shooting off witty one-liners.

656
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,520
 All this fair and love and gore,

657
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,240
 split dudes, guts open.

658
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,000
 I can't think of a pun for a giant.

659
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,160
 Anyways, he doesn't say anything,

660
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,800
 just steps the giant in the stomachs.

661
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,040
 Giant falls on a bunch of people.

662
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,800
 Anyways, they're chopping all these people up,

663
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,080
 but they are outnumbered.

664
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
 They are outnumbered.

665
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,600
 And over the course of the battle,

666
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,960
 they're not doing too well.

667
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,320
 They're really not doing too well.

668
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,040
 Enoch is gone and we're stuck there.

669
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,840
 And then that is when the tide of battle turns.

670
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,240
 Enoch wasn't, Enoch, God is constantly just not

671
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,800
 paying attention to anything that's going on.

672
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,440
 Enoch, however, goes, you know what?

673
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
 I'm gonna go take care of some stuff, dude.

674
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,280
 I'm gonna go take care of some stuff.

675
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,480
 The angels are holding their own,

676
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,480
 but the wheel of the battle is slowly turning against them.

677
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,440
 That is when throughout the valley, you hear a...

678
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,100
 (ominous music)

679
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:47,640
 And at that point, this isn't the Book of Giants.

680
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,080
 I thought this was an incredible detail.

681
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,080
 At that point, 400,000 humans from across the globe

682
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,000
 have assembled on this battlefield.

683
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 An army of 400,000 men has been drafted up.

684
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,960
 The legends went out that today is the day

685
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,640
 we destroy the giants.

686
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,920
 Today is the day we take back earth.

687
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,900
 And that cry went out.

688
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,560
 People would just pick up their spear,

689
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,400
 leave their village, grab their shield and their sword,

690
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,580
 get their son to tend the farm

691
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,960
 as all the adult men left the city.

692
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,960
 And they just came from all over to that field.

693
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,120
 And they didn't just come with swords and shields.

694
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,420
 The Book of Giants is very specific

695
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,280
 on the weaponry they brought.

696
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,960
 This is part of the fragment from the Book of Giants.

697
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,960
 400,000 righteous came with fire, napatha,

698
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,720
 and brimstone.

699
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,400
 The biggest weapon they had against these giants was fire.

700
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,920
 You have all of them in one location,

701
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,640
 and they just begin raining hell down on these mutants.

702
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,440
 Torched the entire area.

703
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,760
 And as they're burning, as these giants are burning,

704
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,200
 as these witches are being torched,

705
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,700
 you had wave after wave of humans,

706
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,080
 totally normal people running in a battle,

707
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,920
 attacking these super humans,

708
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,340
 taking back for the first time,

709
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,620
 the first time humans were able to fight these guys.

710
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,020
 It took, for archangels on their side,

711
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,380
 it took surprise attack,

712
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,380
 it took thousands and thousands of gallons of napalm

713
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,380
 and brimstone, big ol' rocks,

714
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,620
 who guys are putting on a mid-throwing big,

715
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,500
 heavy rocks of brimstone at 'em.

716
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,340
 People are looking at 'em,

717
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,620
 he's like, "Are you sure you're not a giant?"

718
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,140
 He's like, "No, I'm not a giant."

719
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,340
 Drinks a giant bucket of ale, totally normal.

720
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,180
 They just burnt these monsters to the ground.

721
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,920
 And Sami Haza is watching this whole thing,

722
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
 and he knows it's over.

723
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,440
 He knows that there is,

724
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,880
 the archangels are getting their second wind,

725
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,040
 400,000 troops are surrounding them,

726
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,000
 far outstripping his army,

727
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,560
 and there's just no way they're gonna make this.

728
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,200
 So he leaves, he takes off.

729
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,280
 The day is one.

730
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,480
 (breathing heavily)

731
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,220
 Sharon, after that, Enoch leaves.

732
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,560
 Now, one of the most interesting things about Enoch,

733
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,040
 again, one of the passages that's mentioned

734
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,980
 in the canonical Bible about him,

735
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,060
 is that Enoch doesn't die.

736
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,380
 Scholars, the way the Bible verse is set up,

737
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,120
 is that he walked with God and then he was no more.

738
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,020
 And that has been believed to be by scholars

739
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,460
 that he didn't die, he was taken away.

740
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,860
 He's considered to be the only man in history

741
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,060
 who never died.

742
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,360
 He's in heaven and he's still alive.

743
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,080
 So that's how much of a pimp this dude was.

744
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,000
 That's how, even God's like,

745
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,600
 you know what, I made you do some ridiculous stuff,

746
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,080
 you didn't get to fly around in space,

747
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,320
 but yeah, you don't gotta die, man.

748
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,640
 I'm gonna give you a bus pass to heaven.

749
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,040
 I'm going to, I guess it's more of like a limo ride,

750
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,920
 it's not even a bus pass.

751
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,280
 You don't even have to die.

752
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,640
 Come hang out with me, just come chill with me.

753
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,400
 Enoch's like, yeah, yeah, that's cool.

754
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,800
 And after Enoch leaves,

755
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,120
 Raphael visits Samaehaza one last time,

756
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,260
 lands in front of his hut.

757
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,320
 There's still a few giants left,

758
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,780
 still a few wives, still a few watchers,

759
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,340
 but the majority of them were wiped out in this battle.

760
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,820
 But they were still there

761
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,900
 and they were still interbreeding.

762
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,300
 And so Raphael lands and Samaehaza's sitting there,

763
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,520
 probably all burned up, probably sitting there,

764
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,140
 all bandaged up in bed.

765
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,260
 And Raphael says, so Enoch's gone.

766
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,100
 Enoch's gone now.

767
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,000
 Samaehaza's like, is he dead?

768
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,920
 Raphael's like, no.

769
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,400
 But he's in heaven, he's not here anymore.

770
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,000
 Samaehaza's like, that's weird.

771
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,760
 So that's not expecting.

772
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,480
 Raphael's like, yeah, mysterious ways,

773
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,600
 you know all that stuff.

774
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,540
 But I'm telling you this because now

775
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,680
 it's time for the second part of God's plan.

776
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,860
 There is a flood coming and it will destroy you.

777
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,840
 This is just a message from one angel to another.

778
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,040
 'Cause we fought together.

779
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,660
 I've known you for a billion years, Samaehaza.

780
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,260
 It's time to repent.

781
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,860
 You can't avoid this.

782
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,020
 You've been putting it off all this time.

783
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,420
 You gotta repent.

784
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,980
 Raphael flies away.

785
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,100
 And as he's flying away,

786
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,780
 little raindrops start falling.

787
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:33,740
 Samaehaza looks outside of his hut

788
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,340
 and just watches the rainfall.

789
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,260
 (water running)

790
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,400
 The Great Flood has started.

791
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,000
 So the story's fascinating on server.

792
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,220
 As a narrative, the story I think is really, really

793
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,780
 fascinating, just as a story.

794
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,700
 But what I, you can pick it apart.

795
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,940
 So I think probably the most interesting takeaway

796
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,180
 from the story is that people go,

797
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,740
 well, if the people in biblical times were super wicked

798
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,940
 and then God destroyed the world,

799
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,260
 aren't people today probably even more wicked

800
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,500
 than they were back then?

801
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,740
 Or have been in periods of time more wicked

802
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,660
 than they were back then?

803
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,260
 But it's not the, according to the book of giants,

804
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,700
 that's not the reason why the flood happened.

805
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,980
 It was the fact that they were being wicked,

806
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,180
 but you also had an entire subspecies on earth

807
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,580
 that was destroying his people.

808
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,020
 Now I know a lot of people are gonna go,

809
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,180
 wait a second, so 400,000 righteous men showed up

810
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,940
 at that battlefield and fought off the giants,

811
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,580
 but then God killed them all with the flood.

812
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,260
 Here's, and I don't wanna get too much

813
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,940
 into the weeds on this thing, but the Great Flood,

814
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,580
 the Bible is not a history book.

815
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,860
 It is the religious history of the Jewish people.

816
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,020
 When they had the Great Flood, it flooded the region.

817
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,220
 The word, keep saying that the world is,

818
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,540
 the entire world is flooded.

819
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,340
 It kills all the humans and stuff like that.

820
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,540
 That's not what happened.

821
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,220
 If you look at it in a spiritual,

822
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,420
 a spiritually historical text,

823
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,360
 the flood killed everyone in the region,

824
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,860
 because even the most ardent creationist,

825
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,420
 I can't imagine, could argue,

826
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,260
 well they can be ridiculous, but there was absolutely no way.

827
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,420
 I believe there was a Great Flood.

828
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,420
 I believe that Noah built the ark and all that stuff.

829
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,140
 I do not believe for one second

830
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,580
 that Noah got off the ark with his family,

831
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,080
 and then a thousand years later,

832
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,380
 you had a bunch of Chinese people,

833
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,900
 and they're all descended from Noah.

834
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,060
 That is completely ridiculous.

835
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,540
 There is no, I believe that a giant flood happened,

836
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,340
 and a select family got on a boat,

837
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,740
 and the entire region there was wiped out.

838
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,300
 But outside of that region, you'd have people being like,

839
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,060
 whoo, good thing I was living on this cliff.

840
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,580
 I don't think Noah and his family

841
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,900
 were the last people left.

842
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,580
 I think elements of the Noah story are a parable.

843
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,940
 I don't think you put two of each animal on the boat.

844
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,420
 Again, that just doesn't make any sense.

845
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,820
 But the idea of someone having a portent

846
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,260
 of a natural disaster, avoiding said natural disaster,

847
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,380
 and then reclaiming the land

848
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,140
 where everyone else was destroyed,

849
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,280
 I think historically that could have happened.

850
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,780
 I guess in a world where there's giants,

851
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,820
 you could fit two animal, two of each animal on a boat,

852
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,100
 but anyways, I'm getting too much.

853
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,140
 So those 400,000 people who came to fight the giants,

854
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,780
 they weren't all then wiped out by the flood.

855
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,460
 They went back to their own regions

856
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,220
 and continued to prosper.

857
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,940
 When you hear that story, it's funny,

858
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,920
 'cause again, half of it was a remnants in China,

859
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,220
 and then they found another chunk of it in the,

860
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,260
 they found the beginning half in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

861
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,420
 There are many elements in the story

862
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,660
 we've seen in fantasy novels

863
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:23,060
 that came out before the story of the Book of Giants

864
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,340
 was readily available.

865
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,700
 Obviously, Lord of the Rings, things like that.

866
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,380
 I think that whether or not the story is true,

867
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,020
 I think that the story was passed along

868
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,220
 so much in our culture.

869
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,500
 I think it's become part of our cultural memory,

870
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,700
 where we may not actually remember the story itself,

871
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,260
 but the idea of alien invaders or supernatural beings

872
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,960
 trying to take over the planet,

873
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,540
 the idea of getting the entire planet on one battlefield

874
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,420
 to fight said invaders,

875
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,820
 the idea of divine intervention

876
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,020
 in a battlefield working side by side

877
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,820
 with the good aliens versus the bad aliens.

878
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,500
 You'll see that stuff across sci-fi,

879
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,540
 you'll see that stuff across fantasy literature,

880
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,700
 and I think it resonates to us, like Lord of the Rings,

881
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
 is because it's part of our cultural memory.

882
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,980
 For thousands of years,

883
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,920
 people believed this story was true,

884
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,740
 and then you can now read a story in the 1940s

885
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,460
 about a group of "normal people"

886
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,580
 siding with a good angel, Gandalf,

887
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,860
 versus an evil angel you have Sauron

888
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,060
 who's corrupting the world and everything like that.

889
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,340
 I don't think that he was reading the Book of Giants,

890
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,740
 and even if he did read the Book of Giants to write that,

891
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,580
 we didn't.

892
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,140
 I think our cultural knowledge of that story

893
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,780
 embedded into us made us more excited to hear that story.

894
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,420
 It was reminding us of those old days.

895
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,920
 I personally would like to believe

896
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,500
 the Book of Giants is real, because it's awesome.

897
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,060
 I mean, that story is great.

898
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,740
 I love that story.

899
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,560
 I really would like it to be awesome.

900
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,980
 But, I mean, obviously the logical side of me

901
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,720
 is it's an interesting parable

902
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,980
 to explain a horrible natural disaster.

903
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,180
 But still.

904
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,700
 Wouldn't it be great if you knew for a fact

905
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,940
 that there was a time on this planet

906
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,540
 where we all united to fight back monsters

907
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,820
 and reclaim the world for ourselves?

908
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,700
 This story made me so excited.

909
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,860
 This story?

910
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,020
 This story got me so excited.

911
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,760
 I thought this story's like an action movie.

912
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,440
 And what does an action movie need?

913
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,880
 What does every action movie need?

914
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,520
 It needs a song during the credits

915
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,120
 that recap the events of the story.

916
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:42,400
 Yo, my name is Enoch, and I'm from another E-Paka.

917
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,600
 Once went to space and I parted with the Ewoks.

918
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,520
 But long ago, the watches came inside.

919
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,600
 Some bitches had a bunch of giant babies

920
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,540
 turning women, the witches, putting men up in stitches,

921
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,260
 warfare everywhere.

922
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,060
 They started eating flesh, so I got out of there.

923
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,180
 God sent a dream so they could come to me,

924
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,980
 and I could perceive what it all means.

925
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,460
 I got 200 trees.

926
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,860
 We got poisonous seeds, and soon you're

927
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,020
 going to be six feet deep.

928
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,580
 It's war now.

929
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,140
 Get to your battle stages.

930
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,820
 No items, box only.

931
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,580
 Final destination, but we don't fight fair.

932
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,340
 When we come to fight, we come and load it for bear.

933
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,560
 We got angels in the air, break bones and tear.

934
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,840
 Got the giant babies running in fear.

935
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,880
 Get that weak sauce out of here.

936
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,400
 We bringing 400k.

937
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,960
 We shooting fire and flame.

938
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,200
 Boy, you got to know that we're winning that day.

939
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,000
 Up, up, in a way, I went to heaven and stayed.

940
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,880
 And I'm a pimp up there, because I ain't never been slayed.

941
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,400
 My name is Enoch, and I'm from another E-Paka.

942
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,640
 Once went to space and I parted with the Ewoks.

943
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,280
 I got one last thing to say.

944
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,940
 I'm so OG, you'll find my rhymes in a cave.

945
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,140
 Dead Ravaradios, your daily paranormal conspiracy

946
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,540
 true crime podcast.

947
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,220
 You don't have to listen to it every day,

948
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,940
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

949
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,980
 Have a great one, guys.

950
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,560
