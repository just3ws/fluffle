 Brought to you by Mammoth Live and AG Touring.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Some people believe that marijuana actually slows down your perception of time.

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 But does it do something even more drastic...

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Every time you toke?

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 And then we take a look at the man known as Tesla.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 World famous inventor who died in abject poverty.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Pretty famous dude, there's a car named after him.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 But did you know that this guy also...

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Is from Venus!

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio!

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I'm your host Jason Garment and I'm having a great day.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Hope you guys have a lot of fun things to do today.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Not tomorrow, just today.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Hope you cram in all the fun stuff and then you take a nap tomorrow.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Matt Springfield.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Matt Sprinkle.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to Matt Sprinkle doing cart whales while he enters the room.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Doing a little bow, doing a little bow.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It's a little ostentatious.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Matt, that's okay. You deserve it. You're a Patreon supporter.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Matt, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 If you can't support the Patreon guys, that's fine too.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Just help spread the word about the show.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 So Matt, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jet.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Give you a little pair of aviator glasses I throw them and you catch them all cool and put them on.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 On top of the Jason Jet, fly us out of here Matt.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We are going to a secret government facility.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Somewhere in the middle of America.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 We get there, we're wearing our lab coats, walking around.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And we notice that all the other scientists are just kind of like sitting there.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 They're just all kind of sitting there. All the scientists are just kind of chilling out.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 We notice that like laboratories, some of their equipment's been cleared out and there's like beanbag chairs everywhere.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Like this is a guy, he's looking at a lava lamp through a microscope.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 He's like groovy dude.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 We hear someone coughing in the distance of the laboratory.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 We round the corner and we see a couple of scientists with a big fat joint in their hands.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And they hold it to us like a 3D movie.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 They're holding it right at the camera. They're like, "Want a toke bro?"

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 A little cliffhanger. A freeze frame, a little cliffhanger.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 You know that marijuana use, one of the side effects of it is that it slows down time.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 What it does is it speeds up the user's measurement of time.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It doesn't actually slow time down.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Don't go play baseball. It'll be like, "Oh, I can totally catch this ball now."

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Time goes quote-unquote "normal." It's fairly relative, but time will move at a normal pitch for everyone around you.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 But for someone who's high, everything seems to go by much, much slower.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And this is something that scientists have actually tested.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 The scientists are like, "I'll be in the group. I'll volunteer my body for science."

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 You get stoned and then you have to gauge how long you've been in that room.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 They've even done it to rats.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 They've gotten rats high, which would be an amazing job as a scientist.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Imagine going into school for six years and you're just blowing smoke, your hot boxing mice.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 You're like, "Dude, they get the rats high."

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And they said they had this thing set up where the rats every, let's say, three minutes.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 It was a timed interval. Every three minutes, the rat could walk up, hit a button, and food would roll out.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And the rat was trained that they could hit the button as much as they wanted, but it would only come out after, say, three minutes.

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 So the rats started to learn, "Oh, I'm hungry. I mean, how much do you have to eat every three minutes?"

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Those must be the fattest rats in the world. They're like, "Ugh, no more experimentation."

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 But anyway, so these rats were trained that food would only come out every three minutes, so they only started hitting it once every three minutes, so the food would come out, because otherwise it was useless.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 When they got the rats stoned, though, they kept hitting the button again.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Like, kept, like, hitting it, thinking that three minutes had passed. It wasn't like they were like, "Come on, give me food. I'm sure they had the munchies, too."

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 But they would hit the button and wait for the food to come out, and it would dawn on them, "Oh, dude, maybe it hasn't been three minutes yet."

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So he'd walk away and then he'd come back, he's like, "Oh, man, I'm so hungry. It's been three minutes. Ting!"

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Nothing. He's like, "Oh, man, no. Next time it'll..." And basically it slows down time perception and mice.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 So marijuana does affect your ability to perceive time.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So my theory is this. That's kind of a long preamble, but my theory is this, I'll wrap this up.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I have a theory. If weed messes with time perception, what is time but perception?

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Now, sure, you can buy a pumpkin and watch it rot. Isn't that a passage of time?

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Yeah, but you can take a big enough object and actually warp time.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Time isn't this constant thing. It's actually pretty gooey, really.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 So here we go, guys. If you've smoked weed, you'll know that the earliest times of smoking weed are super, super strong.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And then as time goes on, you actually seem to get less stone.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Now, there's a couple of caveats there, but hear me out.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 For the most part, you start smoking, the weed kicks a lot harder, assuming you're smoking anything decent and not bammer that you bought from your cousin.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Good stuff. You get totally blazed, but as time goes on, the weed doesn't kick like it used to.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Eventually, you taper out because the return of investment isn't worth it.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 You're like, "I'd rather drink a beer or rather ride a bike or go running or something like that."

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Or, "You nothing just sit there too lazy to smoke weed."

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 My theory is this. The first time you get high, time distorts so much that you are smoking with every future you that's smoking.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 So you take that hit and 10,000 other yous,

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 hitting that joint, ripping that bong, eating that edible, however else you do it, that's only three ways I know.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I'm sure now you can inject it or something like that. Topicals.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 The first time you get high, it's every future you getting high.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 But as time goes on, there's less future versions of you to get high with.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 So eventually, you're like, "Yeah, it just doesn't kick like it used to. It just doesn't kick."

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Because the future you has already stopped smoking.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So by the time you're in your late 20s, in the future, you stopped smoking at age 32.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It just doesn't hit that special button inside of you. I don't know any other analogies.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Weeds like, "Boo!" hits a little button.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 But you go, "Jason, that's just because of tolerance buildup."

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 You can actually take a break from weed for a year or several years.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I used to smoke a lot when I was in my early 20s. Took a break.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Smoked again in my early 30s. Haven't smoked in years.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 But even then, after that tolerance, I didn't take a tolerance break.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I just didn't want to smoke anymore. When I started smoking again,

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 it wasn't as strong as it was when I was younger.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 It was still good, but it wasn't as strong.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 You go, "Jason, I've smoked weed for 40 years and it's never gotten less."

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Like, sure I've had to up it a little bit, or I've taken a break here and there to kind of reduce my tolerance,

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 but I've been smoking for 40 years straight. I'm only 43 years old, Jason.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 That's because the future yous keep smoking.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 You are a lifelong pothead. No, no, it's self-intended there.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But you're just one of those people who are going to smoke like Willie Nelson until the day you die.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 So you don't have a future yous running out.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 The weed high stays.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 You go, "Jason, I actually, that doesn't make sense at all because I smoked, I don't know, three or four times in college.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 I absolutely hated it. It wasn't because the future yous stopped smoking after four or five times."

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Marijuana may distort time so much it breaks it.

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 The really the only difference between you now and future you is little clicks of an atomic clock.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 But if future you was standing on the edge of a black hole, first of all, I'm sorry that that happened to you.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Whatever chain of events got you to stand on the edge of a black hole.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Time is not the same anymore.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Even on a planet that's bigger, that distorts the time space continuum, the time space plane, things are going to be different.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So time is super malleable and your brain can already do so much amazing things.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Who's not to say?

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And you're like, "Jason, there's a lot of people who would say that smoking weed doesn't let you reach across time, but I don't know.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 I don't know.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Think about it.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Think about it the next time you're getting stoned if you still smoke weed.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 I think that it may distort time so much it's not just a matter of you going,

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 "Dude, we've been playing Super Smash Brothers for like hours, but I just looked at my watch.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 First off, I have a watch for some weird reason and then that one of four started smoking tonight.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 I just looked at my watch and we've only been playing for five minutes.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 That's pretty normal with smoking weed.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 But then you turn to your buddy and you look and that buddy is you 30 years from now.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 A joint hanging out of their mouth.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 A gleam in their eye going, "Get wrecked, noob."

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Apparently they're a total dork and they're using that phraseology 30 years from now.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 But they beat you at the game is what I'm saying.

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 So I think that's my theory.

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 When you smoke weed, you're smoking with future versions of you.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Here's a question actually.

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 When you get super stoned, next time you do, you might be super stoned right now.

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 You think to yourself, "Future me, what are you doing?

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 What are you doing right now?

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And I wonder if you can send a message in the future."

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Actually, that's just opening yourself up to a bunch of goats showing up.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Don't do that.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 But Matt, let's go ahead and leave behind this laboratory of a bunch of stoners.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Call in that carbonar copter.

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 We are headed out to New York City.

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 [Making a sound effect]

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 We were just here yesterday.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 We have to make a return to the Big Apple.

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Land that carbonar copter in the middle of Times Square.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 As we're landing, we all yell the same time, "Hey, we're landing here!"

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And we laughed ourselves.

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 The streets are empty actually.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 I think they're in another lockdown right now.

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 We can land the helicopter wherever while Matt is hot-wiring a parked car

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 so he can drive us around New York City.

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I turn to you guys and I say, "This is a really interesting story."

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 A quick overview though.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Nikolai Tesla, he was a contemporary of Thomas Edison, a genius inventor.

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 A lot of people felt he was ahead of his time, way ahead of his time.

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 He invented a remote control boat in like 1920 or 1930 or something like that.

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Some of the other people, they would seem magical.

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I don't know if I didn't think they had radios back then.

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 People are trying to listen to like Howdy Doody and it's like they're just your boat engines coming over their radio.

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 But he had all this crazy stuff.

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 We'll get into more of it later because it'll play a part in the story.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 But he's now become a cult figure.

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 There was a long period of time where Nikolai Tesla was truly a fringe scientist.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 He died destitute.

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Thomas Edison hated his guts.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 He was constantly sabotaging him.

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 That's why he was basically getting a $500 monthly allowance from Czechoslovakia, which $500 back then.

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 That's not money to sneeze at. That's pretty good money.

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 But he died poor anyways because he had a bunch of...

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 You know how much it cost to buy bolts for ringsine monsters neck?

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Buy those mad scientist wigs. It costs a lot of money.

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Tesla for a long time was considered like fringe.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 He wasn't somebody a lot of people knew about.

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Basically you had to be Uber nerd or a paranormal nerd to know about Nikolai Tesla.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Now he's very famous.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 There's movies and cartoons and comic books made about him.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 There's a car made about him.

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Now when someone has a shirt that says "I love Tesla"

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 You know that shirt doesn't mean they're a fan of the car company.

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Maybe they are.

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 But it's most likely a reference to this Uber nerd geek scientist stuff like that.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 So he has kind of... I guess now I'm feeling...

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Now I'm kind of being a hipster.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I knew him before he was cool.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Obviously I've been researching this stuff for decades.

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I was aware of Nikolai Tesla stuff.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 That's why I'm brushing over a bunch of it.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I imagine you guys have a passing knowledge of Tesla at this point.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Either through pop culture or actually doing research on him.

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 But did you know?

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Fair traveler.

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Matt finally has the taxi cab hot wired.

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 He's giving us a ride around.

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Did you know that Nikolai Tesla...

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Well, I'm gonna let the headline speak for itself.

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 This is the headline from howunwise.com.

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 FBI vault.

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Nikolai Tesla...

219
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Nikola... Nikola? I think it's actually how you pronounce it.

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Doesn't matter.

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Nikolai Tesla was brought to Earth by Vesuvians in a spacecraft.

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I don't know why they had that last part.

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 I don't think they did like a Hail Mary pass and threw an Earth.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 FBI vault.

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Nikolai Tesla was brought to Earth by Vesuvians.

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 By Venetians.

227
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 By people from Venus.

228
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Okay, the point is that the FBI vault had a document saying that Tesla...

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 This episode is going off the rails.

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Tesla was brought to Earth from Venus.

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Now I gotta say this too, again really briefly, because we have a ton of stuff to cover.

232
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 The FBI vault.

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 We see this happen all the time.

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 The FBI vault, someone will find a document and they'll say, "FBI says,"

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 or "FBI has a document claiming that Mars used to have a bunch of people on it."

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 That the Adam and Eve story took place on Mars.

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 There was remote viewing on Mars, da-da-da-da.

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 The FBI is not saying that.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 FBI has documents from the Monroe Foundation, which we've covered before.

240
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 That say that.

241
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 The FBI has never gone on the record whether or not there are secret bases on Mars from 300,000 years ago.

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 The FBI vault just gobbles up and any information they think may be important that day or a hundred years from now.

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 They simply gobbled all this stuff up and at a certain point they do a Freedom of Information Act

244
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 and so they dumped a bunch of documents that FBI had on Tesla.

245
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 So they're not actually saying that.

246
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 That would be the equivalent of someone coming over to your house seeing a Spider-Man comic book and assuming you are Spider-Man.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Or at least you know him, because you have documents pertaining to the existence of Spider-Man.

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 It's the same thing.

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 This claim that Tesla came from outer space actually came from a document that's in the FBI vault.

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 From the Interplanetary Sessions newsletter dated June 14th, 1957.

251
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 So way after Tesla has passed away they have this document.

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Margaret Storm is writing a book about Tesla called Return of the Dove.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Now when she was writing this book she got access to what's known as a Tesla set.

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 It's one of the many inventions he was working on.

255
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 The Tesla set was something that he had diagrams for but he was never able to invent himself.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 He drew it out in 1938. He died in 1943.

257
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 It wasn't until after his death that they actually were able to build this.

258
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And using the Tesla set they got this message from Space Aliens.

259
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Also known as the Space People, which is like the most generic name, but apparently they're good at communicating with aliens but not good with naming them.

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 This is the story.

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Tesla was born on Venus and then he was brought to Earth and given to Mr. and Mrs. Tesla to race him.

262
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 That's why all of his inventions are so weird. Because he's actually not from this planet.

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 So we have that. We have this interesting story, Tesla's from outer space.

264
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 That's why he was so ahead of his time. Fine, whatever.

265
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 But you have to take this document in context.

266
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 This document also says, "We don't know if Margaret Storm will be able to finish her book by June 30th."

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Now this newsletter was coming out June 14th, 1957.

268
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Why is it so important for her to have her book finished by June 30th?

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 July 1st, 1957. Do you guys remember reading about this in the history books?

270
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 From 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Massive UFO fleets hovered over every major city in the United States.

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Do you remember that? You remember that?

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Because that's what this newsletter is actually predicting.

274
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 On June 14th the author is saying, "Listen guys, I hope she has this book done by June 30th, because by July 1st, we'll all know the truth.

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 There'll be UFOs everywhere."

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 He makes these predictions that at 9 a.m. first they're over like Washington, D.C.

277
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 and then like at 3 p.m. they're over a couple other cities.

278
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And I don't know where they're taking their time. They're an alien fleet. Time war is different.

279
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 For them, they're super stoned.

280
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 But he does give this caveat. Obviously, that didn't happen.

281
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 He gives this caveat like everybody makes in predictions.

282
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 He goes, "The alien fleets are coming down. They're tired of us.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Having nuclear weapons, polluting the environment, all that stupid nonsense."

284
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And then he goes, "But, but, if you don't see any UFOs, that's because the government chased them away.

285
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Chased them away."

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 So, I mean, that's a, I mean, here's the thing.

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 You could go, "Jason, maybe there were UFOs in the government chased them away."

288
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 I don't remember reading in history books either about every fighter jet in the United States being launched on July 1st chasing them away.

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 But anyway, so that's a good out, right?

290
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 You make a prediction that's going to happen two weeks from now.

291
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Get everyone riled up, but also say, "You know, it could be wrong. It could be wrong."

292
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 But not because of me. Not because I'm making this up.

293
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 It's because of some sort of external force.

294
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 That's the article that is written on howandwise.com.

295
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 But that's not the whole story.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 This is so weird.

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 I don't know why. I know why howandwise.com.

298
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And I know why a lot of websites would focus on that particular story.

299
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Because it's sexy with aliens and stuff like that.

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Little Tesla coming down from Venus.

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 But in that same dump of documents, the same FBI dump of documents, this is what I found.

302
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 This is no joke. This is 100% real.

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Actual FBI memorandums written by special agents.

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 We have a copy of a document made on January 9th, 1943.

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 The document is addressed to a Mr. Foxworth, most likely Percy Foxworth,

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 who was the chief of the FBI Special Intelligence Service.

307
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Tesla had died on the 7th of January.

308
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 So the document's only being crafted two days after Tesla died.

309
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 So Tesla died on the 7th, and the day that he died, a Mr. A. N. Spanal contacts the FBI that rhymes.

310
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 But this whole thing's not a Dr. Seuss thing.

311
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 The agent in question was Special Agent Fred Cornels, and he's the one drafting this document, investigating this case.

312
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 The day that Tesla died, Mr. Spanal called the FBI and said,

313
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 "Listen, I don't know how much you know about Tesla.

314
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I don't know if you know how to pronounce his first name, Nikola Tesla."

315
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 But he's been working on a lot of crazy stuff.

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And if that stuff gets into the wrong hands in 1943, when World War II is still going on, it's not going to be good.

317
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 One of his distant relatives, one of Tesla's distant relatives, and someone who Tesla had told people that he hated,

318
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 was his nephew, Sava Kosanovich, from Czechoslovakia.

319
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Mr. Spanal says, "Listen, this nephew's coming here, and he's trying to get Tesla's notes."

320
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And I'll be honest, he's been in America for a couple months, but if he gets these notes, I think he's going to give them to the enemy.

321
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 So you guys need to secure this location. I don't think you guys know what he's working on over there.

322
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Mr. Spanal explains, "Listen, I work for the government. Like an outsider, I work with the government.

323
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I work on science-y stuff. I know Tesla, and I know him through acquaintances as well.

324
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 You've got to take care of this." And the special agent goes, "Yeah, okay, you know, we'll look into it."

325
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Hanks it up, special agent starts writing up the report. He doesn't really know who Tesla is.

326
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 This guy's calling him, making these claims. The phone rings a couple minutes later, and agent Cornel picks it up.

327
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And it's Mr. Spanal again. He goes, "Yeah, I remember how I told you how I worked for the government."

328
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And special agent's like, "Yeah." And he goes, "Yeah, I just talked to the vice president's personal assistant.

329
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 You are ordered to go and secure that location right now. That's coming from the top."

330
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 The FBI gets the ball rolling. The next day, January 8th, the FBI contacts, "Blois Fitzgerald."

331
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 That's a great name, "Blois." "Blois Fitzgerald, who was Tesla's protege."

332
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 They call him in for an interview, and they say, "Hey, so what's going on with this Tesla guy?"

333
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 We know he passed away. We're being told he has all these documents. And "Blois" goes, "Oh, yeah, yeah."

334
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 He built a new type of torpedo. And they're like, "What?" He's like, "A brand new...

335
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 This torpedo has never been seen before. It's this design, and the FBI just kind of ran it down.

336
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 They're like, "Yeah, we don't want that falling into enemy hands." And "Blois" goes, "He also has documents about wireless energy.

337
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 It's a way that you can actually just transmit energy. No more plugs, no more outlets.

338
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Stuff could rove out in the middle of nowhere you wouldn't need to recharge stuff.

339
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Things are constantly charging. The FBI is like, "Okay, that's kind of weird, but that would be helpful as well."

340
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And then "Blois" goes, "Oh, yeah." And then the "Death Ray." FBI is like, "What? Wait, what?"

341
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 "Blois" is like, "Yeah, he built a death ray. He basically built a beam weapon that can be put on planes,

342
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 that can shoot down other planes, or it can just be put on the ground and shoot down planes.

343
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 It can shoot down anything. It doesn't just shoot down planes. It's a death ray."

344
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 "Blois" also says, "Listen, I'll be honest with you, Sava got a locksmith, broke into Tesla's apartment,

345
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 and got into his safe." That's one crummy locksmith, right? He's like, "I'll do whatever you want for a price."

346
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 He got into the apartment, broke into the safe, and took out some of Tesla's documents.

347
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And Sava left the country. So "Blois" goes, "Listen, I don't know what he took. Hopefully it wasn't too destructive,

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 but you're not too late. You see, Tesla actually has crates of just papers, of drawings and sketches

349
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 and designs and stuff like that. He kept some of them at a warehouse, other ones he'd kind of hit around town.

350
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I don't know the locations of all of them. I know where the warehouse is. That's what he was using some of the

351
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Czechoslovakian money for. But if you get a couple of those crates, that'll probably be a good start.

352
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And the FBI goes, "Okay, cool. You know how many crates there are full of documents and drawings and diagrams?"

353
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 And "Blois" goes, "There's 80 of them spread around the city like some sort of side quest on an open world video game.

354
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I don't know if they ever retrieved all 80 chests. There's possible that there's still a couple chests out there

355
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 in some dusty New York basement, but they are able to secure the majority of them."

356
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 So the FBI secures all the documents they can on January 8th, the day after Tesla dies.

357
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Sava took some of those documents and disappeared behind the slowly encroaching iron curtain.

358
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 On January 9th, that memo goes out to Percy Foxworth, chief of FBI's Special Intelligence Service.

359
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 On January 15th, Percy Foxworth, Special Agent Dennis Haberfield, and 33 others are on a plane flying over North Africa.

360
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Percy Foxworth was ordered to go on a mission for General MacArthur.

361
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 That plane disintegrated on January 15th, 1943.

362
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 It has never been determined what the cause of that accident was.

363
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Here's a quote regarding this accident, "Although 35 people were onboard the aircraft,

364
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 search teams were only able to locate sufficient remains to be placed in a single casket."

365
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Percy Foxworth was made aware of this situation on the 9th, and six days later, his plane and everyone on it was,

366
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 for really lack of a better word, disintegrated.

367
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And his group had just taken control of documents about building a death ray to shoot planes out of the sky.

368
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 That story is honestly more interesting than the Venus one, because it's true. All of it's true.

369
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 To wrap this up, let's go ahead and put our conspiracy caps on for a second.

370
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 It probably is a coincidence, because the world is full of coincidences.

371
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 That little over a week since Tesla had died, only six days after Percy Foxworth got the memorandum,

372
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 talking about Tesla's death ray and the race to retrieve those documents,

373
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 could just be a coincidence that six days after that his plane disintegrated in midair,

374
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 which is one of the reasons why the death ray was made in the first place.

375
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Is it possible that Sava is the one who got the plans for the death ray, took them back to Czechoslovakia,

376
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 and in that short amount of time with those detailed blueprints were able to construct a death ray

377
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 and use it against the plane flying over North Africa.

378
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 It may have been dumb luck that they hit that plane,

379
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 or they may have known that this chief of the FBI was personally entangled in collecting the documents that Tesla had left behind.

380
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 They had to take him out and set the search back until they could retrieve even more of those crates around New York City.

381
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 So, dear listener, if you ever find a crate, open it up with the crowbar, it's full of documents,

382
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 you can tell from the handwriting that they're written by a Czechoslovakian.

383
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Why don't you just put that crate back where you found it and forget that it ever existed?

384
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 It's quite likely that simply knowing these documents exist can put you in the crosshairs of a sci-fi weapon,

385
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 and if they stopped investigating the possible murder of a chief of the FBI,

386
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 what happens when you get evaporated or me?

387
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 We just become another missing person case.

388
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And when the investigators come to try to get to the bottom of it,

389
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 they don't notice that it looks like something's been moved recently.

390
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 They don't notice that the crate you found you were so curious about is no longer sitting in your living room.

391
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 You are gone, so are the documents, and neither will never be found.
