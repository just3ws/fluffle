00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.800
 The U.S. Army warns its service members that if they want to see the movie Joker,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.600
 they better be prepared to fight.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.800
 And then we take a look at an interesting story of a man who traveled to an alternate dimension

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.200
 simply to buy some McDonald's.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.400
 And that dovetails into a story, a personal story of mine I like to call

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.200
 The Haunted Windies, today on Dead Ravvr Radio.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.000
 I'm a little like a lifestyle, actually I'm a walkie-talkie.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravvr Radio.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 So the other day I did an episode about UFOs, drones being spotted over Iranian power plants.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.600
 I do have to make a slight correction of that story.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.200
 The story itself, I stand by, the story itself was reported.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.800
 But the video that I talked about is actually video of a like a barbecue in Texas.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.400
 I talked about this video of this, it was only like maybe 10 seconds of the episode,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.200
 but I talked about a video you see in this drone flying around in all this anti-aircraft fire.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.600
 Turns out it was just a bunch of hillbillies trying to shoot down an RC drone.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.200
 So that was my mistake for including that example, but the story itself I still stand by.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 Just the video that I talked about briefly.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.600
 That was fake.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.000
 So when that type of stuff happens, I'm not going to try to cover it up.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.200
 I will admit that video itself is fake, but I'm going to leave it in the episode

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.000
 and then people will hear this correction and go, "That is a man of integrity."

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Or a man who doesn't really look into videos.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.200
 Which is why I don't feature a lot of videos, because they're honestly one of the easiest things to fake.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.200
 So that correction being done, let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.400
 Now our first story is very near and dear to my heart.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.800
 October 4th is my birthday. Nine days from now I will be 43 years old.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.400
 Feel free to sing Happy Birthday wherever you're at.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.000
 And it will magically come to me. It will make me feel good.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.400
 I'll get all these shivers as I'm walking around.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.200
 I'll spend the whole day just quivering.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.400
 October 4th is also the release date for the movie The Joker, which I've been waiting for.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.800
 I really hope it's good, dude.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.800
 There's a chance I want to go in and I'm going to be super bummed out and like, "Ugh, I'll show you Joker movie."

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.800
 Actually, I shouldn't do that because that's kind of the point of our next story.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.000
 But I'm really looking forward to the movie The Joker, or Joker, I guess it's better way, because that's the actual title.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.800
 But really looking forward to that movie.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.600
 I really, really love the character of The Joker. We've talked about that before.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.400
 I love-- I think he works best as a foil to Batman.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.600
 He would be a terrible Spider-Man villain or horrible Fantastic Four villain.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.000
 But he's the perfect foil for the world's greatest detective, because he is complete chaos.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.400
 He's totally outside the box.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.200
 He is the box and outside of it and he's just-- he's--

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 Anyways, you guys get it.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.200
 So I could go on and on about Joker.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.400
 I'm sure I will do a Joker review.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.600
 So if the movie sucks, it'll be a two hour long episode, because I just rip into it.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.000
 What happened on Tuesday of this week is the US Army released a memo and it was listed as official release only.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.500
 But of course, you know, it was an email that went out to the service members and somebody leaked it.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.300
 So let me-- let me tell you a little bit about this memo here.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.200
 So they released this memo and what happened was the FBI-- here's a quote from this memo.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.800
 The FBI, quote, "discovered disturbing and highly specific chatter in the dark web

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.000
 regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the Joker release."

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.600
 So it seemed that this threat was coming out of Texas or was directed towards Texas, the Lone Star State.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.900
 But they released this message and then the US military, the US Army said,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.600
 "Listen, if something happened, when you're going into the theater, identify two points of exit."

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.400
 They were like, "Remember when you went to go see the Love Guru in the theater

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.900
 and you were looking to try to escape the whole time?

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.000
 Do that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.700
 Imagine Joker is the Love Guru and you just can't wait to leave that theater at any moment.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.100
 You might have to get up and walk out because that movie was garbage.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.100
 So this is technically from now on going to be called the Love Guru Memorandum."

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.000
 And they said, "Now I got to change back to actual seriousness."

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.400
 They said, "Go in and identify two points of exit and you do the run hide fight."

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.000
 So you do what they call the run hide fight.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.900
 So your first case of action is to get out of the theater.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.200
 Second case of action, if you can't get out of theater, is to conceal yourself.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.000
 You wear your ghillie suit to the movie theater.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.500
 You just have popcorn stuck to it.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.800
 I know you guys are thinking, "Jason, you're making fun of a possible mass shooting."

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.900
 Trying to just keep it light.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.600
 You can hide.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.900
 And this is good advice for anyone in a mass shooting, really.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.600
 First thing you should do is try to run away.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.800
 Second, if you can't run away, you should conceal yourself somewhere.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.900
 Third, if you can't do either of those things, you should fight back.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.700
 That's pretty normal stuff.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.500
 And the memo goes on to say this.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.200
 So they're saying that the person or persons targeting the movie theater are incels,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.200
 which are involuntary celibates.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.400
 It's a slang term or an actual term for someone who is involuntarily celibate.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.000
 They want to have sex, but they can't.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 And this is what the memo says.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.600
 "Incels are individuals who express frustration from perceived disadvantages to starting intimate relationships."

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.300
 That's really, really a lot of $3 words to explain.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.200
 They can't get laid and they want to.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.500
 "Incel extremists idolize violent individuals like the Aurora Movie Theater Shooter."

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.100
 That was the guy.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.700
 He actually never said he was the Joker.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.400
 A lot of people said, "Oh, he dressed up like the Joker and went and shot up during a Batman movie."

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.200
 He was just an orange-haired freak who shot up a movie theater.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.600
 So he wasn't the Joker.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.900
 I'm a Joker apologist.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.700
 I've become a man who now has to defend the Joker.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.400
 And then going back to this article, going back to this quote,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.100
 "They also idolize the Joker character, the violent clown from the Batman series,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.200
 admiring his depiction as a man who must pretend to be happy,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.500
 but eventually fights back against his bullies."

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.200
 Why do I have to keep defending the Joker?

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.700
 The Joker is that characterization of the Joker.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.500
 You guys are like, "Jason, this has nothing to do with this."

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:44.100
 The characterization of the Joker has never been ever a man who must pretend to be happy while fighting back against his bullies.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.800
 That may be what the new movie's about,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.400
 but no, he's always been at the very least a common thug,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.300
 a predator of the good people of Gotham.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.800
 And in the most, just a cosmic-level diabolical creature.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.400
 So whoever wrote this doesn't read comic books.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.700
 So that's my first quibble with it.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.000
 But let's let that aside.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.900
 My Joker apologist stance aside.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.300
 It's, I don't want to do the normal,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.500
 it's sad that we live in a world where we have to do this and it is sad.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.700
 And it's not that it could be the military overreacting to which they have a tendency to do.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.000
 Military overreacts to everything.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.900
 It's not that.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.500
 I am willing to throw out a conspiracy theory.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.800
 And it's actually a conspiracy theory I've come up with a long time ago.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.900
 And also, let me say this.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.400
 If you are an incel, if you consider yourself an incel, the words have power.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.500
 And when you label yourself an incel, you really can't, it's hard to control what other people call you,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:48.500
 but when you label yourself an incel, you're giving your body that tag.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.500
 You're giving yourself that tag.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.200
 You can have those feelings of frustration that you can't be in an intimate relationship with somebody,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.900
 but the more power you give words, the more power we give words as a community,

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.500
 and especially the words you attach to yourself, they give them power.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.700
 I don't attach negative words to myself.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.200
 Like, I don't call myself fat.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.600
 I will make jokes about me being chubby and I'll make jokes about me being fat,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.800
 but in my own private moments, I don't look in the mirror and go, "I'm fat."

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:22.500
 I don't assign negative words to me outside of some sort of humor or something like that.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.600
 And I will say, "I used to be fat.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:31.500
 I'll use negative terminology of me in the past, but I don't use negative terminology for who you are."

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.900
 Sorry, that was a little preaching moment.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.700
 Let's get back to an actual interesting thing.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.100
 So, this is conspiracy theory I have.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.500
 I have no proof of this and it's most likely not true.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.800
 So, take it with a grain of salt.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.900
 Who... this is what we look at when we look at conspiracy theories, especially ones that Jason made up.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:55.400
 Who has the most to gain with people being afraid to go see Joker at the movie theater?

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.500
 And who has the ability to pull off something like this?

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.300
 And who owns the Magic Kingdom?

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.200
 Disney.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200
 Disney.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.700
 The Disney company got a bunch of people on the dark web and being like,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.600
 "You... the thing that is amazing about the internet is anyone can be anything."

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.100
 So, you could have Bob Iger sit down and be like,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.300
 "Oh man, I wish I could have so much sex.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.300
 I'm gonna go do all this violent stuff."

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.200
 And then it's just an anonymous thing on the web.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.000
 So, Joker is poised for like a hundred million dollar opening weekend.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.300
 Joker's being talked about, it's like one film festivals, it's talked about being Oscar worthy.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.800
 That's the one thing Disney movies have never even come close to. Not... I should say Disney Marvel movies.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.000
 Joker, it is... and this is another reason why I'm looking forward to this movie.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.400
 And it could be hyping it up too much, but Joker may possibly change the superhero genre.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:59.400
 I will actually go so far to say that Joker may have the same effect on the superhero genre as Pulp Fiction had on Independent Film.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.100
 Because I was talking to my lord, and this is one thing I like about DC.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:08.200
 The movies are so weird. They're just so bizarre. You have mustard, you have like a dance scene,

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.900
 and then everyone gets killed by mustard gas and Wonder Woman, spoiler alert.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:19.900
 Batman vs. Superman was this bizarre meditation on everything. It was just crammed full of ideas.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.700
 I just tell my little brother, we were talking about Phase 4, because I'm really into movies.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.400
 I'm really into movies and comic books and stuff like that.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.700
 I never really talk about them on the show, because that's not why you guys listen to it.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.000
 Except for this segment, but...

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.100
 I told my little brother, I go, "You know what? I can tell you right..."

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.500
 In regards to the Joker, I go, "It just looks so unique."

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.400
 I go, "I can tell you right now what every movie in Marvel's Phase 4 is going to look like."

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.300
 I can tell you exactly what the color palette is going to look like.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.000
 I said, "It's going to look exactly like Iron Man."

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.200
 Iron Man 2 maybe. Maybe they'll go a little bit darker.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.800
 But it's going to have that exact same color palette, because they all do.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.300
 Guardians of the Galaxy was the only one that kind of changed up the color scheme, because they were in space.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.800
 Then they come back in Avengers, and it's that same set of paintbrushes.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.600
 I go, "I can tell you exactly what Captain Marvel 2 is going to look like."

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.000
 Or Shang-Chi. Doctor Strange may be a little bit different.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.100
 But again, all the movies look the same.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.500
 Marvel movies are the equivalent of a...

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.200
 A sports illustrated swimsuit issue.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.200
 And DC movies are the equivalent of Suicide Girls.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.100
 I don't even know if that website's still up, but...

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.700
 Just kind of a weird look to it.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.800
 And everything looks grungy.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.800
 All the photos look like it was taken at someone's backyard and/or murder dungeon.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.400
 So Marvel's pretty much gone with creativity.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.000
 They're all the movies that's a cookie cutter thing.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.200
 And DC is still trying to figure stuff out, and they're just making these bizarre flicks.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.000
 And I think that Joker could change...

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.900
 Joker, when it comes out, it could make the Marvel movies look like antiques.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.500
 Like, "Whoa, look at this really cool thing you can do with superheroes."

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.900
 "Oh, great."

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.800
 "Captain Marvel 2."

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.200
 "Oh, yay. Another superhero I've never heard of."

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.700
 "Wesley Snipes, not in Blade."

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.300
 And I think that Disney could actually be hurt by that.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.700
 And so if they can make Joker not a hit,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.600
 if they can make people scared to go see Joker,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.600
 maybe they can hold on to their kingdom for a little bit longer.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.700
 I have no proof of that whatsoever at all.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.400
 So don't sue me, Disney.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.700
 I don't have any proof of that at all.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:29.000
 But it's an interesting, made-of-conspiracy nonetheless.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.600
 So, okay, let's go ahead and move on to our...

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.100
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.300
 That was an analysis lawyers for Walt Disney Company.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.200
 And I don't actually believe it.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.400
 I just think it's interesting.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.900
 It's interesting theory.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.100
 And this is a comedy podcast.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.300
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.000
 Now, our next story I came across, just kind of on accident,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.800
 it sparked an old memory of mine.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.000
 And it's funny because it's one of those stories...

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.200
 We'll get to my Haunted Windy story in a second,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.800
 but it's one of those stories that I remember once when it happened to me.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.500
 And I have a vague recollection.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.200
 I mentioned this on the show before and I asked on Twitter,

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.000
 @DeadRabberRaters on my Twitter, you guys should sign up for that.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.100
 I asked them, I said, "Have I done the Haunted Windy story before?"

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.800
 And they were like, "No, I've never heard of that story."

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.800
 So there is... I believe them. I believe them.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.000
 I still have an inkling somewhere back in the 300+ episodes I've mentioned it,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.200
 but they're saying that they haven't heard it, so we'll go with it.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.700
 So, but it's one of those stories that when it happened to me,

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.800
 I actually didn't tell anybody.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.600
 I didn't tell anybody for a long time, and then I finally told my sister.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.000
 And then she told her boyfriend and I ripped her a new one.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.600
 And I said, "Listen, when I tell you a story, you don't tell anybody."

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.500
 Like that, I tell the story.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.000
 I'm kind of a dick to my sister, but I was like, "Listen, I tell the story."

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.700
 Like, I was telling you that story in confidence and it's so bizarre and weird.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.300
 You can't go around telling that story.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.500
 Now here we fast forward 15 years later.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.300
 I love my sister to death, by the way, but I was not happy with that.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.300
 But I am a dick to her as well.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.700
 15 years now and later, I'm about to announce the story on public.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.000
 So sorry, sis, but not really.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.500
 She should have said it, but let's go ahead and get the preamble set up.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.700
 I think this is a real interesting story.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.700
 I found this story and, like I said, it sparked that memory.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.500
 This is from-- I was reading this Mysterious Universe article about people who travel to alternate dimensions.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.200
 And there's about five different stories and four of them I've read before, and I think three of them I've covered.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.600
 One of them's coming up.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.600
 But the Mysterious Universe article mentioned a Reddit post and I was like, "This is interesting.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.100
 There's no date. There's no name. There's no time."

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:41.600
 So it's really, really-- it has about as much veracity as my Walt Disney conspiracy.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.600
 It really isn't true, really, is the way I should say it, or most likely isn't true.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.300
 But let's take a look at it briefly.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.600
 This dude, my sister-- this is my sister because this is something stupid my sister would do.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 Sorry, sis.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.900
 My sister's driving her car through town.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.400
 She wants to go to McDonald's, right?

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.200
 Do-do-do-do-do.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.600
 Dog in the back seat.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.700
 Barking, walking around.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.900
 And she's driving through town and she starts to realize that the street lights are going to--

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.100
 Again, this is anonymous.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.100
 This is not actually my sister. Don't contact my sister.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.400
 Tell me about the McDonald's.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.100
 So she's driving on the street.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.700
 She sees the street lights going, "Wom-wom-wom-wom."

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.100
 Start flickering on and off.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.600
 They weren't actually making those noises.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.100
 And she's like, "That's weird."

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.100
 And then she hears like a loud buzzing--

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.100
 There's like a loud feedback noise in her head.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:28.600
 Like a--

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.100
 And she feels pressure on her head.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100
 Something's going on.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.100
 And the dog's freaking out in the back seat.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.100
 Probably because it's no--

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.600
 Probably because it knows it's about to be fed in McDonald's.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.100
 And the dog's like, "No, this isn't right."

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.100
 And so the car--

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.100
 She keeps driving the car.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.100
 But the noise goes away and the street lights are working fine.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.100
 And then her car stalls.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.100
 And then it starts back up.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.100
 So you have this weird electrical interference, whatever, in--

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.100
 As she's driving through the neighborhood.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.100
 And she starts to realize that things in the neighborhood seem different.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.600
 Not like each house is a big bubble and there's like monsters walking around.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.600
 It just seemed off.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.100
 She started seeing these cars drive by.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.600
 And she didn't recognize the maker model of the car.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.100
 And the car had like emblems on them that she didn't recognize.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.100
 But the license plates were totally normal for the area.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.100
 So she finds the McDonald's.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.100
 And the McDonald's is in the exact same location that it always has been.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.600
 But it's in a different shaped building.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.100
 Again, not a giant bubble with monsters.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.100
 It was just a different style building.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.100
 And at this point--

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.600
 So you're driving on the road.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.600
 This is all happening to you.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.100
 The feedback noise, the lights.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.100
 That is a normal Tuesday for me.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.100
 I wouldn't even register that.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.100
 I'd be like, "Ugh, I wouldn't even register that as a bizarre thing."

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.100
 I don't know much about cars.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.100
 So a Studebaker or an Astro-11 could fly by me.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.100
 And I'd have no idea that they--

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.100
 What the maker model was.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.100
 The McDonald's different building probably still wouldn't pick up on that.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:03.600
 But all of those things combined would start to make me feel a little iffy about the situation.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.600
 But of course, I'm loving it.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.600
 You gotta get that Mickey D's, right?

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.600
 Even though you may now be in an alternate universe, this character in this story,

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.100
 my sister, drives up to the McDonald's, still willing to buy food even at this point.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.100
 They seem--

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.600
 They are no longer in their home dimension.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.600
 They ordered their food.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.100
 Oh, and this is another great detail.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:30.100
 Off this Reddit post, they said, "I pulled up to the menu in the prices where more than they normally are."

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.100
 That is stupid.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.600
 That is the dumbest indicator of an alternate dimension I've ever seen.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.600
 I went to Walmart the other day.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.100
 Stuff was $3.99.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.600
 I went there today.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.100
 It was $4.99.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.100
 There's a little sales sticker laying on the ground that fell off.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.100
 You're like, "The plot thickens."

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.600
 That is the dumbest detail.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:54.600
 But anyways, still, my sister, is dumb enough to order food from an alternate dimension,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:00.100
 gets to McDonald's, and when they go to pay for it, they go, "I want to pay with my credit card."

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.600
 And the person in the McDonald's worker person, who's not a monster, and totally normal looking human,

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:13.600
 gives her a device that looks like it's the slideshow credit card, but instead it looks like your finger goes inside of it.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.600
 It's described as a blood pressure-looking machine.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.600
 And so, for the first time, this person does something smart.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 They say, "I'm not going to use that. I'll pay with cash."

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.600
 So they pull cash out and they hand it to the cashier, and the cashier kind of fumbles with the bills and looks at him for a moment.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:35.100
 And then puts him in the drawer and pulls out a piece of paper, gives it back to my sister, and she goes, "What's this?"

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.600
 And the cashier goes, "That's the word I'm looking for."

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.600
 The cashier goes, "Oh, that is for..."

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.100
 This is a drive-through, by the way. I guess I should have mentioned that.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.600
 This is never got out of the car.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.100
 That's a cash voucher. We don't give out change. We give out cash.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.600
 We give out cash vouchers. So, "Oh, okay, we're..."

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600
 And get the food.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.100
 And then, as she's driving out of the drive-through, she hears the noise again.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:05.100
 And she looks in a rear-view mirror and the McDonald's is back in the original building and driving home.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.600
 Everything's back to normal.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.100
 Now, an interesting story. Yes.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:14.100
 But let's take it apart a bit. One, if the story's true, then you should still have the cash voucher.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.600
 I'd like to see a photograph of that.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:23.100
 Two, the idea that the makes and the models of the cars would be different would show a drastic change in the alternate dimension.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.600
 So, the layout of the street would be fine. The layout of the neighborhood would be fine.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:34.100
 But the fact that different companies had arisen to build different cars, which show drastic changes in the timeline,

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:42.100
 it would be very, very unlikely in that case that the presidents on the money would be the same presidents.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:48.100
 Because you could have a president Ford in that universe and then Roosevelt made a car.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.600
 Or whatever. Or just a hobo became rich and made a car.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.100
 Now, I'll push back a little bit on that pushback.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:01.100
 It could be the cashier was so stupid or didn't care that when they looked at the bills and there were different people on there,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.100
 they're just like whatever. But I'd like to see the cash voucher.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:08.100
 It's most likely just a fun story that somebody wrote online.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.100
 Let's talk about the haunted windows.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.100
 There was, so when I lived in Sacramento, I lived off of, I lived all over Sacramento,

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:21.600
 but I lived one time off Howe Avenue and it's the street that goes right down into Sac State.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.600
 So I was right on the corner of Howe and the street that goes to Sac State.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.600
 And there was like a boarders books there. There used to be a blockbuster on the corner.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.600
 There's a little Safeway shopping center, things like that.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.600
 And then there is a, like it was basically a strip mall and stuff like that.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.100
 I used to go there to GameStop. This is where I bought Resident Evil 4, one of my favorite games of all time.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.100
 And I used to go to the blockbuster all the time.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:52.100
 I rented so many movies from blockbusters, they gave me a gold card because I rented like a thousand movies in a year or something like that.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:56.100
 Like they were basically applauding me as they gave me this special card.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.100
 So along that strip, there's a Wendy's, a Wendy's restaurant.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.100
 And there were so many food choices in the area and Wendy's is one of those things.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.100
 You kind of got to be in the mood for a square burger.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.100
 You kind of got to be, really you go to Wendy's for the Frost.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.600
 Like the burgers are pretty good. They're very fresh.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.600
 French fries are decent. They're not as good as McDonald's French fries.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.100
 But better than Burger King French fries.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.600
 But the burgers are pretty good and they got Frosties.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.100
 You got little milkshake things, you got Abe with the spoon.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.600
 But there were so many food choices there that, you know, I wouldn't go there very often.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.600
 But I remember one day I go, I'm going to go to Wendy's.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.100
 I'm going to drive to Wendy's, go through drive-thru.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.100
 Now there was no crazy blinkin' lights, nothing like that.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.600
 There's normal drive, I lived a couple blocks from it.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.600
 I drove down the road, got into the drive-thru.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.100
 And so I've got some weird stuff happening to me in drive-thru.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.100
 I'm sitting behind a car in the drive-thru.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.100
 The story's 100% true. At least I saw it.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.100
 Could have been a hallucination.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.100
 Could have been a whole host of things.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.100
 But let me go ahead and tell you what happened.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.600
 So, and this would have probably been probably like 2005.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.600
 I'm sitting there in my car and I'm behind another car that's getting their food.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.600
 And I'm just not really paying attention to stuff.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:14.100
 Listening to music, waiting for my delicious frosty and then the food I ordered to excuse me getting a frosty.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.100
 So you have the drive-thru window and there's the car in front of me.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:23.100
 And I see the person in the car give the cashier the money.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.100
 So it reaches out, gives the money to the cashier in the window.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.100
 And then this is going to be really, really hard for me to explain.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.100
 What I see come out of the drive-thru window.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.100
 I'll tell you exactly what I saw and then I'm going to tell you...

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.600
 Okay.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.100
 There's a giant ball of paper cups.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.100
 So like empty Wendy's cups.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.600
 There's a giant ball of empty Wendy cups and napkins like pushed together to make like a giant ball.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.600
 Like if someone said, "Hey, pick up all that garbage!"

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.600
 And you just scooped up a bunch of paper cups and napkins and then you held it.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.600
 That's what it looked like.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.100
 But it was probably about, I don't know, maybe a foot?

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.600
 Maybe, I'm trying to make the size of it with my hands here.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.100
 Maybe like a foot or two of material.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:17.100
 And so this ball comes out of the cashier's, out of the drive-thru window, right?

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:26.100
 And attached to it is a, now this is probably like a good four feet long tube made.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.600
 And it's not like a cardboard tube.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:33.600
 It is made of coffee stirrers, those little, um, cart, those little, I don't know if they still make them,

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.600
 but they have little pieces of wood that used to stir your coffee.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600
 And straws.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.100
 And more tissue paper.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.100
 Like more napkins.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:49.100
 So imagine if someone made a giant lo- like a giant fake lollipop out of garbage.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.100
 Out of stuff that you could find at a Wendy's.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.600
 Coffee stirrer, straws, napkins, and cups.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:59.600
 Had this giant ball on the top, and then had this about four foot long tube coming out of the back of it.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.600
 And it had this arch to it, right?

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.600
 And I watched this, and I'm like looking at it, and I watched this thing come out of the Wendy's.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.100
 And it has like, like I said, it has an arch to it.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:16.600
 So it almost looked like someone was holding the bottom of it, and they're making, they're basically like pushing it out of the window.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.100
 And I'm watching this and I'm like, what is going on?

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.100
 Like who built this thing?

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:27.100
 And you go, Jason, it was some kid, bored at Wendy's, who made this thing.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.600
 And that's exactly what I would have thought.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.600
 But we haven't even gotten started with this crazy, crazy event.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.600
 The people sitting in the car waiting for their food.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.600
 This giant prop comes out of the Wendy's you have through your window, right?

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:48.600
 And it's holding or balancing the food.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:56.100
 So you have this giant ball made of this stuff, and kind of hanging underneath it is a bag of food, right?

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.600
 So it's like someone made this giant prop and they attach bags of food to it, and they stick it through the window.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.600
 Instead of just being a normal human reaching through the window and handing it to someone,

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.600
 they reach through the window and they hand the bag to the people in the car.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.600
 And the car drives away.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:17.600
 And I pull up and I look in the, I'm terrified at this point because so, and that's,

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.600
 let me, okay, let me keep telling the story.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.600
 I feel terrified at this point because I have no idea what I just saw.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.600
 I mean, I know what it was, it was much a garbage with like a bag attached to it.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.600
 But there was some key details that I'm leaving out right now because I really got to go into detail with those.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.600
 I'm watching this thing come out.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.600
 I pull up, I'm a little terrified.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:44.600
 And I turn and I ask the girl, there's a young girl at the cashier window, I go, what was that?

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:51.600
 And she looks at me and she goes, oh, he always likes to play tricks.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.600
 Hands me my bag of food, and I drive away.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:02.600
 And I'm thinking in my head, some guy made this giant thing and he attached the food to it and handed it to her.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:11.600
 But then as I'm driving away, my mind is basically saying that was a bunch of garbage put together and some kid was using it.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.600
 But then this other part of my head was going, Jason, what you just saw was physically impossible.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600
 And here's why.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:29.600
 One, the way it arched out of the window, it would have clipped the top of the roof of the, like, you know, you have those windows and they're not super big of the drive-thru.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:37.600
 The way that it came out like a perfect arch, but there is no physical way it could have fit through there the way it was arching up.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:46.600
 Two, there is no way that coffee stirrers and napkins could hold a bag of food or even just the prop at the end of it.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:57.600
 And the way that it came down and bounced down, when I remember it, the big ball also should have clipped, should have hit the roof of the car.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.600
 It just had such a long arch, it shouldn't have been able to get out and it should have hit the top of the car.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 It shouldn't have been able to support its own weight and it wasn't there when I pulled up.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.600
 It was completely gone.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.600
 And that's when I realized something or think I realized something.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.600
 Because this has happened to me before.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:25.600
 There have been times where I've seen a ghost or a haunting and your brain immediately starts to try to rationalize it.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.600
 So you'll look down a hallway and it will be completely empty, but you feel a little, ugh.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:39.600
 And then a week later, you're sitting in your living room, you're reading a book, and you remember you saw a little kid standing at the end of that hallway looking at you.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.600
 Because you see it and your brain immediately starts basically retconning itself.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.600
 No, that wasn't there. It was just an empty hallway, it was a breeze.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.600
 And then later on, the memory comes back of why you actually had that reaction.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.600
 It wasn't a thing of paper and napkins and a big ball.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.600
 This is, again, this is going to sound super weird. What came out of that, Wendy's?

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.600
 It was a giant eyeball.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:08.600
 A giant eyeball with like a tendril attached to it.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.600
 Now can I prove it? No.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:16.600
 Is it possibly that that is my own imagination retcon? Absolutely.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.600
 But I remember it, when I remember that event, I remember two things.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.600
 I remember the actual physical scene of the paper and the cups.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.600
 I mean, you would need some heavy wood to balance all that stuff.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:35.600
 I mean, I hope I'm trying to set, I hope I'm getting across how fragile this thing would actually be to build, and then you're delivering food with it.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:40.600
 But when I remember it, I remember it as the paper cups and the tube and all that stuff.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:47.600
 And then I also remember it as a long green tendril and a giant eye type thing on the end of it.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.600
 And it kind of moving through the building and then clipping into the car and dropping the food off and then going back in.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.600
 One memory is 100% real, which is the paper cup thing.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.600
 And the other memory is maybe not a memory at all, a sense.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.600
 That's what I saw. I stopped going to that, Wendy's. I didn't go to it that often, but I stopped going there.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.600
 But every so often, my little brother would come into town or I'd have a visitor over and they'd be like, "Hey, you want to go get some Wendy's?"

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.600
 And I'd be like, "Because I wasn't telling people this story."

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.600
 I'd be like, "Sure, let's go to the Wendy's."

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.600
 So we'd go to the Wendy's and go through drive-thru and nothing too unusual.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.600
 We'd go during the day, but nothing too unusual.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:31.600
 The last time I went to that Wendy's, it had been maybe a year since that had happened.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.600
 I wanted a frosty. So I thought, "I'm going to go back to that Wendy's."

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.600
 I never forgot that story. I'm going to go back to that Wendy's.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.600
 So I parked my car, I walked inside and I ordered my food.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:48.600
 And the person on the counter was a teenager just like, "Yeah, sure. Here's dude, dude, dude. Yes, your food."

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.600
 And I went and I sat down because of tempting fate at this point.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.600
 The teenager didn't set off any alarm bells when I'm sitting down and I'm eating my food.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.600
 Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.600
 I'm eating some frosty. Nom, nom, nom. Eating food.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:09.600
 And then for whatever reason, I look up and I look around.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.600
 And I realize that it's probably the middle of the day. It's probably like around noon or one that I'm there.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.600
 It is, other than myself and the employees, completely empty.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.600
 Now, I did say there were a lot of food choices in the area.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.600
 But when's the last time you walked into a fast food restaurant in the middle of the day

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.600
 and it had nobody in it except you and the employees?

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.600
 Not impossible, but a little hard.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.600
 I'm sitting there and I look up and it's completely empty.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:45.600
 And there's maybe four visible employees and all of them are just kind of moving almost like they're on a track.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.600
 Like one guy was just kind of moving around in the back.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:55.600
 I could see one guy moving around in the kitchen and then there was a girl kind of moving around the dining room area.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.600
 Not cleaning up, just kind of walking around.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.600
 They looked zombified.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.600
 Maybe there were only three now to think about it.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:08.600
 Maybe there was another one in the back, but I remember kind of stopped eating because I realized I was the only one in there.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.600
 I don't remember if there was music playing.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.600
 I think actually there was no music playing. It was dead quiet.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.600
 And that could be an exaggeration, to be honest.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.600
 That could just be a detail I've remembered to make the story more spooky.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.600
 I got to admit it when I'm not 100%.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:29.600
 And I remember looking up and everyone was just kind of moving in a very odd fashion blank look on their face.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.600
 I remember that.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:37.600
 And I just kind of looked around at everybody and they were not acknowledging me, which is that's usually customer service at a fast food restaurant.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.600
 But they weren't acknowledging me.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.600
 They weren't chatting with each other.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.600
 They weren't really doing anything.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:52.600
 They were almost like moving about waiting for stimulus, waiting for someone to come and order food.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.600
 And I remember going this, there's something not right about this place.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.600
 I already saw the tendril or the giant ball of cups.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.600
 Either way, both are bizarre.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:10.600
 And I didn't come here for a while unless I was with a friend and now I'm sitting here and it's again, there's something off about this place.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.600
 I took what was left to my food, got in my car, drove away.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:20.600
 Maybe two, three months later, the Wendy's closed.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.600
 Closed down.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:29.600
 And I thought, when's the last time I've ever seen a fast food restaurant close?

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600
 It happens.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.600
 Again, that's not impossible.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:38.600
 And the fact that they didn't have any business on 1pm, middle of the week, means you're probably not making a ton of money.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.600
 But I didn't think it was.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.600
 First off, it's weird that a Wendy, because Arby's was killing it.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:49.600
 Arby's was maybe four businesses away and Arby's is garbage food and they were killing it.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.600
 I forced myself to try to eat Arby's multiple times.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.600
 It's gross.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.600
 Wendy's is way better than that.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.600
 And it's only like four buildings away.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.600
 So, sorry Arby's.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.600
 But Wendy's shut down, which is weird.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.600
 A fast food restaurant shutting down is weird, but again, not impossible.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:14.600
 And to make it even weirder, and again, now maybe stretching the definition of weird, that fast food restaurant stayed empty for years.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.600
 It actually was still empty when I left Sacramento.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:24.600
 So probably about, or at least that area, so probably about four years, that building on that prime piece of real estate.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.600
 That is maybe half a mile from Sac State, right on the border of downtown.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.600
 Tons of businesses in the area.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.600
 A fast food restaurant with a giant parking lot stood empty for years.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:41.600
 I don't know what was up with that Wendy's.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.600
 I have no idea.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.600
 High school kid pulling a prank and able to break the laws of physics.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:56.600
 I mean, that's more likely than an interdimensional entity taking over a fast food restaurant, sucking the souls out of its employees,

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:03.600
 turning them into mere husks of humans that simply walk around and empty Wendy's waiting for a customer to come in.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:10.600
 But, but, something, I don't know what was going on there, but something was.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:17.600
 And whatever was going on there was so toxic that a prime piece of real estate went empty for years.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:24.600
 Could you imagine being a realtor and you happen to get, you're like, alright, I got the Wendy's gig.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.600
 I can actually sell this building to someone else.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:32.600
 It has a full kitchen built in, giant parking, it had one of the biggest parking lots in that strip.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.600
 Massive parking lot, has drive-thru built in.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.600
 This is great.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.600
 I can't wait to sell this.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600
 I'll make so much money.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.600
 Yes, that's our real estate agents to talk as far as I know.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:49.600
 I actually know a couple of them, but, and you walk in to this Wendy's, you got your keys, jingling them, and you open the door.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.600
 There's like cobwebs everywhere, a black cat.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:59.600
 But after you shoo away the black cat with the broom and clean up the cobwebs, you're walking around this empty Wendy's and you're like,

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600
 this is going to be easy to sell.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.600
 Perfect real estate has all the stuff built into it.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.600
 But you get a weird feeling.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.600
 You get a weird feeling about it.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.600
 You don't know exactly what it is, but you feel like you're not alone.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 A couple of weeks later, you put your sign out, hammered into the cement.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.600
 Honey and vinegar real estate, right?

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.600
 You're a subsidiary of that great chain in Philadelphia.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.600
 You're trying to tell a scary story, but I keep cracking jokes.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.600
 You're the real estate agent.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.600
 You're inviting these customers into your Wendy's.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:38.600
 And so you bring these two customers in and you're like, I've totally gone off rails with this, but I got it ended somehow.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.600
 You walk, this is supposed to be scary.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.600
 You walk people into the Wendy's and you're like, look at this.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.600
 Don't you want this?

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.600
 Like, isn't this a great location for you?

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:54.600
 And the people are like, yes, yes, we would love to buy this property or rent it or whatever you do when you get real estate.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.600
 We love to do this.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.600
 And then in the corner of the darkened room, I have to make this scary again.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:07.600
 In the corner of the darkened room, the two people see something move in the darkness.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.600
 They don't know what it is.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.600
 It looks like garbage falling out into the corner of the room.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:18.600
 And when the two people look in the corner of the room, they turn to the real estate agent and they go, what was that?

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:25.600
 And the real estate agent looks at him with a blank look on their face and says, oh, nothing.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.600
 He's just playing games.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600
 That's kind of scary, right?

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.600
 That's kind of scary.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.600
