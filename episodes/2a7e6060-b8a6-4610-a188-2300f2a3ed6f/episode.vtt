 Memories should last a lifetime, but Alzheimer's disease has robbed millions of Americans of their treasured memories.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:17.700
 If you have a family history of Alzheimer's disease or are worried about your memory, you can help by joining the NIH-funded AHEAD Study.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.000
 It's aimed at delaying symptoms of Alzheimer's before they appear.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 My day sucked. And I'm gonna tell you about some other sucky, sucky days I've had.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 And then, because this is a show about the paranormal conspiracy and true crime, I'm gonna tell you a short story about a guy who gets abducted by aliens.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 We're gonna make it work today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Yeah, I'm not having a good day. You know what the thing is, is, I hope you're having a good day.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 And I hate breaking openings. I like to keep the openings the same. It's funny, 'cause as a listener of stuff, of consuming stuff, you have a routine.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 And you wanna hear the same thing all the time. That's why I've never changed the intro. I've never tried, "Oh, let's do something different."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Like, it's been the same since episode one. The only thing that's changed...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 It hasn't been the same since episode one. The format's been pretty much the same, and I've just kinda tweaked and I think we're at now.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 But I don't wanna lie to you guys either. Today sucked.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 So today's episode, I actually didn't plan on doing it. It's 9.30 right now, at night.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And I was like, "I'm not gonna release an episode. I'm not gonna release an episode." And I thought, 99% of life is just showing up.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 So just show up. You did say you're gonna take some extra days off this season, 'cause your vacation was kinda wacky.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 But just show up, Jason. Even if it means you gotta go a little off topic.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Now, maybe at the end of this, I'll have a better day. Maybe at the end of this, you'll have a better day.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Maybe your day suck. You see, the thing is, it's like my day...

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 And sorry, this first part's gonna be kinda vloggy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 So, if that's not what you're here for, if you're a new listener, I apologize.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 If that's not what you're here for, and you're an old listener, you're like, "Jason, just tell a story about a ghost!"

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Fast forward. Or listen to it at a high speed.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 I just want to hear about my bad day. I don't know if any of you do.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Anyways, let's talk about it. Woke up, did jujitsu, and that one, great. That one, totally fine.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 No jujitsu for next week, though. I had a doctor's appointment today that I'd planned the long time in advance.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 It snowed. I couldn't make it. My ride couldn't take me to the city that it's in.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 I ended up not going to work because of the doctor's visit, but then I could go to work, but I left my glasses at home, so I couldn't go to work.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 And I broke my phone. I was goofing off, and I broke my phone.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Now, I have two phones. I have two phones. You're like, "Jason, that's not a bad day!"

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 That's not a bad day at all. You had the day off work, and you didn't have to go to the doctor.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 There was snow involved, so that sucked. And you have two phones. Why are you complaining about breaking--

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 There's one phone--the phone that I broke I've had for like four years.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 I have two phones because, one, I don't even have it activated. It's where I put all my music on.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And then I have a phone, so I never have to worry about listening to too much music that my phone dies, or talking to too many people that--

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 which never happens, but, you know, it's also I'm on the phone on the internet.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 The other phone, I'd use the listening music, so it just sucked losing my phone.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And I just was having--I came home, and you're like, "Yeah, Jason, you had the day off work! You didn't have to go to work!"

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Boo-hoo! Poor Jason. I came home, and I sat here, and I just was sad. I was sad. I didn't feel good.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 So I thought, "Now, I'll tell you this right now. The bad day experiences, you'll probably find quite humorous."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 To me, though, I was like, "I'm at home. My mom sent me a Christmas present. She sent me her Christmas present."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Jason, that's not the definition of a bad day! You're getting Christmas presents.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 The Christmas present had been sitting here for a while, and I said, "I'm not having a good day."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 I'm really sad. I'm going to open up my Christmas present. Maybe that will cheer me up.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Now, mom, if you listen to all the episodes, she doesn't. She listens to one every so often.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 If you're listening to this episode, I totally love you, and I totally love your gift.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 But I do have to say that as I was already kind of sad--I owe you guys really chasing you--

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 I opened up the present, and I got a shirt, which is what I wanted. I got a sweater, which I actually have that exact same sweater.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Those sweaters stain really easily. You're like, "Jason, you're super ungrateful."

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 No, no, no, no. I love the sweater. I won't get a stain on this one, because I have the exact same sweater with a huge stain on it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 She buys me a pair of socks, which I asked for. I said, "Can I get some nice warm socks?"

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Because she sent them to me about two years ago. I lost them already. She sends me socks, okay?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And it's just one of those things. You know when you're already having a bad day, everything seems to be wrong?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 She sends me these socks, and I look at them, and it says 13 to 15 socks.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Now, again, on a normal day, if I had opened that up on Christmas Day, I would have simply laughed.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 But because my day was already just a series of unfortunate incidents, I'm thinking, "Does my mom know who her son is?"

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 I'm not Shaq. Who has size 13 to 15 socks? And so, they're pretty comfy, though, so I'll give her that.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 And then, my mom, and I feel really bad about this one, actually, my mom sent me two gift cards.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Everyone else has no presents right now. They're like, "I don't even have presents."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 She sends me two gift cards, and it's $15 each, one for Dairy Queen and one for Taco Bell.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And I would look at them, and I'm like, "But I'm on Keto, too. I can't even spend these right now."

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 And I remember sitting back... So, I'm so ungrateful. I love you, mom, so much.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 I remember sitting... Remember, it just happened today. I sit back in my chair.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 I'm sitting back in the chair, and I'm looking at these gift cards, and I'm thinking, "I can take a break off the Keto."

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 This is fine. This isn't like super... This isn't a bad present. It just goes...

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 I'd have to stop doing my diet to eat these places, but also, it's snowing.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 So, I can't even leave my house. I can't even leave my house to walk the mile, two miles, to the restaurant to use these things today.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 You're like, "You don't have to eat today." But then, I'm thinking, "Well, this is my problem.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 I think if I'm going to break my Keto on Day X, I'm just going to break it now."

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 So, if I know that I'm going to have a birthday party coming up, or a celebration Christmas party on Friday,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 compelling podcasting, I know. If I have a... If I have a party on Friday, and it's Wednesday,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 I'll just go, "Well, I'm going to break the Keto on Friday. I'll just break the Keto now."

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 Which is stupid. But that's what I do.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 So, I get a gift card for... Talk about a gift card for Dairy Queen,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 and then I order a free Domino's Pizza, because I ordered Domino's Pizza in the past.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 You're like, "Jeez, how many pizzas do you have to order before a corporation gives you a free pizza?"

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 So, anyways, I go, "I'm going to eventually go to Taco Bell, so I'm just going to eat pizza today."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 I order a Domino's Pizza, and I just devour it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And then, I went and I hung out with a friend. I went and took a nap because I was still feeling quite miserable.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 I did end up going to hang out with a friend for the past couple hours, and I came home...

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 And that made me feel better. And then I came home and said, "I'll record this podcast."

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 So, you're like, "Jason, are you really going to spend eight minutes telling us about how crappy your day is?"

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Yes, actually, we'll know, because I'm going to spend more time.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And the reason why, and we're done with that day, the reason why I'm telling you these bad day stories,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 is because maybe you're having a bad day today. Maybe you're having a bad holiday.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Maybe you're having a bad holiday.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 So, I want you to hear some funny stories, miserable Jason stories, that I think are quite humorous.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 So, let's see if I can get both of them in. And maybe it'll cheer you up.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Maybe it'll make your bad... And don't worry, I'll talk about aliens.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 I got an alien story at the end. Don't worry. Don't stop listening to it yet.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 So, that was my bad day today. And again, you're sitting there thinking, "Jason, that is not a bad day."

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 You're not... Okay, so this was my bad day.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 I had Jiu Jitsu, which was totally fun.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 I got the day off work. I didn't have to go to the doctor's office.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 I ate a pizza and opened a Christmas present.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 And I'm like, "Oh, my day sucked." Here, check this bad day story out.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 So, one day, I was... This was probably about two or three years ago.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 So, I was 350 pounds at the time. And I was super poor.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 I had very, very little to no money.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 The point of this story, I had zero money. All I had was a subway gift card that I think my brother gave me.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Now, I didn't subway on it before. I had enough money on the subway gift card for one sandwich.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 It was like seven or eight bucks left on the card.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 No other money on me. Zero.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 A lot of times, people go, "Oh, I'm broke." They have like a couple thousand in savings.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 They're like, "Whoa, whoa, I'm not touching my savings. Like, I mean, I'm my checking accounts, bro."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 No, I was flat broke. I didn't even have cans to recycle. Broke.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 So, I go to Subway and I buy myself a foot-long Spicy Italian, which is what I ate back then.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 And I have this big green jacket. I had this jacket, I think, I bought it, like, shortly after 9/11.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 So, the jacket is like 18 years old. It's this giant jacket with these giant pockets, and it's just like...

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 just drapes over me. It looks like the jacket the bad guy wore in Blade II.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 So, that's always... I always pretend I'm that dude. I don't remember his name.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 But I'm always hiding in the shadows, distending my jaw.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 So, I'm wa... That was a good movie, actually. The first one was the best.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Blade III was terrible, but I'm... This is not a movie review show.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 I'm walking... Oh, I saw the trailer for the new Grudge movie. That movie's terrifying.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 We'll talk about that later, but you're like, "No, Jason, talk about the now." That's more on topic.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 I'm walking from Subway home. And at this point, I have like maybe 35 cents on my Subway gift card.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 No other money. This was my dinner. This was the only food that I had available, because I was broke.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And so, I walk home. It's about a mile and a half again, two miles from the fast food restaurants to my house.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 I walk home. I come into the apartment. I start taking my stuff off.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 I go... I guess I should have said this earlier. I put my sandwich in the jacket pocket.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Put the sandwich in my jacket pocket and walked and listened to my music on my old phone that's broken now.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Thanks for the story reminds me of that. I'm... I get really attached to stuff like that, because it's been on so many adventures with me.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 I'm walking down the street. I have this sandwich in my pocket, big foot long.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 The... It's jacket, giant jacket, huge pockets. You're like, "Jason, I don't think you have foot long pockets."

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Well, the pocket had a hole in it, so it went into the interior of the jacket.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 So, you use basically like a normal hole, like a pocket hole, and then you could put your hand through the hole, and then you could be inside the jacket.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 So, it's basically a jacket... It's basically a jacket with a giant hole in the pocket into the interior of the jacket. Does that make sense?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 All of you at one point said, "Yes!" And then... So, I put the giant foot long sandwich in the... in my jacket, and it kind of is sticking out...

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 It's sticking basically in my jacket. I remember one day, actually, I got to tell this story to...

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 I always put food in my pockets. I remember once, I had this big jacket on, and I just bought like three bean burritos at Taco Bell.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 I put them in my pocket, put the whole bag in my pocket, and I'm walking down the street.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 This young guy's walking down the street. He's walking towards me. I'm walking towards him.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 This happened a couple years ago in Hood River, too. He's kind of like, you know, he's a tough guy, you know, walking down the street.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And I'm walking, I'm like a tough guy walking down the street, and we're getting closer and closer. I'm sizing him up, like, "Oh, you know, could I take him?"

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Like, "What if he did this? Could I do this?" You know, what guys do?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 And, well, he's getting closer, and then I just bust out laughing. I start laughing so hard.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Because in my mental exercise of whether or not I could fight this guy, I imagined him punching me, doing a gut punch, and just bean burritos, just shooting out of my pocket.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 It would be the most bizarre thing if you were in a fight, and you just swung super hard, and you felt just goo, and just a bunch of just refried beans.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Shot out of a dude. Bleh! Like, "Oh, no!" He runs away.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Anyways, walking down the street with a subway sandwich. I get home. I go to grab my subway sandwich. It's not in my pocket.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Now, I'm thinking this is the only food I have in the world right now. I have no other food.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 So I must have set it down. I must have, like, the first thing I did instinctually emptied my pockets. I'm looking around my apartment. Where's my subway sandwich?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 It's kind of hard to miss something that is a foot long, but I'm looking around, looking on the table. I keep patting down my jacket. Where's my sandwich? Where's my sandwich?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 And after about five minutes, I make the grim... not discovery. I come to the grim conclusion that I must have dropped the sandwich somewhere.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Again, the only food that I had in existence at this point with no money to buy more.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 And you're thinking, "Jason, you could just gone a day without eating." Well, sure. Good. But I really wanted that sandwich.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 And I go... I got a backtrack. And I'm thinking, "Could I go to subway?" This was my logic. I'm going to walk all the way to subway.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 Because obviously it's not before subway. It's not moving on its own. And maybe I'll get to subway and I'll explain the situation.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 "Hey, just bought the sandwich and I lost it. Maybe they'll give me another one because I was a regular there."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 But I was really... Obviously I was depressed because I hadn't eaten that day. I had no money to buy food.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 I was really looking forward to the sandwich that I could get with the little money that I had.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 And I had lost it. So I walk... And I remember going out, leaving my apartment.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 I remember the sky being particularly gray that moment.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 And I thought, "Listen, best case scenario is it's laying on the side."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 Best case scenario, it's right there. The worst case scenario is it fell out of my pocket while I was walking across the street.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 A bunch of cars have run over it and then there's no salvaging it.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 I walked for a mile just scanning the ground. Scanning the ground. Every time.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 I'd be like, "Oh, there it is." It's just a balled up newspaper. Walk a bit further.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 "Oh, there it is." Just a wad. I didn't realize how dirty it was until I was trying to find a foot-long wrapping.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Because it was in that sandwich bag with napkins wrapped around it. So I knew it would be long and white.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 And walking. I get about a mile out and I see a subway napkin on the ground.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 And I go, "Aha! I'm close!" I felt like Basil, the great mouse detective. I think his name was Basil.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 I think Basil's not a fruit. It's a spice.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And I go, "Aha! I'm close. I can smell it. I can smell the pepper chainies from here."

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 And there my sandwich was a couple feet away in the gutter. Just sitting there.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Now it had fallen out of the bag. So the bag is just blown away at this point.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 But in the gutter there is a perfectly wrapped sandwich with a napkin still attached to it.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 The other napkin had blown away. And I remember thinking, I'm very grateful that it wasn't raining.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Because the gutter was told. And you were like, "Jason, this story's not going where I think it's going."

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 As I'm approaching my prize, I remember thinking, "Well, it wasn't raining. The gutter is dry. Bone dry."

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 There's a couple leaves blown around. The sandwich is perfectly wrapped. It hasn't even been touched.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Not even a squirrel had come over in the half hour this whole journey has taken.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 I felt like Frodo. That doesn't make sense. Frodo wasn't looking for something. Frodo was trying to destroy something.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 Technically, Mount Doom was my stomach. The sandwich was the ring. And now I was ready to complete my task.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 What's funny is, across the street there was a house. And I remember as I bent down to pick up a subway sandwich.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 I imagined someone in that house was probably watching television, flipping through channels.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And for some reason that had caught their eye. There was something white just sitting in the gutter.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 A foot-long white object sitting in the gutter. And they're like, "I don't know what that is."

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 "I'm not going to worry about it." They're flipping the channel. And then a short time later they see a 350-pound man walk up,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 stared down at the object in the gutter. And they're like, "What? I wonder what that was?"

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 The guy reaches down, picks it up, looks at it. And at that point you recognize that it's a foot-long sandwich in the gutter.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 And then you watch this 350-pound man put it in his pocket and walk down the street.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Dude, that sandwich tasted delicious because I had to work for that sandwich. And I was grateful.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 I was super, super grateful that even though I had to go backtrack to get that sandwich, I was able to eat that night.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 That was a bad day. That actually was a pretty crummy day.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 But you're like, "Jason, the poor little-- you got the sandwich!" Yeah, yeah. But I felt so miserable even having--

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Obviously, like, I've been poor most of my life. Like, right now I'm actually doing pretty good for myself.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 But I've been-- there's been a most of my life. I've been like, "Do I eat today or do I drink a Coca-Cola?"

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Like, I've had long stretches of my life like that. And here's why. I'm not very good with money.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Like, even when I was making good money, I made poor money choices. Now I make less money than I have in the past,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 but I make much better money choices. Not perfect money choices.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 But a big part of being poor is making good money choices.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 It's not going to solve all your problems. Sometimes you are actually underemployed.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 But for me, now that I'm making better-- Keto helps a lot, actually, because I just buy meat and bulk.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 I make better money choices now. So there's very-- it's not as likely that I'm completely out of money.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 I was completely out of money a couple months ago, and that's why Chris K, the founder of the Golden Rabbit Brigade,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 he's like, "You got to start a Patreon." And he gave me some money, because I was talking about not having food or something like that.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And that used to be a regular occurrence for me. Now it's once in a blue moon.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 I will always appreciate Chris K reaching out to me like that. That was great.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 But yeah, I would be like, "Do I buy a dollar hamburger at Walmart today, or do I buy a Coca-Cola, a refreshing Coca-Cola?"

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 It's been a lot of my life like that. Childhood and adult life like that.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 It's only been recently that I've been more stable with my finances.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 But anyways, that's why I just-- it was a reminder of just the abject poverty I had placed myself in.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 But anyways, so that was a bad story. I think I have enough time for one more.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 You're like, "Jason, do you have a sad story that actually involves you being sad at the end of it?"

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 If you get-- we want to hear a story where you're completely miserable at the end, but a funny story.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Well, here's another one. I remember this was Thanksgiving, or a couple days before Thanksgiving.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 I was absolutely miserable. The weather was garbage. This was a couple years ago. The weather was absolutely garbage.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 I was miserable. I was homesick. I don't get homesick often, but it does happen. I was homesick.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 All my friends had moved away recently. I was very lonely. I wasn't happy with my life.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 This was way before the podcast. This was probably-- I think I might have already said this, but it was like three or four years ago.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And like I did at this Thanksgiving, I generally will do Thanksgiving by myself. I buy everything.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 And I think this might have been actually the first time I was doing full Thanksgiving by myself.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 I think that's might have been why I was so miserable. I wasn't going to anyone's house.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 I wasn't going to any local relatives, anything like that.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 And I remember-- I'm really bad at putting stuff in shopping carts. I'll shop just by putting stuff in my arms.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 And then I'm like, "Oh, I need this. I need this." And eventually I'm just carrying all this garbage through the store.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Now, I'll tell you this. It actually-- you guys might call me wrong on this.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 My female listeners might call me wrong on this, but women seem to be impressed by you being strong enough to carry all that stuff.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 So, men, if you're looking for love, go to Safeway and just grab a bunch of stuff and walk through the aisles.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Right now, I just heard the sound of 500 female listeners shake their head. They're like, "No, you look like an idiot when you do that.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Just get a shop in the car." But anyways, I remember I was like, "Okay, I need mashed potatoes and I need stuffing and I need green beans.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 And then I need like these meat dishes, like these turkey, edible thingy." Well, there it's all edible, but like these prepared turkey things.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Loading all this stuff up and I go-- I need gravy. And I don't know how much gravy I need it, so I got three jars of gravy.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 And I'm walking through the store and I'm like trying to hold all of this stuff.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 I'm trying to hold a non-prepared Thanksgiving feast in my arms is what I'm attempting to do.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 And I remember I'm walking through and I just was miserable. I wasn't having a good time. Super just disappointed in life and in myself.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 I'm walking, but I'm going to have Thanksgiving, so everything will be okay. I'm walking and walking and then I hear a "whoop" and I turn around and what had happened was one of the jars of gravy slipped out from my arm.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And it made this "whoop" sound as it did. It was like if someone was trying to grab a wet melon but made a glass and containing gravy and it smashed into the ground spreading brown gravy all over the middle of the Walmart aisle.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 And I just stood there and I was like, "Oh, great. Horrible." And then I was like, "This is bad." So there's like chunks of glass in here.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 I remember waving over at one of the employees and I was like, "Hey, sorry about this. I knocked this over. I just fell out of my arms."

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 And the employee was like, "Ah, you know, whatever. That's fine."

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 And then I debated, "Should I go buy another one? I already have this too." And then I thought, "I don't know how much gravy I need for one, two."

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 I need to put this stuff down. I just can't go grab another jar of gravy. Start walking through the store, drop that one too.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Eventually there's just a dotted line of broken glass through the store. But I felt really bad for breaking it.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 There's just another reminder of how crappy life was going right now. So I went and I bought all my stuff. I throw it in my backpack.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Now I have a tendency, because I wear big jackets, to put stuff in my pockets just like the Subway Story.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Helps distribute the weight. Nowadays when I go shopping, I'll buy like two or three six packs of dye root beer or dye Pepsi.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 And some of it I'll put in my backpack and the other ones I'll put in the pockets of my jacket or in the pockets of my pants so I can carry a lot of stuff.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Distributing it. I'm like a real life death stranding character, except without a little fetus attached to my chest.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 It's funny, I've never played that game, but I think about it all the time, especially when I'm walking in the snow. How you have to keep your balance.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 I throw all my stuff in and I remember thinking, this is again when I was 350 pounds so I was like, "I'm gonna eat. I'm gonna eat on the way home."

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 That's how you get to become 350 pounds. Because I was like, "I'm gonna cook this stuff."

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 I think the food was for tomorrow or the... I don't think it was Thanksgiving Day. This was the day before Thanksgiving. I was gonna take this stuff home.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 But I wanted to get Taco Bell to eat before I had to walk home because I was 350 pounds and that was a long walk, carried as much as I was.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 So I go to... And also I felt like garbage and carbs was gonna help me feel better. I go to Taco Bell and I'm just sitting there, eating my burritos all alone.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Sad, not feeling good, not feeling good about myself, not feeling good about life.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 But as I'm eating these carbs, I'm on my phone, like searching around on stuff on phone, just reading funny stuff and I'm starting to feel better and starting to feel better, getting distracted.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Okay, this isn't gonna be so bad. I got a good meal in me now. I think that also had a lot to do with my moods.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 It was a tendency to go... I don't never eat in the morning. I never eat in the morning and then I would be like noon and I would eat something and then I would tend to overeat.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 So I'd already be a little not feeling good from not eating in the morning and then I'd overeat and then I'd feel bad after that.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 But anyways, I ate my Taco Bell, ready to go.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 So I get all my stuff, throw away my garbage at Taco Bell. I go to put my jacket on and I have this tendency to kind of swing my jacket around this ultra dramatically way.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Same jacket from the Subway Story, the green jacket with a big hole in the pocket.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 And as I'm swinging the jacket on, I hear a "whoop" and I remember just standing there with my back to what I knew was standing behind me.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 I immediately knew. I recognized that noise. I just heard it about 45 minutes earlier and I understand physics.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 I realized that I had put the two cans of gravy, two bottles of gravy in my jacket and when I swung it around dramatically, one of them flew out of the jacket, smashed onto the ground.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 And I remember just kind of hanging my head.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Now there's nobody else in the Taco Bell except me and there's maybe two or three employees behind the counter.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 And I turn around and I'm looking at a smashed jar and gray, brown gravy just *pfft*.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 And I knew from the experience at Walmart when I was apologizing to the employee there, when he was trying to clean it up, how hard it is to clean up gravy.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Super hard. You can't really sweep it up, you can't mop it up. You're kind of boned either way.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 And I remember I picked up the glass immediately because I didn't want someone to walk in and then I walked up to the counter and said, "Hey, really sorry about this, but I accidentally dropped a jar of gravy over in the area there."

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 And the guy goes, "Oh, that's fine, we'll take care of it." And I was like, "Oh, okay."

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 So then I go over there and I kind of finish putting stuff on it and this is gravy, dude. It is a danger.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 It's something that someone's going to slip on. First off, now Taco Bell smells like gravy.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 The second you walk in or you're just in there, you just smell gravy.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 And I'm looking and I'm just standing there and I stood there for about five minutes and the people behind the counter weren't helping.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 I walked back up and I go, "Hey, can I borrow a broom or some paper towels? I'll clean it up."

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 And they're like, "No, no, no, we'll get it. It's totally fine."

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Because this is the thing. As I was leaving the Taco Bell, I go, "This is the problem here. I'm the only one in the Taco Bell."

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Eventually someone else is going to walk into the Taco Bell and they are going to smell gravy, which is going to be odd.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 That's the one thing you don't, that's really the one flavor you don't expect to smell in a Taco Bell.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 But then you're going to imagine this, you walk in a Taco Bell in the middle of the day.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 You look and on the floor, in the middle of the floor, is a brown ooze just sitting there.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 In a place that sells no gravy, it's never had gravy ever.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 In a KFC, you wouldn't even bat an eye.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 But you're at a Taco Bell, you walk in, there is a brown, there's 16 ounces of brown ooze just sitting on the floor in front of you.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 What would go through your head?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Now, I don't, you could go, "Well, I would just assume somebody spilled gravy."

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Some idiot brought gravy into a Taco Bell and then spilled it.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 But I remember leaving and I thought, "That would be, that would be so puzzling to me."

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 It'd be the same thing as if you walked into a McDonald's and there was a chicken fried burrito, or a quesadilla just sitting on the floor.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 You'd be like, "What? Where did this come from?"

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 And it's just sitting there, the employees are completely ignoring it.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 You would think that it was a Mandela effect.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 Now Taco Bell has always served gravy.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 What are you talking about? It's always been here.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 I walked home, now two jars of gravy short, completely miserable.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Again, felt like I just was not on a good path.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 And I remember walking and I get to my apartment complex and right then I hear, "Hey, buddy!"

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 And I look up and my buddy Jonas, who had been in LA for probably about a year at this point, had just walked up to my apartment, knocked on the door to see if I was there.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 And I wasn't, obviously, I was contemplating my horrible existence walking on the street.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 And he walked out and he goes, "Hey, I was just at your apartment, seeing if you're home."

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 I walked up to him, I just gave him the biggest hug and I'm like, "I'm so glad you're here today."

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Because that was the day I needed some cherry nut.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 So now we're sitting at a fireplace and puffing on a big pipe and you're like, "Jason, those are stories."

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Yes, they are all sad stories. They're kind of funny. I think they're funny.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 You're like, "Oh, they're kind of funny."

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 But they all ended happily. They all ended happily.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 I've had worse days than you, Jason. And yes, you have.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 And obviously, I've had worse days than the stories I've told. I could tell you miserable days where I've lost loved ones or people made horrible decisions that affected their lives forever.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 But I'm not going to tell you those stories. Puffing on my pipe.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Because this isn't a competition. This isn't a competition. The story, the point of this odd episode where recording isn't, "I have worse days than you."

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 It's that the point of the episode is, one, there's an episode being recorded tonight. And two, even when we have bad days, we don't know how they're going to end.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 We don't know how they're going to end. Today, I was really miserable, but it had a good ending.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 The sandwich, the subway sandwich story had a good ending. The gravy story in the end.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 In the end, actually, that one jar of gravy, when I poured it, it had three jars of gravy in it.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 It was a Thanksgiving miracle, you may know, it was just one jar of gravy, but it was enough. It was enough for me.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 I don't know why I thought I needed three jars of gravy.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 So, you may be having a bad day. You may be having a bad weekend.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 But you don't know how it's going to end. So keep going. Keep walking. Keep looking for that subway sandwich in the sewer.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Because things might work out. I think things always work out in the end.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Sometimes it takes a long period of time, but things still get done.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 I planned on not doing an episode today. I 100% by the time 3pm rolled around, I said, "Nope, not doing an episode."

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 I am not doing an episode today. I'm so crummy. I'm feeling so bad. I'm not doing an episode today.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Took an app. Did everything and will avoid doing it. And here we are recording an episode.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And you're like, "Yes, Jim, air quotes episode." Let me tell you an alien story real quick.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 You're fast. You're settling in. You're putting on your alien pajamas. You're like, "All right."

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 I fast forwarded fast. All this stuff for this. I found a website.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 I'm sure it does more than this, but the website part that I saw was specifically Alien Encounters in the year 1988.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 So I got some good ones. Now, this one takes place in Salzburg, Pennsylvania.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 You're like, "Ooh, this sounds awesome." March 18th, 1988.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 This UFO comes down. It's shaped like a V flying around.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Oh wait, it says on my notes, "No sound was heard." So there you go. UFO's falling down.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 So this guy, we've got to make this quick. Because we're out of time. You're like, "Jason, no, don't you dare make this quick."

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 You just spent all that time talking about eating food out of the sewer. Technically, it was the gutter, not the sewer.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 But anyways, so this guy's traveling to his friend's house. It doesn't say if he's walking, skiing, driving.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 It's from 1988. What do you expect? This guy's going to his friend's house.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 And the next thing he knows, he's walking around in a grocery store. He's super disoriented.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 "Oh, I don't know where I'm at. I'm super hungry." It's basically me. He's basically me two years ago.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 He walks in the grocery store disoriented. He's hungry. He's thirsty. And then he looks at his watch and he's like,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 "Oh my God, two hours have passed. I've just left from my friend's house. I know it, but now, oh, I can't see anything.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Oh, low blood sugar. He's eating food, eating Twinkies. They're like, "Sir, sir, you didn't pay for that."

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 He's like, "Aliens abduction, get out of my way." He realizes two hours have passed.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Now, at first off, he doesn't think that aliens are abducted. He does remember seeing something fly over his car.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 So that kind of scared him. Then his car stalled. But he's like, "It might have been connected to that.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 It could have just been, you know, my watch broke and I'm just really, really hungry. I'm eating all this food.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Dropping gravy." They're like, "Sir, no." He's like, "I don't know. The aliens are making me do this."

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 Knocking gravy over. Anyways, it's weird enough. He can't figure it out that he goes to a hypnotherapist.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 And this is what he recalls. He remembers his car stalling out in the middle of nowhere.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 And then a fourth-- This is quite short, honestly. A four-foot-tall alien.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 And he's not a gray, because gray is normally short, but it's his four-foot-tall alien with like a long head and pinchers.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Just out of staff. He walks up to the car. He walks up to the car. He's wearing clothes. Grays are always naked.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 I've always heard that theory that, you know, the idea that aliens are demons, that's a common theory.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 But the reason-- Reptilians will tend to wear clothes. The reason why gray aliens don't wear clothes is because they never were exposed to original sin.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 It has to do with how humans ate the apple. According to the Bible story, humans ate the apple.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 And then they realized they were shameful because they were naked and they started wearing clothes.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Other alien races wear clothes. The reason why grays don't wear clothes is because they are never exposed to original sin.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 I should actually do some more research on that. I think that would be an interesting topic for the show.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 They're-- They're-- They're pure. They're pure beings. They don't have shame in that sense that other species do.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 But anyways, I mean, nudists-- Nudists, you can say, don't have shame, but it goes more deeper than that into the psyche.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 So anyways, this Reptilian, he's wearing a purple robe. Purple bluish gray robe. I don't know where I got purple from.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Forget I said purple. Blueish gray robe with a fringed bottom.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 I gotta say this, if a four foot tall alien with pinchers was coming at me, I'm not looking at the bottom of his robe.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 I don't know where that deal detail come from. It also had an insignia on its chest. Doesn't get a lot of detail.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 This whole story doesn't have a lot of detail. This is where I thought was the most interesting,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 and I honestly got a little too excited 'cause I misread it. Here's from this report.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 "The witness was then placed in a jar-like object and then taken inside a large cigar-shaped craft."

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 So now I'm imagining, like, from a 1950s comic book, a dude in a jar. Like, no, let me out.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 It's like a cover of, like, a guy in a jar banging on it, and there's, like, an evil scientist or an alien standing over it, pointing at it.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 And it's like, "Amazing tales, Tencentz! You can't tell me you didn't just picture that comic book cover in your head."

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 And I was like, "Dude, a guy being placed in a jar-like object. Just say it's a jar."

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 I guess there, I guess a jar, what if he's in a jar of gravy? So now that's the cover.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 He's like, "Wooah!" He's swimming in gravy. There's a scientist, there's an evil guy pointing at a jar of gravy.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 And then in the background, he's seeing me running, he's seeing me running towards the jar of gravy to rescue him. To knock it over.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 But anyways, a jar, I don't know what the difference is between a jar and a jar-like object.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 But anyways, so this guy, he realizes he's putting a big old jar, and he's, like, pounding on the glass.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Comic book cover's going on. And then I'm gonna read this sentence the way that it's written, and then I'm gonna read it the way that I read it.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 And he'll realize why I was more excited about doing this story. So this is how it's written, the next sentence.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 And this is the last sentence, actually, of this description.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 "Inside the craft, the witness was apparently examined by several similar beings."

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 So, you know, he's in a jar, and then he sees a bunch of other four-foot aliens come up and tap on the glass, selling it.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Now, when I read it originally, I was like, "Hot dog! This story's gonna be amazing!"

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 And then I did a bunch of other research. I couldn't find any more information about this encounter than what I just read you.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 But I was like, "This is amazing! I'm super excited!" Because this is what I thought that last sentence said.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 "Inside the craft, the witness apparently saw several similar beings."

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 So I was like, "Oh, there's other people in jars, dude!"

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 So it's like he wakes up and he's in a jar, and he looks, and there's, like, 50, 100, maybe a thousand jars of different alien species all banging on the side.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 "That's so awesome, dude!" He's just... No, I misread it. He's just in a jar.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 There's aliens poking at it. I was like, "Damn it!"

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 I was just reading it actually before I started recording this episode.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 That, you know what? That goes perfect with my bad day.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 Because I honestly thought I was going to tell you a story about a guy trapped in a jar with a bunch of other aliens.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Like, these aliens were collecting species from around the cosmos, and they were all putting them in jars.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 And then 10 minutes before I decided to record this episode, I looked this story up, I read the last sentence, and I went, "Ugh."

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 Still an interesting story. How many times do you hear about people being put in jars when they're still alive?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 But it would have been more interesting if there was a bunch of jars everywhere.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 So that's the episode. That's the episode.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 I liked it. I hope you guys liked it too. I'm having a better day, so I'm going to go ahead and do my intro now.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 Hey, everyone! I forgot it now. Hey, everyone! Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 I really hope you guys are. I'm never going to do that intro if it's not true.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Because that way, when I do it, you know it's true.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
