WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
 Connecticut, known the world around for their delicious maple syrup, their birds probably,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.680
 and murderous ghosts.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.400
 They leave that part out of the brochure, they make sure they talk about their birds, and

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.000
 then we travel to Malaysia to take a look at the story of a young woman who is approached

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.160
 by a television producer and he promises this young woman fame and fortune.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.760
 All she has to do is pull a prank.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 I hope you guys are staying warm wherever you're at.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.240
 I guess now they have live streaming in Antarctica.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.680
 I guess there's now like some satellites so you can live stream them.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 That sounds super boring.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 I mean unless they're getting killed by the thing, it really would just be a bunch of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.280
 people like playing chess and talking about like, "Hey, did you see how scientific the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.780
 snow looked today?

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.400
 I did so much science.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.280
 Like I can't, why would you want to talk to people in Antarctica?"

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.560
 I find that, I find that terrible.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.400
 I guess their families, I guess their loved ones enjoy it.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.320
 But you know, I don't know, I'd find it kind of boring.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.440
 Let me know when you guys are being picked off one by one by a shape-shifting alien, but

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.760
 someone who will always fight the good fight against the things, walking into Dead Rabbit

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.960
 Command is one of our Thanksgiving live stream contributors.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 Everyone give it up for Sugoi.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.960
 Woohoo!

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.880
 Yeah, come on Sugoi, walking on into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.440
 He's shape-shifting as he's trying to assume a final form.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.800
 Sugoi, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.760
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, you guys can't support the show financially, I

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.600
 totally get it.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.480
 Just helps for the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.760
 That really, really, really helps out.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.520
 Sugoi, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.480
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.880
 Fly us all the way on out to Connecticut.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.800
 [Demonic sound]

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
 Headed all the way out there.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.040
 We've been to Connecticut a couple times over the course of this show.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.960
 Some people say it's the most haunted state in America.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.640
 Those people tend to, the people who say that tend to run haunted tours in Connecticut.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.000
 So I mean, a little bit biased there.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.720
 I've always heard that California is the most haunted state, pound for pound.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.920
 But a lot of people claim their state's the most haunted and that's why we're in Connecticut

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.800
 right now because whether or not Connecticut has the most ghosts, they definitely have

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.240
 some of the most memorable.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.240
 They really do.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.880
 I've been researching Connecticut ghosts lately.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.440
 I've been going through the Shadowlands.net in alphabetical order.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.440
 I'm up to the seas and I'm in Connecticut.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.040
 And man, I found some doozies.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.680
 I found some really weird ones.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.880
 We're going to be covering them over the next couple of episodes, but even these two are

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.040
 just so weird.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.520
 To go inland, the Dead Rabbit Dergible, our first stop here in Connecticut is we're going

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.960
 to hang out at Warren Harding High School in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.760
 We're here at Warren Harding High School and we're here to check out a haunting which has

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.200
 some terrifying implications of what life after death could actually be.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.200
 It just seems like a normal high school.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.520
 These are walking out of classes, bells are ringing, principals like, "You better get

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.400
 back to class, guys."

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.600
 All that good stuff.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.320
 But then we see a ruckus down an empty hallway.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.200
 We see this older man, he seems to be middle aged, and he's running down the hallway and

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200
 he's like, "Help!

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 Help!

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200
 Oh my God!

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.200
 Help me!

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.200
 Somebody help me!"

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.600
 He runs out of view and we're like, "What dude?"

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.840
 We look over at the principal, "Principles, what am I supposed to do about that?"

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.760
 I'm telling these kids to go back to class.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.640
 I'm telling these kids to go back to class.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.280
 You handled the bloodied man running through my school, so we're running down the hallways

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.000
 and we turn and we look down the other hallway.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 What?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.600
 I swear, I just saw a, not elderly man, but an older man running, why am I so fixated

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600
 on the age?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.960
 A bloodied human being, no matter if he was four or forty-four, a man with blood leaking

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.120
 out of his body went running by and now he's gone.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.760
 There's no blood on the ground, nothing.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.840
 So we start, we split up, we split up.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 I'll take the food court.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.160
 You guys walk down the spooky hallways of this school and you guys are looking around.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.920
 Never show often when the hallway is long and empty, you'll hear, "No!

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.920
 Somebody save me!

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.360
 Ah!"

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.480
 You can never find the source of the screaming.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.920
 We all meet back up in the cafeteria and I'm sitting there and I go, "So how did the investigation

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920
 go, guys?"

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.800
 And you're like, "Dude, it was super creepy.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.520
 We're walking around this school and I swear it sounds like a man's being murdered."

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.800
 And I go, "That's exactly what you heard."

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.120
 However, he wasn't being murdered today, so there's nothing you could have done to help

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 this guy.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.880
 He's just shooting at you on a wild goose taste.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.960
 I go, "What you heard was the screams of Mike.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.560
 Mike, sit down.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.240
 Let me tell you a story.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.400
 Grab some mashed potatoes."

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.480
 Apparently back in the 1960s at Warren Harding High School, now there's a new building at

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480
 this location.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.520
 I couldn't tell if it was a new addition to the original building or if they tore down

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520
 the original building.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.120
 But this haunting seemingly still exists.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.520
 There's very little evidence of this online, but you do see a story here or there.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.600
 Back in the 1960s, there was a custodian named Mike who worked at Warren Harding High School

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.040
 and there was an insane student there as well.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:19.120
 And also, attending this school is a bad combination, Old Man, Janitor, and an insane student who

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.280
 one day killed Mike, the beloved janitor of Warren Harding High School.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.880
 It wasn't like a quick kill, right?

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.280
 I don't think the killer jumped out of a locker or something and then stabbed him once and

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.360
 the guy's like, "I'm dead."

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.920
 It sounds like there was a long chase.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.640
 And what we're hearing in these modern times is the spirit of Mike.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.240
 But they'll actually see this guy.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.000
 They'll see a bloody man running down a hallway screaming for help.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.240
 He's basically reliving his murder.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.920
 That's pretty part and parcel with basic ghost lore, right?

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.560
 We see that a lot in ghost stories.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.880
 Someone died tragically.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.800
 Someone died violently and they're reliving their death over and over again.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.600
 What's interesting about this story, and again, there's really not a lot of stuff online about

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.920
 it.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.240
 But the story goes that his killer was never caught and some believe that his killer haunts

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.160
 the school as well.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.000
 So it's not just a matter that we're hearing this guy and sometimes seeing this guy relive

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.400
 his death over and over again.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.240
 The dude who killed him is there as well.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.560
 His spirit is there as well.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:39.520
 And that, I think we talked about this a little bit last season, but this is extra terrifying.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.720
 And listen, if I get brutally murdered, someone beats me to death with a spiked baseball bat

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.040
 while I'm walking to work one day, I'll deal with it.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.320
 I mean, I'll be dead, right?

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320
 I'll be dead.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.720
 But I'll deal with it.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:58.160
 Imagine, though, if in the afterlife I'm constantly being pursued by this same guy.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.640
 It would be like an infinite game of Pac-Man.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.120
 You would never find any rest.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.280
 Now, you could argue that the souls are simply repeating.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.080
 You know, they're just basically repeating.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.160
 There's no emotions being spent.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.720
 The soul isn't actually being destroyed over and over again.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.320
 It's like Jason, if you watch Top Gun over and over again, it's not like Goose is actually

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.320
 dying.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.080
 He, first off, he was a fictional character, but it's not like each time you watch the

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.000
 movie, the tragedy happens again.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.760
 It's simply that you're seeing the tragedy happen again.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.080
 So on one hand, if you have just a recording type phantasm here, recording goes, "Clean

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.720
 out over and over again if a man being murdered and his killer."

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.720
 Who's never seen?

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.720
 Who's never seen?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.760
 Apparently, they didn't catch the insane student.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.440
 They probably could have just looked up his personal records.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.920
 Apparently, he was known to be insane.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.920
 It just went to his house.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.240
 But it's just plain over and over again.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.720
 The soul of Mike is...

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720
 You know what I mean?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.200
 Like, it's one thing if someone videotaped your death and they're showing it on some

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:11.880
 gore deep web channel versus every time someone played that video, your soul relived that

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.880
 torment.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.880
 Does that kind of make sense?

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.280
 But there's always the option.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.320
 There's always the idea that that is taking place.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.920
 That this isn't a typical recording type haunting.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.640
 That Mike's soul is trapped in the place where he died violently, but the killer went on

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.640
 with his life.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.800
 He was never caught.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.560
 So when he died, wherever it was, whether it was in Connecticut or he was in Timbuktu,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.880
 hanging out, trying to get a job as a high school janitor, he goes, "The circle starts

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.880
 again."

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:54.120
 When he died, when his soul died, it went back to where he was the happiest, which was killing

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.640
 Mike at Warren Harding High School.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:05.720
 So it's possible that this is the two souls, not simply reliving the event, but reenacting

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.720
 the event.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:12.920
 That Mike's soul is now trapped and being tormented by his killer over and over and over

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.920
 again.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.600
 The reason why I say that is because we do...

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600
 Here's the thing.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600
 The story may not be true at all.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.760
 I found two sources for it.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:26.280
 Shatterlands.net and then a book called Ghost to Coast Tours and Haunted Places.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.680
 It was the name of the book.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680
 That was published in 2009.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.360
 That was the only place I could find information about this particular haunting, but I wonder

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:43.280
 if it is simply a replaying of the event or if it's actually the soul's trap there.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:50.000
 It's also interesting to note that according to these accounts, only the staff members

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.160
 have ever heard this.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.480
 The students themselves are not bothered by these sights and these sounds.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480
 An interesting haunting.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480
 There's some interesting things.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480
 Sugio.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.920
 Is that how our parents are named?

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920
 Sugoi.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920
 Sugoi.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.160
 Let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Jason D'Apri.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.600
 We're going to leave behind Warren Harding High School, but we're staying in Connecticut.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:18.040
 We have us all the way on out to Hubbard Park.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.040
 It looks pretty beautiful.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.760
 I was looking at photos of it.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.000
 It's about 1800 acres that was donated by this dude named Walter Hubbard.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.760
 Back in 1900, he was a pretty dope guy.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.760
 Everyone liked him.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.120
 He didn't have any scandals.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.680
 He's just genuinely a nice rich dude and he ended up donating all this land to the town

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.280
 and also in the park, there's a place called Castle Craig.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280
 Castle Craig.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.880
 Apparently it's like a thousand foot, nearly a thousand foot tall observation tower built

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.840
 so you can walk up and go, "Wow, look at this big old park."

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.680
 And then you walk back down.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.840
 I don't know what else you do up there.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.360
 I don't know if there's like a casino or anything fun, but you get to look around.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.640
 You get to be a thousand feet tall.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.360
 That's pretty cool.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.920
 Apparently.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.920
 This is interesting.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.200
 This is what I love about doing this show because I wanted to gun down this rabbit hole or dog

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200
 hole.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.440
 How do I not, I never mind.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.480
 You still call it a rabbit hole.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.560
 How do I not done this podcast?

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.680
 I was reading about stuff in, haunted stuff in Connecticut.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.520
 I came across Hubbard Park.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.920
 There's a story of a phantom dog that roams the area.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.920
 This one is opposed to the Warren Harding High School story.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.240
 You'll find this everywhere.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.280
 You'll find this in lists of the top Connecticut haunted places.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.800
 You'll find this story everywhere about this black phantom dog that hangs out in this area.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.320
 Specifically, it walks through this portion of the park called Hanging Hills.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.640
 The Hanging Hills.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.640
 And if you see this black dog when you're out in the area, that means you're going to

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.800
 have great fortune soon.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.160
 You're going to find yourself in the possession of worldly goods.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.080
 That might be a reason why people like climbing that tower because now you got a huge view

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.080
 of the park.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.640
 You go, "Whoa, there's the dog.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.040
 I'm rich."

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.120
 But don't ever go back to the park.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.120
 Don't ever go back to Hubbard Park because if you see the dog twice, then you get really,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.520
 really sick.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.440
 And if you see the dog three times, you die.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.680
 It seems like a pretty easy curse to avoid, right?

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.080
 You go there, you see the dog, you get a bunch of money.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.080
 You just leave.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.440
 You never go back.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.000
 You leave the state of Connecticut.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.360
 It doesn't seem like that bad of a curse.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.200
 I don't know if there's some sort of monkey paw type of thing where you get all your money.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.480
 You win the lottery, but they're like, "We've moved.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.680
 We've moved location in the lottery office."

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.760
 You're going to have to come to Hubbard Park to pick up your ticket.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.360
 I don't know if somehow you keep getting tricked to go back there.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.560
 You use your money.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.560
 You buy a brand new car.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.560
 It breaks down.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.920
 The breaks, the breaks give out and you just roll all the way downhill back to Hubbard

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920
 Park.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.760
 I don't know if the dog visits you if you see it once.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.800
 It's no guarantee that you're going to see it twice or three times, but it's just kind

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.480
 of like, "Why would you ever go back?"

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:15.240
 This story is repeated over and over and over all over the internet, this particular story.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.240
 So I kept digging.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.240
 The more resources there are, I kept digging into it.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.280
 It turns out this one is 100% false.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.200
 100% false.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.600
 It's verifiably false.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.040
 Not just because magic doesn't exist, curses and good luck charms.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.960
 I do believe magic exists, but you know what I mean?

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.800
 Generally, if it was identifiable, if it was repeatable, scientists would be like, "Woohoo!

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.840
 Now I got all this money to put more liquids in vials."

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.840
 Next stop, Antarctica.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.200
 Provably not true.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.560
 This story is provably not true.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:53.760
 It's actually based on a short story written by Thomas Pinchon.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.120
 He's an author.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:02.000
 His grandpa wrote a fictional story back in 1898 for the Connecticut Quarterly, and it

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.080
 was about this black dog.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080
 It's interesting.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.680
 Again, this is what I love about this podcast.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.760
 I was doing lots of research and I found that.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.960
 They said, "The reason why a lot of modern people think that story is real, even though

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.960
 it was clearly fictional," if you read the original versions, clearly fictional, "is

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.720
 one, it's from Thomas Pinchon's grandpa, but he was also graduated from Harvard.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.760
 And he was a noted geologist.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.680
 And then so when he wrote this story that was obviously fictional, people thought, "Well,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.000
 you know, he's a geologist.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 We always trust geologists, right?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.080
 We're not going to lie to us."

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.960
 So that story is 100% fake.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.200
 It was fascinating.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.680
 You'll find that story all over and you won't see that final part where they go, "It's actually

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.680
 fake."

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.200
 You'll just find a report of the legend, their stories, and da da da da da.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.120
 However, I wasn't even looking for the black dog of the Hanging Hills.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.280
 I was looking for another ghost that supposedly lives in Hubbard Park that, again, you can

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.320
 barely find any information on.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.200
 So we know the black dog is so fascinating to me.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.920
 We know the black dog is fake, 100%.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.840
 It was based on a short story that was published in Connecticut Quarterly in 1898.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.640
 We know that's fake.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.840
 That gets tons of press.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.280
 The story, the Warren Harding High School, barely anything, and then this story, there's

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.320
 barely anything.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:27.080
 And again, it makes us look at the power of the paranormal, the power of the ghostly world.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:36.440
 Over by 999 West Main Street in the Hanging Hills area, there's a story of a ghost.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.440
 This is really interesting.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.160
 I see this phrase different ways.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.480
 Sometimes the ghost is listed as a seven-year-old girl.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:51.520
 Other times it's described as something that looks like a seven-year-old girl.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.040
 And there's really a big difference between the two, right?

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.720
 One would imply it's the ghost of a girl who died when she was seven.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:03.360
 The other one would imply this is something much darker and older and more powerful that's

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:10.600
 simply assuming that form, which would make sense considering where the story is going.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:16.640
 If you're hanging out at 999 West Main Street and you want to see a ghost, there is a way

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.240
 to summon this seven-year-old girl's phantom.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.240
 Quite simple, actually.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.880
 Quite simple.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.280
 All you have to do is kidnap somebody.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.120
 I said it was simple.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.240
 Didn't say it was legal.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.040
 So let's go ahead and grab this random person walking down the street and throw him in the

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.920
 back of the Jason Jalopy and drive on out in the middle of the forest.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.440
 We got to see if this actually works.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.600
 We got to see if this haunting actually works.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.480
 So you grab a guy and make you pick one out of the crowd.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480
 You're like, "Jason, I don't know.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.640
 I don't know who's innocent and who's guilty."

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.640
 And I go, "Just pick someone at random.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.240
 You know you might pick a guy who deserves to get kidnapped."

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.680
 So you pick a guy and I go, "Oh, no, that guy was actually really good.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.960
 He's a really good guy, but you picked him.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.360
 You're a bad person for picking him to kidnap."

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.520
 Throw this guy in the trunk and we're driving on out to Hubbard Park.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.320
 And then you get the guy out of the trunk and you're dragging him.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.640
 He's begging for his life.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.640
 He's saying, "Please, I have a family.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640
 I have a family at home.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.640
 It's my daughter's birthday.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.640
 We're crying out loud.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.640
 He's holding an ice cream cake.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.160
 It's melting, but you have no heart.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.160
 You're cold.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.880
 You're a cold, blooded person."

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.720
 You're dragging him through the woods.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.320
 Finally we're standing there in the middle of Hubbard Park and you hear a, "Hehehehe."

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:48.320
 You're like, "Jayson, is that just you laughing?"

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.280
 I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.280
 That sounded like me laughing, but it was actually the laughter of a seven-year-old girl."

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:00.280
 And you're like, "Oh, you're all scared."

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.720
 You hear this laughter coming from all around you and then all of a sudden the seven-year-old

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:13.880
 girl appears out of the darkness and she rips you to pieces or she stops your heart

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.480
 or she stabs you with a sword.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.520
 It doesn't actually say how she does it, but apparently this little girl's ghost is so

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:29.320
 interesting and apparently this little girl, she was kidnapped as a child and murdered

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.480
 in the forest.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.680
 So now if you, so specific, it's like one of the most specific on-aids ever.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:43.960
 If you kidnap somebody, if you kidnap anybody and take them to the forest here in Hubbard

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.840
 Park, the seven-year-old girl will kill you.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.880
 She specifically kills kidnappers.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.320
 They say that she enjoys it.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.960
 She loves killing bad people.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.080
 So kidnappers beware in Connecticut.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.360
 I'm sure Connecticut has a huge kidnapping problem, right?

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.480
 Kidnappers beware.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.120
 If you take them to Hubbard Park, there's a chance that you'll take them to 999 West Main

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.760
 Street area and there'll be a little girl waiting for you to kill you.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.920
 That's such a specific haunting.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.200
 I mean, that's so bizarre.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.000
 When I came across that, I thought, "How would anyone have tested that out?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.440
 The first person who goes, "Man, you won't believe what happened tonight.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.600
 First off, I kidnap somebody."

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.600
 It's a difficult thing.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600
 They never met me.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.600
 I'm a kidnapber after all.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.600
 I kidnap someone.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.080
 I didn't know where to take them.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.720
 I took them to the woods, a new place.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720
 I was taking them to a new place.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.960
 Normally, I'd take them to the outskirts of town or the old abandoned ironworks factory.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.920
 But this time, I decided to take the scenic route to drive through the forest.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.160
 And I wasn't alone.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.160
 Don't worry.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.840
 Pete was with me, my fellow kidnapper.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.680
 But all of a sudden, this little girl showed up and ripped Pete into little tiny pieces

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.600
 and never seen anything like it.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.680
 And I didn't know what to do, so I left the kidnapping victim there.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.240
 Hoping whatever killed Pete would take its time with the victim and what?

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.920
 They didn't even kill the guy I kidnapped.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.800
 I ran through the woods, barely made it out alive.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.040
 And here I am on theshadowlands.net typing out my story.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.720
 Who was the first person to report that?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.520
 It would have had to be someone who admitted to breaking the law.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.920
 It would have been a kidnapper.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:34.920
 The idea of a ghost of vengeance, again, is something that is cool, but it's very rarely

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.120
 seen in the world of the paranormal.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.480
 We have ghosts that were killed violently, ghosts that didn't get justice in this life.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.640
 And every show often we have a story about them interfering.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.480
 We did an episode like that a long time ago about a ghost interfering, like basically acting

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.760
 as a witness in the trial of their own death.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760
 That was a really cool story.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.280
 I'll put that in the show notes.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.440
 I think we've honestly covered more than one like that.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.960
 And I've seen maybe five or six in total through decorative research.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.520
 It does happen, but it's quite rare.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.160
 This ghost goes the extra mile.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.240
 She kills the criminals.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.600
 And it's also interesting to note, if you realize who you're detail oriented, she only

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.400
 kills criminals who committed the crime that got her killed.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.560
 So I imagine if you were kidnapping people, you shouldn't take them to this park.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:31.040
 However, if you were like moving huge amounts of cocaine or you were a gun smuggler, she

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.160
 would be totally fine with that, right?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.360
 She'd be totally fine with that.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.800
 She only likes to kill kidnappers.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.440
 This is a story that I looked into.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.200
 Again, I found very, very few sources on it.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.760
 In this neck of the woods, no pun intended, they have found bodies.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.560
 People have been reported dead here.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.040
 There was at least one woman who the authorities believe she killed herself, and then there

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.600
 were the bodies of two men at different times.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.560
 And these are fairly recent, like 1990s forward that these three bodies showed up.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.200
 That's all really I could find in a pretty cursory examination of this area.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.800
 It's an 1800 acre park.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.800
 I'm sure they've had their fair share of suicides and accidental deaths and possible

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.080
 murders and people being dropped off.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.240
 But it's such an interesting story.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:26.360
 A ghost who is not a recording, it's her actual soul as a spirit of vengeance, but only killing

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.440
 people who commit the crime that killed her is very, very odd.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.480
 And then you'd have to wonder like, what's the definition of kidnapping?

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.360
 Does she make allowances?

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.920
 Like she's like, well, technically, they're simply human smuggling.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.000
 The people started off coming willingly and now they're being taken under a boat and send

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 them out to Eastern Europe.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.240
 I don't know how well she defines the term kidnapping, but fascinating story nonetheless.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.480
 This is one of the stories that we don't know if it's true.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.160
 It would be easy to test.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:03.200
 It would not be legal to test, but it would be easy to test.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.240
 Kidnap someone and take them out into the woods.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:11.440
 However, if you're wrong, you're guilty of kidnapping a human and you'll probably go

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:19.960
 to prison and if you're right, you'll hear a little girl laughing as she's killing you.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.440
 So they're both pretty bad options.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.920
 And just to be clear, it would be a bad option if she wasn't laughing.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.040
 If she was sobbing uncontrollably as she's killing you, that would be equally bad.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.520
 It's not the laughing part that makes it dangerous.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.400
 It's the death of the hands of a spirit.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.360
 Sugoi have officially pronounced her name three different times.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.320
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.520
 We are leaving behind this forest in Connecticut.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.120
 Kidnappy free.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.120
 We're not.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.760
 No one's coming against their will.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:01.920
 Fly us all the way out to Malaysia.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.000
 Before we get this story started, I want to give a shout out to Dead Rabbit Radio Listener

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.120
 Virginia Pygare on Instagram.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.600
 Virginia sent me over a Instagram story, a little Instagram video from someone known

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.640
 as Zack D Films.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.080
 So I got most of my information from the Zack D Films account as well as an article written

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.760
 by Simon Perry for the Daily Mail.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.760
 Super fascinating story.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.120
 I'm shocked I had never heard of this.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.960
 This is so bizarre.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.200
 So thank you Virginia for sending this over.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.480
 The year is 2017.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.880
 We're in Malaysia.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:49.720
 And there's a young woman, a single mother known as Siti Aisyah.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720
 Siti Aisyah.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:57.880
 She's 25 years old and she grew up in a rural village in Indonesia.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.560
 But like so many people, she dreamed of a better life.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.280
 Specifically she dreamed of being rich and famous.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.000
 She wanted the eyes of the world upon her.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.760
 It's a very, very common desire, right?

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:16.840
 But reality doesn't always give us what we want, at least not in the way we expect it.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:23.480
 By the time Siti is 25 years old, she finds herself working as a masseuse in Malaysia.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.720
 And it's making ends meet.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.960
 It's not a lot of money at all, but it's something.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.960
 She's working as a masseuse.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.040
 And through her job, she meets a taxi driver.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.000
 And the taxi driver says, "Oh Siti, you're so beautiful.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 You're so beautiful.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.760
 What are you doing here in this massage parlor?

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.800
 It's such a waste of your obvious talents.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.200
 You're too good looking for this job.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.000
 You're too smart to simply sit here and be a masseuse.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.920
 You should be on the front cover of magazines.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.920
 You should be all over the world.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.280
 You should have everything you've ever wanted."

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.760
 And Siti is listening to this taxi cab driver.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.360
 She's probably thinking, "Well, I'd share it.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.360
 Yeah, that'd be nice.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.640
 But you're a taxi cab driver.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.280
 What can you do for me?"

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.840
 Taxi cab driver goes, "I actually know a television producer.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.760
 I'm driving taxi, but I meet people from all over.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.560
 Rich people take the taxi too.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:21.080
 And I know a television producer and he is actually looking for a drop dead gorgeous woman,

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.120
 just like you, for his next project.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.840
 Would you like me to put you in touch with him?"

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.880
 Siti, like most of us would, she jumps at the opportunity, right?

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.200
 She's just been giving back rubs.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.640
 I don't know what type of massage parlor it was, but either way, she's been rubbing down

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.080
 greasy men night after night.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.440
 She goes, "Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.000
 That'd be great.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.880
 Go ahead and put me in touch with that television producer."

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.600
 And then the taxi cab driver goes, "But finish giving me my back rub.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.240
 Then I'll do it."

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:00.000
 She eventually gets put in touch with this television producer from Japan named James.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.120
 And James is talking to Siti and he goes, "Listen, I generally do television, but we

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.600
 know that YouTube is the future and I'm working on this new project.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.320
 It's going to be a hidden camera prank show.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.760
 Those are all the rage right now.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.760
 These hidden camera pranks.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.960
 It's going to be super easy.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.720
 All I need you to do is help me pull these pranks.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.640
 I'm going to be hidden with my phone and I'm going to be recording these things.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.000
 We're going to post them on YouTube.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.160
 It'll go viral.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.360
 You will go viral.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.160
 Are you in or are you out?"

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.160
 And Siti goes, "Oh yeah, I know.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.160
 I'm totally do that.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.320
 That would be awesome.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:38.880
 This is the first step to me actually getting out of this crummy massage business, making

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.880
 it big."

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.360
 So they meet up at this location.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.560
 Generally they did this at restaurants and outdoor cafes and things like that.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:54.560
 There so often they would actually do it at the local international airport, but the setup

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.000
 was always the same.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.480
 Siti would show up and this television producer, James, would squirt baby oil into her hands.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:10.880
 And he would go, "I want you to walk up to a random businessman and smear the baby oil

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.640
 on his face and then leave.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.640
 You can run away.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640
 You can apologize.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.400
 I don't want to do it, but don't stick around for too long."

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.400
 And I'm going to record it.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.400
 It'll be hilarious.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.840
 It'll be this super funny prank.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:29.880
 And Siti's like, "Okay, I don't know if I'd say it was super funny, but it could be amusing."

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:36.200
 So James sprays baby oil on Siti's hands and she walks up to a random dude and smears

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:43.280
 it all over his face and then stands there and apologizes briefly and then runs away.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.800
 James is filming this the whole time.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.320
 And on her first time doing this, she did it to three different guys in this kind of

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.440
 open, common, public area.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440
 She's walking around.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.560
 She's smearing this baby oil on these guys' faces and she's getting paid good money to

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.160
 do this, right?

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.800
 She's getting paid good money to actually do this.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800
 So it's worth it.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.160
 Nothing bad has happened.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.160
 No one's beating her up.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.720
 I mean, at the end of the day, it's baby oil.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.520
 There's this beautiful young woman standing in front of you and being like, "Oh, I'm so

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.520
 sorry.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.520
 I'm so sorry."

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.520
 And whatever.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.200
 And maybe you recognize her from the massage parlor and you're like, "Hey, Siti, see you

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200
 later tonight.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.520
 Save that baby oil."

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.960
 This goes on for a couple weeks.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:31.320
 They're shooting these prank videos.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:38.520
 Well now it's February 2017 and she gets a call from James and goes, "Okay, we're going

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.080
 to do another one of these pranks.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.880
 Meet us down at the International Airport."

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.840
 They've done the prank here before.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840
 Not a big deal.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.560
 It's the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.560
 And she shows up.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.920
 Siti shows up and this time there's another woman is there as well named Duong Fee Huong

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.480
 who is another young woman.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.160
 And James goes, "Okay, here we go, guys.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.680
 We're going to do another one of these pranks."

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.360
 But this time, we're going to have both of you.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360
 It's going to be super funny.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.360
 We're going to have both of you.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.800
 We're going to put this baby oil on your hands.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.320
 You guys have both done this several times.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.160
 This isn't your first rodeo.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:18.160
 This time it's going to be extra funny because I'm actually going to point somebody out

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.640
 and it's my boss.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.880
 This has been a side project who we've been working on and it's going to be hilarious.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:30.360
 Now we're going to have both of you come from different angles and smear this baby oil on

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.360
 his face.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.160
 It's going to be hilarious, but I'm telling you right now, my boss dude, he is not going

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.160
 to be happy.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.680
 He doesn't have any funny bones at all in his body.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.360
 He's going to actually be really, really upset when he do this to my boss.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.960
 So when you do this, just leave right away.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.960
 Don't stop.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.680
 Don't apologize or anything like that.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.880
 I'll make it up to him later.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.760
 It'll be hilarious.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.920
 So the girls are like, "Yeah, no, that'll be awesome.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920
 This will be fun."

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.120
 I mean, it's fun as rubbing baby oil on someone's face, but they're getting paid.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.480
 They've been getting paid.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:08.400
 So James once again takes out the baby oil bottle and sprays some baby oil into Duong's

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:15.480
 hands, and then he sprays some baby oil into Siti's hands and says, "That's the guy right

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.480
 there.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.480
 You see him right there?"

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.040
 And the two girls turn and they look and they see James's boss and they head off from two

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.480
 different angles.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.000
 And they walk up to this guy and they smear baby oil all over his face.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.400
 And the two young girls turn and walk in opposite directions.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.640
 It's perfect.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.000
 It was exactly what James was looking for as he was videotaping this.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.240
 Siti, after she walked away, she went into the women's restroom and washed her hands

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.840
 off.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.440
 And in another part of the airport, Duong is doing the same thing.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.640
 She walked right into the women's restroom, washed her hands off.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.120
 The baby oil prank is done.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.880
 But that wasn't James's boss.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.520
 James didn't know him, though.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.280
 He did pick him out for a purpose.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.080
 The man that just had baby oil rubbed on his face inside this international airport, his

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:20.280
 name Kim Jong Nam.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:31.320
 Kim Jong Un's half brother and rightful heir as ruler of North Korea.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:36.400
 He was the older son of Kim Jong Il.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:42.880
 But when he deeply embarrassed the family, he was pretty much exiled from North Korea,

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:49.840
 where he became an open critic of the totalitarian regime of his father and now his brother Kim

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.680
 Jong Un.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:58.080
 Kim Jong Nam had just had baby oil wiped on his face.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.520
 But as he was being led away by security, because he was furious that this happened to him,

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.960
 he's being led away by security, he's actually being taken into a little medical center inside

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:18.640
 this international hospital, his breathing becomes heavy, and then it stops completely.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.440
 Kim Jong Nam was not covered in baby oil.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:32.120
 He was covered in a nerve agent called VX, which is considered a weapon of mass destruction.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.840
 It causes your muscles to become paralyzed.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.000
 You suffocate to death.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.880
 This assassination was months in the planning.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:52.240
 They had been trying to find Kim Jong Un and I say they, obviously people blamed this on

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240
 North Korea.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.520
 But North Korea has always denied this.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:01.000
 They said they had nothing to do with this and they really said that Kim Jong Un's brother

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.680
 died.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.040
 The two girls were pretty quickly arrested.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:12.240
 I think it was maybe three days where these two girls were tracked down because this was

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.520
 all caught on video.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.240
 You can see the surveillance video.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.600
 I was watching that.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.000
 There's a final photo of Kim Jong Nam.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.720
 He's sitting in a chair in this little medical center and it's just like a cheap plastic

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.320
 chair and he's completely slumped back in it.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.720
 He's suffocating.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.800
 You're looking at the photo of a man who's sitting in a chair who can't breathe.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.360
 His lungs have been paralyzed.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.880
 Brain is still active, but he can't draw in a breath.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.000
 His lungs aren't working.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.440
 They arrest these two young women and they go, "What are you talking about?"

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.480
 It was just a prank, bro.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.480
 Literally.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.360
 We've been doing this for weeks.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.520
 We've been doing this all over.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.920
 They're like, "Wait, what are we?"

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.920
 What are you talking about?

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.960
 So, the baby oil thing.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.120
 We've been getting paid to put baby oil on various people's faces.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.320
 It's for a YouTube channel.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.320
 The fact that it didn't kill the two girls, at first investigators thought maybe one person

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.480
 had the V and the other person had the X.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.960
 When they put them together, it happened.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:23.360
 No, it turns out that both of these young women, as unbelievable as it sounds, both

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.880
 had VX nerve agent rubbed on their hands.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.600
 The authorities say, "How did they not wash their hands off immediately?"

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.080
 They would have died as well.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.960
 They would have killed them.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.760
 The fact that they both walked into the bathroom to wash their hands off was nothing short

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.760
 of a miracle, but you're also under arrest.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.840
 We don't believe you that this was a prank.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.600
 We think that you were part of this.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.080
 They're actually arrested and they were being told to give up the rest of their assassination

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.160
 squad and they're like, "You mean James?

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.760
 You mean the television producer?

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.840
 This is all the information I have from them."

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.600
 Nobody else was ever arrested for this.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.480
 Taxicab driver disappeared.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.960
 James, the television producer, disappeared.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.160
 There were some other people they met during this because they were doing some of these

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.000
 operations in Indonesia, some of them in Malaysia.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.880
 They traveled a bit.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.880
 Everyone disappeared.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.840
 And to this day, the only people arrested for it were those two young women.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.080
 Eventually, it was about two years.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.360
 They were in prison for about two years because nobody believed them.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.480
 The first year, both these girls were in solitary confinement.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:33.040
 They were trying to get them to break and give up the rest of their assassination squad.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:41.920
 But eventually, I think they realized, no, these girls were duped into killing a possible

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.920
 world leader.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.760
 See, that was a thing like he was supposed to be in charge of North Korea.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.440
 I said he was embarrassed, he embarrassed the regime earlier.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.440
 That what he did.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.480
 This is so ridiculous.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.560
 Even you are the oldest son of a world dictator, right?

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.960
 One of the last rogue nations on the planet.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:09.680
 Kim Jong-nam's great sin was he got arrested with a fake passport trying to take his family

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.520
 to Tokyo Disneyland.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.720
 That embarrassed his father, Kim Jong-il, so much he disowned him pretty much.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.080
 He was like, you're not going to be heir to the throne.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.080
 You're going to be over Disneyland, right?

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.640
 Over Disneyland.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:31.280
 At the same time, Kim Jong-nam was openly a critic of the regime even when his dad was

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.280
 in power.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.600
 So I'm sure that didn't help anything.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.600
 He was basically doing that.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.000
 He's like, my dad won't let me go to Disneyland.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Totalitarianism sucks.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.080
 People are like, well, that's kind of a weird reason why you want to shut down an entire

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080
 country.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.960
 But he was supposed to be the president or the supreme ruler, supreme leader of North

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:53.800
 Korea and instead his younger brother, Kim Jong-un, rose to power.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:58.760
 But the fact that Kim Jong-nam was still out there running around openly criticizing the

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.360
 government, it wasn't a good look.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.280
 It wasn't a good look for the North Korean leadership.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.000
 So they eventually had him taken out.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.600
 In what must be one of the most bizarre assassinations on record, I'm surprised I had never heard

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.600
 of this.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.920
 It's so recent.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.440
 Maybe I saw a headline at some point.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.440
 I don't know.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.840
 This is so bizarre and it would work.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.800
 That's what makes it so terrifying.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:28.440
 It obviously worked on this guy, but that is the way to pull it off.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.760
 You dupe people into doing this.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:37.080
 And nowadays I feel like that is such an easy thing to do because you could tell someone,

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.400
 you want to be rich and famous, we're going to do these.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.160
 I mean, I couldn't have planned it any better than these guys.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.840
 I mean, I don't give a lot of props to North Korea.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:51.840
 Although I did do an entire week of North Korean episodes, but you got to give hats off

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.840
 to these guys.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.680
 I mean, I want to shake their hand, but you can definitely tip your hat to them.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.760
 You got people to think it was just a prank and they had done it.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.960
 They had basically done trial runs this whole time and it worked.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.640
 Each time you could sneak up to, you not even really sneak up, you're in a crowded area,

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.200
 especially beautiful women walking toward you.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:17.320
 Your guard's going to be down and they smear this VX nerve agent all over you.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.480
 And it's interesting because you couldn't have had one of your own agents do it just

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.760
 because the VX was so dangerous, you'd have to wear gloves and you want to want to be

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.760
 caught on camera.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.320
 Like you could have it totally set up.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.440
 I can't think of it.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.320
 I can't think of a better way to do this.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:39.720
 And you're using people's own desire for fortune and fame to push them forward.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.120
 You didn't have to bring them in on the plot.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:48.160
 You didn't have to whip them up into a frenzy about what a horrible guy this was.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.720
 You didn't have to do any of the brainwashing.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:56.600
 You didn't have to do any of the forming this guerrilla unit and training people and making

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.440
 them hate the enemy so much.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.640
 They'd be willing to put their lives at risk.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.840
 They'd be willing to kill civilians.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.360
 That's been the template really forever.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.280
 And then you go, and now we're going to go out and we're going to go out and we're going

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.000
 to kill this political leader and we're going to take the bombs to the streets and da da

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 da da.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 That's how it used to be.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.880
 Now you can just be like, hey, you want to be on a prank video?

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.640
 I'm going to give you this backpack.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.960
 And somewhere in this crowd, there will be a backpack that looks like it.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.560
 And you replace it and get back here.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.160
 That's the prank.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.720
 Inside your backpack, it's full of cockroaches.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.720
 Don't look.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.400
 If you hear any ticking, that's the cockroaches' legs rubbing up against each other.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:42.000
 You go and you replace this backpack somewhere in that food court.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.360
 It's a backpack that looks just like it.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.360
 Go!

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.360
 And you're running through the food court.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.080
 I guess that would be super suspicious.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.080
 You're all sweaty.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.080
 You're running.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.960
 You're like, Mr. Beast, Mr. Beast, am I almost there?

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.520
 Am I almost there?

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.920
 I guess they probably go and also don't run.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.920
 Don't run.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.480
 Don't yell the name out of my YouTube channel or anything like that.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.400
 You got to be slick.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.960
 And then you're walking away with a backpack full of all these secret documents.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.800
 The guy sitting over there with a bomb now.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.920
 That's the best case scenario.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:19.320
 Worst case scenario is it is full of cockroaches, but it's fantastic.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320
 It's fantastic.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.280
 Like on a purely technical level, it works.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.880
 And I could totally see this happening again.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:31.200
 I could totally see, instead of the guy with the rifle in the clock tower, which you have

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.040
 to train how to use that type of rifle.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.080
 How to make sure that you are able to sneak by security.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.520
 Do you even have the cardio to walk up that many flights of stairs?

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:46.480
 These are all questions that are unnecessary to answer if you can frame it as a prank.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.360
 Instead of putting someone in the clock tower with a rifle, you could just say, we got this

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.560
 new prank.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:58.560
 This prank is called running up to the president with two loaded shotguns.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.640
 I mean, but they're squirt guns.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.640
 Don't worry about it, son.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.640
 They're squirt guns.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.080
 They're super chokers and they're filled with sulfuric acid.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:11.320
 I guess that one would be pretty easy to stop.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.960
 One, the squirt guns would pretty much melt, but let's say they didn't.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.480
 I think the secret survey, if you're running up to the president, if you're running up

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:25.960
 to the president screaming, Mr. Beast, you're giving the channel introduction and you're

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.960
 holding anything.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.960
 You could be holding two bananas.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.000
 I think the secret service is going to stop you.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 But what are they going to do?

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.520
 It's going to be a bunch of sulfuric acid right in their face.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.960
 They're like, ah, ah, and the president will be like, no.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.760
 You could totally do this.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.000
 You could totally do that.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 I'm not saying you should.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.160
 Just so we're clear.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.720
 Just so we're clear government agents.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.240
 I'm not saying you should.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:55.720
 I'm saying this will be the future of political assassinations or even like business assassinations,

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.600
 corporate espionage, all of that.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:05.560
 Instead of trying to get someone who is highly trained to do the job, just get somebody who

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.760
 wants to be famous and trick them into killing people.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.280
 It would have taken years to get these two young women to the point where they actually

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.840
 wanted to take a human life and they hated this guy so much they are willing to possibly

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.780
 sacrifice their own lives and the lives of others to martyr themselves to take out this

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.520
 contender to the throne.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:36.320
 But in a couple weeks, in just a couple weeks, these two young women were turned into assassins.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.800
 Totally against their knowledge.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.800
 Totally against their will.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.800
 They never would have done it.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.640
 No matter how much money you gave them to say, hey, we're going to put this VX nerve agent

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.640
 on your hands.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.080
 They'd be like, no, I'm done.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.080
 It's just a fascinating story.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.640
 I'm surprised I never heard of it.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.880
 A prank that turned into a murder.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.680
 But if anything, this may be a one of a kind event now, but in the future, I feel like this

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:08.840
 type of action will be much more common because it's so easy to do.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.560
 And that's the scary part.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.760
 There's a very, very, very small group of people who you can brainwash into killing

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:23.320
 other people, even civilians for the greater good.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:35.160
 But nearly everybody would do anything to go viral, even if that means smearing a virus

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:44.520
 all over somebody, believing it was all just the prank.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.120
