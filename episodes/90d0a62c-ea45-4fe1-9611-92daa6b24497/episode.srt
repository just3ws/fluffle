1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,280
 Connecticut, known the world around for their delicious maple syrup, their birds probably,

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,680
 and murderous ghosts.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,400
 They leave that part out of the brochure, they make sure they talk about their birds, and

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,000
 then we travel to Malaysia to take a look at the story of a young woman who is approached

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,160
 by a television producer and he promises this young woman fame and fortune.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,760
 All she has to do is pull a prank.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,600
 I hope you guys are staying warm wherever you're at.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,240
 I guess now they have live streaming in Antarctica.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,680
 I guess there's now like some satellites so you can live stream them.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
 That sounds super boring.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,240
 I mean unless they're getting killed by the thing, it really would just be a bunch of

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,280
 people like playing chess and talking about like, "Hey, did you see how scientific the

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,780
 snow looked today?

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,400
 I did so much science.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,280
 Like I can't, why would you want to talk to people in Antarctica?"

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,560
 I find that, I find that terrible.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,400
 I guess their families, I guess their loved ones enjoy it.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,320
 But you know, I don't know, I'd find it kind of boring.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,440
 Let me know when you guys are being picked off one by one by a shape-shifting alien, but

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,760
 someone who will always fight the good fight against the things, walking into Dead Rabbit

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,960
 Command is one of our Thanksgiving live stream contributors.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
 Everyone give it up for Sugoi.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
 Woohoo!

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,880
 Yeah, come on Sugoi, walking on into Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,440
 He's shape-shifting as he's trying to assume a final form.

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,800
 Sugoi, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,760
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, you guys can't support the show financially, I

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,600
 totally get it.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,480
 Just helps for the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,760
 That really, really, really helps out.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,520
 Sugoi, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,480
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,880
 Fly us all the way on out to Connecticut.

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,800
 [Demonic sound]

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
 Headed all the way out there.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,040
 We've been to Connecticut a couple times over the course of this show.

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,960
 Some people say it's the most haunted state in America.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,640
 Those people tend to, the people who say that tend to run haunted tours in Connecticut.

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
 So I mean, a little bit biased there.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,720
 I've always heard that California is the most haunted state, pound for pound.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,920
 But a lot of people claim their state's the most haunted and that's why we're in Connecticut

46
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,800
 right now because whether or not Connecticut has the most ghosts, they definitely have

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,240
 some of the most memorable.

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
 They really do.

49
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,880
 I've been researching Connecticut ghosts lately.

50
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,440
 I've been going through the Shadowlands.net in alphabetical order.

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,440
 I'm up to the seas and I'm in Connecticut.

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
 And man, I found some doozies.

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,680
 I found some really weird ones.

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,880
 We're going to be covering them over the next couple of episodes, but even these two are

55
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,040
 just so weird.

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,520
 To go inland, the Dead Rabbit Dergible, our first stop here in Connecticut is we're going

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:24,960
 to hang out at Warren Harding High School in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,760
 We're here at Warren Harding High School and we're here to check out a haunting which has

59
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,200
 some terrifying implications of what life after death could actually be.

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
 It just seems like a normal high school.

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,520
 These are walking out of classes, bells are ringing, principals like, "You better get

62
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,400
 back to class, guys."

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,600
 All that good stuff.

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,320
 But then we see a ruckus down an empty hallway.

65
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,200
 We see this older man, he seems to be middle aged, and he's running down the hallway and

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
 he's like, "Help!

67
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
 Help!

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
 Oh my God!

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
 Help me!

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
 Somebody help me!"

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,600
 He runs out of view and we're like, "What dude?"

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,840
 We look over at the principal, "Principles, what am I supposed to do about that?"

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
 I'm telling these kids to go back to class.

74
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,640
 I'm telling these kids to go back to class.

75
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,280
 You handled the bloodied man running through my school, so we're running down the hallways

76
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,000
 and we turn and we look down the other hallway.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 What?

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,600
 I swear, I just saw a, not elderly man, but an older man running, why am I so fixated

79
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
 on the age?

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,960
 A bloodied human being, no matter if he was four or forty-four, a man with blood leaking

81
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,120
 out of his body went running by and now he's gone.

82
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,760
 There's no blood on the ground, nothing.

83
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,840
 So we start, we split up, we split up.

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
 I'll take the food court.

85
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,160
 You guys walk down the spooky hallways of this school and you guys are looking around.

86
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,920
 Never show often when the hallway is long and empty, you'll hear, "No!

87
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,920
 Somebody save me!

88
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,360
 Ah!"

89
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,480
 You can never find the source of the screaming.

90
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,920
 We all meet back up in the cafeteria and I'm sitting there and I go, "So how did the investigation

91
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 go, guys?"

92
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,800
 And you're like, "Dude, it was super creepy.

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,520
 We're walking around this school and I swear it sounds like a man's being murdered."

94
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,800
 And I go, "That's exactly what you heard."

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,120
 However, he wasn't being murdered today, so there's nothing you could have done to help

96
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
 this guy.

97
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,880
 He's just shooting at you on a wild goose taste.

98
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,960
 I go, "What you heard was the screams of Mike.

99
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,560
 Mike, sit down.

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,240
 Let me tell you a story.

101
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,400
 Grab some mashed potatoes."

102
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,480
 Apparently back in the 1960s at Warren Harding High School, now there's a new building at

103
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 this location.

104
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,520
 I couldn't tell if it was a new addition to the original building or if they tore down

105
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
 the original building.

106
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,120
 But this haunting seemingly still exists.

107
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,520
 There's very little evidence of this online, but you do see a story here or there.

108
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,600
 Back in the 1960s, there was a custodian named Mike who worked at Warren Harding High School

109
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,040
 and there was an insane student there as well.

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:19,120
 And also, attending this school is a bad combination, Old Man, Janitor, and an insane student who

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,280
 one day killed Mike, the beloved janitor of Warren Harding High School.

112
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,880
 It wasn't like a quick kill, right?

113
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,280
 I don't think the killer jumped out of a locker or something and then stabbed him once and

114
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,360
 the guy's like, "I'm dead."

115
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,920
 It sounds like there was a long chase.

116
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,640
 And what we're hearing in these modern times is the spirit of Mike.

117
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,240
 But they'll actually see this guy.

118
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,000
 They'll see a bloody man running down a hallway screaming for help.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,240
 He's basically reliving his murder.

120
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,920
 That's pretty part and parcel with basic ghost lore, right?

121
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,560
 We see that a lot in ghost stories.

122
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,880
 Someone died tragically.

123
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,800
 Someone died violently and they're reliving their death over and over again.

124
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,600
 What's interesting about this story, and again, there's really not a lot of stuff online about

125
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
 it.

126
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:18,240
 But the story goes that his killer was never caught and some believe that his killer haunts

127
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,160
 the school as well.

128
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,000
 So it's not just a matter that we're hearing this guy and sometimes seeing this guy relive

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
 his death over and over again.

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,240
 The dude who killed him is there as well.

131
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,560
 His spirit is there as well.

132
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,520
 And that, I think we talked about this a little bit last season, but this is extra terrifying.

133
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,720
 And listen, if I get brutally murdered, someone beats me to death with a spiked baseball bat

134
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,040
 while I'm walking to work one day, I'll deal with it.

135
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,320
 I mean, I'll be dead, right?

136
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
 I'll be dead.

137
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,720
 But I'll deal with it.

138
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,160
 Imagine, though, if in the afterlife I'm constantly being pursued by this same guy.

139
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,640
 It would be like an infinite game of Pac-Man.

140
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,120
 You would never find any rest.

141
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,280
 Now, you could argue that the souls are simply repeating.

142
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,080
 You know, they're just basically repeating.

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
 There's no emotions being spent.

144
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,720
 The soul isn't actually being destroyed over and over again.

145
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,320
 It's like Jason, if you watch Top Gun over and over again, it's not like Goose is actually

146
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
 dying.

147
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,080
 He, first off, he was a fictional character, but it's not like each time you watch the

148
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,000
 movie, the tragedy happens again.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,760
 It's simply that you're seeing the tragedy happen again.

150
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,080
 So on one hand, if you have just a recording type phantasm here, recording goes, "Clean

151
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,720
 out over and over again if a man being murdered and his killer."

152
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 Who's never seen?

153
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
 Who's never seen?

154
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,760
 Apparently, they didn't catch the insane student.

155
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,440
 They probably could have just looked up his personal records.

156
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,920
 Apparently, he was known to be insane.

157
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
 It just went to his house.

158
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,240
 But it's just plain over and over again.

159
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,720
 The soul of Mike is...

160
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
 You know what I mean?

161
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,200
 Like, it's one thing if someone videotaped your death and they're showing it on some

162
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:11,880
 gore deep web channel versus every time someone played that video, your soul relived that

163
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
 torment.

164
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
 Does that kind of make sense?

165
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,280
 But there's always the option.

166
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,320
 There's always the idea that that is taking place.

167
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,920
 That this isn't a typical recording type haunting.

168
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,640
 That Mike's soul is trapped in the place where he died violently, but the killer went on

169
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
 with his life.

170
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,800
 He was never caught.

171
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,560
 So when he died, wherever it was, whether it was in Connecticut or he was in Timbuktu,

172
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,880
 hanging out, trying to get a job as a high school janitor, he goes, "The circle starts

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
 again."

174
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,120
 When he died, when his soul died, it went back to where he was the happiest, which was killing

175
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,640
 Mike at Warren Harding High School.

176
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:05,720
 So it's possible that this is the two souls, not simply reliving the event, but reenacting

177
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
 the event.

178
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,920
 That Mike's soul is now trapped and being tormented by his killer over and over and over

179
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
 again.

180
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,600
 The reason why I say that is because we do...

181
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
 Here's the thing.

182
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
 The story may not be true at all.

183
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,760
 I found two sources for it.

184
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:26,280
 Shatterlands.net and then a book called Ghost to Coast Tours and Haunted Places.

185
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,680
 It was the name of the book.

186
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
 That was published in 2009.

187
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,360
 That was the only place I could find information about this particular haunting, but I wonder

188
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,280
 if it is simply a replaying of the event or if it's actually the soul's trap there.

189
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:50,000
 It's also interesting to note that according to these accounts, only the staff members

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,160
 have ever heard this.

191
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,480
 The students themselves are not bothered by these sights and these sounds.

192
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
 An interesting haunting.

193
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
 There's some interesting things.

194
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
 Sugio.

195
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,920
 Is that how our parents are named?

196
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
 Sugoi.

197
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
 Sugoi.

198
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,160
 Let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Jason D'Apri.

199
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,600
 We're going to leave behind Warren Harding High School, but we're staying in Connecticut.

200
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:18,040
 We have us all the way on out to Hubbard Park.

201
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
 It looks pretty beautiful.

202
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,760
 I was looking at photos of it.

203
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,000
 It's about 1800 acres that was donated by this dude named Walter Hubbard.

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,760
 Back in 1900, he was a pretty dope guy.

205
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
 Everyone liked him.

206
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,120
 He didn't have any scandals.

207
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,680
 He's just genuinely a nice rich dude and he ended up donating all this land to the town

208
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,280
 and also in the park, there's a place called Castle Craig.

209
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
 Castle Craig.

210
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,880
 Apparently it's like a thousand foot, nearly a thousand foot tall observation tower built

211
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,840
 so you can walk up and go, "Wow, look at this big old park."

212
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,680
 And then you walk back down.

213
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,840
 I don't know what else you do up there.

214
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,360
 I don't know if there's like a casino or anything fun, but you get to look around.

215
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,640
 You get to be a thousand feet tall.

216
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,360
 That's pretty cool.

217
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,920
 Apparently.

218
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
 This is interesting.

219
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,200
 This is what I love about doing this show because I wanted to gun down this rabbit hole or dog

220
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
 hole.

221
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,440
 How do I not, I never mind.

222
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,480
 You still call it a rabbit hole.

223
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,560
 How do I not done this podcast?

224
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,680
 I was reading about stuff in, haunted stuff in Connecticut.

225
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,520
 I came across Hubbard Park.

226
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,920
 There's a story of a phantom dog that roams the area.

227
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,920
 This one is opposed to the Warren Harding High School story.

228
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,240
 You'll find this everywhere.

229
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,280
 You'll find this in lists of the top Connecticut haunted places.

230
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,800
 You'll find this story everywhere about this black phantom dog that hangs out in this area.

231
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,320
 Specifically, it walks through this portion of the park called Hanging Hills.

232
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,640
 The Hanging Hills.

233
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,640
 And if you see this black dog when you're out in the area, that means you're going to

234
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,800
 have great fortune soon.

235
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,160
 You're going to find yourself in the possession of worldly goods.

236
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,080
 That might be a reason why people like climbing that tower because now you got a huge view

237
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
 of the park.

238
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,640
 You go, "Whoa, there's the dog.

239
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,040
 I'm rich."

240
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,120
 But don't ever go back to the park.

241
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,120
 Don't ever go back to Hubbard Park because if you see the dog twice, then you get really,

242
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,520
 really sick.

243
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,440
 And if you see the dog three times, you die.

244
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
 It seems like a pretty easy curse to avoid, right?

245
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,080
 You go there, you see the dog, you get a bunch of money.

246
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
 You just leave.

247
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
 You never go back.

248
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,000
 You leave the state of Connecticut.

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,360
 It doesn't seem like that bad of a curse.

250
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,200
 I don't know if there's some sort of monkey paw type of thing where you get all your money.

251
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,480
 You win the lottery, but they're like, "We've moved.

252
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,680
 We've moved location in the lottery office."

253
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,760
 You're going to have to come to Hubbard Park to pick up your ticket.

254
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,360
 I don't know if somehow you keep getting tricked to go back there.

255
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,560
 You use your money.

256
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
 You buy a brand new car.

257
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
 It breaks down.

258
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,920
 The breaks, the breaks give out and you just roll all the way downhill back to Hubbard

259
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
 Park.

260
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,760
 I don't know if the dog visits you if you see it once.

261
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,800
 It's no guarantee that you're going to see it twice or three times, but it's just kind

262
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,480
 of like, "Why would you ever go back?"

263
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,240
 This story is repeated over and over and over all over the internet, this particular story.

264
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
 So I kept digging.

265
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
 The more resources there are, I kept digging into it.

266
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,280
 It turns out this one is 100% false.

267
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,200
 100% false.

268
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
 It's verifiably false.

269
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,040
 Not just because magic doesn't exist, curses and good luck charms.

270
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,960
 I do believe magic exists, but you know what I mean?

271
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,800
 Generally, if it was identifiable, if it was repeatable, scientists would be like, "Woohoo!

272
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,840
 Now I got all this money to put more liquids in vials."

273
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,840
 Next stop, Antarctica.

274
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,200
 Provably not true.

275
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,560
 This story is provably not true.

276
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,760
 It's actually based on a short story written by Thomas Pinchon.

277
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,120
 He's an author.

278
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,000
 His grandpa wrote a fictional story back in 1898 for the Connecticut Quarterly, and it

279
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,080
 was about this black dog.

280
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
 It's interesting.

281
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,680
 Again, this is what I love about this podcast.

282
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,760
 I was doing lots of research and I found that.

283
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,960
 They said, "The reason why a lot of modern people think that story is real, even though

284
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,960
 it was clearly fictional," if you read the original versions, clearly fictional, "is

285
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,720
 one, it's from Thomas Pinchon's grandpa, but he was also graduated from Harvard.

286
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,760
 And he was a noted geologist.

287
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,680
 And then so when he wrote this story that was obviously fictional, people thought, "Well,

288
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,000
 you know, he's a geologist.

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 We always trust geologists, right?

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,080
 We're not going to lie to us."

291
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,960
 So that story is 100% fake.

292
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,200
 It was fascinating.

293
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,680
 You'll find that story all over and you won't see that final part where they go, "It's actually

294
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
 fake."

295
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,200
 You'll just find a report of the legend, their stories, and da da da da da.

296
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,120
 However, I wasn't even looking for the black dog of the Hanging Hills.

297
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,280
 I was looking for another ghost that supposedly lives in Hubbard Park that, again, you can

298
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,320
 barely find any information on.

299
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,200
 So we know the black dog is so fascinating to me.

300
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,920
 We know the black dog is fake, 100%.

301
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,840
 It was based on a short story that was published in Connecticut Quarterly in 1898.

302
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,640
 We know that's fake.

303
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,840
 That gets tons of press.

304
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,280
 The story, the Warren Harding High School, barely anything, and then this story, there's

305
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,320
 barely anything.

306
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:27,080
 And again, it makes us look at the power of the paranormal, the power of the ghostly world.

307
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:36,440
 Over by 999 West Main Street in the Hanging Hills area, there's a story of a ghost.

308
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
 This is really interesting.

309
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,160
 I see this phrase different ways.

310
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,480
 Sometimes the ghost is listed as a seven-year-old girl.

311
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,520
 Other times it's described as something that looks like a seven-year-old girl.

312
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,040
 And there's really a big difference between the two, right?

313
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,720
 One would imply it's the ghost of a girl who died when she was seven.

314
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,360
 The other one would imply this is something much darker and older and more powerful that's

315
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,600
 simply assuming that form, which would make sense considering where the story is going.

316
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,640
 If you're hanging out at 999 West Main Street and you want to see a ghost, there is a way

317
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,240
 to summon this seven-year-old girl's phantom.

318
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
 Quite simple, actually.

319
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,880
 Quite simple.

320
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
 All you have to do is kidnap somebody.

321
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,120
 I said it was simple.

322
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,240
 Didn't say it was legal.

323
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,040
 So let's go ahead and grab this random person walking down the street and throw him in the

324
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,920
 back of the Jason Jalopy and drive on out in the middle of the forest.

325
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,440
 We got to see if this actually works.

326
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,600
 We got to see if this haunting actually works.

327
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,480
 So you grab a guy and make you pick one out of the crowd.

328
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
 You're like, "Jason, I don't know.

329
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
 I don't know who's innocent and who's guilty."

330
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
 And I go, "Just pick someone at random.

331
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,240
 You know you might pick a guy who deserves to get kidnapped."

332
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,680
 So you pick a guy and I go, "Oh, no, that guy was actually really good.

333
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,960
 He's a really good guy, but you picked him.

334
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,360
 You're a bad person for picking him to kidnap."

335
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,520
 Throw this guy in the trunk and we're driving on out to Hubbard Park.

336
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,320
 And then you get the guy out of the trunk and you're dragging him.

337
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,640
 He's begging for his life.

338
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
 He's saying, "Please, I have a family.

339
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
 I have a family at home.

340
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
 It's my daughter's birthday.

341
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
 We're crying out loud.

342
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
 He's holding an ice cream cake.

343
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,160
 It's melting, but you have no heart.

344
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
 You're cold.

345
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,880
 You're a cold, blooded person."

346
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,720
 You're dragging him through the woods.

347
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,320
 Finally we're standing there in the middle of Hubbard Park and you hear a, "Hehehehe."

348
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:48,320
 You're like, "Jayson, is that just you laughing?"

349
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,280
 I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no.

350
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,280
 That sounded like me laughing, but it was actually the laughter of a seven-year-old girl."

351
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,280
 And you're like, "Oh, you're all scared."

352
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,720
 You hear this laughter coming from all around you and then all of a sudden the seven-year-old

353
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:13,880
 girl appears out of the darkness and she rips you to pieces or she stops your heart

354
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,480
 or she stabs you with a sword.

355
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,520
 It doesn't actually say how she does it, but apparently this little girl's ghost is so

356
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:29,320
 interesting and apparently this little girl, she was kidnapped as a child and murdered

357
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,480
 in the forest.

358
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,680
 So now if you, so specific, it's like one of the most specific on-aids ever.

359
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:43,960
 If you kidnap somebody, if you kidnap anybody and take them to the forest here in Hubbard

360
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,840
 Park, the seven-year-old girl will kill you.

361
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,880
 She specifically kills kidnappers.

362
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,320
 They say that she enjoys it.

363
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,960
 She loves killing bad people.

364
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,080
 So kidnappers beware in Connecticut.

365
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,360
 I'm sure Connecticut has a huge kidnapping problem, right?

366
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,480
 Kidnappers beware.

367
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,120
 If you take them to Hubbard Park, there's a chance that you'll take them to 999 West Main

368
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,760
 Street area and there'll be a little girl waiting for you to kill you.

369
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,920
 That's such a specific haunting.

370
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,200
 I mean, that's so bizarre.

371
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,000
 When I came across that, I thought, "How would anyone have tested that out?

372
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,440
 The first person who goes, "Man, you won't believe what happened tonight.

373
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,600
 First off, I kidnap somebody."

374
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 It's a difficult thing.

375
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 They never met me.

376
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 I'm a kidnapber after all.

377
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
 I kidnap someone.

378
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,080
 I didn't know where to take them.

379
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,720
 I took them to the woods, a new place.

380
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
 I was taking them to a new place.

381
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,960
 Normally, I'd take them to the outskirts of town or the old abandoned ironworks factory.

382
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,920
 But this time, I decided to take the scenic route to drive through the forest.

383
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,160
 And I wasn't alone.

384
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
 Don't worry.

385
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,840
 Pete was with me, my fellow kidnapper.

386
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,680
 But all of a sudden, this little girl showed up and ripped Pete into little tiny pieces

387
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,600
 and never seen anything like it.

388
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,680
 And I didn't know what to do, so I left the kidnapping victim there.

389
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,240
 Hoping whatever killed Pete would take its time with the victim and what?

390
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,920
 They didn't even kill the guy I kidnapped.

391
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,800
 I ran through the woods, barely made it out alive.

392
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,040
 And here I am on theshadowlands.net typing out my story.

393
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,720
 Who was the first person to report that?

394
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,520
 It would have had to be someone who admitted to breaking the law.

395
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,920
 It would have been a kidnapper.

396
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,920
 The idea of a ghost of vengeance, again, is something that is cool, but it's very rarely

397
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,120
 seen in the world of the paranormal.

398
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,480
 We have ghosts that were killed violently, ghosts that didn't get justice in this life.

399
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,640
 And every show often we have a story about them interfering.

400
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,480
 We did an episode like that a long time ago about a ghost interfering, like basically acting

401
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,760
 as a witness in the trial of their own death.

402
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 That was a really cool story.

403
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,280
 I'll put that in the show notes.

404
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,440
 I think we've honestly covered more than one like that.

405
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,960
 And I've seen maybe five or six in total through decorative research.

406
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,520
 It does happen, but it's quite rare.

407
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,160
 This ghost goes the extra mile.

408
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,240
 She kills the criminals.

409
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,600
 And it's also interesting to note, if you realize who you're detail oriented, she only

410
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,400
 kills criminals who committed the crime that got her killed.

411
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,560
 So I imagine if you were kidnapping people, you shouldn't take them to this park.

412
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:31,040
 However, if you were like moving huge amounts of cocaine or you were a gun smuggler, she

413
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,160
 would be totally fine with that, right?

414
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,360
 She'd be totally fine with that.

415
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,800
 She only likes to kill kidnappers.

416
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,440
 This is a story that I looked into.

417
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,200
 Again, I found very, very few sources on it.

418
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,760
 In this neck of the woods, no pun intended, they have found bodies.

419
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,560
 People have been reported dead here.

420
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,040
 There was at least one woman who the authorities believe she killed herself, and then there

421
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,600
 were the bodies of two men at different times.

422
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,560
 And these are fairly recent, like 1990s forward that these three bodies showed up.

423
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,200
 That's all really I could find in a pretty cursory examination of this area.

424
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,800
 It's an 1800 acre park.

425
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,800
 I'm sure they've had their fair share of suicides and accidental deaths and possible

426
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,080
 murders and people being dropped off.

427
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
 But it's such an interesting story.

428
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:26,360
 A ghost who is not a recording, it's her actual soul as a spirit of vengeance, but only killing

429
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,440
 people who commit the crime that killed her is very, very odd.

430
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,480
 And then you'd have to wonder like, what's the definition of kidnapping?

431
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,360
 Does she make allowances?

432
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,920
 Like she's like, well, technically, they're simply human smuggling.

433
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,000
 The people started off coming willingly and now they're being taken under a boat and send

434
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 them out to Eastern Europe.

435
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,240
 I don't know how well she defines the term kidnapping, but fascinating story nonetheless.

436
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,480
 This is one of the stories that we don't know if it's true.

437
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,160
 It would be easy to test.

438
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,200
 It would not be legal to test, but it would be easy to test.

439
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,240
 Kidnap someone and take them out into the woods.

440
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,440
 However, if you're wrong, you're guilty of kidnapping a human and you'll probably go

441
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:19,960
 to prison and if you're right, you'll hear a little girl laughing as she's killing you.

442
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,440
 So they're both pretty bad options.

443
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,920
 And just to be clear, it would be a bad option if she wasn't laughing.

444
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,040
 If she was sobbing uncontrollably as she's killing you, that would be equally bad.

445
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,520
 It's not the laughing part that makes it dangerous.

446
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,400
 It's the death of the hands of a spirit.

447
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,360
 Sugoi have officially pronounced her name three different times.

448
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,320
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

449
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,520
 We are leaving behind this forest in Connecticut.

450
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,120
 Kidnappy free.

451
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
 We're not.

452
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,760
 No one's coming against their will.

453
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,920
 Fly us all the way out to Malaysia.

454
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,000
 Before we get this story started, I want to give a shout out to Dead Rabbit Radio Listener

455
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,120
 Virginia Pygare on Instagram.

456
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,600
 Virginia sent me over a Instagram story, a little Instagram video from someone known

457
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,640
 as Zack D Films.

458
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,080
 So I got most of my information from the Zack D Films account as well as an article written

459
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,760
 by Simon Perry for the Daily Mail.

460
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
 Super fascinating story.

461
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,120
 I'm shocked I had never heard of this.

462
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,960
 This is so bizarre.

463
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,200
 So thank you Virginia for sending this over.

464
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,480
 The year is 2017.

465
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,880
 We're in Malaysia.

466
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,720
 And there's a young woman, a single mother known as Siti Aisyah.

467
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
 Siti Aisyah.

468
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,880
 She's 25 years old and she grew up in a rural village in Indonesia.

469
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,560
 But like so many people, she dreamed of a better life.

470
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,280
 Specifically she dreamed of being rich and famous.

471
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,000
 She wanted the eyes of the world upon her.

472
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,760
 It's a very, very common desire, right?

473
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:16,840
 But reality doesn't always give us what we want, at least not in the way we expect it.

474
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:23,480
 By the time Siti is 25 years old, she finds herself working as a masseuse in Malaysia.

475
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,720
 And it's making ends meet.

476
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,960
 It's not a lot of money at all, but it's something.

477
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
 She's working as a masseuse.

478
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,040
 And through her job, she meets a taxi driver.

479
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,000
 And the taxi driver says, "Oh Siti, you're so beautiful.

480
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 You're so beautiful.

481
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,760
 What are you doing here in this massage parlor?

482
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,800
 It's such a waste of your obvious talents.

483
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,200
 You're too good looking for this job.

484
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,000
 You're too smart to simply sit here and be a masseuse.

485
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,920
 You should be on the front cover of magazines.

486
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
 You should be all over the world.

487
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,280
 You should have everything you've ever wanted."

488
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,760
 And Siti is listening to this taxi cab driver.

489
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,360
 She's probably thinking, "Well, I'd share it.

490
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
 Yeah, that'd be nice.

491
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,640
 But you're a taxi cab driver.

492
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,280
 What can you do for me?"

493
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,840
 Taxi cab driver goes, "I actually know a television producer.

494
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,760
 I'm driving taxi, but I meet people from all over.

495
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,560
 Rich people take the taxi too.

496
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,080
 And I know a television producer and he is actually looking for a drop dead gorgeous woman,

497
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,120
 just like you, for his next project.

498
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,840
 Would you like me to put you in touch with him?"

499
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,880
 Siti, like most of us would, she jumps at the opportunity, right?

500
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,200
 She's just been giving back rubs.

501
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,640
 I don't know what type of massage parlor it was, but either way, she's been rubbing down

502
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,080
 greasy men night after night.

503
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,440
 She goes, "Yeah, yeah, sure.

504
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,000
 That'd be great.

505
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,880
 Go ahead and put me in touch with that television producer."

506
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,600
 And then the taxi cab driver goes, "But finish giving me my back rub.

507
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,240
 Then I'll do it."

508
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,000
 She eventually gets put in touch with this television producer from Japan named James.

509
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,120
 And James is talking to Siti and he goes, "Listen, I generally do television, but we

510
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,600
 know that YouTube is the future and I'm working on this new project.

511
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,320
 It's going to be a hidden camera prank show.

512
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,760
 Those are all the rage right now.

513
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
 These hidden camera pranks.

514
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,960
 It's going to be super easy.

515
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,720
 All I need you to do is help me pull these pranks.

516
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,640
 I'm going to be hidden with my phone and I'm going to be recording these things.

517
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,000
 We're going to post them on YouTube.

518
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,160
 It'll go viral.

519
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,360
 You will go viral.

520
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,160
 Are you in or are you out?"

521
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
 And Siti goes, "Oh yeah, I know.

522
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
 I'm totally do that.

523
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,320
 That would be awesome.

524
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,880
 This is the first step to me actually getting out of this crummy massage business, making

525
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
 it big."

526
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,360
 So they meet up at this location.

527
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,560
 Generally they did this at restaurants and outdoor cafes and things like that.

528
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,560
 There so often they would actually do it at the local international airport, but the setup

529
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,000
 was always the same.

530
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,480
 Siti would show up and this television producer, James, would squirt baby oil into her hands.

531
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,880
 And he would go, "I want you to walk up to a random businessman and smear the baby oil

532
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,640
 on his face and then leave.

533
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
 You can run away.

534
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
 You can apologize.

535
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,400
 I don't want to do it, but don't stick around for too long."

536
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
 And I'm going to record it.

537
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
 It'll be hilarious.

538
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,840
 It'll be this super funny prank.

539
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,880
 And Siti's like, "Okay, I don't know if I'd say it was super funny, but it could be amusing."

540
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,200
 So James sprays baby oil on Siti's hands and she walks up to a random dude and smears

541
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:43,280
 it all over his face and then stands there and apologizes briefly and then runs away.

542
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,800
 James is filming this the whole time.

543
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,320
 And on her first time doing this, she did it to three different guys in this kind of

544
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,440
 open, common, public area.

545
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
 She's walking around.

546
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,560
 She's smearing this baby oil on these guys' faces and she's getting paid good money to

547
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,160
 do this, right?

548
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,800
 She's getting paid good money to actually do this.

549
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 So it's worth it.

550
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,160
 Nothing bad has happened.

551
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
 No one's beating her up.

552
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,720
 I mean, at the end of the day, it's baby oil.

553
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,520
 There's this beautiful young woman standing in front of you and being like, "Oh, I'm so

554
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
 sorry.

555
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
 I'm so sorry."

556
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 And whatever.

557
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,200
 And maybe you recognize her from the massage parlor and you're like, "Hey, Siti, see you

558
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
 later tonight.

559
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,520
 Save that baby oil."

560
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,960
 This goes on for a couple weeks.

561
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,320
 They're shooting these prank videos.

562
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:38,520
 Well now it's February 2017 and she gets a call from James and goes, "Okay, we're going

563
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,080
 to do another one of these pranks.

564
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,880
 Meet us down at the International Airport."

565
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,840
 They've done the prank here before.

566
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
 Not a big deal.

567
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,560
 It's the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia.

568
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
 And she shows up.

569
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,920
 Siti shows up and this time there's another woman is there as well named Duong Fee Huong

570
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,480
 who is another young woman.

571
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,160
 And James goes, "Okay, here we go, guys.

572
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,680
 We're going to do another one of these pranks."

573
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,360
 But this time, we're going to have both of you.

574
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
 It's going to be super funny.

575
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,360
 We're going to have both of you.

576
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,800
 We're going to put this baby oil on your hands.

577
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,320
 You guys have both done this several times.

578
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,160
 This isn't your first rodeo.

579
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:18,160
 This time it's going to be extra funny because I'm actually going to point somebody out

580
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,640
 and it's my boss.

581
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,880
 This has been a side project who we've been working on and it's going to be hilarious.

582
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,360
 Now we're going to have both of you come from different angles and smear this baby oil on

583
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
 his face.

584
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,160
 It's going to be hilarious, but I'm telling you right now, my boss dude, he is not going

585
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
 to be happy.

586
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,680
 He doesn't have any funny bones at all in his body.

587
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,360
 He's going to actually be really, really upset when he do this to my boss.

588
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,960
 So when you do this, just leave right away.

589
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
 Don't stop.

590
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,680
 Don't apologize or anything like that.

591
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,880
 I'll make it up to him later.

592
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,760
 It'll be hilarious.

593
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,920
 So the girls are like, "Yeah, no, that'll be awesome.

594
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
 This will be fun."

595
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,120
 I mean, it's fun as rubbing baby oil on someone's face, but they're getting paid.

596
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,480
 They've been getting paid.

597
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,400
 So James once again takes out the baby oil bottle and sprays some baby oil into Duong's

598
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:15,480
 hands, and then he sprays some baby oil into Siti's hands and says, "That's the guy right

599
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
 there.

600
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
 You see him right there?"

601
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,040
 And the two girls turn and they look and they see James's boss and they head off from two

602
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,480
 different angles.

603
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,000
 And they walk up to this guy and they smear baby oil all over his face.

604
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,400
 And the two young girls turn and walk in opposite directions.

605
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,640
 It's perfect.

606
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,000
 It was exactly what James was looking for as he was videotaping this.

607
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,240
 Siti, after she walked away, she went into the women's restroom and washed her hands

608
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,840
 off.

609
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,440
 And in another part of the airport, Duong is doing the same thing.

610
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,640
 She walked right into the women's restroom, washed her hands off.

611
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,120
 The baby oil prank is done.

612
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,880
 But that wasn't James's boss.

613
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,520
 James didn't know him, though.

614
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,280
 He did pick him out for a purpose.

615
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:15,080
 The man that just had baby oil rubbed on his face inside this international airport, his

616
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,280
 name Kim Jong Nam.

617
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:31,320
 Kim Jong Un's half brother and rightful heir as ruler of North Korea.

618
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,400
 He was the older son of Kim Jong Il.

619
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,880
 But when he deeply embarrassed the family, he was pretty much exiled from North Korea,

620
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,840
 where he became an open critic of the totalitarian regime of his father and now his brother Kim

621
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,680
 Jong Un.

622
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,080
 Kim Jong Nam had just had baby oil wiped on his face.

623
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,520
 But as he was being led away by security, because he was furious that this happened to him,

624
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,960
 he's being led away by security, he's actually being taken into a little medical center inside

625
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:18,640
 this international hospital, his breathing becomes heavy, and then it stops completely.

626
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,440
 Kim Jong Nam was not covered in baby oil.

627
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:32,120
 He was covered in a nerve agent called VX, which is considered a weapon of mass destruction.

628
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,840
 It causes your muscles to become paralyzed.

629
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,000
 You suffocate to death.

630
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,880
 This assassination was months in the planning.

631
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:52,240
 They had been trying to find Kim Jong Un and I say they, obviously people blamed this on

632
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
 North Korea.

633
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,520
 But North Korea has always denied this.

634
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,000
 They said they had nothing to do with this and they really said that Kim Jong Un's brother

635
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,680
 died.

636
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,040
 The two girls were pretty quickly arrested.

637
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,240
 I think it was maybe three days where these two girls were tracked down because this was

638
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,520
 all caught on video.

639
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,240
 You can see the surveillance video.

640
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,600
 I was watching that.

641
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,000
 There's a final photo of Kim Jong Nam.

642
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,720
 He's sitting in a chair in this little medical center and it's just like a cheap plastic

643
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,320
 chair and he's completely slumped back in it.

644
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,720
 He's suffocating.

645
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,800
 You're looking at the photo of a man who's sitting in a chair who can't breathe.

646
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,360
 His lungs have been paralyzed.

647
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,880
 Brain is still active, but he can't draw in a breath.

648
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,000
 His lungs aren't working.

649
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,440
 They arrest these two young women and they go, "What are you talking about?"

650
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,480
 It was just a prank, bro.

651
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
 Literally.

652
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,360
 We've been doing this for weeks.

653
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,520
 We've been doing this all over.

654
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,920
 They're like, "Wait, what are we?"

655
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
 What are you talking about?

656
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,960
 So, the baby oil thing.

657
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,120
 We've been getting paid to put baby oil on various people's faces.

658
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,320
 It's for a YouTube channel.

659
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,320
 The fact that it didn't kill the two girls, at first investigators thought maybe one person

660
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,480
 had the V and the other person had the X.

661
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,960
 When they put them together, it happened.

662
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,360
 No, it turns out that both of these young women, as unbelievable as it sounds, both

663
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,880
 had VX nerve agent rubbed on their hands.

664
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,600
 The authorities say, "How did they not wash their hands off immediately?"

665
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,080
 They would have died as well.

666
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,960
 They would have killed them.

667
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,760
 The fact that they both walked into the bathroom to wash their hands off was nothing short

668
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,760
 of a miracle, but you're also under arrest.

669
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,840
 We don't believe you that this was a prank.

670
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,600
 We think that you were part of this.

671
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,080
 They're actually arrested and they were being told to give up the rest of their assassination

672
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,160
 squad and they're like, "You mean James?

673
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,760
 You mean the television producer?

674
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,840
 This is all the information I have from them."

675
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,600
 Nobody else was ever arrested for this.

676
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,480
 Taxicab driver disappeared.

677
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,960
 James, the television producer, disappeared.

678
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,160
 There were some other people they met during this because they were doing some of these

679
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,000
 operations in Indonesia, some of them in Malaysia.

680
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,880
 They traveled a bit.

681
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
 Everyone disappeared.

682
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,840
 And to this day, the only people arrested for it were those two young women.

683
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,080
 Eventually, it was about two years.

684
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,360
 They were in prison for about two years because nobody believed them.

685
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,480
 The first year, both these girls were in solitary confinement.

686
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,040
 They were trying to get them to break and give up the rest of their assassination squad.

687
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:41,920
 But eventually, I think they realized, no, these girls were duped into killing a possible

688
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
 world leader.

689
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,760
 See, that was a thing like he was supposed to be in charge of North Korea.

690
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,440
 I said he was embarrassed, he embarrassed the regime earlier.

691
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
 That what he did.

692
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,480
 This is so ridiculous.

693
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,560
 Even you are the oldest son of a world dictator, right?

694
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,960
 One of the last rogue nations on the planet.

695
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:09,680
 Kim Jong-nam's great sin was he got arrested with a fake passport trying to take his family

696
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,520
 to Tokyo Disneyland.

697
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,720
 That embarrassed his father, Kim Jong-il, so much he disowned him pretty much.

698
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,080
 He was like, you're not going to be heir to the throne.

699
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
 You're going to be over Disneyland, right?

700
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,640
 Over Disneyland.

701
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,280
 At the same time, Kim Jong-nam was openly a critic of the regime even when his dad was

702
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
 in power.

703
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,600
 So I'm sure that didn't help anything.

704
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
 He was basically doing that.

705
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,000
 He's like, my dad won't let me go to Disneyland.

706
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Totalitarianism sucks.

707
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,080
 People are like, well, that's kind of a weird reason why you want to shut down an entire

708
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
 country.

709
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,960
 But he was supposed to be the president or the supreme ruler, supreme leader of North

710
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,800
 Korea and instead his younger brother, Kim Jong-un, rose to power.

711
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,760
 But the fact that Kim Jong-nam was still out there running around openly criticizing the

712
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,360
 government, it wasn't a good look.

713
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,280
 It wasn't a good look for the North Korean leadership.

714
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,000
 So they eventually had him taken out.

715
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,600
 In what must be one of the most bizarre assassinations on record, I'm surprised I had never heard

716
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
 of this.

717
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,920
 It's so recent.

718
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,440
 Maybe I saw a headline at some point.

719
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
 I don't know.

720
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,840
 This is so bizarre and it would work.

721
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,800
 That's what makes it so terrifying.

722
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,440
 It obviously worked on this guy, but that is the way to pull it off.

723
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,760
 You dupe people into doing this.

724
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,080
 And nowadays I feel like that is such an easy thing to do because you could tell someone,

725
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,400
 you want to be rich and famous, we're going to do these.

726
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,160
 I mean, I couldn't have planned it any better than these guys.

727
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,840
 I mean, I don't give a lot of props to North Korea.

728
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,840
 Although I did do an entire week of North Korean episodes, but you got to give hats off

729
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
 to these guys.

730
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,680
 I mean, I want to shake their hand, but you can definitely tip your hat to them.

731
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,760
 You got people to think it was just a prank and they had done it.

732
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,960
 They had basically done trial runs this whole time and it worked.

733
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,640
 Each time you could sneak up to, you not even really sneak up, you're in a crowded area,

734
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,200
 especially beautiful women walking toward you.

735
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:17,320
 Your guard's going to be down and they smear this VX nerve agent all over you.

736
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,480
 And it's interesting because you couldn't have had one of your own agents do it just

737
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,760
 because the VX was so dangerous, you'd have to wear gloves and you want to want to be

738
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
 caught on camera.

739
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,320
 Like you could have it totally set up.

740
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,440
 I can't think of it.

741
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,320
 I can't think of a better way to do this.

742
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:39,720
 And you're using people's own desire for fortune and fame to push them forward.

743
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,120
 You didn't have to bring them in on the plot.

744
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,160
 You didn't have to whip them up into a frenzy about what a horrible guy this was.

745
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,720
 You didn't have to do any of the brainwashing.

746
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,600
 You didn't have to do any of the forming this guerrilla unit and training people and making

747
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,440
 them hate the enemy so much.

748
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,640
 They'd be willing to put their lives at risk.

749
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,840
 They'd be willing to kill civilians.

750
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,360
 That's been the template really forever.

751
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,280
 And then you go, and now we're going to go out and we're going to go out and we're going

752
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,000
 to kill this political leader and we're going to take the bombs to the streets and da da

753
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 da da.

754
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 That's how it used to be.

755
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,880
 Now you can just be like, hey, you want to be on a prank video?

756
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,640
 I'm going to give you this backpack.

757
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,960
 And somewhere in this crowd, there will be a backpack that looks like it.

758
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,560
 And you replace it and get back here.

759
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,160
 That's the prank.

760
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,720
 Inside your backpack, it's full of cockroaches.

761
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
 Don't look.

762
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,400
 If you hear any ticking, that's the cockroaches' legs rubbing up against each other.

763
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,000
 You go and you replace this backpack somewhere in that food court.

764
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,360
 It's a backpack that looks just like it.

765
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
 Go!

766
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
 And you're running through the food court.

767
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,080
 I guess that would be super suspicious.

768
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
 You're all sweaty.

769
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
 You're running.

770
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,960
 You're like, Mr. Beast, Mr. Beast, am I almost there?

771
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,520
 Am I almost there?

772
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,920
 I guess they probably go and also don't run.

773
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
 Don't run.

774
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,480
 Don't yell the name out of my YouTube channel or anything like that.

775
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,400
 You got to be slick.

776
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,960
 And then you're walking away with a backpack full of all these secret documents.

777
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,800
 The guy sitting over there with a bomb now.

778
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,920
 That's the best case scenario.

779
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:19,320
 Worst case scenario is it is full of cockroaches, but it's fantastic.

780
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
 It's fantastic.

781
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,280
 Like on a purely technical level, it works.

782
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,880
 And I could totally see this happening again.

783
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,200
 I could totally see, instead of the guy with the rifle in the clock tower, which you have

784
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,040
 to train how to use that type of rifle.

785
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,080
 How to make sure that you are able to sneak by security.

786
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,520
 Do you even have the cardio to walk up that many flights of stairs?

787
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,480
 These are all questions that are unnecessary to answer if you can frame it as a prank.

788
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,360
 Instead of putting someone in the clock tower with a rifle, you could just say, we got this

789
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,560
 new prank.

790
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,560
 This prank is called running up to the president with two loaded shotguns.

791
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,640
 I mean, but they're squirt guns.

792
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,640
 Don't worry about it, son.

793
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
 They're squirt guns.

794
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,080
 They're super chokers and they're filled with sulfuric acid.

795
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,320
 I guess that one would be pretty easy to stop.

796
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,960
 One, the squirt guns would pretty much melt, but let's say they didn't.

797
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,480
 I think the secret survey, if you're running up to the president, if you're running up

798
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,960
 to the president screaming, Mr. Beast, you're giving the channel introduction and you're

799
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
 holding anything.

800
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
 You could be holding two bananas.

801
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,000
 I think the secret service is going to stop you.

802
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 But what are they going to do?

803
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,520
 It's going to be a bunch of sulfuric acid right in their face.

804
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,960
 They're like, ah, ah, and the president will be like, no.

805
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,760
 You could totally do this.

806
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,000
 You could totally do that.

807
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 I'm not saying you should.

808
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,160
 Just so we're clear.

809
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,720
 Just so we're clear government agents.

810
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,240
 I'm not saying you should.

811
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:55,720
 I'm saying this will be the future of political assassinations or even like business assassinations,

812
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,600
 corporate espionage, all of that.

813
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,560
 Instead of trying to get someone who is highly trained to do the job, just get somebody who

814
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,760
 wants to be famous and trick them into killing people.

815
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,280
 It would have taken years to get these two young women to the point where they actually

816
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,840
 wanted to take a human life and they hated this guy so much they are willing to possibly

817
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,780
 sacrifice their own lives and the lives of others to martyr themselves to take out this

818
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,520
 contender to the throne.

819
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:36,320
 But in a couple weeks, in just a couple weeks, these two young women were turned into assassins.

820
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,800
 Totally against their knowledge.

821
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,800
 Totally against their will.

822
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,800
 They never would have done it.

823
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,640
 No matter how much money you gave them to say, hey, we're going to put this VX nerve agent

824
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,640
 on your hands.

825
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,080
 They'd be like, no, I'm done.

826
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
 It's just a fascinating story.

827
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,640
 I'm surprised I never heard of it.

828
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,880
 A prank that turned into a murder.

829
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,680
 But if anything, this may be a one of a kind event now, but in the future, I feel like this

830
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:08,840
 type of action will be much more common because it's so easy to do.

831
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,560
 And that's the scary part.

832
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,760
 There's a very, very, very small group of people who you can brainwash into killing

833
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,320
 other people, even civilians for the greater good.

834
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:35,160
 But nearly everybody would do anything to go viral, even if that means smearing a virus

835
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:44,520
