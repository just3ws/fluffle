1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,680
 Mental health parity is the law requiring health insurance coverage for mental health

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,480
 or substance use disorders that is no more restrictive than your physical health coverage.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,600
 That means if you're dealing with depression or anxiety, your access to mental health coverage

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,560
 is comparable to your access to physical health coverage for a broken arm or leg.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,900
 It's important to learn and understand the laws that protect you when you use your health

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,480
 insurance for treatment.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
 Know your rights.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,400
 Go to GetCoveredIllinois.gov for more information on mental health parity.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,720
 An island that can make Mexico richer goes missing?

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,360
 And then we delve back into the vault of Jason Carpenter's personal stories where I tell

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:50,080
 you the one about me, the Scientologist girl, and possibly seeing proof of an afterlife today

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,400
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:02,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
 I'm having a great day.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,160
 I hope you're having a great day too.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,680
 So we're going to go ahead and jump right into this.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,160
 This is the Friday episode.

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,400
 This is the episode before the weekend.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,840
 I guess that's kind of implied by the Friday episode part.

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,680
 I hope you guys have a great weekend, but we've got some good stuff for you here today.

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,120
 Now the first story is actually from the conspiracy iceberg.

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,360
 It's about middle tier.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,320
 And again, a lot of stuff in the middle tier, there's definitely something behind it.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
 It's not just word soup.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,960
 I've come to the conclusion now that I think most of them do have something connected to

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,400
 it, even if it's kind of lame.

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,920
 But this one's really interesting.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,360
 So this is on the conspiracy iceberg and it's listed as Isle Bermeja.

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
 Bermeja?

32
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
 Bermeja?

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
 It's in Mexico.

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,760
 So I think the J is an H and I think the Isle is probably even spelled differently.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,920
 Here I have it written down as Isla.

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
 So what is that?

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
 Isla Bermeja?

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
 Okay.

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,000
 Isla Bermeja.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,800
 The beautiful Mexican island.

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,640
 Now it doesn't exist.

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,920
 And this is where the controversy comes from because this island, which is called the Isle

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,680
 from here on out to spare you guys me saying the name over and over again, the Isle that

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,360
 is listed on the map, which is on tons of maps over the course of 200 years that originally

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
 it shows up on maps as early as the 1500s.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,640
 But around the time of the 1700s doesn't show up on maps anymore.

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,720
 So the reason why this is important to Mexico is because this island is farther off the

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,840
 coast and it allows Mexico to expand its borders.

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,040
 The reason why that's important is because Gulf of Mexico has massive oil reserves and

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,120
 the far, I think it's like a two, you have up to 200 miles from your furthest border

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,920
 to where you can drill for oil.

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,880
 That was a treaty that America and Mexico came up with.

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,600
 So if they can say, well, this island is 43 miles away from the Yucatan, they've now

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,760
 extended their oil drilling range 43 miles.

55
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,960
 And then America goes, what island?

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,800
 I point to the map.

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,480
 They go this one and they're like, dude, that map is turning to dust.

58
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
 You can't even touch it.

59
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,920
 They're wearing those special gloves and we're in a room that has nothing but UV light.

60
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,520
 Show me a modern map that has this island on it.

61
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,000
 And they're like, uh, okay, be right back.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
 They've been searching for this island for a while now.

63
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,000
 I think it really became an issue because what happened was it's not on modern maps,

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
 but it's on the older maps.

65
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,400
 And in Mexico and the Mexican government, when they were looking at the oil rights and stuff

66
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,600
 like that, some historian or someone came to them and says, hey, there's this island

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,880
 that allows us to push off further.

68
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,280
 Maybe we should just get photographs of the island and we can extend our borders.

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,440
 So they started sending out planes and boats and stuff like that and they can't find the

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,960
 island and they're going off of these old timing maps.

71
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,960
 They're like in the boat and they're holding it and it's like in plexiglass and they're

72
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,040
 just like scanning it, covering it up with an umbrella.

73
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,680
 So the sunlight doesn't hit it and they're like, dude, we could have just taken a photocopy.

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
 Shut up.

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,680
 Try not to get it wet, this 300 year old map.

76
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,640
 But they can't find it.

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,040
 And America says it doesn't exist.

78
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,000
 America actually says it never existed and we'll get to that in a second.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,440
 But the Mexican government is still trying to find this island because again, it's worth

80
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,840
 a lot of money if they do.

81
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,160
 So these are the theories.

82
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,920
 The first off that the island existed at one point, there was a massive earthquake and

83
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
 it fell apart.

84
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,880
 Just like a cookie.

85
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,160
 Crumbles like a cookie into the ocean.

86
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,360
 That's the end of it.

87
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,400
 The other one that I saw was global warming.

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,880
 And then the other theory that Mexico has is that the dastardly government of the United

89
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
 States of America bombed the island out of existence.

90
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,960
 Now that's a popular conspiracy theory among the people who are looking into this.

91
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,840
 That the island existed in America just blew it up.

92
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,760
 The pushback on that and other researchers have said this because a lot of time and money

93
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,280
 is even though like this is a very obscure conspiracy theory for most people, a lot of

94
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,240
 time and money have been put into finding this island because it's worth millions of

95
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,160
 dollars if they can prove it exists.

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,000
 The pushback to America blowing it up, they'd say well, they could have, but they would

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,360
 have had to do it fairly recently.

98
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,320
 So for them to be able to blow up an island without the government of Mexico knowing would

99
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,840
 be kind of hard to pull off.

100
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,920
 It'd be kind of hard to pull off.

101
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,480
 So what could it actually be?

102
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,960
 Did the island actually existed sometime and it was destroyed or that it was destroyed

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,880
 naturally or was destroyed by the US government?

104
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,240
 Is it some sort of bizarre Mandela effect where everybody doesn't remember the island

105
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
 being there except the Mexican government?

106
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,680
 Is this there?

107
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,600
 Is this Mexico's Berenstein Bears incident?

108
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,360
 What's interesting is when I was reading about this, there is a very kind of mundane answer

109
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,520
 to this, but it's weird because it opens up another can of worms.

110
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,040
 One of the theories is that the island did never exist at any point in time and the reason

111
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,000
 why it was written on the maps was to confuse your enemies.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,800
 If they saw a little island in the corner of your map, they could go, oh, we could land

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,080
 there, we could drop troops or we could put spies there or this is where they'll have

114
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,160
 that and then the island doesn't exist at all.

115
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,000
 They said there was actually common for cartographers.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,200
 You're surprised I could pronounce that word.

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,920
 People were saying that back then cartographers would actually make fake places, make fake

118
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,680
 islands, make fake ravines or whatever to confuse your enemies.

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,800
 Now it's not really helpful if all you have, if you're lost at sea and all you have is

120
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
 a map and you think you're, oh man, I'm almost there and then there's nothing there, but

121
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,200
 for the most part the maps would actually work in deceiving other people, other governments,

122
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,480
 not your stranded sailors but other people where your territory was.

123
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,680
 And what's interesting about it is we actually still do that today in the most common way,

124
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,160
 but for a different reason.

125
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,920
 You ever see those like Rand McNally maps and they also have those books, I remember

126
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,880
 when I was a pizza delivery driver, we had those books of maps and I don't know if GPS

127
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,320
 people do it but I'm pretty sure they do it as well.

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,600
 They put fake roads in their maps.

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,560
 I know for certain that the printed map books have fake roads in them and I'm pretty sure

130
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,440
 GPS also will insert a fake road here and there and the answer is really simple, why?

131
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,040
 It's copyright protection.

132
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,560
 Maps themselves, geographical locations cannot have a copyright on them.

133
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,040
 And what was happening was people were, companies were putting all this time and money into

134
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,240
 creating these maps of local areas and then another company would simply, not like photocopy,

135
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,200
 the copy, they didn't just run it off on a black and white Xerox but they were copying

136
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,680
 the maps and then releasing them saying, oh no, this is my book and I didn't put any

137
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,840
 of the money into building the map in the first place.

138
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,680
 So map companies started putting in fake roads, fake courts, little areas that don't exist

139
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,880
 that you wouldn't notice at all if you lived in that neighborhood but the person who made

140
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,920
 the map would go, that's not, that is a fake street, I made that street up.

141
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,000
 That street doesn't exist.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,360
 But let's put those two things together now.

143
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,120
 We know that we do it today for copyright reasons, they put in fake streets and I think

144
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,840
 the reason why they still do that with GPS software, because it's the same problem.

145
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,600
 Someone could just take all the data from one GPS company and put it in another.

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,000
 A map company is what I mean, not necessarily a GPS but you know they have like the Google

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,080
 Maps and stuff like that.

148
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,200
 Those fake roads that are there, I imagine it playing out like this in this weird sort

149
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
 of way.

150
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,800
 A man has a house on a street.

151
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,840
 He's lived there all of his life.

152
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,720
 He goes to work, raises his kids, all of that stuff.

153
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,320
 And then one day he realizes that the street that he spent his entire life living on doesn't

154
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
 exist.

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,020
 It never existed.

156
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:04,240
 It was a little line drawn by a map maker for copyright protection.

157
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,880
 How would you reconcile that?

158
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,520
 He would have proof in the form of a map saying, no, my street is here.

159
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,640
 I mean I know this gets into horror movie territory but is it possible that by just

160
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,080
 through the power of thought and will, by drawing this map and putting this little island on

161
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,480
 here that so many people are searching for, that's never been found and never been recorded

162
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,040
 being cited other than on those maps, is it possible that someday that island will be

163
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,360
 found and there will be people on it who wondered, what are you guys so worried about?

164
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
 We've always been here.

165
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,200
 We went to Mexico all the time and we met you.

166
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,600
 Why are you guys looking so confused?

167
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,360
 Now of course, horror movie scenario.

168
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,160
 Twilight zone-ish.

169
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,000
 But I think when you start messing with reality like that, when you start putting stuff into

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,520
 reality that shouldn't be there, that's not supposed to be there for simple reasons, who

171
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,760
 knows what can result from that?

172
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
 Who knows what can result from that?

173
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

174
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,480
 Now our next story also has a bit to do with the power of the mind.

175
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,680
 So for our next story, like I said, we're going to go back into the vault of my personal

176
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
 experiences.

177
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,320
 This one's always been a little weird to me and I've never known really where to place

178
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,680
 it in the Partheon of, is it Partheon or Pantheon?

179
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,760
 Anyways, in the big building of Jason experiences.

180
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,720
 But a little way to begin it.

181
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,760
 So my dad was a Southern Baptist minister as I was growing up.

182
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,840
 And he was also going to college to be a minister as well.

183
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,480
 So it's like you can preach at individual churches, but like for the Southern Baptist,

184
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
 there was like you got ordained and then you could do this whole college thing.

185
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
 So he had to learn like Latin and Greek and Hebrew.

186
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
 He was got fluent in that.

187
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,200
 He had to learn all about biblical history and philosophy and counseling and stuff like

188
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
 that.

189
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,040
 He had to go on and get his bachelor's degree and his doctorate and all that stuff.

190
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,720
 But at the time, I was about seven years old in the story, so that's going to place us

191
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,040
 around 1983, 1984.

192
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,840
 My dad was also a chaplain because he was preaching at a church.

193
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,040
 He was going to school and you still, ministers don't make a lot of money.

194
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,280
 He also had a job working at a hospital as a chaplain.

195
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:31,000
 Now I remember once when I was a kid, my dad said, "Hey, Jason, come with me to this thing

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 I got to do at the hospital."

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,640
 And I don't remember why.

198
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,200
 I don't know if we didn't have a babysitter or what was going on.

199
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
 But for whatever reason, I go with my dad.

200
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
 Maybe I just want to spend time with my dad.

201
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,840
 Me and my dad, he was a big sports guy.

202
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,600
 He did really into sports and I wasn't.

203
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,840
 So it was maybe he was a bonding, it was definitely a bonding experience.

204
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,520
 So we, he takes me to the hospital and he's like, "Here, go in this room with this nice

205
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,680
 doctor and he'll put on this snuggly coat for you."

206
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,840
 And I'm like, "No, daddy, no."

207
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
 He's like, "Luck him in."

208
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
 But no, no, no.

209
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,520
 So he takes me to the hospital.

210
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,800
 And I don't remember the exact sequence of events of how he got here.

211
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,800
 I do remember being a little kid and basically to jump to where this, because I'm not going

212
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,160
 to say, "And then I went to a vending machine."

213
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
 "Mmm, that soda sure was good."

214
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
 "Coke classic."

215
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,440
 Like, I mean, it was a bunch of mundane stuff.

216
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,680
 But the way it happens is I end up in a room, my dad is there, giving, not giving last rights

217
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,720
 because that's not what Southern Baptists do, but he was basically counseling this man

218
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
 who was dying.

219
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,600
 And he was like in hospice for a while and stuff like that.

220
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 And the man's family was there.

221
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,080
 And I don't know what he was dying of, but it was something that they could predict and

222
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,560
 he was basically, it was his last night on earth.

223
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,920
 And I remember I was standing in the room, this little chubby boy, and there was probably

224
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,040
 maybe like eight or nine other people in there that are his family members plus my father.

225
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,960
 And I was the youngest.

226
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
 Everyone else was an adult.

227
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,320
 The man who was dying was much, much older, so his kids were all older, things like that.

228
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,720
 And so I remember at one point my dad says, "I'm gonna have some private words with him."

229
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,500
 So if you, everyone could step out for a second.

230
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,920
 So we all kind of shuffled out into the hallway of the hospital.

231
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
 And I'm standing out there in the hallway and everyone's just kind of milling about

232
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
 talking.

233
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,840
 And I remember specifically, this is where my memory really picks up.

234
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,160
 I'm leaning against the wall of the hallway.

235
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,680
 And standing next to me is his adult son, who was probably around my age, maybe a little

236
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,520
 younger now.

237
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,200
 So he might have been like late 30s, early 40s, maybe.

238
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,040
 I didn't ask him for his ID, but I'm sitting there, I'm standing there with my back against

239
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
 the wall and he's standing there, a back against the wall too.

240
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,080
 And basically we were both sons.

241
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,440
 We were both sons there with our father.

242
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,040
 And we start chit chatting.

243
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,320
 Just, you know, did you watch Transformers?

244
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,640
 No, I don't know exactly what we were talking about, but it was just like a casual conversation

245
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,320
 in the midst of what was going on.

246
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,720
 That went on for a couple minutes and then my dad came out of the hospital room and he

247
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,280
 goes, "It's time."

248
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,040
 And everyone shuffles back in and I stay exactly where I'm standing with my back against the

249
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
 wall.

250
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,280
 And my dad goes, he pokes his head back out of the hospital room and goes, "I want you

251
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,640
 to see this."

252
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,160
 So he leads me in the hospital room.

253
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,560
 They shut the door and there I am, seven years old, watching this family sob around a man

254
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,000
 I never met before and him just going, "It's okay.

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 It's okay.

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,240
 I'm going to heaven, guys.

257
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
 I'll see you there.

258
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,040
 Don't cry.

259
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
 It's okay.

260
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,880
 It's okay."

261
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,440
 So that was the first time I'd ever seen anybody die, but it wasn't the last.

262
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,080
 And the story I'm about to tell you wasn't the last either, but it leads into an interesting

263
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,800
 event.

264
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,360
 So now we're going to jump ahead.

265
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,440
 I believe in this story, I think probably like 19 or 20, 19 or 20.

266
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,960
 I used to gasoline was like 99 cents a gallon.

267
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,640
 So I love being alone.

268
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
 I love solitude.

269
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,240
 I believe there's a reason why every major religion and most philosophies give great

270
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,280
 weight to isolation and being alone.

271
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,200
 So many of them, when their great leaders go out to discover these things, they walk

272
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,440
 into the wilderness by themselves.

273
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,640
 There is something very, very powerful about being alone which humans don't like and makes

274
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
 them nervous.

275
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,280
 We're a social species, so when we are removed from the group it makes us nervous, but I

276
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
 love it.

277
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,360
 I love being alone.

278
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,560
 Gasoline was 99 cents a gallon.

279
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,120
 I used to just fill up my gas tank and drive around Sacramento three, four hours a night.

280
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,560
 I loved it.

281
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,760
 I was driving down Hazel Avenue.

282
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,400
 If you know the area, if you don't, that's fine, but if you want to reconstruct the events

283
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
 this night.

284
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
 I was driving down Hazel Avenue.

285
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,400
 I was going through leaving Citrus Heights, going through Gold River and was headed towards

286
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
 Rancho Cordova.

287
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,760
 There was just straight shot and it's all suburban areas out here.

288
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,760
 It was probably like two in the morning.

289
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,280
 I'm driving down the road.

290
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:23,120
 I see smoke in the middle of an island that's separating northbound and southbound.

291
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,640
 If you've ever come across the car accident, it doesn't look like ordinary smoke.

292
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:33,760
 It almost has this weird, it doesn't look like billowing smoke out of a house.

293
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,440
 It's basically this weird mixture of maybe steam or when an airbag goes off it gives

294
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,360
 off this big like, "pffft," like this powder type thing.

295
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,000
 But I'm driving down the road and I see basically it's almost like a mist type of thing unless

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,320
 the car is straight up on fire.

297
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,240
 Driving down the road, I see a car that is facing sideways.

298
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,440
 So the headlights are headed towards the northbound side and the tail end is headed towards the

299
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,120
 southbound side and the car is impacted into a tree on the island.

300
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,280
 This is before a lot of people had cell phones.

301
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,840
 I definitely didn't have one.

302
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,880
 I pull over.

303
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,920
 I hop out of my car.

304
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,400
 At that point, there are two other people there.

305
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,920
 It's dead at night.

306
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
 Pull over.

307
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,720
 I hop out of my car to see if I can help anybody.

308
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,280
 I'm walking up to the car.

309
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,840
 It's this black, sporty car, maybe a Honda or something like that.

310
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,720
 I walk, I see two people over by the driver's side and they're talking to the driver.

311
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
 And the car, the front end is just mashed.

312
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,680
 So what happens, they were coming down, looked and then they jumped onto the island, hit the

313
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,360
 tree and then spun a bit.

314
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,800
 And that's why it was facing weird.

315
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,560
 I see two people talking to the driver and so I'm walking around to check on the passenger.

316
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,600
 And as I'm walking over there, I can hear the driver going, "Oh my God, I can't move.

317
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
 I can't move.

318
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,120
 I can't move."

319
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,160
 Screaming.

320
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,200
 And I walk over there and the two people in the car, there are two young women, probably

321
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,640
 younger than, older than I was then, but younger than I am now.

322
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:10,800
 I would assume, I would say maybe like 26, 27, somewhere around there, mid-20s.

323
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,720
 I get to the passenger side and I look and I can see the driver and she is just, her

324
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,800
 head, her body is, she's still sitting up, she still has a seatbelt on so she's not

325
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,960
 slumped over, but she's not moving her arms.

326
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,600
 She's just screaming at the top of her lungs, "I can't move.

327
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,720
 I can't move."

328
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,160
 I had more pressing concerns because she's screaming.

329
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,040
 She has two people trying to calm her down.

330
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,880
 They can't touch her because they don't know what happened.

331
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,800
 The car is not on fire so it's not a rush.

332
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,360
 I think one of them ran off to go get a pay phone to call the inevitable ambulance that's

333
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,800
 coming, but I'm standing now at the passenger seat and I'm looking in and there is a young

334
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,840
 woman, both women dressed up for the clubs, out having a good time, hair done up, everything

335
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,200
 like that.

336
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,400
 I'm looking at the woman in the passenger seat and her head, she's looking at me.

337
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,680
 Her head is leaned over and she's like looking out the passenger window.

338
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,160
 And she's not moving either, but I'm looking at her right in her eyes.

339
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:16,160
 I'm watching her and she's just staring and then she's gone.

340
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,680
 When you see somebody die, people go, "It's like shutting off a light bulb."

341
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,680
 No, it's not because you can turn the light bulb on.

342
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,880
 It's like if you shut off a light bulb and it turned into a peach.

343
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,080
 It becomes something completely different and you can just look at it and you go, "Oh,

344
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,000
 they're dead."

345
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,640
 They're completely different than how they were before.

346
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,680
 It's the most bizarre thing in the world because it's not just like something being shut off,

347
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,120
 it's like something being turned into complete inanimate matter and can never be turned back

348
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,560
 into what it was.

349
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,360
 And I stood up right when I realized she was dead.

350
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,480
 I just kind of stood up and looked at her and I realized, "Well, there's nothing I

351
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
 can do for her.

352
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
 She just died.

353
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,040
 I know for a fact that she had just died."

354
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,580
 So eventually another car pulls up even before the ambulance and these guys get out who were

355
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,120
 with them at the club.

356
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,800
 They were either friends or they were dancing with these girls or whatever.

357
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,560
 And this one dude is in complete hysterics and he's like, "Oh my God, oh my God.

358
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,060
 She has kids.

359
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,440
 She has a husband at home.

360
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,640
 This can't be happening.

361
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
 This is totally freaking me out."

362
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:28,440
 And now I have to calm him down because he's not helping the situation at all.

363
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
 He's just totally freaking out.

364
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
 And I'm like, "Dude, it's okay.

365
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
 No, the ambulance is going to come.

366
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
 They're going to be...

367
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,880
 I knew the one woman was already dead.

368
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,200
 That woman looked like she was paralyzed, but she just got a lie to people a lot of times

369
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 in these situations."

370
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,700
 "Oh no, it's fine, man.

371
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,640
 Don't worry, but now that's cool.

372
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
 She'll see her kids again.

373
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
 They'll come visit her at the hospital.

374
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
 It'll be no big deal.

375
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,360
 Just flat out lying to this dude."

376
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
 Ambulance shows up.

377
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,360
 I think the fire department showed up as well.

378
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,880
 They had to pull the door open and all that stuff.

379
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,800
 I got out of there because at that point, once I start seeing the emergency personnel show

380
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,480
 up, I was like, "I'm just an obstacle.

381
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,600
 I'm going to get out of here."

382
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,440
 I didn't go there saying, "Oh, I'm going to watch this woman die."

383
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,600
 It's weird to think that that woman, her entire life, 26 years of life, boyfriends,

384
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,000
 husband, kids, went out that night clubbing.

385
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,920
 And the last thing she sees is some just stranger that she's never met before standing

386
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,800
 outside her window.

387
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,720
 And it was always very weird to me.

388
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,680
 We had never met before that, and I was the last human being that she ever looked at.

389
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:40,520
 But that aside, that bizarre set of circumstances aside, there's a traumatic event, but at the

390
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,280
 same time, it wasn't the first time I'd seen somebody die.

391
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,320
 It wasn't even the first time I'd seen someone grievously injured.

392
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,360
 I was like, "Okay."

393
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
 But it did.

394
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:58,160
 That last thought about how I was the last person, that kind of upset me a little bit.

395
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,920
 Because it's just a bizarre set of circumstances, just to look at someone in the eyes.

396
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,560
 It was very unsettling.

397
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,080
 So fast forward a couple months.

398
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,640
 I was hanging out with this girl when I went to American River College, and I'll call her

399
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,840
 Mabel, because she looked like one of the backup dancers in that Goldfinger video Mabel.

400
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
 She's really cool.

401
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,280
 A really good friend of mine.

402
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
 She was a Scientologist.

403
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,760
 And her parents were Scientologists, and they had the books, and they took the courses and

404
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
 things like that.

405
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,260
 Now, I had gone to the Scientology, what do they call it, the church, once to watch some

406
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,260
 orientation video.

407
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,560
 I was like, "Whatever."

408
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,760
 I'm always willing to look into other belief systems.

409
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,920
 They didn't really speak to me.

410
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,360
 But Mabel was really into it.

411
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,760
 And I was her friend, and they were having an auditing workshop, and she wanted me to

412
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,920
 come with her, because I guess if you brought someone who wasn't a Scientology to this auditing

413
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,640
 workshop, it was free or something like that.

414
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
 So I was like, "Yeah, sure."

415
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
 You know, they had free breathics.

416
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,140
 They had croissants and stuff like that.

417
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,140
 And I was like, "Yeah, sure.

418
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,080
 You know, it's a fun way to spend the afternoon helping my friend out."

419
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,440
 We go to the Auditing Workshop.

420
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,480
 Now, a quick overview of Auditing, and if you're a Scientologist, you may go, "No, no,

421
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
 no, that's totally off base.

422
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,880
 It has these other steps."

423
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:16,240
 But basically, in a nutshell, is you talk about a horrible experience, or any experience

424
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,960
 you went through.

425
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,000
 And then the auditor has you do it again, and again, and again, and again, each time

426
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,280
 in more detail.

427
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,360
 And basically, it's almost like a self-hypnosis, or you're basically working it through to

428
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,400
 the point where you're remembering how many ashes were coming off the cigarette butt in

429
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,840
 this memory.

430
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,320
 When you're in the church, I believe they use the E-meters during this part, but this

431
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,040
 one we weren't doing in E-meters.

432
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,200
 She was just there to get practice on how to audit.

433
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,840
 So we're sitting there, and we're listening to the presentation.

434
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,800
 I'm eating a bunch of croissants, and then they're getting their workbooks together,

435
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,120
 and I'm still eating some croissants.

436
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,320
 It wasn't on keto back then.

437
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,200
 And after I'm full of butter and flaky bread, it's time to start.

438
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,280
 It's time to break up.

439
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,200
 So Mabel's like, "Hey, let's do this.

440
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
 I'm super excited."

441
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,000
 So what memory do you want to work on?

442
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,440
 And I'm like, "I don't know.

443
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,640
 I mean, I remember loving those croissants I just ate, but I don't think that's going

444
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
 to work.

445
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
 I don't know.

446
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
 I don't know."

447
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,280
 And I was thinking, "What's a memory that I've had that's fairly dramatic, but not

448
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,680
 too crazy?"

449
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,800
 And my mind went to that car accident.

450
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,000
 So again, you go through the story over and over again, and basically what you're cleansing

451
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 your...

452
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,760
 I don't want to get too much into the Scientology terms, so basically I'll break it down into

453
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,800
 generic terms.

454
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,360
 You're cleansing your soul of these bad memories by putting yourself there and living through

455
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,760
 them a couple of times, and it's like you're basically washing yourself of the memory.

456
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,640
 They do something similar to that in psychotherapy or psychology, where it's called immersion

457
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,120
 therapy where you just kind of keep going over it until eventually you're like, "That's

458
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
 not that bad."

459
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,040
 They'll do that for war veterans.

460
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,240
 They'll have super realistic FPS shooters where you're not shooting people.

461
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,120
 You're walking through populated areas.

462
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,960
 It is a valuable form of therapy in the right hands.

463
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,640
 And Mabel, this was her very first time auditing, and I chose as her first time auditing a horrific

464
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,080
 event that involved the death of a young mother and another woman most likely being paralyzed

465
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,040
 from the neck down for the rest of her life.

466
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,480
 So we're sitting there, and she goes tell the story.

467
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,360
 And I told the story pretty much how I exactly told it to you.

468
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,200
 I mean, obviously not exactly, but the same sequence of events.

469
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
 And I tell her the whole story.

470
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,720
 It takes maybe like 10 minutes like I did.

471
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,840
 And she goes, "Okay, now tell it to me again with more detail."

472
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,120
 And that's why the story does have a lot of details even now when I told it was because

473
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,080
 I remember a lot of the details that I remembered back then.

474
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,880
 And I'm like, I remember, but I did remember additional stuff.

475
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,840
 I was like, I do remember the crunch of my boots on the ground, the mist, the mist coming

476
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
 out of the car.

477
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,680
 That was something that I remembered through the auditing because I was focusing on the

478
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,480
 event over and over again.

479
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,960
 I remember my boots hitting the ground.

480
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,920
 I remember it being a bit cold.

481
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,320
 I remember that she was wearing a short skirt.

482
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,520
 Like it was definitely a clubbing skirt.

483
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,920
 The driver had on like an electric blue top, a tight top.

484
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,320
 The passenger had a tight mini skirt on, black top.

485
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,920
 I'm remembering all of these details that pop out, that didn't pop out the first time

486
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,840
 I had told the story.

487
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,680
 She goes, "Okay, tell it to me again."

488
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,960
 And basically I'm reliving this event over and over again with the first time auditor.

489
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,640
 And she, I don't think, is picking up that I'm starting to get a little distressed because

490
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,160
 I'm putting myself back in the situation over and over again.

491
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,200
 But what, the reason why this story is on Dead Rabbit Radio, there was one last time

492
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,600
 I told that story to the auditor.

493
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,200
 And she goes, "And every time you have to start from the beginning."

494
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,400
 And she goes, "Okay, do it again."

495
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,080
 I'd probably already done it like four or five times at this point.

496
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,360
 She goes, "Okay, tell me the story again with more detail."

497
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,720
 And so this time I'm super concentrating on every single detail.

498
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,480
 Stuff that I missed the first four or five times.

499
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,720
 I'm trying to relive that event in such a realistic form that I'm remembering things

500
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,760
 I didn't remember four times earlier telling it.

501
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,840
 And I walk her through the sequence of events just like I did you.

502
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,200
 The debit card laying on the ground from the purse flying out the window.

503
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,760
 Those really minor details.

504
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,760
 And when I get to the part where I walk to the car and I'm staring at her and she's

505
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:47,000
 staring at me and I'm watching her and she's watching me, I see what could only be described

506
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 to me.

507
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,880
 So I remember I'm back in this moment.

508
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,040
 I've put myself, when you're, first you tell the story but then since you're looking for

509
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,000
 details you're mentally going back to that moment.

510
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,080
 I walk to the car, I turn around, I'm looking at her, she's looking at me, the woman screaming,

511
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:10,680
 the people are talking and for a brief second, for a brief, brief second, what I see is her

512
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,480
 soul leave her body.

513
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:24,200
 Now not only that, what I remember seeing through this auditing process was I'm looking

514
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,440
 at her, she's looking at me.

515
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,200
 A translucent blue version of her, this is going to sound ridiculous but a translucent

516
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:40,080
 blue version of her lifted itself slightly out of her body, began banging on the window

517
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,480
 in panic and then shot into the sky.

518
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,120
 And then I stood up and knew she was dead.

519
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,720
 And I sat there, I didn't tell her that.

520
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,640
 I didn't tell Mabel that.

521
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,840
 She goes, I'm telling the story again and I get to the part where I go, I look in the

522
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,200
 window and then I open my eyes and I said, I don't want to do this anymore.

523
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
 I don't want to do this anymore.

524
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
 She goes, are you okay?

525
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,400
 I was like, I don't want to do this anymore.

526
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,800
 I appreciate your time and I think that you have your skills doing this auditing thing

527
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,080
 but I don't want to tell that story again.

528
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
 I don't want to tell that story again.

529
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
 I was distressed.

530
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,560
 We didn't leave, we stayed.

531
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,280
 I got some more croissants because there was like an after-workout shit thing but I

532
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:26,840
 was a little disturbed by that and then I told her later on, a couple days later I

533
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,080
 told her what I saw and I said, I don't want to do that.

534
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,520
 I don't want to do that again.

535
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,080
 And she said, she apologized.

536
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,600
 She goes, I should have told you to pick something better because again it was my first time

537
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
 and it was your first time.

538
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,160
 I should have asked you to pick like a spanking or something like that.

539
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,040
 Is that why I knew she was dead?

540
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:55,000
 I see the thing is like now with that story, that her ghost coming out, looking at her

541
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,360
 ghost comes out of her body, her soul, whatever you want to call it, comes out of her body.

542
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,440
 It looks exactly like her but it's like a blue translucent figure.

543
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:10,360
 I see her fist bang on the window super fast and then she's shot up into the sky.

544
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,360
 Then I stand up.

545
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,520
 And that part of the memory has become ingrained with the factual version of the story now.

546
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,480
 I can't remember one without remembering the other.

547
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,240
 It's an interesting note because is that what I saw?

548
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,400
 Is it when people say like I said it's like watching someone flick a switch and a light

549
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,040
 bulb turns into a basketball?

550
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,120
 You can't, you obviously know that person is dead.

551
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,360
 Is that what we are seeing?

552
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,920
 Are we actually seeing their ghost, their soul, leave their body?

553
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,880
 And the only reason why I put that connection because I relived that experience so many

554
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,240
 times was it just my imagination that was making it up?

555
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,560
 Because I'm clothed, basically I'm in this traumatic event over and over and over again

556
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,120
 and my brain wants it to end so it inserts something so terrifying for me to remember

557
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,640
 that makes the experience end.

558
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,880
 I don't know.

559
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
 It's always puzzled me.

560
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,640
 My, I'll tell you right now, my instinct is that it's my imagination because really

561
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,680
 as much as I believe in a lot of this stuff and I have fun talking about all of it, I'm

562
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,360
 very, very skeptical about a good chunk of it.

563
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:26,000
 And I'm even skeptical about stuff like that because there has been stuff that I've experienced

564
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,920
 in real time that I've looked into and go, "Oh, maybe I was just going crazy or something

565
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,160
 like that."

566
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,760
 This one doesn't even have the benefit of being real time.

567
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,920
 This one has the benefit of me looking back on it and remembering an incident that I didn't

568
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
 see.

569
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,120
 But did I see it and my mind didn't register it?

570
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,200
 Did I see it and my mind didn't want to comprehend it?

571
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,680
 Do we all see it when people die?

572
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,040
 And because we don't focus back on it and meditate on it, we don't notice it?

573
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,160
 I don't know.

574
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:05,280
 And that's why this has always been one of those weird stories of my paranormal life

575
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,880
 because it doesn't fit into the normal, "Oh, I saw a ghost," or "I saw something that

576
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:16,040
 I thought was a ghost and it turned out to be my scented garbage bags."

577
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,440
 This is kind of right in the middle there.

578
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,880
 I did see the woman pass away.

579
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,840
 I didn't know when she had passed away.

580
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,280
 I understood that sequence of events.

581
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:32,680
 But then there's this added detail where under intense questioning, a new detail emerged

582
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,760
 that leads it more to the paranormal.

583
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,040
 But this is the biggest question I have from this whole story and this is how we're going

584
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,800
 to end this week out.

585
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:50,560
 If it was her soul, this beautiful blue translucent soul, leaving her body to go up, which is

586
00:32:50,560 --> 00:33:19,080
 traditionally known as heaven, why was she in a state of panic?

587
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,660
 (upbeat music)

588
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,240
 (upbeat music)

589
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,820
 (upbeat music)

590
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,400
 (upbeat music)

591
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,980
 (upbeat music)

592
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,560
 (upbeat music)

593
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,140
 (upbeat music)

594
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,720
 (upbeat music)

595
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,300
 (upbeat music)

596
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,880
 (upbeat music)

597
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,460
 (upbeat music)

598
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,040
 (upbeat music)

599
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,620
 (upbeat music)

600
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,200
 (upbeat music)

601
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,780
