1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,320
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,600
 Was the UN General Assembly recently briefed on alien contact?

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,600
 And then we kick off Request Week with something from the Conspiracy Iceberg.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,600
 And personally, one of my favorite conspiracies on there.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,600
 Medieval, found footage.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 And not just any episodes.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,600
 It's the premiere of season four episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
 I'm having a great day.

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
 I hope you're having a great day too.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 Now, I think I actually, while cooking dinner, disproved evolution.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 How long have humans been cooking food?

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 100,000 years, probably.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
 50,000 years, most likely.

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
 And I still need a pot holder to pick up a hot bowl.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,600
 If evolution was true, my hands should be able to withstand the hottest food possible.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 Now, obviously, there's a limit.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,600
 If the food is too hot, like the hot is the sun or hot is hot lava, I couldn't eat it.

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,600
 But there is a ceiling of how hot food can get while still remaining edible.

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,600
 And yet I had to spend 10 minutes looking for the single pot holder that I own.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 So I could take a bowl out of the microwave.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
 Your move, Charles Darwin.

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,600
 Now, you could easily say, "Jason, why do you only own one oven mitt when you have two hands?"

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,600
 And two, how do you lose a thing that's bigger than a human hand?

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
 And my response to that is, "Your move, Charles Darwin.

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,600
 You can't judge me for my pot holder losing this?"

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,600
 Well, here's--that should explain why I only have one pot holder, because I lost the other one.

42
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
 Your move, Charles Darwin.

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 Okay, let's go ahead and jump into the first story here.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 Actually, before I do that, my friend Mitchum sent me a trailer for a movie.

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,600
 The title sounds completely ridiculous, but the movie looks incredibly good.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,600
 I've seen movies like Helen Keller vs. the Night Wolves, which I couldn't finish it. It was so bad.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
 And I saw FDR American Badass, which was actually pretty good.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 So when Mitchum sent me a trailer for a movie called "The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot,"

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 I had really low expectations, but the movie stars Sam Elliott.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,600
 The trailer looks great. It looks like they took a ridiculous plot and are playing it as seriously as possible.

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
 It looks beautiful as well.

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
 This man, when you go back in time--not literally, but you see him kill Hitler,

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,600
 and then the government enlists him to kill Bigfoot, who is spreading some sort of deadly pathogen across the wilderness.

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,600
 Looks really good, actually. So I'll put the trailer in the show notes, check it out.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,600
 Now, our first story--we had a couple big stories pop up while I was taking my vacation.

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
 And this was one of the ones that popped up.

57
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,600
 And at first I was--a lot of people are going to go, "Oh, I already know how the story ends,

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,600
 because you're following it on 4chan, but give me a second, because I found a new piece of evidence."

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
 But for those who don't know anything about the story, what happened was on January 29th,

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,600
 the video was uploaded January 29th, 2019, I should say, in case you're listening to this episode 10 years in the future.

61
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 This video was uploaded on January 29th, 2019, and it is a video of the United Nations General Assembly.

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:59,600
 And it starts off saying, "There's no videotaping allowed. This video--this message cannot be reproduced anywhere.

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
 It's like a crime."

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 You see a young woman walk up to the podium and get stuff ready.

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,600
 You see an older gentleman off to the left standing there, and as he moves backwards his hands kind of sway side to side.

66
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 And you see a very attractive woman sitting in a chair waiting for her turn to speak.

67
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
 Now, that woman's name is...

68
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
 Alia Prokofyeva.

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
 I bet you missed those mispronunciations for a week.

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
 Anyways, she describes herself that she is ahead of something called Galactica.

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,600
 I went to her LinkedIn profile. She is trying to set up the first city in space.

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,600
 So she's kind of like this expert, self-proclaimed expert, I'm not for sure.

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,600
 So you do have experts go to the UN from time to time, not everyone who speaks here is a world leader.

74
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 She goes up to the podium and she says--she reveals this message and the video quality is really bad because it was supposedly recorded on a cell phone.

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 Every so often you see a black image move in front of it, and the idea is that the person who's recording it is trying to shield the cell phone camera from view.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
 And the audio quality is bad as well because it's not an official video.

77
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
 So you're basically just getting the audio from the phone.

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,600
 She goes up to the podium and says--back in December, a pyramid-shaped UFO was sighted over the Pentagon in Washington, DC.

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
 And we don't know what it was. It's possibly extraterrestrial.

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:29,600
 What makes this visitation curious is that the pyramid began broadcasting a pattern that matches a pattern from a nearby star system.

81
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,600
 Now we do have things called pulsars. We don't have them. Nature has them. The universe owns them.

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
 But there are stars that rotate and they can let off these radio bursts.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,600
 We pick up--when we first discovered them, we thought it was alien life because of the pattern.

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,600
 But it turns out it's just a pulsar spinning in space.

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,600
 But she says this pyramid-shaped UFO matches that frequency.

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 Now, there were videos that came out in December of a pyramid-shaped UFO hovering over Washington, DC.

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,600
 Those videos themselves are interesting because, one, they look real-ish.

88
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,600
 Nowadays, anything can easily be faked, especially because you're running on a cell phone camera.

89
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,600
 Any special effects you put in there, any irregularities in the special effects,

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
 a believer will just chalk it up to the bad quality of the video.

91
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,600
 When I saw the UFO over Washington, DC, I didn't personally see it, but when I saw the video,

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,600
 my first thing was, you know, Washington, DC is heavily populated, so why am I only seeing a couple angles of this thing?

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
 There should be thousands of videos, even if the mainstream media didn't cover it.

94
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
 The thing was huge. So she says that this is what happened.

95
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,600
 Now, the video got uploaded to YouTube on January 29th and it set the UFO community abuzz.

96
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,600
 They're like, "Oh my God, look at this leaked footage that came out of the UN."

97
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,600
 Now, when I'm watching it, I'm thinking, if this video footage is real, YouTube would take it down.

98
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,600
 The governments of the world would immediately go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, that video is not supposed to be up.

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 It wasn't even supposed to be videotaped. Can you please shut down this, take this channel offline?"

100
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,600
 And it's still there. It only has 60,000 views, so it's not a ton of views, but it's there.

101
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,600
 It was on 4chan. 4chan is generally known to be monitored by at least the US government.

102
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,600
 So the fact that it's still up kind of takes away its credibility.

103
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
 If you go to that video, and all the links are going to be in the show notes, of course,

104
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 but if you go to that video, it links to an original video. That channel is taken down,

105
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,600
 but that could be part of the LARP. I could easily set up a channel, delete it,

106
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,600
 and then link a video to it and be like, "Oh, the original channel was deleted, but this is the video."

107
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
 So that's easy to fake, too.

108
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,600
 But UFO people, especially on 4chan, were like, "Oh my God, what do we do with this? Here's this woman talking about this thing."

109
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,600
 Now, the debunking to it, and this is where people are like, "Yeah, yeah, I know this part,

110
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
 but I have to go over this and don't just skip ahead because there's something,

111
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
 there's another additional detail to this."

112
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,600
 The debunking to it is, earlier in the year, I believe, it might have been the previous year,

113
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,600
 Erdogan, Erdogan, I believe, is the president of Turkey, if I'm pronouncing his name right,

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 which I'm most likely, I'm not.

115
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,600
 He gives a presentation to the UN, and when he is talking to the United Nations,

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
 you see a young woman walk up to the podium, get everything ready.

117
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,600
 You see a man, an old gentleman, kind of stand into the side, and he steps back,

118
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
 and his hands are kind of moving.

119
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,600
 It's the exact same video, except for a few key details.

120
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,600
 One, the young woman, Aliyah, is not giving the speech.

121
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
 She's nowhere present in the video.

122
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
 Instead, it's Erdogan.

123
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 The film quality is much better.

124
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,600
 It's digital video, it's basically high-end digital video because it is the United Nations.

125
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
 It's not like they have money problems.

126
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 The sound quality is much, much better.

127
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,600
 The cell phone video is really tinny because it's supposedly on a cell phone,

128
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
 and there's no hand ever kind of blocking the view.

129
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,600
 And so the debunkers go, "Look it, this is the video that they took the president, Erdogan, out of,

130
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,600
 put Aliyah in as a deep fake. They digitally removed one person and put another person in,

131
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,600
 dropped the video quality, dropped the sound quality, and presented this as proof.

132
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
 You guys are idiots, you guys shouldn't have ever believed this."

133
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
 So when I was looking at, I saw the original video, I was like,

134
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
 "It shouldn't be online if it's real."

135
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,600
 I think it's kind of suspicious that there's the black hand keeps moving in front of the camera,

136
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,600
 and I'm thinking that could be to clear up, like to kind of block any irregularities in the video

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
 that they're trying to put out as real.

138
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 So we talked about deep fakes before.

139
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
 Now, it's funny because the first time I came across deep fakes,

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,600
 ICE was seeing pornographic images of Gal Gadot's face on a porn star's body.

141
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 Natalie Portman's face on a porn star's body.

142
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
 Daisy Ridley's face on a porn star's body,

143
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 and they were taking these huge celebrities and basically turning them into porn stars.

144
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
 And very, very convincing, very, very convincing technology.

145
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,600
 I had never seen a full-body deep fake before, but it's the same idea.

146
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 You take thousands of images, you have a source image,

147
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
 and then you have the image you want to insert,

148
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,600
 you remove one image in the porn videos, it would just be the original actress's face,

149
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
 put the new face on top of it.

150
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 You could do the same thing here.

151
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,600
 The Aliyah speaker, she has a shadow, she looks, it looks convincing.

152
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 Again, if she went up and talked about wheat products or the production of corn in Germany,

153
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 I would have had no reason to disbelieve it.

154
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
 If the video hadn't started off saying, "Please don't record,"

155
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
 I would have had less reason to doubt it.

156
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
 But the fact that they're like, "We're going to prosecute anyone who puts this out,"

157
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 I was like, "Okay, they're kind of hyping it up a bit."

158
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
 But here's the interesting thing.

159
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 So that's the story with that.

160
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 When I first saw the video, I was like, "Oh, I'll cover that when the break's over."

161
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
 It's pretty cut and dry.

162
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
 You have a, what looks like a fraud when you look at all the evidence.

163
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 You have a video that seems suspicious,

164
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,600
 and then you find the exact same video at higher quality

165
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
 of a different person giving a boring speech.

166
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 Totally different speech.

167
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
 So I go, "Well, that's pretty cut and dry."

168
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 But what happens next is what makes me suspicious about everything.

169
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,600
 January 29th is the you and video uploaded to YouTube.

170
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
 At least the one we can see.

171
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 I don't know about the one that supposedly got the account terminated,

172
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
 but on January 29th is the video you can watch,

173
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 the video I have a link to.

174
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
 January 29th was the same time they're like,

175
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
 "Nope, this is fake. Here's the Erdogan video."

176
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
 That whole story kind of happened relatively quickly.

177
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,600
 But also what makes me suspicious about the story is on January 30th,

178
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 a viral news story goes up.

179
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
 Look at these wacky deepfakes.

180
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
 Look at Steve Buscemi's face on Jennifer Lawrence's body.

181
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 What? This is crazy.

182
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
 Look at this wacky technology.

183
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,600
 And it's weird because they could have had that same story.

184
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
 If you wanted to cover deepfakes that day,

185
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 if you wanted to make that a viral story,

186
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
 the UFO video is a more convincing deepfake.

187
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,600
 Because when you see the Steve Buscemi/Jennifer Lawrence thing,

188
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
 it looks grotesque.

189
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
 It looks really, really weird.

190
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
 It's not convincing in any way, shape, or form.

191
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,600
 And I thought, why a day after the UN video comes out,

192
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
 which is most likely a fake,

193
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,600
 are they now pushing the story of deepfakes back into the media

194
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
 and showing us a ridiculous example?

195
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
 And they did the same thing over the summer.

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 Over the summers when the trend began of the famous actresses

197
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
 being put on porn stars' bodies,

198
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
 but when the media covered it, when they showed examples of it,

199
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 they'd say, "Look at Nicholas Cage's face

200
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
 on all of these movie stars? What?"

201
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
 And I'm thinking, why don't--

202
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
 I'm not asking them to show porn on CNN,

203
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
 but why don't they show at least still clips

204
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 and they could be like, "This is this actress's face.

205
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 This is Gal Gadot's face on Biloxi Blue's body or something."

206
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 That's convincing. The skin tone's the same.

207
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
 You can't tell the difference.

208
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,600
 The only reason you know it's fake is because Gal Gadot's never done porn.

209
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,600
 That's the reason you factually know that video is not real.

210
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,600
 So why, if they have that, did they push the Nicholas Cage's face

211
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
 in the middle of Game of Thrones or whatever it was?

212
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
 Why when they have a semi-convincing deepfake

213
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
 of someone giving a speech to the United Nations General Assembly about UFOs,

214
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,600
 do you show how wacky deepfakes are because you have Jennifer Lawrence

215
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 with this grotesque-- sorry, Steve Bishammy,

216
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 but like this weird-looking face?

217
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 I think because ultimately deepfake technology, they warn us about it.

218
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,600
 I think their concern is rogue actors using deepfake technology.

219
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
 I think the government, I think certain powerful people

220
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
 want to use it for their benefit,

221
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,600
 so they don't want to really show us how convincing it can actually be.

222
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 Because this Ewan video, like I said, if she went up and talked about trade tariffs

223
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 and someone showed me that video, I'd be like, "Why are you showing me this?

224
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 This is super boring."

225
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
 And then they'd go, "That never happened. That's fake."

226
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 I'd have been like, "What?"

227
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,600
 It's very convincing.

228
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,600
 I think deepfake technology is being planned to be used--

229
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
 and people go, "Oh, it's going to be used for Pizzagate.

230
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
 If Hillary Clinton never gets videotaped eating a baby,

231
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
 I don't think it's ever going to be anything like that."

232
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,600
 I think when deepfake technology actually is used,

233
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,600
 it's going to be something super mundane that no one will really question it.

234
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 When you talk about UFOs and Satanic worship and all sorts of this crazy stuff,

235
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 it's easy for a skeptic to go, "Well, that's obviously not true."

236
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,600
 But if they want to have a video of the president talking about a new trade plan with Italy,

237
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
 where we're going to basically give them all of our money,

238
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
 or that's kind of ridiculous too,

239
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
 but you know what I mean?

240
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,600
 Like, something relatively boring, people won't question that.

241
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,600
 And I think there's an actual effort to warn people about deepfakes,

242
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,600
 but not warn them at how realistic they can be.

243
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
 Very odd timing.

244
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,600
 The Steve Buscemi video was uploaded the same day as the Ewan video.

245
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,600
 The story got reported the next morning.

246
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,600
 So while all the UFOologists were still debating over the authenticity of this Ewan General Assembly video,

247
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 all of these news websites were like,

248
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 "Pfft, look at this technology! Can you believe it? It's 2019!"

249
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
 Weird. Very, very convenient timing.

250
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
 Very convenient timing.

251
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

252
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,600
 Now, our next story was actually a request from Joshua from YouTube,

253
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,600
 and it is one of the ones that I have found the most intriguing on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

254
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
 Just the idea I've always found interesting.

255
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,600
 "Mideval found footage." The phrase itself is very evocative,

256
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
 because it makes you think of one of two things.

257
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
 Well, three.

258
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
 One, it's fake. It's totally made up.

259
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 It's just three words strung together.

260
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
 But that's boring.

261
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
 People always go, "What? That's just fake!"

262
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
 And I'm like, "Yeah, probably!"

263
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
 But that's not a fun podcast.

264
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 They'll just be like, "Ah, it's fake."

265
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
 Like, either it's fake for a reason,

266
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
 or you go, "It's fake, but..."

267
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
 Let's pretend it's not for a second.

268
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 So, it is possibly just three words strung together.

269
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 However, this one has a bit of meat to it.

270
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
 So, it's one of three things. It's either fake.

271
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,600
 It involves time travel, which is a nice theory,

272
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 which is nice, it's evocative.

273
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 And then there's one that I think is more accurate.

274
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 And, and, it's pretty, pretty cool.

275
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
 So, we've already addressed, maybe it's fake,

276
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
 maybe it's something people put together, whatever.

277
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
 I don't like, you know, maybe. But that's boring.

278
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
 Time travel.

279
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 The idea of time travel, I think,

280
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
 kind of touches people on a personal level,

281
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 because it addresses two things.

282
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
 It addresses changing the past,

283
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 because everyone has regrets.

284
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
 Time travel touches on the idea that

285
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
 we can change our past.

286
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 And two, I think a lot of people

287
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
 don't necessarily wish they could live forever.

288
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,600
 But for me, I want to see what comes next.

289
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,600
 I personally think it would be more fascinating

290
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,600
 to travel into the future, to see what happens next.

291
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
 And time travel plays on both of those.

292
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
 Like, I could fall asleep and wake up a thousand years from now

293
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
 and be like, "Oh my God, this is awesome.

294
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 There's like robots or apocalyptic wasteland.

295
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,600
 Everyone's dead and I'm just kind of stumbling around

296
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
 until I fall and my glasses break

297
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 and I go, "All the books in the world!"

298
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
 That's what interesting thing about time travel.

299
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 It kind of plays on both of those things.

300
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
 So, let's address the time travel theory first.

301
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
 And that would be that some archaeologists

302
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
 go or are like digging around in England.

303
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 They like got their shovels and the cops are like,

304
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
 "Oh, oh, oh, you don't have a permit!"

305
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
 And they're like, "Ah, whatever. Where are archaeologists

306
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
 throwing dirt in the cops' face?"

307
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
 They keep digging.

308
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
 The cops are trying to arrest them.

309
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
 And not the hammer, the shovel goes, "Tink, tink!"

310
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
 Hit something and the cops are like, "What's that?"

311
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,600
 The archaeologist goes, "It looks like some sort of film case."

312
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
 (imitates gunshot)

313
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
 Test it off.

314
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
 Pull it out and it's a real film.

315
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
 And they're like, "Hmm, do you have a projector?"

316
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
 And the cops are like, "No, we're cops!

317
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
 We don't even have guns over here.

318
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
 Why would you think we'd have a projector?"

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
 Eventually, though, the archaeologists pay their bail.

320
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,600
 They go to a local cinema, put the film on the projector

321
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 and what they see is literal found footage.

322
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,600
 They see film of these medieval people

323
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
 kind of dancing around, doing their stuff,

324
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,600
 making clay pots, looking miserable all the time.

325
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
 Knights are beating them up.

326
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
 They're all dying.

327
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 Every movie ends with them dying of the bubonic plague.

328
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
 The end.

329
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
 And the archaeologists are like,

330
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 "This is impossible.

331
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
 It's encased in this metal tin.

332
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
 It's shot on this camera

333
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 that we are actually able to string up to a projector.

334
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
 Maybe it's on like Super IMAX film.

335
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
 Maybe it's digital film from the future.

336
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 But it's found footage.

337
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,600
 And the idea would be that at some point

338
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,600
 somebody traveled back in time to the medieval period,

339
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
 filmed them doing their things.

340
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
 Maybe they're hamming it up for the camera.

341
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
 Maybe it's a little Punch and Judy show.

342
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 Maybe they were videotaping something

343
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
 and the time travelers dressed up as medieval people

344
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
 walking around their hidden camera.

345
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
 And they're like, "Hey, what are you writing?"

346
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
 He's like, "I'm a writing stuff."

347
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
 And they're like, "Well, that's obvious that you're writing stuff.

348
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
 What are you writing?"

349
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 He's like, "Oh, nothing.

350
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
 I just have stories in my head sometime.

351
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
 I call this one Romeo and Juliet."

352
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,600
 And they're like, "Oh, your hand name doesn't happen

353
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 to be William Shakespeare."

354
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
 He's like, "They call me Billy.

355
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 That's in the found footage."

356
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
 And obviously, apparently it has audio as well.

357
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
 But anyways, they find this footage

358
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,600
 and for whatever reason they leave it behind.

359
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 For us to find.

360
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
 Because if it was just time travelers going back in time,

361
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 filming a bunch of dudes dancing around

362
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
 and Billy Shakespeare,

363
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
 and then went to the future, we wouldn't know it was there.

364
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 So that theory is completely ridiculous, obviously.

365
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
 And not because I don't believe in time travel,

366
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
 because I do, to a sense.

367
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,600
 But this would require, one, time travelers to travel back

368
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
 to medieval times.

369
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
 Two, to time travel back to medieval times,

370
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 and use technology that we would be able to view.

371
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
 We can't even view, right,

372
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
 if someone gave me a laser disk right now, I'd be SOL.

373
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
 Like, I'd be like, "Hey, thanks.

374
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
 What am I gonna do with this?

375
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
 It's a giant coaster."

376
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
 I can't even view laser disk technology.

377
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 By the time we have time machines going back and forth in time,

378
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
 they're not gonna be using SD cards.

379
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 They're not even gonna be using film.

380
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
 What would they use?

381
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
 It would be the same thing.

382
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
 Yeah, actually, if I had a cell phone,

383
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
 if I went back in time,

384
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
 I'd be like, "Oh, I'm gonna use a cell phone.

385
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
 I had a cell phone.

386
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,600
 If I went back in time and I left my cell phone in the 1980s

387
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
 and I pulled down my SD card,

388
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
 they'd be like, "Well, okay, your fingernail fell off,

389
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 robot man."

390
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
 Like, they'd have no way of even knowing what was on it.

391
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,600
 So, that theory, while it is interesting,

392
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
 because it's sci-fi-ish, it's not very likely at all.

393
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,600
 And I don't think that's what medieval found footage refers to.

394
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
 I've seen that theory bandied around a couple times.

395
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
 They're like, "Oh, it's about time travelers going back in time."

396
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 I don't really think that it is what it refers to.

397
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
 But I do think the theory has some meat,

398
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 and I think this version is more interesting

399
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
 because it's quite possibly true.

400
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 Let's say the year is 1568.

401
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 A couple peasants running around in the field.

402
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,600
 I apparently, in my version of medieval times,

403
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 they just dance and run and don't do any work.

404
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
 It was actually quite grueling.

405
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
 They worked from sundown to sunup or the other way around.

406
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
 They would be working the night.

407
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
 They worked from sunup to sundown.

408
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 And then they'd sit at home in front of the fireplace

409
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
 and try to forget their miserable existence.

410
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 So, but anyways, in my version,

411
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
 they're just running around through the fields.

412
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,600
 They're like, "Gerald, Gerald, go back to your chores!"

413
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
 And he's like, "No way! I'm out of here!"

414
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 It's 15, whatever year I said before.

415
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 I don't even remember at this point.

416
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
 And these peasants were playing in the woods, and this night...

417
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
 [imitates sound of a gunshot]

418
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
 I don't know what this effect was.

419
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
 This night rides up to the peasants and is like,

420
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,600
 "The king requires your service, peasants."

421
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 And they're like, "Oh, yeah, whatever you say, knight.

422
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
 What are we supposed to do?"

423
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,600
 And the knight's like, "The king is making a movie."

424
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
 The peasants would be like, "What? What's a movie?"

425
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
 And the knight's like, "I don't know."

426
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
 You know how hard it is to shrug an armor,

427
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
 but I'm gonna do it anyways. I don't know.

428
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
 The horse is like, "Wah, wah, wah."

429
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
 They all go back to the castle.

430
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
 Now, we know the history of film.

431
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
 It's very, very well documented.

432
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
 Partially because film is a document in and of itself.

433
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
 It's a chemical process, and I'm not gonna bore you with the details of it,

434
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
 because it's easily you can find on Wikipedia.

435
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
 Again, all the links are below.

436
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
 But we can trace it back quite a while.

437
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
 And before we were capturing...

438
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,600
 'Cause really, I say I'm not gonna bore you with the process,

439
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,600
 but all film is, is a series of pictures.

440
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
 And there's... It's weird.

441
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
 On film, I don't know if it's the same with digital,

442
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,600
 but on film there's a black bar between each frame,

443
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
 but our brain doesn't pick up the black bar,

444
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
 'cause we have this thing called like continuity of image.

445
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
 And it's weird now, 'cause think about it,

446
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
 when you sit down and you watch a film,

447
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
 you're actually seeing a black image.

448
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
 Oh, what is it? 32 frames per second,

449
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 so you're seeing a black image 32 times every second,

450
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
 and your brain just doesn't process it.

451
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
 And what's weird is I'm sure some people's brains do.

452
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,600
 I'm sure there are some people whose brains don't work right,

453
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
 and it must be maddening to have to watch a movie,

454
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
 'cause they'd be like, "Oh my God, people like this?

455
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
 "Like, I'm just seeing a bunch of black every once in a while."

456
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
 Normal people don't see it.

457
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,600
 But anyway, so all it is, is a series of photographs,

458
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
 played very, very rapidly.

459
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
 Same thing with like, "You guys know what film is."

460
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,600
 So, between film, we can go all the way back,

461
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,600
 thousands, probably about a thousand years, if not farther.

462
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 So something called the camera obscura,

463
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,600
 and that was film without film.

464
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,600
 It was only what was going on outside.

465
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,600
 That was basically a black room with a peephole,

466
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
 not like a pervert's peephole,

467
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
 but a peephole that allowed sunlight to come in,

468
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
 and the image was like, "Reverse on the wall."

469
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
 It got real complicated for me to follow on this stuff,

470
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
 but that allowed you that if you sat in this dark room

471
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,600
 through this, looking against the wall,

472
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
 you could see what was going on outside.

473
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
 Now, obviously, you could just leave the dark room

474
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
 and see what was going on outside.

475
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 But it was an early form of a projected image.

476
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 People say that cave paintings on walls

477
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 could have been brought from some sort of camera obscura.

478
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 That religious practices could have involved the camera obscura

479
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
 thousands of years ago.

480
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,600
 Could have been the way to tell stories of myths and legends

481
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 by basically creating this type of room

482
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 and having people acting it out,

483
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
 and then it appears on the wall.

484
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,600
 So the camera obscura, Leonardo da Vinci used one.

485
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
 A bunch of other old people used one.

486
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,600
 I think Leonardo da Vinci was the one who actually made it popular.

487
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
 He made it fetch.

488
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
 He created the mainstream version of it.

489
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
 And then in 1827, that's when some guy says,

490
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,600
 "You know what? I'm going to use that same process,

491
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,600
 but I'm going to take a piece of polished pewter plate

492
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
 with Peter Peckle."

493
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 And I'm going to help him with this.

494
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
 A polished pewter plate,

495
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,600
 and he covered it with something called bitmen of Judea.

496
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,600
 The sunlight hits the plate using the same thing as the camera obscura.

497
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
 And after eight hours,

498
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,600
 he's able to wipe off everything that the sun didn't burn in.

499
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
 This is a weird process, and then he has an image on a plate

500
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
 of what was outside.

501
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 That is the first, like, here is an image.

502
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 You didn't have to be here to see this.

503
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
 Obviously it took eight hours,

504
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 so they didn't have any pictures of people back then.

505
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
 So you go, Jason.

506
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
 You said camera obscuras existed for a long time,

507
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
 and then in 1827 is the first time we have a photograph,

508
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
 and a photograph is a stepping stone to a film.

509
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,600
 So how do you equate that with medieval times?

510
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
 Well, to do that, I'm actually going to talk about

511
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
 another recommendation I got.

512
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,600
 A while back, I got an email from a gentleman named Gary,

513
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,600
 and we were talking about Terare, the guy who could eat anything,

514
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
 which I love that episode.

515
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,600
 He ate a gold fork, and the gold fork never came out,

516
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
 and so the idea is that he dissolved it.

517
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,600
 And Gary emailed me, and he sent me a link to something called aqua regia.

518
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,600
 Now aqua regia was a chemical,

519
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,600
 it was a chemical combination that could be used to dissolve gold and platinum,

520
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
 and completely dissolve it.

521
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,600
 So aqua regia was this chemical that was made,

522
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
 and you're like, okay, that's a cute story,

523
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
 but what does that have to do with anything you're talking about?

524
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,600
 It was first mentioned in 1300 AD, and then in 1600 AD,

525
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 the next time we see a reference to this,

526
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,600
 it was written out not as a chemical composition

527
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
 or how the chemicals work together,

528
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
 it was instead a riddle.

529
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:17,600
 It was a drawing that explained this advanced chemical process as an image.

530
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
 And the process said, the process showed, a dragon,

531
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
 and then a fox eating a rooster, and the rooster eating the fox.

532
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,600
 And then this is how they deciphered this.

533
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,600
 It said, the rooster symbolizes gold, and the fox represents aqua regia.

534
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
 Obviously there was some sort of key code, some guy just wasn't looking at it and going,

535
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
 oh yeah, that's what that means, but the repetitive dissolving,

536
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,600
 heating, and re-dissolving, the rooster eating the fox,

537
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,600
 eating the rooster, leads to the buildup of chlorine gas in the flask.

538
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,600
 The golden crystallizes in the form of gold chloride,

539
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
 whose red crystals were known as dragon's blood.

540
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,600
 So you had the initial recipe of what it does in 1300 AD.

541
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,600
 You then have this coded drawing in 1600 AD.

542
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:07,600
 The reaction was not listed in chemical literature at all until 1890.

543
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,600
 So in that time period, people had invented the process or discovered the process in 1300.

544
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:24,600
 It was referenced again 300 years later, and then it took another 200 years before anyone ever wrote it down again.

545
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
 But it was still being practiced.

546
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,600
 And in that time period, if those original documents were destroyed for whatever reason,

547
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,600
 it would have been lost until it was "discovered" in 1890.

548
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:44,600
 So who's not to say that all film is a chemical process involving light and material and a chemical?

549
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,600
 Dark rooms and stuff like that, you're mixing these chemicals together,

550
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,600
 you take an image onto a piece of material, there's not magic.

551
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,600
 Now I get it, the magic of the cinema and all that stuff, it's great, it's silver screen, all that nonsense.

552
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,600
 But it's not actual magic, it is a chemical process.

553
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:08,600
 Who's not to say that the chemical process wasn't discovered in 1827, but it was discovered before then,

554
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 the proof we have that it was discovered is gone?

555
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,600
 Is that a supposition? Absolutely. Do I have any proof of that? No.

556
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,600
 I can look at these other things that were lost and then rediscovered.

557
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
 I can say, well, this stuff happened.

558
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 The biggest obstacle to the idea of medieval found footage is this.

559
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,600
 That it took eight hours to produce an image back then.

560
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,600
 I don't want to say, well, maybe they found a quicker way to do it because that's taking it more into the fantastical.

561
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
 I want to stick with the technology we know they had.

562
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:46,600
 They had a magic lantern, no, not literal, they had a thing called a magic lantern,

563
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 that you'd have a little image, it's basically a side projector back then.

564
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,600
 The magic lantern was like in the 1500s, it was in the medieval times.

565
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,600
 In the medieval times they had this thing called the magic lantern.

566
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
 It was a projector, it was the evolution of the camera obscura,

567
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 but instead of seeing what was outside, you could have a little piece of glass that was hand-painted,

568
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,600
 and you'd put it in and you'd put a candle in it or sunlight or whatever,

569
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,600
 and it would project the image on the wall, just like a slide projector.

570
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,600
 And then people said, you know what, let's put two slides in it,

571
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,600
 and you could show like a little cartoon guy juggling.

572
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:29,600
 So the basics of the technology were there, projection, glass slides, animation to a degree.

573
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 You would definitely see the black switch there as the machine slowly clicked over,

574
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,600
 but this technology was in wide use.

575
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:43,600
 So the only thing we have to add to have medieval found footage is the real people.

576
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,600
 They have the slides of the two people juggling or whatever they want to do, the two little cartoon people dancing,

577
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,600
 but for found footage I want footage of people.

578
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,600
 Is it possible that there was film footage of people in the medieval times?

579
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,600
 Again, the biggest obstacle to it is people having to stand still for eight hours,

580
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,600
 but that's why I use the King example, because you're a peasant,

581
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,600
 you're going to get your head chopped off if you don't stand in the same spot for eight hours,

582
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,600
 and then you just move slightly for the next one, and move slightly for the next one,

583
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
 and move slightly for the next one.

584
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,600
 It would take, you know, a month to have a good five minutes of footage,

585
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
 and you know, you figure maybe they're sitting down in chairs,

586
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,600
 but it's not an insurmountable hurdle to have someone sit in a chair for eight hours,

587
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,600
 and then after that move their arms slightly, and it would be a great,

588
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,600
 imagine going to a King's house, and he's like, "You know, have you ever heard of a witch?"

589
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 And his guests are like, "Well, of course, witches are real, we have to kill twelve of them getting here."

590
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,600
 And King goes, "Have you ever heard of the Blair Witch?"

591
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,600
 And then he has this found footage movie. Well, it's not found to him, he owns it, he made it.

592
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,600
 But imagine going to a royal court, and people being like, "Oh, look at my magic lantern,

593
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,600
 it's two images of this cartoon guy juggling," and the King's like, "That sucks.

594
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,600
 Here's Transformers 4. It took me eight years to film, but I did it."

595
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,600
 It is possible, even using the technology, the only thing that's not possible

596
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,600
 is you have to go along with me on the journey, that the technology got a little more advanced

597
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,600
 between 1500 and 1827 regarding that chemical process.

598
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:40,600
 And the fact that we, I can say, here's another chemical process that was not mentioned for 200 years.

599
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,600
 People were doing it in that time period, but it wasn't mentioned for 200 years.

600
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,600
 I think there is medieval found footage. I think that it is very likely that some archaeologists found this stuff.

601
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,600
 Why it wasn't released? I don't know.

602
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,600
 Now, I want to put money, I think it's likely, but I want to put money on it.

603
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,600
 But it may be out there. There may be footage of the real Blair Witch.

604
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,600
 There, it is a documentary. It was an actual witch they were chasing around.

605
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,600
 King standing in the corner of the castle at the end, camera falls, breaks, it's over.

606
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,600
 I think the idea of medieval found footage is very intriguing.

607
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,600
 And I, it's one of those conspiracy theories that I actually really like.

608
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,600
 Because it's a good one. It's a happy conspiracy theory. It's we are more advanced than we think we are.

609
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,600
 We're more clever as a species than we think we are.

610
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:40,600
 That 300, 400 years before the official invention of something, someone came up with it, used it for entertainment, for documentation, whatever.

611
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,600
 There's not a lot of positive conspiracy theories out there.

612
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 But one of them that we're actually smarter than we give ourselves credit for,

613
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,600
 that's a good conspiracy theory.
