WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.600
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.600
 Was the UN General Assembly recently briefed on alien contact?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 And then we kick off Request Week with something from the Conspiracy Iceberg.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 And personally, one of my favorite conspiracies on there.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 Medieval, found footage.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 And not just any episodes.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.600
 It's the premiere of season four episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 I hope you're having a great day too.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 Now, I think I actually, while cooking dinner, disproved evolution.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.600
 How long have humans been cooking food?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 100,000 years, probably.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 50,000 years, most likely.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 And I still need a pot holder to pick up a hot bowl.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 If evolution was true, my hands should be able to withstand the hottest food possible.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 Now, obviously, there's a limit.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 If the food is too hot, like the hot is the sun or hot is hot lava, I couldn't eat it.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 But there is a ceiling of how hot food can get while still remaining edible.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 And yet I had to spend 10 minutes looking for the single pot holder that I own.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 So I could take a bowl out of the microwave.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 Your move, Charles Darwin.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 Now, you could easily say, "Jason, why do you only own one oven mitt when you have two hands?"

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.600
 And two, how do you lose a thing that's bigger than a human hand?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 And my response to that is, "Your move, Charles Darwin.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.600
 You can't judge me for my pot holder losing this?"

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 Well, here's--that should explain why I only have one pot holder, because I lost the other one.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600
 Your move, Charles Darwin.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 Okay, let's go ahead and jump into the first story here.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.600
 Actually, before I do that, my friend Mitchum sent me a trailer for a movie.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 The title sounds completely ridiculous, but the movie looks incredibly good.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.600
 I've seen movies like Helen Keller vs. the Night Wolves, which I couldn't finish it. It was so bad.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 And I saw FDR American Badass, which was actually pretty good.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.600
 So when Mitchum sent me a trailer for a movie called "The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot,"

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 I had really low expectations, but the movie stars Sam Elliott.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.600
 The trailer looks great. It looks like they took a ridiculous plot and are playing it as seriously as possible.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 It looks beautiful as well.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.600
 This man, when you go back in time--not literally, but you see him kill Hitler,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 and then the government enlists him to kill Bigfoot, who is spreading some sort of deadly pathogen across the wilderness.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 Looks really good, actually. So I'll put the trailer in the show notes, check it out.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.600
 Now, our first story--we had a couple big stories pop up while I was taking my vacation.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 And this was one of the ones that popped up.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.600
 And at first I was--a lot of people are going to go, "Oh, I already know how the story ends,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.600
 because you're following it on 4chan, but give me a second, because I found a new piece of evidence."

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 But for those who don't know anything about the story, what happened was on January 29th,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 the video was uploaded January 29th, 2019, I should say, in case you're listening to this episode 10 years in the future.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.600
 This video was uploaded on January 29th, 2019, and it is a video of the United Nations General Assembly.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.600
 And it starts off saying, "There's no videotaping allowed. This video--this message cannot be reproduced anywhere.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 It's like a crime."

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 You see a young woman walk up to the podium and get stuff ready.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.600
 You see an older gentleman off to the left standing there, and as he moves backwards his hands kind of sway side to side.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 And you see a very attractive woman sitting in a chair waiting for her turn to speak.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.600
 Now, that woman's name is...

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.600
 Alia Prokofyeva.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.600
 I bet you missed those mispronunciations for a week.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.600
 Anyways, she describes herself that she is ahead of something called Galactica.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.600
 I went to her LinkedIn profile. She is trying to set up the first city in space.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.600
 So she's kind of like this expert, self-proclaimed expert, I'm not for sure.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.600
 So you do have experts go to the UN from time to time, not everyone who speaks here is a world leader.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:53.600
 She goes up to the podium and she says--she reveals this message and the video quality is really bad because it was supposedly recorded on a cell phone.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 Every so often you see a black image move in front of it, and the idea is that the person who's recording it is trying to shield the cell phone camera from view.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.600
 And the audio quality is bad as well because it's not an official video.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600
 So you're basically just getting the audio from the phone.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.600
 She goes up to the podium and says--back in December, a pyramid-shaped UFO was sighted over the Pentagon in Washington, DC.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.600
 And we don't know what it was. It's possibly extraterrestrial.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:29.600
 What makes this visitation curious is that the pyramid began broadcasting a pattern that matches a pattern from a nearby star system.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.600
 Now we do have things called pulsars. We don't have them. Nature has them. The universe owns them.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.600
 But there are stars that rotate and they can let off these radio bursts.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.600
 We pick up--when we first discovered them, we thought it was alien life because of the pattern.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 But it turns out it's just a pulsar spinning in space.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.600
 But she says this pyramid-shaped UFO matches that frequency.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.600
 Now, there were videos that came out in December of a pyramid-shaped UFO hovering over Washington, DC.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.600
 Those videos themselves are interesting because, one, they look real-ish.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.600
 Nowadays, anything can easily be faked, especially because you're running on a cell phone camera.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.600
 Any special effects you put in there, any irregularities in the special effects,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.600
 a believer will just chalk it up to the bad quality of the video.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.600
 When I saw the UFO over Washington, DC, I didn't personally see it, but when I saw the video,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.600
 my first thing was, you know, Washington, DC is heavily populated, so why am I only seeing a couple angles of this thing?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.600
 There should be thousands of videos, even if the mainstream media didn't cover it.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.600
 The thing was huge. So she says that this is what happened.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.600
 Now, the video got uploaded to YouTube on January 29th and it set the UFO community abuzz.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.600
 They're like, "Oh my God, look at this leaked footage that came out of the UN."

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.600
 Now, when I'm watching it, I'm thinking, if this video footage is real, YouTube would take it down.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.600
 The governments of the world would immediately go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, that video is not supposed to be up.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.600
 It wasn't even supposed to be videotaped. Can you please shut down this, take this channel offline?"

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.600
 And it's still there. It only has 60,000 views, so it's not a ton of views, but it's there.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.600
 It was on 4chan. 4chan is generally known to be monitored by at least the US government.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600
 So the fact that it's still up kind of takes away its credibility.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.600
 If you go to that video, and all the links are going to be in the show notes, of course,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.600
 but if you go to that video, it links to an original video. That channel is taken down,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.600
 but that could be part of the LARP. I could easily set up a channel, delete it,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600
 and then link a video to it and be like, "Oh, the original channel was deleted, but this is the video."

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.600
 So that's easy to fake, too.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.600
 But UFO people, especially on 4chan, were like, "Oh my God, what do we do with this? Here's this woman talking about this thing."

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 Now, the debunking to it, and this is where people are like, "Yeah, yeah, I know this part,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.600
 but I have to go over this and don't just skip ahead because there's something,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.600
 there's another additional detail to this."

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.600
 The debunking to it is, earlier in the year, I believe, it might have been the previous year,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 Erdogan, Erdogan, I believe, is the president of Turkey, if I'm pronouncing his name right,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.600
 which I'm most likely, I'm not.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.600
 He gives a presentation to the UN, and when he is talking to the United Nations,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.600
 you see a young woman walk up to the podium, get everything ready.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 You see a man, an old gentleman, kind of stand into the side, and he steps back,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.600
 and his hands are kind of moving.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.600
 It's the exact same video, except for a few key details.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.600
 One, the young woman, Aliyah, is not giving the speech.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600
 She's nowhere present in the video.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.600
 Instead, it's Erdogan.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 The film quality is much better.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.600
 It's digital video, it's basically high-end digital video because it is the United Nations.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600
 It's not like they have money problems.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.600
 The sound quality is much, much better.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.600
 The cell phone video is really tinny because it's supposedly on a cell phone,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.600
 and there's no hand ever kind of blocking the view.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.600
 And so the debunkers go, "Look it, this is the video that they took the president, Erdogan, out of,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.600
 put Aliyah in as a deep fake. They digitally removed one person and put another person in,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.600
 dropped the video quality, dropped the sound quality, and presented this as proof.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.600
 You guys are idiots, you guys shouldn't have ever believed this."

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.600
 So when I was looking at, I saw the original video, I was like,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.600
 "It shouldn't be online if it's real."

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.600
 I think it's kind of suspicious that there's the black hand keeps moving in front of the camera,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:31.600
 and I'm thinking that could be to clear up, like to kind of block any irregularities in the video

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.600
 that they're trying to put out as real.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.600
 So we talked about deep fakes before.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.600
 Now, it's funny because the first time I came across deep fakes,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.600
 ICE was seeing pornographic images of Gal Gadot's face on a porn star's body.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.600
 Natalie Portman's face on a porn star's body.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.600
 Daisy Ridley's face on a porn star's body,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.600
 and they were taking these huge celebrities and basically turning them into porn stars.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.600
 And very, very convincing, very, very convincing technology.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.600
 I had never seen a full-body deep fake before, but it's the same idea.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.600
 You take thousands of images, you have a source image,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.600
 and then you have the image you want to insert,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.600
 you remove one image in the porn videos, it would just be the original actress's face,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.600
 put the new face on top of it.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.600
 You could do the same thing here.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.600
 The Aliyah speaker, she has a shadow, she looks, it looks convincing.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.600
 Again, if she went up and talked about wheat products or the production of corn in Germany,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.600
 I would have had no reason to disbelieve it.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.600
 If the video hadn't started off saying, "Please don't record,"

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.600
 I would have had less reason to doubt it.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.600
 But the fact that they're like, "We're going to prosecute anyone who puts this out,"

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.600
 I was like, "Okay, they're kind of hyping it up a bit."

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.600
 But here's the interesting thing.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600
 So that's the story with that.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.600
 When I first saw the video, I was like, "Oh, I'll cover that when the break's over."

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.600
 It's pretty cut and dry.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.600
 You have a, what looks like a fraud when you look at all the evidence.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.600
 You have a video that seems suspicious,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.600
 and then you find the exact same video at higher quality

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.600
 of a different person giving a boring speech.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 Totally different speech.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.600
 So I go, "Well, that's pretty cut and dry."

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 But what happens next is what makes me suspicious about everything.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.600
 January 29th is the you and video uploaded to YouTube.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
 At least the one we can see.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.600
 I don't know about the one that supposedly got the account terminated,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.600
 but on January 29th is the video you can watch,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.600
 the video I have a link to.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.600
 January 29th was the same time they're like,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 "Nope, this is fake. Here's the Erdogan video."

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.600
 That whole story kind of happened relatively quickly.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.600
 But also what makes me suspicious about the story is on January 30th,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.600
 a viral news story goes up.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.600
 Look at these wacky deepfakes.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.600
 Look at Steve Buscemi's face on Jennifer Lawrence's body.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.600
 What? This is crazy.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.600
 Look at this wacky technology.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.600
 And it's weird because they could have had that same story.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 If you wanted to cover deepfakes that day,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.600
 if you wanted to make that a viral story,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.600
 the UFO video is a more convincing deepfake.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.600
 Because when you see the Steve Buscemi/Jennifer Lawrence thing,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 it looks grotesque.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.600
 It looks really, really weird.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.600
 It's not convincing in any way, shape, or form.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.600
 And I thought, why a day after the UN video comes out,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.600
 which is most likely a fake,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.600
 are they now pushing the story of deepfakes back into the media

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.600
 and showing us a ridiculous example?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.600
 And they did the same thing over the summer.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.600
 Over the summers when the trend began of the famous actresses

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 being put on porn stars' bodies,

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.600
 but when the media covered it, when they showed examples of it,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 they'd say, "Look at Nicholas Cage's face

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.600
 on all of these movie stars? What?"

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.600
 And I'm thinking, why don't--

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.600
 I'm not asking them to show porn on CNN,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.600
 but why don't they show at least still clips

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.600
 and they could be like, "This is this actress's face.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 This is Gal Gadot's face on Biloxi Blue's body or something."

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 That's convincing. The skin tone's the same.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.600
 You can't tell the difference.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.600
 The only reason you know it's fake is because Gal Gadot's never done porn.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.600
 That's the reason you factually know that video is not real.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.600
 So why, if they have that, did they push the Nicholas Cage's face

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.600
 in the middle of Game of Thrones or whatever it was?

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.600
 Why when they have a semi-convincing deepfake

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.600
 of someone giving a speech to the United Nations General Assembly about UFOs,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.600
 do you show how wacky deepfakes are because you have Jennifer Lawrence

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.600
 with this grotesque-- sorry, Steve Bishammy,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 but like this weird-looking face?

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.600
 I think because ultimately deepfake technology, they warn us about it.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.600
 I think their concern is rogue actors using deepfake technology.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.600
 I think the government, I think certain powerful people

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.600
 want to use it for their benefit,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 so they don't want to really show us how convincing it can actually be.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.600
 Because this Ewan video, like I said, if she went up and talked about trade tariffs

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.600
 and someone showed me that video, I'd be like, "Why are you showing me this?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600
 This is super boring."

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.600
 And then they'd go, "That never happened. That's fake."

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.600
 I'd have been like, "What?"

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.600
 It's very convincing.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.600
 I think deepfake technology is being planned to be used--

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.600
 and people go, "Oh, it's going to be used for Pizzagate.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.600
 If Hillary Clinton never gets videotaped eating a baby,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.600
 I don't think it's ever going to be anything like that."

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.600
 I think when deepfake technology actually is used,

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.600
 it's going to be something super mundane that no one will really question it.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.600
 When you talk about UFOs and Satanic worship and all sorts of this crazy stuff,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.600
 it's easy for a skeptic to go, "Well, that's obviously not true."

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.600
 But if they want to have a video of the president talking about a new trade plan with Italy,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.600
 where we're going to basically give them all of our money,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.600
 or that's kind of ridiculous too,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600
 but you know what I mean?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.600
 Like, something relatively boring, people won't question that.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.600
 And I think there's an actual effort to warn people about deepfakes,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.600
 but not warn them at how realistic they can be.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.600
 Very odd timing.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.600
 The Steve Buscemi video was uploaded the same day as the Ewan video.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.600
 The story got reported the next morning.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:10.600
 So while all the UFOologists were still debating over the authenticity of this Ewan General Assembly video,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.600
 all of these news websites were like,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.600
 "Pfft, look at this technology! Can you believe it? It's 2019!"

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.600
 Weird. Very, very convenient timing.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.600
 Very convenient timing.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.600
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.600
 Now, our next story was actually a request from Joshua from YouTube,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.600
 and it is one of the ones that I have found the most intriguing on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.600
 Just the idea I've always found interesting.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.600
 "Mideval found footage." The phrase itself is very evocative,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.600
 because it makes you think of one of two things.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 Well, three.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600
 One, it's fake. It's totally made up.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.600
 It's just three words strung together.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.600
 But that's boring.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.600
 People always go, "What? That's just fake!"

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.600
 And I'm like, "Yeah, probably!"

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.600
 But that's not a fun podcast.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.600
 They'll just be like, "Ah, it's fake."

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.600
 Like, either it's fake for a reason,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.600
 or you go, "It's fake, but..."

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.600
 Let's pretend it's not for a second.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.600
 So, it is possibly just three words strung together.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.600
 However, this one has a bit of meat to it.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.600
 So, it's one of three things. It's either fake.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.600
 It involves time travel, which is a nice theory,

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.600
 which is nice, it's evocative.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.600
 And then there's one that I think is more accurate.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.600
 And, and, it's pretty, pretty cool.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.600
 So, we've already addressed, maybe it's fake,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.600
 maybe it's something people put together, whatever.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.600
 I don't like, you know, maybe. But that's boring.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.600
 Time travel.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.600
 The idea of time travel, I think,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.600
 kind of touches people on a personal level,

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.600
 because it addresses two things.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.600
 It addresses changing the past,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.600
 because everyone has regrets.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.600
 Time travel touches on the idea that

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.600
 we can change our past.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.600
 And two, I think a lot of people

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.600
 don't necessarily wish they could live forever.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.600
 But for me, I want to see what comes next.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.600
 I personally think it would be more fascinating

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.600
 to travel into the future, to see what happens next.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.600
 And time travel plays on both of those.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.600
 Like, I could fall asleep and wake up a thousand years from now

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.600
 and be like, "Oh my God, this is awesome.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.600
 There's like robots or apocalyptic wasteland.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.600
 Everyone's dead and I'm just kind of stumbling around

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.600
 until I fall and my glasses break

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.600
 and I go, "All the books in the world!"

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.600
 That's what interesting thing about time travel.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.600
 It kind of plays on both of those things.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.600
 So, let's address the time travel theory first.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.600
 And that would be that some archaeologists

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.600
 go or are like digging around in England.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.600
 They like got their shovels and the cops are like,

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.600
 "Oh, oh, oh, you don't have a permit!"

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.600
 And they're like, "Ah, whatever. Where are archaeologists

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.600
 throwing dirt in the cops' face?"

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.600
 They keep digging.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.600
 The cops are trying to arrest them.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.600
 And not the hammer, the shovel goes, "Tink, tink!"

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.600
 Hit something and the cops are like, "What's that?"

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.600
 The archaeologist goes, "It looks like some sort of film case."

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.600
 (imitates gunshot)

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.600
 Test it off.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.600
 Pull it out and it's a real film.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.600
 And they're like, "Hmm, do you have a projector?"

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.600
 And the cops are like, "No, we're cops!

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.600
 We don't even have guns over here.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.600
 Why would you think we'd have a projector?"

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.600
 Eventually, though, the archaeologists pay their bail.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 They go to a local cinema, put the film on the projector

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.600
 and what they see is literal found footage.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.600
 They see film of these medieval people

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.600
 kind of dancing around, doing their stuff,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.600
 making clay pots, looking miserable all the time.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.600
 Knights are beating them up.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.600
 They're all dying.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.600
 Every movie ends with them dying of the bubonic plague.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600
 The end.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.600
 And the archaeologists are like,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.600
 "This is impossible.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.600
 It's encased in this metal tin.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.600
 It's shot on this camera

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.600
 that we are actually able to string up to a projector.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.600
 Maybe it's on like Super IMAX film.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.600
 Maybe it's digital film from the future.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.600
 But it's found footage.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.600
 And the idea would be that at some point

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.600
 somebody traveled back in time to the medieval period,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.600
 filmed them doing their things.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.600
 Maybe they're hamming it up for the camera.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.600
 Maybe it's a little Punch and Judy show.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.600
 Maybe they were videotaping something

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.600
 and the time travelers dressed up as medieval people

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.600
 walking around their hidden camera.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.600
 And they're like, "Hey, what are you writing?"

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.600
 He's like, "I'm a writing stuff."

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.600
 And they're like, "Well, that's obvious that you're writing stuff.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600
 What are you writing?"

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.600
 He's like, "Oh, nothing.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.600
 I just have stories in my head sometime.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.600
 I call this one Romeo and Juliet."

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.600
 And they're like, "Oh, your hand name doesn't happen

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600
 to be William Shakespeare."

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600
 He's like, "They call me Billy.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.600
 That's in the found footage."

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.600
 And obviously, apparently it has audio as well.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.600
 But anyways, they find this footage

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.600
 and for whatever reason they leave it behind.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600
 For us to find.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.600
 Because if it was just time travelers going back in time,

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.600
 filming a bunch of dudes dancing around

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.600
 and Billy Shakespeare,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.600
 and then went to the future, we wouldn't know it was there.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.600
 So that theory is completely ridiculous, obviously.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.600
 And not because I don't believe in time travel,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.600
 because I do, to a sense.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.600
 But this would require, one, time travelers to travel back

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.600
 to medieval times.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.600
 Two, to time travel back to medieval times,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.600
 and use technology that we would be able to view.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.600
 We can't even view, right,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.600
 if someone gave me a laser disk right now, I'd be SOL.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.600
 Like, I'd be like, "Hey, thanks.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.600
 What am I gonna do with this?

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600
 It's a giant coaster."

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.600
 I can't even view laser disk technology.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.600
 By the time we have time machines going back and forth in time,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.600
 they're not gonna be using SD cards.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.600
 They're not even gonna be using film.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.600
 What would they use?

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.600
 It would be the same thing.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.600
 Yeah, actually, if I had a cell phone,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.600
 if I went back in time,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.600
 I'd be like, "Oh, I'm gonna use a cell phone.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.600
 I had a cell phone.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.600
 If I went back in time and I left my cell phone in the 1980s

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.600
 and I pulled down my SD card,

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.600
 they'd be like, "Well, okay, your fingernail fell off,

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.600
 robot man."

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.600
 Like, they'd have no way of even knowing what was on it.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.600
 So, that theory, while it is interesting,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.600
 because it's sci-fi-ish, it's not very likely at all.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.600
 And I don't think that's what medieval found footage refers to.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.600
 I've seen that theory bandied around a couple times.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.600
 They're like, "Oh, it's about time travelers going back in time."

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.600
 I don't really think that it is what it refers to.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.600
 But I do think the theory has some meat,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.600
 and I think this version is more interesting

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.600
 because it's quite possibly true.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.600
 Let's say the year is 1568.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.600
 A couple peasants running around in the field.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.600
 I apparently, in my version of medieval times,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.600
 they just dance and run and don't do any work.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.600
 It was actually quite grueling.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.600
 They worked from sundown to sunup or the other way around.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.600
 They would be working the night.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.600
 They worked from sunup to sundown.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.600
 And then they'd sit at home in front of the fireplace

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.600
 and try to forget their miserable existence.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.600
 So, but anyways, in my version,

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.600
 they're just running around through the fields.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.600
 They're like, "Gerald, Gerald, go back to your chores!"

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.600
 And he's like, "No way! I'm out of here!"

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.600
 It's 15, whatever year I said before.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.600
 I don't even remember at this point.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.600
 And these peasants were playing in the woods, and this night...

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.600
 [imitates sound of a gunshot]

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.600
 I don't know what this effect was.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.600
 This night rides up to the peasants and is like,

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.600
 "The king requires your service, peasants."

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.600
 And they're like, "Oh, yeah, whatever you say, knight.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.600
 What are we supposed to do?"

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:18.600
 And the knight's like, "The king is making a movie."

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.600
 The peasants would be like, "What? What's a movie?"

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.600
 And the knight's like, "I don't know."

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.600
 You know how hard it is to shrug an armor,

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.600
 but I'm gonna do it anyways. I don't know.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.600
 The horse is like, "Wah, wah, wah."

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.600
 They all go back to the castle.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.600
 Now, we know the history of film.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.600
 It's very, very well documented.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.600
 Partially because film is a document in and of itself.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.600
 It's a chemical process, and I'm not gonna bore you with the details of it,

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.600
 because it's easily you can find on Wikipedia.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.600
 Again, all the links are below.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.600
 But we can trace it back quite a while.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.600
 And before we were capturing...

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.600
 'Cause really, I say I'm not gonna bore you with the process,

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.600
 but all film is, is a series of pictures.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.600
 And there's... It's weird.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.600
 On film, I don't know if it's the same with digital,

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.600
 but on film there's a black bar between each frame,

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.600
 but our brain doesn't pick up the black bar,

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.600
 'cause we have this thing called like continuity of image.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.600
 And it's weird now, 'cause think about it,

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.600
 when you sit down and you watch a film,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.600
 you're actually seeing a black image.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.600
 Oh, what is it? 32 frames per second,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.600
 so you're seeing a black image 32 times every second,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.600
 and your brain just doesn't process it.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.600
 And what's weird is I'm sure some people's brains do.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.600
 I'm sure there are some people whose brains don't work right,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.600
 and it must be maddening to have to watch a movie,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.600
 'cause they'd be like, "Oh my God, people like this?

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.600
 "Like, I'm just seeing a bunch of black every once in a while."

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600
 Normal people don't see it.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.600
 But anyway, so all it is, is a series of photographs,

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.600
 played very, very rapidly.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.600
 Same thing with like, "You guys know what film is."

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.600
 So, between film, we can go all the way back,

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.600
 thousands, probably about a thousand years, if not farther.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.600
 So something called the camera obscura,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.600
 and that was film without film.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.600
 It was only what was going on outside.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.600
 That was basically a black room with a peephole,

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.600
 not like a pervert's peephole,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.600
 but a peephole that allowed sunlight to come in,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.600
 and the image was like, "Reverse on the wall."

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.600
 It got real complicated for me to follow on this stuff,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.600
 but that allowed you that if you sat in this dark room

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.600
 through this, looking against the wall,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.600
 you could see what was going on outside.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.600
 Now, obviously, you could just leave the dark room

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.600
 and see what was going on outside.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.600
 But it was an early form of a projected image.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.600
 People say that cave paintings on walls

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 could have been brought from some sort of camera obscura.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.600
 That religious practices could have involved the camera obscura

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.600
 thousands of years ago.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.600
 Could have been the way to tell stories of myths and legends

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.600
 by basically creating this type of room

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.600
 and having people acting it out,

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.600
 and then it appears on the wall.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.600
 So the camera obscura, Leonardo da Vinci used one.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.600
 A bunch of other old people used one.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.600
 I think Leonardo da Vinci was the one who actually made it popular.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.600
 He made it fetch.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.600
 He created the mainstream version of it.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.600
 And then in 1827, that's when some guy says,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.600
 "You know what? I'm going to use that same process,

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.600
 but I'm going to take a piece of polished pewter plate

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.600
 with Peter Peckle."

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.600
 And I'm going to help him with this.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.600
 A polished pewter plate,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.600
 and he covered it with something called bitmen of Judea.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.600
 The sunlight hits the plate using the same thing as the camera obscura.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.600
 And after eight hours,

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.600
 he's able to wipe off everything that the sun didn't burn in.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.600
 This is a weird process, and then he has an image on a plate

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.600
 of what was outside.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.600
 That is the first, like, here is an image.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 You didn't have to be here to see this.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.600
 Obviously it took eight hours,

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.600
 so they didn't have any pictures of people back then.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.600
 So you go, Jason.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.600
 You said camera obscuras existed for a long time,

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.600
 and then in 1827 is the first time we have a photograph,

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.600
 and a photograph is a stepping stone to a film.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.600
 So how do you equate that with medieval times?

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.600
 Well, to do that, I'm actually going to talk about

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.600
 another recommendation I got.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.600
 A while back, I got an email from a gentleman named Gary,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.600
 and we were talking about Terare, the guy who could eat anything,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.600
 which I love that episode.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.600
 He ate a gold fork, and the gold fork never came out,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.600
 and so the idea is that he dissolved it.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.600
 And Gary emailed me, and he sent me a link to something called aqua regia.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.600
 Now aqua regia was a chemical,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.600
 it was a chemical combination that could be used to dissolve gold and platinum,

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.600
 and completely dissolve it.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.600
 So aqua regia was this chemical that was made,

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.600
 and you're like, okay, that's a cute story,

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.600
 but what does that have to do with anything you're talking about?

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:58.600
 It was first mentioned in 1300 AD, and then in 1600 AD,

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.600
 the next time we see a reference to this,

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.600
 it was written out not as a chemical composition

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 or how the chemicals work together,

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.600
 it was instead a riddle.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:17.600
 It was a drawing that explained this advanced chemical process as an image.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.600
 And the process said, the process showed, a dragon,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.600
 and then a fox eating a rooster, and the rooster eating the fox.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.600
 And then this is how they deciphered this.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.600
 It said, the rooster symbolizes gold, and the fox represents aqua regia.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.600
 Obviously there was some sort of key code, some guy just wasn't looking at it and going,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.600
 oh yeah, that's what that means, but the repetitive dissolving,

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.600
 heating, and re-dissolving, the rooster eating the fox,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.600
 eating the rooster, leads to the buildup of chlorine gas in the flask.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.600
 The golden crystallizes in the form of gold chloride,

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.600
 whose red crystals were known as dragon's blood.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.600
 So you had the initial recipe of what it does in 1300 AD.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.600
 You then have this coded drawing in 1600 AD.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:07.600
 The reaction was not listed in chemical literature at all until 1890.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:13.600
 So in that time period, people had invented the process or discovered the process in 1300.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:24.600
 It was referenced again 300 years later, and then it took another 200 years before anyone ever wrote it down again.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.600
 But it was still being practiced.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.600
 And in that time period, if those original documents were destroyed for whatever reason,

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.600
 it would have been lost until it was "discovered" in 1890.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:44.600
 So who's not to say that all film is a chemical process involving light and material and a chemical?

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.600
 Dark rooms and stuff like that, you're mixing these chemicals together,

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.600
 you take an image onto a piece of material, there's not magic.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.600
 Now I get it, the magic of the cinema and all that stuff, it's great, it's silver screen, all that nonsense.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.600
 But it's not actual magic, it is a chemical process.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:08.600
 Who's not to say that the chemical process wasn't discovered in 1827, but it was discovered before then,

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.600
 the proof we have that it was discovered is gone?

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.600
 Is that a supposition? Absolutely. Do I have any proof of that? No.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.600
 I can look at these other things that were lost and then rediscovered.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.600
 I can say, well, this stuff happened.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.600
 The biggest obstacle to the idea of medieval found footage is this.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.600
 That it took eight hours to produce an image back then.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:38.600
 I don't want to say, well, maybe they found a quicker way to do it because that's taking it more into the fantastical.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.600
 I want to stick with the technology we know they had.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:46.600
 They had a magic lantern, no, not literal, they had a thing called a magic lantern,

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.600
 that you'd have a little image, it's basically a side projector back then.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:55.600
 The magic lantern was like in the 1500s, it was in the medieval times.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.600
 In the medieval times they had this thing called the magic lantern.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.600
 It was a projector, it was the evolution of the camera obscura,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.600
 but instead of seeing what was outside, you could have a little piece of glass that was hand-painted,

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.600
 and you'd put it in and you'd put a candle in it or sunlight or whatever,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.600
 and it would project the image on the wall, just like a slide projector.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.600
 And then people said, you know what, let's put two slides in it,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.600
 and you could show like a little cartoon guy juggling.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:29.600
 So the basics of the technology were there, projection, glass slides, animation to a degree.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.600
 You would definitely see the black switch there as the machine slowly clicked over,

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.600
 but this technology was in wide use.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:43.600
 So the only thing we have to add to have medieval found footage is the real people.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.600
 They have the slides of the two people juggling or whatever they want to do, the two little cartoon people dancing,

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:52.600
 but for found footage I want footage of people.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:58.600
 Is it possible that there was film footage of people in the medieval times?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.600
 Again, the biggest obstacle to it is people having to stand still for eight hours,

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.600
 but that's why I use the King example, because you're a peasant,

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.600
 you're going to get your head chopped off if you don't stand in the same spot for eight hours,

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.600
 and then you just move slightly for the next one, and move slightly for the next one,

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.600
 and move slightly for the next one.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.600
 It would take, you know, a month to have a good five minutes of footage,

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.600
 and you know, you figure maybe they're sitting down in chairs,

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:34.600
 but it's not an insurmountable hurdle to have someone sit in a chair for eight hours,

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.600
 and then after that move their arms slightly, and it would be a great,

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:44.600
 imagine going to a King's house, and he's like, "You know, have you ever heard of a witch?"

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:50.600
 And his guests are like, "Well, of course, witches are real, we have to kill twelve of them getting here."

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.600
 And King goes, "Have you ever heard of the Blair Witch?"

00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.600
 And then he has this found footage movie. Well, it's not found to him, he owns it, he made it.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.600
 But imagine going to a royal court, and people being like, "Oh, look at my magic lantern,

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.600
 it's two images of this cartoon guy juggling," and the King's like, "That sucks.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.600
 Here's Transformers 4. It took me eight years to film, but I did it."

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.600
 It is possible, even using the technology, the only thing that's not possible

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.600
 is you have to go along with me on the journey, that the technology got a little more advanced

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.600
 between 1500 and 1827 regarding that chemical process.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:40.600
 And the fact that we, I can say, here's another chemical process that was not mentioned for 200 years.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:45.600
 People were doing it in that time period, but it wasn't mentioned for 200 years.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:52.600
 I think there is medieval found footage. I think that it is very likely that some archaeologists found this stuff.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.600
 Why it wasn't released? I don't know.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.600
 Now, I want to put money, I think it's likely, but I want to put money on it.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.600
 But it may be out there. There may be footage of the real Blair Witch.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.600
 There, it is a documentary. It was an actual witch they were chasing around.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.600
 King standing in the corner of the castle at the end, camera falls, breaks, it's over.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.600
 I think the idea of medieval found footage is very intriguing.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.600
 And I, it's one of those conspiracy theories that I actually really like.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:26.600
 Because it's a good one. It's a happy conspiracy theory. It's we are more advanced than we think we are.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.600
 We're more clever as a species than we think we are.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:40.600
 That 300, 400 years before the official invention of something, someone came up with it, used it for entertainment, for documentation, whatever.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.600
 There's not a lot of positive conspiracy theories out there.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:49.600
 But one of them that we're actually smarter than we give ourselves credit for,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.600
 that's a good conspiracy theory.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.600
