00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.600
 Did a homeless man get help from a Good Samaritan, or is he a singular victim of the Mandela

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 Effect?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.880
 And then we travel to a recording studio where a young man feverishly writes out lyrics to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.840
 his newest album.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.000
 But these lyrics aren't coming from a creative mind.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 They're coming from the Book of the Dead, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.100
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.000
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started right away.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.040
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone give it up for one of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 our Christmas livestream contributors, Kamau Kokai Taylor.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 Woohoo, yeah, come on in, come on in.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.040
 Kamau, Kamau, I don't even know if these people still even listen to this show, right?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.640
 They donated money back in December, but Kamau, you're going to be our captain, our pilot

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 this episode.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.360
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or the livestream, I totally understand.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.840
 Just help spread the word about this show.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.360
 That helps out so much.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.000
 Kamau, let's go ahead and toss you the bunny bicycle.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.560
 Little hop on the handlebars as you pedal us all the way out to Colorado Springs, Colorado.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.600
 I got to come up with a better special effect than that.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 People are like, what?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 Is my dog, is my dog panting near my leg?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.720
 Kamau's pedaling us all the way out to Colorado Springs, Colorado.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.880
 This is a really recent paranormal conspiracy story.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.320
 This all started back in June of 2022.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.120
 This guy posted this story online.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.760
 He went by the name Revolutionary25485.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.200
 I don't have his actual real name.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.640
 We're going to call him Cody.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.800
 That'll be his name for this story.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.960
 And Cody is currently a homeless dude living in his car.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.120
 And he's like, you know, it kind of sucks not having a house and all that stuff.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.120
 But luckily the weather's warm enough.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.480
 I can just sit in my car, kick back.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.480
 I don't know if he has a job.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.640
 Well, okay, let's put it this way.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.440
 I did go through his posting history.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.200
 He's up to something, but we don't know what this guy's situation is.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.000
 All we know is that he's homeless and he lives in his car.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.400
 And he says this, he cannot explain what happened.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.880
 And I can't either.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.400
 This is absolutely fascinating.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.480
 He said that his car has heavy oxidation on the car headlights.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.760
 And the passenger quarter panel, which is that piece of like fiberglass or metal or

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.640
 whatever it's made out of that goes from the headlight all the way to the passenger

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 door.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640
 It's like this big pan.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.640
 I had a look at it up.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.120
 If you guys were like, Jason, we know what a quarter panel is.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.120
 I was like, huh?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.400
 I don't look it up.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.680
 That big piece of plastic or fiberglass, whatever it's made out of steel that goes from the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.960
 passenger side door to the headlight on the passenger side was covered in a good layer

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.960
 of dirt.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.960
 Dirty car, dirty headlights.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.760
 I don't know what the state of the rest of the car was.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.640
 I don't know just that part was muddy.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.840
 I don't know what the state of the rest of the car was, but these are the parts that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.960
 are important to this story.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.920
 And he's aware of this, right?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.280
 We're all pretty familiar with the bumps and scrapes and scratches of our cars.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.560
 Well one day he's walking to his car because even though he's homeless and living in his

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.640
 car, I'm sure he's like getting out to get food.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.400
 I don't think he's cooking rotisserie chicken in the back seat.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:17.040
 At one point back in June, he's walking around his car and he notices that the passenger side

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.200
 quarter panel is cleaned off completely.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.720
 And not only is it cleaned off completely, it's brand new.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.080
 Just the quarter panel.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.840
 And then he looks and he looks at his headlight and his driver's side headlight, heavy oxidation

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.400
 on it, passenger side headlight, brand new headlight.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.080
 That whole area was replaced.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.680
 And he has no idea what's happened to this.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.280
 And what's interesting is when you look at the comments of people trying to help him,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.880
 it makes it very clear very quickly that nobody knows what could have caused this.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.240
 Some people said, "Well, maybe you were cooking a rotisserie chicken in your car."

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.640
 They actually said, "Maybe you were breathing in too much carbon monoxide because you left

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.240
 your car on all the time."

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.600
 Because nobody knows where this guy's at.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.840
 I had to figure out that he was in Colorado Springs.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.600
 But he just said, "No, the place I'm at is really warm right now, so no.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.840
 And gas is $5 a gallon.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.480
 So no, I'm not running my car all the time."

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.200
 So because people are all, you know, thinking maybe it's carbon monoxide because the post-it

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.200
 notes guy.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.280
 And that's a story about a guy who was slowly having carbon monoxide poisoning.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.840
 He was leaving weird post-it notes around his own house.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.160
 And he thought his house was haunted because he'd find stuff out of place, but it was really

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.160
 him.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160
 Bear with me, it's a story.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.920
 It's something that people talk about all the time on ghost forums now.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.480
 And someone would go, "It was weird.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.080
 My daughter began levitating around the room and vomiting."

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.120
 And people were like, "Well, check out this theory about carbon monoxide.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.760
 I don't think all ghost accounts could be for carbon monoxide."

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.200
 And then the idea of that in relation to this means this guy was up in fumes for so long.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.640
 He went to the pet boys, bought a new quarter panel, bought a new headlight, didn't remember

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.560
 doing either, installed them, didn't remember doing either, and then discovered them one

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.360
 day.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.400
 So I mean, I guess you can hallucinate that much.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.200
 You're at that boys, you're all meh, thrown up everywhere.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.680
 They're like, "Ohh, sir, we'll help you.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.840
 Just please stop hovering around."

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.720
 You have that theory, right?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.880
 And which, okay, fine, that's probably the best rational theory you can come up with.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.200
 Then a bunch of people said this was just insane.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.920
 They said, "Well, dude, maybe someone hit you with their car and felt really bad about

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.120
 it, but figured they don't want to get the insurance agents."

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.800
 This is a couple people who actually said this.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.320
 This is so stupid.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.160
 They said, "Maybe when you weren't in your car," because he's not in it 24/7, "Maybe

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.240
 when you weren't in the car," there was a car accident.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.080
 Someone crashed into your car, and instead of leaving a note saying, "Sorry, I crashed

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.520
 into your car, here's my insurance information," instead of getting the insurance companies

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.680
 involved, instead of just doing a hit and run, which I think is what most people did,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.840
 they replaced your front quarter panel and your head of light.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.760
 They did it when you weren't there.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.360
 They hit a car and they're like, "Oh no, listen, I get the insurance involved.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.720
 Luckily I have this guy's exact car parts in the backseat of my car."

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.480
 He's like, "I don't think it's anything more polite than I would have been."

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.520
 I was like, "You guys are all idiots."

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.120
 He goes, "I don't really think so.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.360
 I don't know when they would have been able to replace everything.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.720
 I do live in my car.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.400
 Even though I'm not in the car all the time, you think I would have just walked by when

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.400
 I saw two or three guys reinstalling parts of my car."

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.040
 He has no idea what could have caused this.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.800
 He does mention the Mandela effect as far as being part of this.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.800
 Now, obviously, when we talk about the stories, it could be totally made up.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.360
 God, I would hate it if it's the start of some ARG that I got tricked into.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.880
 But yeah, that's the story we have.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.040
 What could have caused this?

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.760
 It definitely seems...

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.840
 It's one of those paranormal stories that is so mundane.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.340
 I love it.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.680
 It's so mundane.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.880
 It's not like... and then he saw the three pet boys there, ghosts are floating around.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.280
 They're like, "We're sorry.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280
 You're homeless.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280
 Homeless."

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.280
 They fade away.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280
 You know what I mean?

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.480
 Actually, we've been pretty bragged about it.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.160
 I do like extreme ghost stories as well.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.880
 But it has to be one of the two.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.160
 It has to be so insane that you can't believe it.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.200
 Or so mundane, you think, "Why would someone lie about this?"

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.880
 This is just one of those little mysteries.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.440
 Who replaced his front quarter panel and his headlights?

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.040
 It's a brand new headlight, right?

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.040
 Brand new front quarter panel.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.520
 So who knows?

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.400
 He brings up the Mandela effect.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.880
 At a certain point, what would your options be?

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.200
 Mandela effect, quantum death, right?

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.840
 He died in one reality and shifted into another reality.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.760
 That's exactly the same.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.440
 He's still homeless, but this time he has a new quarter panel and a new headlight.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.120
 I mean, what could it be?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.800
 When we look at the lore, I can't think of anything else outside of those two, right?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.120
 Cern firing up.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.640
 We all went to the headlight universe this time instead of some big change.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.840
 It's a little change like that.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.640
 So I wanted to find out more about this guy.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.480
 I always like to do this when I'm able to.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.200
 I was looking through his posting history.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.120
 He's only posted about two things.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.960
 Technically three, but two or three things.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.400
 The first one being his car.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.640
 He posted about this a couple times.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.040
 And then you can look at all this in the show notes.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:52.240
 And then he posted on two other subreddits where he was trying to get laid.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.280
 So I mean, I guess he has priorities in order, right?

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.280
 He's living on the streets.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.280
 He's living in his car.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.080
 The universe may be slowly repairing his vehicle.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.640
 And then he's trying to have oral sex with some girl who goes by the name unlucky hedgehog.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.120
 Dude, don't roll the dice on that one.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.000
 Do not roll the dice on that one.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.360
 That's how I found out he was in Colorado Springs because he was commenting on subreddits

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:24.200
 for Colorado Springs, like sexy springers or something like that, or ColoradoSpringsHookups.com,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.360
 wherever it was.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.600
 That's where our intrepid Mandela adventure is also spending his time.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.880
 So be safe, young traveler.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.960
 And then with the car part, who knows what that could possibly be?

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.880
 How could you explain that?

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:47.400
 If I had to guess a theory, I would say quantum death, right?

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.400
 Where you shift into another, you die and then you shift into another universe that's

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.360
 almost unrecognizable from the one that you're in.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.320
 But I don't even know if I'm a huge believer in that.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.260
 I'm intrigued by the theory, but I don't know if I'm a huge believer in that.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.280
 So who knows?

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.480
 It's truly a mystery what happened to this dude's car.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.480
 And will it happen again?

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.600
 I'll keep looking at his posts and they're watched.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.440
 They just all be swinging your posts from here on.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.960
 I'm like, oh man, I'm still checking.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960
 Come out.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.640
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.000
 We're leaving behind Colorado Springs, Colorado.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.840
 We're going to head all the way out to a recording studio.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.160
 I found this story the other day on the X-Board.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:40.120
 There was a post about a band called The Mars Volta and a cursed album they were working

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.480
 on.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.400
 And I actually have all the notes for that story as well.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.280
 I had to make a choice though.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:52.160
 I had to make a choice between doing a full segment on the Mars Volta cursed album.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160
 What was it called again?

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.800
 Like walking towards Goliath or Trouble in Goliath?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.200
 Bedlam in Goliath was the name of that album.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:06.360
 I read a bunch of articles about it and listened to a couple of their songs and wrote up a

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.920
 detailed thing about their cursed album, Bedlam in Goliath.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.600
 But I've decided to tell this story instead.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.360
 This story was posted in relation to that X-Board post.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.920
 Someone goes, you know what?

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.920
 Something like this happened to me and they wrote this down.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.080
 I had to choose between the two and I figured the Mars Volta story and who knows, maybe

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.080
 we'll cover it in the future.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.880
 They're just so similar.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.680
 They're almost beat for beat and I would rather cover the one that's more obscure.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.680
 The Mars Volta one.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.200
 If you're a fan of the Mars Volta then you're probably familiar with this story.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.080
 If you're not, I'll put some links in the show notes of this episode so you can research

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.080
 it.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.640
 But the story I'm about to tell you has been told basically twice ever on the internet.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.120
 The guy said, I talked about this a couple of months ago and I didn't, nobody really

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.960
 cared, nobody really cared, right?

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960
 Nobody really cared.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.960
 Who's this dude?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.840
 And then he told the story again on this Mars Volta thread.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.200
 So I wanted to cover this one because this one will just disappear into the ether.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.560
 The Mars Volta one, it's pretty well documented.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.160
 Some people say it was just a publicity stunt.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.280
 Who knows?

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.680
 This one I like because it's not a publicity stunt because we don't know any of the people,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.080
 we don't know the name of the album, we don't even know where the story took place.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.800
 But let's go ahead and get this story started.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.280
 Maybe someday I'll do the Mars Volta but again it's almost beat for beat the same story because

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.040
 I would imagine if both stories are true they would follow the same pattern.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.920
 Or come into contact with any sort of cursed media.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.120
 Would probably follow along the same path.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.400
 Let's get the story started here.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.680
 Back in 1977 there was a book published called The Necromonon.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.080
 It was originally a fiction, just a brief overview here.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.440
 A lot of you guys may be familiar with this but originally HP Lovecraft as a narrative

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:03.720
 device in his stories and his shared universe, the HPU, he created this book called The Necromonon

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.640
 that could be used to contact the Elder Gods that had all these dark rituals that the followers

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.320
 of Cthulhu and Blacky Cactoon, Yachtlackugan, all those dudes, right?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.600
 Probably just summoned one or two.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.800
 This is how you got ahold of them.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.880
 This is basically their cell phone, The Necromonon.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.200
 And he totally made it up.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.600
 He's very very clear he made it up.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.040
 There's nothing to it.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:34.360
 There is no real Necromonon and HP Lovecraft for years would be contacted by people asking

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.440
 where he got it or where they can get a copy and he'd be like it's fake.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.800
 What are you talking about?

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.520
 So of course eventually someone's going to publish a book called The Necromonon.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:49.480
 In 1977 there was a book called The Necromonon and generally it's referred to as Simon Necromonon

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:56.720
 because it was written by a, well, this should not be a brief overview but again I want to

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.160
 let you guys know how this book was crafted here.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:06.120
 So there was a guy who supposedly was named Simon who gathered up all of these spells

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:12.080
 and these rituals and found the Journal of the Mad Arab and put all this stuff together

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.920
 and published it as the Necromonon.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.960
 But people are like the Necromonon doesn't exist.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.080
 But this supposedly was the real Necromonon.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.720
 You can buy it at like a Barnes and Noble or an Amazon.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.320
 I got my copy at like a bookstore in the mall.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.160
 Like what were the, I don't even remember, Walden Books is where you could buy them anywhere

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.320
 but it was supposed to be this dark book of the dead.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.840
 These spells could actually summon.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:40.560
 The dark ones, I don't think Walden Books had anything legit like that, right?

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.720
 Well what's interesting about this is it has been called a hoax because people can, we

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.360
 know the Necromonon doesn't exist.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.520
 This book doesn't exist.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:53.000
 H.P. Lovecraft made up the character of the Mad Arab but you're saying you found a Journal

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 of a Fictional Character.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.480
 They'd be like finding the Journal of R2D2, right?

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.640
 It doesn't exist and they believe that Simon was a fictional character.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.840
 It was written by a guy named Peter LeVenda who was an occult history author and that

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.200
 he created Simon, he created this whole thing.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.840
 Now that's the, when I read it I knew going, and I didn't read it, it was super boring,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.600
 but when I bought it and read the first couple pages I knew that it was fictional.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.440
 A lot of people who get it, I'd say most people who buy it know that it's fictional but nowadays

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:30.000
 people go, here's the thing, with a lot of grim walls, these books of collections of

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.560
 spells, basically they are just collections of spells, right?

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.320
 Some might be real and some might be fake and this is the tradition that there's always

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.320
 been.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.000
 And so there are some sources that say yes, the Mad Arab is fake and Simon is fake and

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.840
 a lot of the Necromonon, the book that you buy at the bookstore is fake, however some

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:57.080
 of the rituals are real because that is the ancient way of collecting these things.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.400
 Do you think Peter actually sat down and made up ritual after ritual after ritual or did

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.880
 he just include some?

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.240
 There's been accounts of plagiarism and all sorts of stuff.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.720
 But in general the book is considered a work of fiction.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.360
 So I wanted to be very clear on that because this fictional book is going to have some

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.600
 real life consequences and what's really interesting is the people in this story also believe the

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:27.080
 book's fictional for a while.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.880
 Let's take a look at the story, this guy's name, we don't know it, right?

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.200
 He posted this anonymously on the X-board, we're going to call him Philip.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.200
 And he's at work and his co-worker's reading a copy of the Necromonon, I don't know where

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.680
 they're working, where you can just be in the break room, you're feet up on a table and

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.200
 you're like oh you need to sacrifice 11 men for the dagger of Tiamet.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.520
 Oh that's why they didn't work, I only sacrificed 10.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.560
 He's reading the book, the co-worker's reading the book Necromonon and Philip showed a little

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.680
 bit of an intro, hello what are you reading over there man?

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.840
 And they started talking about it, co-worker goes you want it?

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.120
 Which probably might, probably what I would say too because it was super boring, here

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120
 you want it?

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.000
 And I was like yeah sure, you know, I'll take it and he starts reading over the next couple

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.560
 of days, couple of weeks.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.040
 And he goes, you know he's just reading it casually, it's fictional, he knows it's fictional,

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.960
 doesn't really take it seriously, but it's a fun read, it kind of takes you into this

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.760
 world where these things may exist.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:26.080
 And he said one day I was out reading it, there was a man, he walked by with his family,

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.040
 he goes this guy was a total wasp man, not like a big old bug when he's like oh no I

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.000
 have some of the dark ones.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.280
 Wasp is an old term, just by him using the term wasp, I bet you this guy's as old as

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:43.580
 I am, it's white Anglo Saxon Protestant, it was an old slang term for basically leave

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.200
 it to beaver type dudes, right?

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.160
 Very clean cut, looks like they go to church twice a week, wasps, I don't think they use

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.400
 that term anymore, I could be wrong.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.200
 But anyways he goes this real waspy looking guy walked by, the man turns, looks at Philip

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.200
 and asks, Phil's reading this book, the man goes so what are you reading?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.080
 There's something about the book called his eye, right?

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:12.520
 And Philip goes oh the necromonon, and that's when the man, he turned to his wife and his

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.960
 kid and says hey why don't you guys keep on walking, why don't you guys just go somewhere,

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.920
 go somewhere else, go check on the millions of eggs you laid honey.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:29.600
 And so they walk away and he turns back to Phil and goes hey that book, that it's a very

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.560
 powerful book that you have, I want you to be aware of that.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:41.760
 If you open yourself up to that book, bad things are going to happen, so just be careful.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.200
 And the man walks away.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.160
 And that actually energized Phil, that made him want to read the book in a more serious

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.400
 fashion because again it would be like if someone walked up to you while you were reading

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.560
 the Hobbit and they go hey you're not going a long journey anytime soon, a town might

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.400
 burn down, you'd be like what and then they walk away.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.840
 It would be weird, you know that it's fictional but here this guy is stopping and sending

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.760
 his family away so he can have this conversation with you, very short conversation.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.600
 So Phil decides to actually start taking the book more seriously, he decides to pretend

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.360
 that it's real.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:26.000
 He begins practicing some of the rituals, he begins to what his friends could only describe

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.040
 as become obsessed with the netcromonon and even he would use that term, I was obsessed

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.920
 with it.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:42.440
 He finished the book and then he re-read it and then he re-read it again and he's pretending

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.840
 that it's real, like what would happen if I actually believed any of this was real?

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.720
 He got lost in the words of the netcromonon.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.120
 Now there's a time jump in this story, he says there's a good period of time where he's

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.080
 kind of moved away from, he's no longer wearing the cloak to work, he's no longer burning

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:07.120
 candles in the break room, he's kind of past the stage where he was obsessed with the netcromonon.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.240
 And one of his friends casually brings up one day, they go "hey, dude remember when you

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.080
 used to read that book all the time?"

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.800
 And Phil's eyes turn red, the book, you call it simply a book.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.200
 Phil goes "oh yeah dude, the netcromonon, yeah I used to read that all the time" and

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.200
 the friend goes "yeah you were acting really weird back then."

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:29.120
 I remember once he said you could talk to the stars.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.480
 He goes "it was weird because when he said, a good enough period of time passed because

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.120
 he goes when my friend said that to me, it sounded super cringe."

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.920
 He goes "I had totally forgotten about that, that sounds like some cringy stuff that I

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.160
 would have said back then, but like when he said that I was like "ugh that's super like

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.560
 edge lord."

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:54.040
 But at the same time, he had forgotten that he said stuff like that, but once his friend

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.920
 said that he goes "oh dude, I do not only remember telling you that, I remember believing

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.920
 it."

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.880
 Like I was really into the netcromonon wasn't I?

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:12.120
 His friend's like "yeah dude, the chowglaffet you can now be aware of that, it's kind of

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120
 spooky."

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.800
 And around that same time, so this dude, he's a musician, he's like plays guitar, he plays

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.640
 bass, plays piano and he's a vocalist, he's kind of like all in one type of dude.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.000
 And it sounded like he was either a musician before this and he had a lot of musician friends,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.280
 I don't know if he was in a touring band or anything like that or he just played on the

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.280
 weekends.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.160
 But he goes "Around the same time that my friend brought up this story about me saying

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.080
 I could talk to the stars, he goes "an album, an idea for an album popped in my head."

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.880
 I called up a buddy of mine who owns a studio and says "hey man, do you mind if I get some

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.880
 studio time?

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.400
 I got a really cool idea for an album."

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.000
 My friend's like "yeah sure, no problem right?"

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.280
 And he says he has a process when he is writing songs, but when he started writing these songs

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.440
 the lyrics are just coming out of nowhere.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.080
 He said he was writing songs quicker than he ever did and when he would look back at

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.040
 the lyrics he goes "these lyrics don't even make sense."

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.840
 It's like gibberish.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.360
 He described the lyrics as both whimsical and bizarre.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.960
 And he doesn't, even though he's writing them down, he doesn't really understand what they

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.200
 mean.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.320
 And then when he's going into the studio all of the songs have been written now.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:28.640
 He goes in the studio, he goes "the arrangements completely fell into place."

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.000
 He goes "I've recorded albums before, I know how long these processes normally take and

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.160
 this went incredibly fast."

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.960
 Like far quicker than he could have ever imagined.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.960
 Everything was falling into place.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.720
 And then, this is another detail that he didn't really remember at the time that his friend

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.920
 had to, his friend who owned the studio had to tell him like "dude what in the world was

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.600
 going on back then?"

00:23:52.600 --> 00:24:00.640
 He said apparently he kept insisting on having these small little details, these small little

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.760
 notes and noises inserted into the music.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.640
 And the studio friends like "uhhhh okay" and like they would do a take and they'd put

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.640
 that little noise in.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.840
 And the friends like "you couldn't even hear it."

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.880
 Like you couldn't hear what was being added in.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.320
 But Phil kept demanding to put in all these little strange, not like demonic growls or

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.000
 anything like that, but just like odd notes and noises laid into the track.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.840
 And again Phil didn't remember doing this stuff.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.320
 This is something the friend mentioned after the album is completed.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:39.080
 He goes "you were super insistent on having these little noises put in."

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.560
 And whenever I asked about him, whenever the friend of the studio owner asked about, so

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.000
 wait wait wait why are we putting that noise in?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.280
 Phil would get incredibly angry.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.560
 Okay sorry I just was wondering, okay.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:58.120
 The friend goes "you couldn't even hear that the noises and notes are in there and I couldn't

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.120
 even ask about them.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.320
 You'd flip out."

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:09.400
 Now at this point the albums near completion, they have these songs that feels like "dude

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.160
 these songs are amazing.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.160
 Let's start practicing to do a live show."

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.400
 We'll do a live show, we'll drop the album, it'll just be this big thing.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.480
 Now again I don't think this was a major label release.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.360
 I don't even know if this was supposed to be a commercial release.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.880
 This could have been an artistic release.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.920
 They were only going to press like 100 albums.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.000
 We're not for sure on the details like that.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.960
 Was he a full time musician?

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.200
 Was he a gig musician?

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.200
 Was this the album of the lifetime or just one of 50 albums he's done?

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.560
 We don't know all of those details.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.640
 But we do know that he, Phil is now getting together some of his friends.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.560
 They're going to perform the album live.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.800
 The night of the very first practice, Phil has his guitar on, the rest of the band's

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.120
 assembled.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:58.520
 As they're practicing these songs, Phil screams out loud in pain.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.960
 Everyone's totally freaking out.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.040
 He screams out loud in pain and he drops his guitar and his guitar breaks when it hits

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040
 the ground.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.440
 And everyone's like "what in the world happened?"

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.680
 And he turns around, he goes "something just scratched me.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.320
 Something just scratched the hell out of my back."

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:23.640
 And he turned around and he pulled his shirt up and sure enough he has these huge scratches

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.160
 all over his back.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.840
 Now obviously we're doing a live show yet.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.200
 This wasn't a fan running up on stage scratching them.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.480
 Totally freaked everyone out.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.880
 Most of all Phil, right?

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.600
 There's no one in there who could possibly scratch his back.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.400
 They get weirded out by it, he gets weirded out by it.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.760
 And they call Quits the rehearsal and also he broke his guitar.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.800
 He goes "I did not have the money for a new guitar."

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.600
 That makes me think he's more of like a gig musician, right?

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.080
 Because I know a lot of gig musicians and that happens.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.160
 They gotta wait a while.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:27:00.920
 He goes "I couldn't get a new guitar and I also got scratched by some paranormal force."

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.920
 So we're not going to be doing a live show anytime soon.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:12.840
 And the very next day Phil gets a phone call from his friend at the studio.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:19.160
 And in a very embarrassed tone, because the friend is a professional, right?

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:26.360
 The friend goes "Hey, I don't know how to put this but the album's gone."

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.120
 Phil's like "What are you talking about?"

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.120
 He goes "They're gone.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.760
 I'm looking at the hard drives.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760
 The files are gone.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:40.680
 Everything we recorded is completely gone."

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.640
 And Phil fills a wave of depression kind of hit him, right?

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.720
 This is something he'd been working on.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.720
 It was like his...

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.080
 Again, he wasn't claiming this to be his masterpiece so that was going to be the album that defined

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.240
 him but it was still something he worked on for a long period of time, right?

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.920
 And although he was having fun hanging out with his friends, stuff like that, it's hard

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.400
 work.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.920
 And he felt really deflated and at that point he goes "You know what?

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.280
 I don't have the energy in it to re-record all that stuff."

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.280
 Whatever.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.280
 And the friend's like "You sure?"

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.280
 He's like "Yeah, yeah.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280
 We're just going to drop it.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.280
 We're not going to finish that album."

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.480
 He goes "Around the same time I gave up on the album, he goes "At the same time I moved."

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.240
 And he said "When we moved, my copy of the Necromonon went missing as well."

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.880
 And he goes "At that point I'd really lost interest in it."

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:30.360
 Like there was a time where I wasn't re-reading it over and over again but I was just down

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.360
 with it, right?

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:38.440
 And I think in the way that he has it set up, you know, he obviously doesn't think anything

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:43.240
 of the Necromonon or he's casually interested in it but it's a work of fiction, that guy

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.640
 inspires him, which was not what the dude wanted to do.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.160
 He wanted to be careful.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.920
 The guy inspired him to take it seriously.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.240
 He begins to take it incredibly seriously, reading it, reading it, reading it, reading

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.360
 it and starts saying cringey things and starts having weird beliefs that people around him

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.800
 are getting a little worried.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.760
 And then it does seem like he's not so obsessed with it for a while but the mere mention of

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.440
 the book again inspires him to write this album which I think the idea is it is still

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.120
 influenced by the Necromonon.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:18.080
 The album, all of the ability to write these whimsical lyrics but they are super bizarre,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080
 they didn't make sense.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:24.680
 The album coming together so quickly, the insertion of these little sounds and signs.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.240
 I think the push to the story is that that is also the Necromonon working through the

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.240
 album.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.760
 He never really says, well you know I wrote the lyrics about the Necromonon.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:40.880
 I was taking rituals from the Necromonon and turning them into lyrics but that is kind

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.680
 of implied, right?

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:48.800
 And from his point of view it seems to be that that's how he sees it, right?

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.680
 The mere mention of his phase.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.320
 It's interesting in his narrative he doesn't say I was rereading the Necromonon over and

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.520
 over and over and over again up until the time I was recording it and I'm in the recording

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:07.160
 studio but I think the idea is that the recording process was influenced by the Necromonon.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:12.160
 He pushed himself too far, too fast in a fictional book but turned it real.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.080
 And the story is not over yet, I'm just doing a little bit of analysis right now, right?

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.800
 We still got a little choice ending.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.240
 But the Necromonon influenced this album and that's why it fit together so well and

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.320
 he was doing stuff he didn't remember, right?

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.600
 It was very creepy, that's almost like a possession.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.600
 But so he moves on with his life though.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:36.500
 He's like whatever, the Necromonon inspired me to write this album where at the very

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.560
 least was an underlying influence.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.240
 But I lost it and I lost interest in the album and I'm gone.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.560
 He finishes his story like this though.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:52.920
 This takes place a time afterwards after he moved away and after the album disappeared.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:31:01.280
 He says quote, "That friend with the studio actually died in a pretty brutal way."

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.200
 And it happened several years later when we got together again and decided to attempt

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.200
 the entire album again.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.720
 Probably just a coincidence.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.840
 But it left me feeling pretty messed up.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:23.720
 It's a fascinating story obviously about cursed media, lost media, what was going on with

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.480
 this album.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:33.180
 Was it truly inspired by a fictional book that elements of it may be true?

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:39.040
 Or is it the case of this young man who actually believed it was so true that he's connected

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.560
 a bunch of coincidences together, right?

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.160
 Things happen with technology, files disappear, people die, right?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:52.040
 These are all things that happen and is it possible that a narrative has been completed

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.840
 because it borders so close on the paranormal he's putting together paranormal events?

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.920
 Or was it a real life cursed album?

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.080
 Was this album actually influenced by demons?

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.520
 One thing I find really interesting is let's step back for a second and get kind of meta

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.120
 with this whole thing of spooky albums of cursed media.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.520
 I've been thinking about this story a lot.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.800
 If you haven't noticed the audio has changed, I've been thinking about it.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.200
 This is a couple days later I'm recording this part.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.840
 Let's play this out for a second because this is kind of the way that these stories go.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.040
 Demon, boy meets girl, demon meets the demon.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:38.600
 Demon or demonically influenced music, media, haunted recording, haunted movie is created.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:47.600
 And yet this media is almost always lost or destroyed.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.840
 Demon meets a willing victim, right?

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:56.760
 A demon influences an artist to create the art, the artist created and then the art becomes

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.320
 lost.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.000
 It's how this story always plays out, which again makes you think that not necessarily

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.840
 this guy's story is made up, but every other story involving the same things are made up.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:16.560
 The album created by the Mars Volta got released and is actually critically acclaimed.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.720
 But for the most part, and there are people who think the Mars Volta thing was just a

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.960
 marketing thing that they came up with, but for the most part when we talk about movies

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.240
 like Babylon Rising or whatever, that was supposedly haunted, it came out and nobody

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.480
 watched it.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:36.160
 We hear these other albums that come out like this guy's, it doesn't get released.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:41.040
 When we look at the history of these demonically created works of art, they seem to fall to

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.400
 the wayside.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:48.640
 So my question is this, my question is this, why?

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.720
 Why?

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:56.800
 Because if you were a demon and your goal was to create a piece of art, a haunted art,

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:04.680
 like cursed art, anyone involved in the process of this, they were going to go mad or die.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.880
 The idea is that if this piece of art got out, you know, it was the latest from the computer,

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.200
 it could never be recovered, and then when they talked about doing it again, the guy

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.680
 died, the studio dude died.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.640
 So why?

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.960
 Why would a demon put so much work into an album and then curse it so much that it never

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.080
 gets created?

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.600
 So that's my question, that's my question.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600
 Why?

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.520
 You think that now that they've had this willing victim craft this piece, wouldn't it have

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:40.520
 been in the demon's benefit to, I don't know, not kill the studio engineer or delete the

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.520
 files?

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:46.040
 Like wouldn't it have been in that demon's benefit to have that album released?

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:51.080
 Whether or not it had 50 listeners or 50,000 listeners, it's still extra souls for the

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.240
 demon to corrupt.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:57.920
 These weird sounds that are being laid underneath the audio track, people hearing those over

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:04.400
 and over and over again that demonic influence is now coming to them with a snappy tune laid

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.520
 over it.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.320
 Why isn't the stuff being widely distributed?

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.120
 We talk, did I don't know, I've lost the order of those, so I'm going to do an upcoming

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.920
 episode about the Illuminati's influence in the music business, right?

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.920
 Those get released, right?

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.320
 So, Yana's new album comes out, Charlie XCX's new album comes out, has all this satanic

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.280
 Illuminati-esque imagery, and those get released.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.280
 Wouldn't it have been in the demon's best interest to get this album released?

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.840
 And if so, why did they kill the engineer if that's the story, you know, if that's the

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.840
 connection?

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.840
 Why did they kill the engineer?

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.040
 Why did they erase the files?

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.200
 That's what I don't understand about this story.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.240
 Because the Mars Volta story, it's the same thing, they're influenced by this dark person

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.240
 known as Goliath.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.400
 It's like three different personalities formed into one named Goliath, and he's dictating

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:01.200
 the album, or this album is about what Goliath is saying through the use of the spirit board,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.680
 but they keep running into problems too.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:08.240
 The studio gets flooded, the files disappear off the computer, it's all of this stuff.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.840
 The engineer at one point takes all of his notes and says, "You guys are going to unleash

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.920
 something dark upon the world, and I don't want to have anything to do with it."

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.880
 So they had to start the process over from scratch.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:23.320
 Why would the demons sabotage their own album?

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.600
 And I don't really have an answer for that.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.040
 Like I said, I've been thinking about it for the past probably week.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.160
 I'm adding this on way late in the game, and I just can't come up with an answer.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.800
 Why would the demons create an album and then sabotage it?

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.400
 Or is the sabotage coming from a higher power?

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:43.120
 Is it not the demons are deleting it from the computer?

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.120
 Is it God?

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.680
 Because he's like, "I don't want that getting out there."

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.400
 But then it opens the question, then what about all the...

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.400
 This one have like little hidden audio tracks underneath a layer of music.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.680
 You have music videos with straight up satanic imagery.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.280
 Those get released.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:04.040
 I also don't know why God would brutally kill the studio engineer, right?

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.680
 He could have just, I don't know, give him a flat tire on the way to the studio, and

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.760
 he goes, "I don't want to record anymore."

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.760
 Anything, right?

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.960
 There's a lot of stuff in between getting them to not do the album again and brutally

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.120
 murdering somebody.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.120
 So why?

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.800
 It doesn't seem like it's the most...

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.720
 The original ending was like dark and spooky, like I normally do.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.520
 It kind of was like, "So the next...

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.360
 So the next time you're recording a cursed album, watch out!"

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.600
 One of those endings, but I thought more about it, and I just don't understand the

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.000
 why of this story.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.800
 I believe, I'll accept the belief that demons were a part of this recording process, that

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:42.760
 this guy went so deep into the world of darkness, that he started to believe that these spells

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.720
 were real, and maybe some of them are, and he was putting them into the lyrics.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.280
 I'll accept all that.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.000
 And I accept that the files were getting deleted and you had this string of bad luck.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.400
 I just don't understand why the demons would put so much work into an album, and then sabotage

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.400
 it.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.920
 And if they didn't, who did?

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:09.000
 But a fascinating story nonetheless, a story that ends not on a spooky ending, but on an

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.200
 open question.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.840
 Why would this happen?

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:18.960
 What would the demons have to gain by creating an album and then deleting it?

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:24.160
 I guess the only way to know is to craft a demonic album ourselves.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.160
 Don't do that.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.920
 I actually probably shouldn't even joke about that.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.680
 I do not understand it, but the world of the paranormal is not for me to understand all

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.640
 the time, right?

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.840
 That's why it's paranormal.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:41.120
 That's why it doesn't follow along the line of normal questions.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.720
 A fascinating story nonetheless.
