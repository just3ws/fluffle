16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,480
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,400
 A terrifying crime shows what happens

18
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,760
 when we take conspiracy theories a little too seriously.

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,520
 Then we take a look at the story of a young woman

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,440
 who encounters aliens, advanced life from another galaxy,

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,160
 which makes us ask the question,

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,160
 what if the smartest beings in the universe are wrong?

23
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,160
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

24
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,740
 (upbeat music)

25
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,320
 (upbeat music)

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,740
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

27
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,780
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

28
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,740
 I'm your host Jason Garvin,

29
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,660
 or I'm having a great day.

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,340
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

31
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,540
 This may be the fastest recorded episode

32
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,500
 of Dead Rabbit Radio ever.

33
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,260
 It's slowly approaching 100 degrees outside.

34
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,060
 I really, really waited a long time

35
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,820
 to record this episode.

36
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,500
 Recording it like almost the hottest time of the day.

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,540
 So we're gonna have to get right through this.

38
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,060
 First off, let's give a shout out

39
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,540
 to one of our legacy patriots.

40
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,580
 Actually, you know what?

41
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,540
 Today I wanna give a shout out.

42
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,700
 I don't know if I ever gave her a shout out for this.

43
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,260
 So today's shout out is going to be Audrey Mackamson.

44
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,940
 Everyone give a round of applause to Audrey

45
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,620
 as she's walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

46
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,100
 Do a little bow.

47
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,740
 She's not a Patreon supporter,

48
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,300
 but a long time ago I put out a bounty.

49
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,100
 You're like, "Jason, you did reward her for this."

50
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,140
 We remember this.

51
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,740
 You just didn't put it down in your notes.

52
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,780
 Audrey Mackamson, or makeumson,

53
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,100
 I put out a bounty for a Bigfoot USB.

54
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,580
 There was something called Bigfoot the Track Record,

55
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,460
 a Bigfoot Encyclopedia.

56
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,460
 And we covered the story.

57
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,380
 It was about Bigfoot hanging out in Oregon

58
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,020
 at near a place called Cock Rock,

59
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,100
 which is a place where dudes go to bang each other.

60
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,700
 But Bigfoot was there for some reason,

61
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,620
 just looking for love.

62
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,580
 Anyways, I'll put that episode in the show notes.

63
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,300
 You're like, "No, Jason, tell us that story now."

64
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,420
 In that episode I mentioned there as a USB.

65
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,460
 It was like Lost Media.

66
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,660
 I didn't think I could ever find it.

67
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,900
 She found it.

68
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,060
 She sent me the link and I purchased it.

69
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,900
 And it's really cool.

70
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,180
 So Audrey, I wanted to really thank you for that.

71
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,700
 So you're gonna be our captain or pilot

72
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
 of this episode today.

73
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,900
 If you guys can't find an obscure piece of Lost Media

74
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,740
 for me, that's fine too.

75
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,900
 Just help spread the word about the show.

76
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,340
 Really, really helps out a lot.

77
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,620
 Also, to give a shout out to the Patreons,

78
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,140
 there is currently a debate.

79
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,980
 It's not a debate.

80
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,380
 Everyone agrees on the Patreon Discord.

81
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,980
 How much they hate me for being a--

82
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,820
 (laughs)

83
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,900
 For being a fan of the Minecraft streamer Dream.

84
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,380
 Apparently there's almost enough rising.

85
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,900
 I expect to lose a lot of Patreons this weekend

86
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,540
 because I do like Dream.

87
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,700
 Audrey, oh, oh, what am I talking about?

88
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,420
 We also got this amazing fan art for Fan Art Friday.

89
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,840
 I almost forgot 'cause I'm not looking at it on my screen.

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,340
 But this was from the Patreon Discord.

91
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,580
 This was from long time listener of the show,

92
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,700
 Patreon supporters, Will Roody Jazz.

93
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,540
 Look at this.

94
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,580
 It's a little combination.

95
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,660
 Don't, if you're driving, if you're driving,

96
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,500
 you can look at it later.

97
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,620
 It's a combination of myself with the Dead Rabbit radio logo.

98
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,580
 So I got my hair cut, I'm all wooly,

99
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,900
 and apparently I have the nose of a pig.

100
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,740
 I did not know that.

101
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,940
 I always assumed my nose was Romanesque

102
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,660
 and less Chief Wiggum, but whatever,

103
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,020
 I don't care either way.

104
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,860
 Roody, thank you so much for providing this artwork

105
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,700
 for Fan Art Friday.

106
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,100
 It really is super-duper awesome.

107
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,660
 Audrey, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

108
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,000
 to the Jason Jet.

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,420
 We're actually gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit,

110
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,420
 I forgot where we were going.

111
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,860
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

112
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,860
 You're gonna vroom vroom us on out to Mexico.

113
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,600
 (blows air)

114
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,420
 Audrey's flying us over the beautiful blue skies

115
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,220
 of the world, headed down to Mexico.

116
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,020
 Now this first story, it's a little intense.

117
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,120
 I'm not gonna go into a lot of the details with it,

118
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,060
 honestly, because I think the implication is more important

119
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,500
 than the gruesomeness of it.

120
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,020
 On August 7th, 2021, you had a dude

121
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,280
 named Matthew Coleman of Santa Barbara.

122
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,240
 People are already skipping, they're like, nope.

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,280
 There's all this in the news, all this in the news,

124
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,880
 where's the fast forward button?

125
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,480
 On August 7th, 2021, Matthew Coleman of Santa Barbara

126
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,160
 decides to kidnap his own two children.

127
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,120
 Kalio, three years old, it only gets worse from here,

128
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,500
 unfortunately, Kalio is three years old

129
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,360
 and Roxy is 10 months old

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,460
 and takes his beautiful little babies down to Mexico.

131
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,620
 Shortly after that, their mother, Abby Coleman,

132
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,260
 his wife, reports her children missing.

133
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,060
 This is a pretty breaking news story.

134
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,580
 I mean, on August 7th, we're still getting

135
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,900
 drips and drips of information,

136
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,980
 but we don't know if the relationship was on the rocks,

137
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,060
 like if he was sending out warning signs

138
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,300
 that he may be planning to do something brutal.

139
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,260
 They're actually lived up in, where is it?

140
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,220
 Santa Barbara, so he's driving down to Mexico

141
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,360
 and she reports them missing and the police are like,

142
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,920
 oh, great, so I think there is more stuff going on.

143
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,100
 It wasn't like, oh, I think he spent a little too long

144
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,940
 on this day trip.

145
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,940
 I think she alerted them that he's been having

146
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,020
 some mental health difficulties.

147
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,300
 Matthew Coleman is then coming across the border

148
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,240
 from Mexico back in the United States

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,160
 and everyone at the border had gotten a bolo for him, right?

150
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,760
 Be on the lookout for Matthew Coleman.

151
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,820
 So when his car comes, they stop him.

152
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,400
 Hey, Matthew, he's harmfully alarmed.

153
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,580
 They know his name, he's like, oh,

154
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,880
 they start questioning him.

155
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,820
 They notice that there is droplets of blood in his car,

156
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,740
 like on a sheet of paper, and most horrifically,

157
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,380
 neither of his children are in the car.

158
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,620
 So Matthew Coleman is arrested, he is questioned,

159
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,000
 and it turns out that he took both of his children

160
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,580
 down to this farm in Mexico and shot them both

161
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,200
 with a spear gun.

162
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,460
 All that stuff is just horrific.

163
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,460
 It's a terrifying local news story

164
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,300
 and it happens all too often.

165
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,740
 The reason why I'm talking about it on Dead Rabbit Radio,

166
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,340
 even though this is a true crime podcast,

167
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,820
 we don't cover stuff like that.

168
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,940
 We do cover more stuff like that on the TikTok.

169
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,580
 We cover kind of these local, weird, creepy crime stories

170
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,340
 on the TikTok, but on the Shell Proper,

171
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,500
 I don't really talk about that type of stuff,

172
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,700
 unless it's super bizarre.

173
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,700
 This is super bizarre because his motive,

174
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,140
 and this is why I think they probably

175
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,500
 was probably aware that there was some mental health

176
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,060
 difficulties going on prior to this.

177
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,220
 Matthew Coleman told the investigating officer,

178
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,380
 I believe it was an FBI officer,

179
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,260
 'cause you can read the affidavit on Crime Online,

180
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,580
 I'll put the link on the show notes.

181
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,740
 It's a really great website, I visit it every day.

182
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,220
 For my crime fix, I go to Crime Online.

183
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,380
 He tells the FBI agent, "Well, I had to kill him.

184
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,580
 "I had to kill him."

185
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,140
 Because I learned the truth,

186
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,820
 because I learned the truth.

187
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,700
 You see, I am a, what you may call a conspiracy theorist.

188
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,100
 He's on his exact words.

189
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,300
 He wasn't talking like Heath Ledger's Joker,

190
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,220
 or anything like that, but I'm kind of puffing it up for you.

191
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,900
 I can just read the affidavit,

192
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,820
 but that's no fun, and it's kind of dark.

193
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
 He goes, "Listen, I've been learning about this stuff

194
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,180
 "about the Illuminati, and QAnon."

195
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,020
 Did you know about QAnon?

196
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,180
 The agent goes, "Yes, I do read the newspaper.

197
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,660
 "I'm aware of that term."

198
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,420
 He goes, "But see, the Illuminati has opened my eyes

199
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,780
 "to what's really going on in this world.

200
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,940
 "You see, my wife and mother of my children

201
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,220
 "is a reptilian.

202
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,680
 "She has what's known as serpent DNA,

203
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,140
 "and she gave it to my children.

204
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,700
 "Officer, I'm telling you this right now.

205
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,220
 "Those weren't children I killed in the desert.

206
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,060
 "They were monsters.

207
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,900
 "I didn't murder my children.

208
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,460
 "I just saved the world."

209
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,660
 Now, even though that was me adding a bit of dramatic flair,

210
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,980
 the lights flickering, (stutters)

211
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,380
 that is the gist.

212
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,660
 He did say QAnon and Illuminati conspiracy theories,

213
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,540
 and he, quote, "Was receiving visions and signs,

214
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,580
 "revealing that his wife possessed serpent DNA

215
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,540
 "and had passed it on to his children."

216
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,900
 And the phrase, "To save the world,"

217
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,820
 was also used in that after David as well.

218
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,140
 Terrifying story, absolutely terrifying story.

219
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,260
 And I know right now,

220
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,460
 there are already some people typing

221
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,540
 into the YouTube comments,

222
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,700
 "Maybe this is just a story

223
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,380
 "to make conspiracy theorists look bad."

224
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,660
 Listen, there's already enough stuff

225
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,300
 that makes conspiracy theorists look bad.

226
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,260
 I would, it would be hard pressed for a group

227
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,300
 to just pick out a local crime story,

228
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,500
 no matter how horrific.

229
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,020
 And this actually isn't in the top 10 most horrific crimes

230
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,220
 that have happened in the past month.

231
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,900
 I mean, for this family, it isn't.

232
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,020
 For this family, it's the worst.

233
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,860
 But you know what I mean?

234
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,500
 Like, if this was some sort of conspiracy,

235
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,460
 oh, oh, they're trying to make QAnon look bad,

236
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,060
 so they're gonna type, no, no, no.

237
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,700
 That, there's worse they could have chosen.

238
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,220
 There really is worse crimes they could have chosen.

239
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,820
 What, I do enjoy investigating conspiracy theories,

240
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,100
 and I love sharing them with you.

241
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,220
 And I think you guys sense that

242
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,460
 there's definitely at the very least

243
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,940
 an interest in conspiracy theories.

244
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,780
 And for me, at the very most like a joy.

245
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,460
 Like, I enjoy finding these things.

246
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,620
 And you guys are very well put together adults as well.

247
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,900
 But this guy had most likely an underlying mental illness

248
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,340
 and found the conspiracy theories as well.

249
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,140
 It's interesting because I think,

250
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,100
 I don't think this is gonna become a huge major story,

251
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,940
 and they're gonna try to use it

252
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,740
 to push away conspiracy theory content

253
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,340
 on YouTube or anything like that.

254
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,300
 But this is almost like the Freddy Kruger defense,

255
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,780
 which I don't think's ever been used.

256
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,100
 But if they did, that's a cool name for it,

257
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,980
 where somebody commits a crime based on a horror movie.

258
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,420
 And that person had been struggling

259
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,220
 with mental health issues their entire life,

260
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,340
 and then they became a huge fan

261
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,380
 of the Freddy Kruger franchise.

262
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,900
 They bought a time machine, went back to the '80s.

263
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,060
 They're a huge fan of Freddy Kruger,

264
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,700
 and they end up making a glove out of knives

265
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,980
 and stabbing someone to death.

266
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,860
 Or just took a knife and stabbed someone to death.

267
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,980
 One, that's most likely happened.

268
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,340
 That's most likely happened already.

269
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,940
 But was Freddy Kruger to blame?

270
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,060
 Were those horror movies to blame for the crime?

271
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,500
 Or if he had watched The Wind and the Willows too many times,

272
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,780
 would he have dressed up like a frog and drowned people?

273
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,900
 Because the underlying mental illness is already there,

274
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,180
 and if it's untreated, that's really the key.

275
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,740
 Like if you can get it treated, you're fine.

276
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,140
 But if it's untreated,

277
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,180
 and you have the movie stimulating the thought pattern,

278
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,380
 would any movie do that?

279
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,220
 Would if he was watching action movies all the time,

280
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,460
 would he want to go on a mass shooting rampage?

281
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,380
 So that's where I think this lies.

282
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,300
 I don't necessarily blame the conspiracy.

283
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,740
 I will say this though.

284
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,660
 Freddy Kruger and The Wind and the Willows and The Matrix,

285
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,980
 they don't ever imply that they're true,

286
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,460
 even though Nightmare on the Street was based on a true story.

287
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,460
 Well, but that episode in the show notes is really creepy,

288
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,940
 but the movies themselves don't apply to be true.

289
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,540
 These conspiracy theories are supposed to be true.

290
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,580
 So there might be more of an argument

291
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,700
 that the conspiracy theories weighed more on him.

292
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,780
 Actually, that's a good point,

293
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,980
 'cause as I'm arguing with myself in a 90 degree closet,

294
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,140
 Freddy Kruger doesn't go now,

295
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,380
 "Well, listen, kids, this is a true story.

296
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,340
 This is what happens if you try to take vigilante justice

297
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,380
 against a child rapist.

298
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,060
 This is what will happen to you."

299
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,180
 We know it's fictional.

300
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,100
 And see, when we look at conspiracy theories like,

301
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,660
 there's a whole group of population

302
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,940
 that has serpent DNA in them,

303
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,980
 and they're gonna pass it on.

304
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,620
 We've covered this conspiracy theory.

305
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,460
 Not only have we covered this conspiracy theory,

306
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,180
 oddly enough, we've covered multiple times

307
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,940
 people have tried and successfully used spear guns

308
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,300
 to kill people, which is such a weird, exotic weapon.

309
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,540
 We covered it when the guys were fighting on the airliner,

310
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,700
 and we covered it with the guy who killed his family

311
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,540
 using a spear gun.

312
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,220
 But anyways, I'll put those episodes in the show notes.

313
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,620
 That's not an advertisement.

314
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,300
 I'm not using that as an advertisement,

315
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,060
 as a weapon of choice, but we did cover

316
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,980
 the serpent seed conspiracy theory once.

317
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,180
 There was a minister who believed

318
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,020
 that people were passing this around,

319
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,460
 and that's quite foolish conspiracy theory.

320
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,500
 That's one of the ones where I'd be like,

321
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,620
 "Wait, well, if we can't detect it,

322
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,900
 if we can't detect that serpent DNA,

323
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,220
 like you look at a microscope,

324
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,660
 you see regular little sperm,

325
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,580
 and then you look and there's little microscopic

326
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,180
 alligator-shining of those sperm.

327
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,180
 You can't detect that there's serpent DNA in there.

328
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,740
 You can't scientifically do anything.

329
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,580
 It's quite foolish.

330
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,260
 But he was having these visions

331
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,100
 and seeing these signs as well.

332
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,620
 He's probably flipping through the radio station

333
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,740
 and every so often the song "Man Eater" would start playing.

334
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,940
 He's like, "Oh, Man Eater, that's like an alligator."

335
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,820
 And he puts this stuff together.

336
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,760
 And who knows?

337
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,020
 It's tragic.

338
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,340
 And it goes to show that sometimes

339
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,900
 when you take these conspiracy theories too seriously,

340
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,580
 plus, that can just be your kind of believing stuff

341
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,820
 that doesn't exist if you believe

342
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,420
 in every conspiracy theory.

343
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,860
 Someone believes the earth is flat.

344
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,620
 It doesn't affect you in any way, shape, or form.

345
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,460
 It really doesn't.

346
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,420
 So I don't care about it.

347
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,580
 I think it's dumb.

348
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,860
 But it doesn't affect me in any way or other people.

349
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,260
 But when you take that conspiracy theory

350
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,440
 and you put an underlying mental illness to it,

351
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,740
 that's the problem.

352
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,060
 I think that's really the problem.

353
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,380
 And I think that's the main issue here.

354
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
 If people wanna believe that 10% of the population

355
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,860
 is reptilian, whatever.

356
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,740
 Then the only way you can become famous

357
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,380
 and rich and powerful is to either be reptilian

358
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,300
 or to join the reptilian core or whatever.

359
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,620
 Have a little reptilian badge

360
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,020
 ask me about my reptilian ancestry?

361
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,860
 Whatever.

362
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,700
 That doesn't affect us in any way, shape, or form.

363
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,180
 And if they just go, "Ah, Queen Elizabeth,

364
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,340
 "she's a big old reptile."

365
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,900
 I saw her laying an egg.

366
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,420
 I saw laying an egg the other day

367
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,160
 and Meghan Markle popped out of it.

368
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,000
 Whatever.

369
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,840
 Who cares?

370
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,680
 Like that really doesn't affect us

371
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,840
 if that person is then going to do something violent,

372
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,380
 which is the extreme minority,

373
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,300
 which most conspiracy theorists,

374
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,760
 they don't do anything like that.

375
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,380
 But there's the extreme minority.

376
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,100
 There's a extreme minority of people who love motocross,

377
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,900
 who are also using their dirt bikes to run drugs

378
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,460
 across the country and maybe to run over

379
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,820
 their enemies' faces.

380
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,980
 They have to wait until their enemies sleep in

381
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,660
 and then they're like, "Ring, ring, ring."

382
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,820
 They got the silence around their back.

383
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,740
 There's a small minority of every group,

384
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,780
 but we are conspiracy theorists

385
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,740
 or at least we enjoy conspiracy theories.

386
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,940
 And this one, unfortunately,

387
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,980
 it's whether or not the conspiracy theory England

388
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,340
 is an unfortunate true crime.

389
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,700
 I'm not trying to gloss over that,

390
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,780
 but I thought it would be interesting for us

391
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,060
 to take a look at because we enjoy these topics,

392
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,100
 sometimes people take them too far

393
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,220
 and have other mental issues.

394
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,420
 And the people who really paid for this

395
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,300
 was the two children,

396
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,420
 Kaleo and Roxy and then Abby

397
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,260
 and then everyone who loved those people.

398
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,220
 Matthew Coleman, who cares about that?

399
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,100
 Anyways, I won't cuss on the family episode.

400
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,660
 I won't cuss on this family podcast

401
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,180
 where I just talked about this horrible brutal crime.

402
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,700
 Awful, awful, awful.

403
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,100
 You don't even want to think about it,

404
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,300
 but Audrey, let's go ahead and toss you

405
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,500
 the keys of the carboner copter.

406
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,060
 We are leaving behind Mexico such a sad story

407
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,780
 and we are headed on out to the Volo Godot.

408
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,860
 What a baby named this place.

409
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,460
 You're like, no, Jason, you're just mispronouncing it.

410
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,260
 Volo Godot region in Russia.

411
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,600
 (imitates guitar music)

412
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,740
 In the Volo Godot region in Russia,

413
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,540
 it's August 2nd, 1982.

414
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,020
 Wow, I didn't even plan that.

415
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,540
 That's almost 21 years ago.

416
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,540
 You're like, Jason, Jason, how hot is it in that closet?

417
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,020
 That's not even cool.

418
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,500
 That's like 40 something years ago.

419
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,780
 Anyways, close enough.

420
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,620
 It's 1.15 p.m.

421
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,780
 We're in the Volo Godot region in Russia.

422
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,400
 And there's a young woman, her name is Elle Smirnova.

423
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,980
 She's walking through this birch forest.

424
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,340
 Doot, doot, doot, doot, having a good time?

425
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,900
 I don't know, doesn't actually say what her mood was.

426
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,860
 She could have been deeply depressed.

427
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,460
 But anyways, she's walking through the forest

428
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,340
 and she hears a loud, booming Russian voice.

429
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,460
 Come closer, do not be afraid.

430
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,140
 The equipment is switched off.

431
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,580
 She's like, is that the voice from Gumplet?

432
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,620
 Elle Smirnova needs food, badly.

433
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,380
 She's walking through this forest and she sees a clearing

434
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,820
 and in the clearing is a UFO, a flying saucer,

435
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,620
 typical flying saucer, shiny metal just sitting

436
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,580
 on the ground and she sees like three dudes walking around.

437
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,940
 One of them looks to be a white guy

438
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,420
 and he has dark eyebrows with gray eyes.

439
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,020
 And then standing next to him are these two other dudes

440
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,100
 who look Japanese.

441
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,140
 And the white dude, she said they all looked around 25.

442
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,720
 So she is trying to gauge how attractive they are.

443
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,620
 She said the white dude starts smiling at her

444
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,740
 and then goes, Elk on seal!

445
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,180
 Which apparently some alien thing,

446
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,900
 it's not Russian, she didn't understand it.

447
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,460
 And the two Japanese dudes leave them.

448
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,420
 They go and they walk by the stairs

449
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,700
 that are leading up into the UFO.

450
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,260
 I didn't describe the UFO, I have more stuff about the UFO.

451
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,820
 I'm too caught up in this romantic drama

452
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,460
 we're about to get entangled in.

453
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,820
 The UFO wasn't sitting on the ground so much

454
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,020
 as it had the little landing gear.

455
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,820
 And then it had these stairs, like the door,

456
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,420
 like how you would picture a UFO from a 1950s movie.

457
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,260
 And the stairs going up into the open doorway.

458
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,820
 And she said the door had these intricate designs

459
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,540
 of animals and plants on them.

460
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,820
 It was like this little motif on the door.

461
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,140
 'Cause if you're gonna build a UFO,

462
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,340
 if you're gonna build a vehicle,

463
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,400
 it spends 90% of its time in the dark reaches of space.

464
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,860
 You wanna have a nicely designed door.

465
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,300
 You wanna show off to nothing.

466
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,740
 To the nothingness that lives in the cosmos.

467
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
 Elk on Sue!

468
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,300
 All of a sudden, El starts to go,

469
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,940
 oh, oh, she starts getting dizzy and sleepy.

470
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,620
 And she's starting to think, oh no, I'm being hypnotized.

471
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,700
 I'm being hypnotized by this really handsome man

472
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,540
 in the middle of the woods.

473
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,860
 And she starts saying, please don't hypnotize me,

474
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,980
 please, please don't hypnotize me.

475
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,220
 So he stops.

476
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,740
 And then he goes, well, I was gonna hypnotize you,

477
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,780
 but now I guess we'll have a conversation.

478
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,940
 He goes, my name is Oli Khan.

479
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,440
 I am Oli Khan from the planet Sunny.

480
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,200
 S-U-N-N-Y.

481
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,680
 And this is where we really, the story's interesting,

482
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,240
 but this is where you really start to ask questions about it.

483
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,480
 I got this story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

484
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,480
 They got it from a magazine called Veer Russia, number 18.

485
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,880
 I couldn't really figure out what that digest was.

486
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,240
 It seems to be maybe some local newspaper

487
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,120
 for the town or province of Veer, T-V-E-R.

488
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,440
 You're shaking your hand,

489
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,760
 that's not how you pronounce it.

490
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,440
 Why do you even go to other countries?

491
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,280
 Anyway, so I don't know what that magazine is,

492
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,560
 but ThinkAboutItDocs.com has never stirred us wrong

493
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
 in the past.

494
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,820
 Oli Khan tells this woman, L,

495
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,980
 that he's from the planet Sunny.

496
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,400
 And then the name is changed.

497
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,800
 I think he realized that that was probably

498
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,160
 a dumb name for a planet,

499
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,600
 because then he goes, oh, yeah, no, no, Sunny.

500
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,800
 That's what those dudes need to call it.

501
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,720
 I call it Galeos.

502
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,780
 So there's actually two names for this planet,

503
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,160
 which is weird.

504
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,960
 Like, I guess we have Earth,

505
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,920
 and then sometimes nerds call it Terra,

506
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,520
 but Sunny or Galeos, it's one of the two.

507
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,760
 It's one of the two names.

508
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,320
 So if you're trying to fly to this planet,

509
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
 you might get lost.

510
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,920
 Then he said it's about 45 light years away

511
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,120
 in the Ursa Majoris constellation.

512
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,680
 Now he says that they're there in this particular,

513
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
 they're having this conversation.

514
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,600
 He goes, the reason why we're here

515
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,880
 in this particular location is we want to investigate

516
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,320
 some nearby atomic weapons.

517
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,280
 And L goes, oh, well, there's none in this area.

518
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,760
 There's no missile silos.

519
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,820
 We're fully aware of that.

520
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,960
 We have to fight back the evil capitalist pigs

521
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,680
 of the United States.

522
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,780
 And Alican goes, well, they actually are nuclear weapons here.

523
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,200
 He said about three kilometers away,

524
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,600
 there's an underground bunker full of nuclear weapons.

525
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,040
 At that point, she's like three kilometers away.

526
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,840
 That's where my house is.

527
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,720
 He then pulls out a beige colored clock dial.

528
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
 (imitates clock)

529
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,480
 And he begins to present holograms of her brain.

530
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,080
 She's able to see her brain and she sees regions

531
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,680
 of it are mapped out in green and red.

532
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,040
 It's very Christmassy.

533
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,920
 And after looking at a hologram of her brain,

534
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,960
 he doos, shuts off the device,

535
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,480
 doesn't shut off her brain.

536
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,200
 And he goes, quote, we will talk to you.

537
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,940
 You have a good memory.

538
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,120
 You don't smoke or drink alcohol, unquote.

539
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,440
 So if you've ever thought about it,

540
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,520
 you're a fan of alien encounters

541
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,120
 and you have either of those vices, stop it.

542
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,040
 Stop doing that stuff, stop smoking and drinking

543
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,520
 because someday you may mate an alien from the planet's honey.

544
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,080
 He begins to quiz her, which we see a lot.

545
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,400
 A lot of times humans don't have time to ask questions

546
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,320
 'cause these aliens are asking so many questions.

547
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,880
 He's asking the weird stuff like,

548
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,080
 what do humans know about water?

549
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,560
 She's like, well, I mean, there's two thirds of it.

550
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,200
 We have the most in the solar system.

551
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,720
 He wanted to know about all the elements,

552
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,680
 what we know about water, fire, sky and earth.

553
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,480
 He asked, oh, what's the meaning of the universe?

554
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,640
 She's just sitting there and he's like, oh wait,

555
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,240
 oh wait, we'll just sit here on this rock

556
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,000
 until we figure it out.

557
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,040
 He starts to ask, does she believe in God?

558
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,360
 Does she read the Bible?

559
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,040
 She says she was a Christian and she worshiped Jesus.

560
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,800
 To which Alican, the space alien, responded,

561
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,760
 Jesus, quote, was the man, unquote.

562
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,040
 I don't know if that's the equivalent of being like,

563
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,560
 oh, he's the man.

564
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,240
 Or if it was saying that Jesus, yeah,

565
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,880
 that's the right guy, I don't know for sure.

566
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,640
 But he also said that our religious life,

567
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,540
 like just all of our religions in general,

568
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,380
 these guidelines were necessary,

569
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,760
 but just in the beginning,

570
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,360
 which is kind of an interesting alien look at it.

571
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,960
 Like all of the, maybe these religious rules

572
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,420
 that our societies follow,

573
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,320
 they're created in different ways all over the world,

574
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
 but these religious rules are created,

575
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,680
 but someday we move past them.

576
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
 I don't know.

577
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,840
 He begins to show her maps.

578
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
 They're having a long conversation here.

579
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,200
 He shows her a map of the ancient world

580
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,540
 and then the world of how it is today.

581
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,560
 When he's showing her the map,

582
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,800
 and these are our electronic maps,

583
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,880
 he's now rolling out these paper maps.

584
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,240
 When he's showing her these maps,

585
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,440
 he shows her these massive mineral deposits

586
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,600
 and unearthed riches in the modern world.

587
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,200
 He also said there's three undiscovered elements

588
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,560
 on the planet Earth that humans don't know about yet.

589
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,360
 They're here, here, and here.

590
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,520
 Pulled that one from behind her ear, and here you are.

591
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,000
 It's already active, she's all melting.

592
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 No, there's apparently three undiscovered elements

593
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,080
 we haven't discovered yet.

594
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,640
 And this is where we start to get

595
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
 into some really interesting stuff.

596
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,200
 Oli Khan then went on to say that in the year 2050,

597
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,680
 there's gonna be massive climate change.

598
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,960
 It's gonna ravage the world.

599
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,800
 Floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, snowstorms,

600
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,200
 islands would disappear,

601
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,080
 all coastal cities would be underwater.

602
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,840
 So if you're big, if you're big in a windsurfing,

603
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,240
 2050 is the year to be here.

604
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,160
 He also says that life is eternal.

605
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,880
 I like this one, but there's also a little catch this one.

606
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,120
 Life is eternal, it just kind of flows through the universe.

607
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,680
 Life, the soul force, simply transfers

608
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,400
 from one form of energy into another,

609
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,520
 and then to another, and to another, and it's endless.

610
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,280
 But not for everyone does this happen.

611
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,240
 So that's a really interesting, again,

612
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,720
 a little tidbit here.

613
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,440
 We're really kind of analyzing this,

614
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,080
 because on the one hand you could go, oh, hell, right?

615
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,360
 Someone who broke the religious code,

616
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,600
 someone who didn't believe in the truth.

617
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,920
 Their soul does not continue to travel through the universe.

618
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
 They go to hell.

619
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,480
 You could also go, no, enlightenment.

620
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,840
 You transfer forever through the universe,

621
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,520
 and then eventually you've been everywhere

622
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,040
 and you are then enlightened and you go somewhere else,

623
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,280
 or simply obliterated.

624
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,840
 What else is there?

625
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,800
 You've ascended, you've experienced everything,

626
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,480
 or those are both kind of older theories,

627
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,240
 or you could say NPCs, the current, relatively new,

628
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,160
 couple-year-old conspiracy theory.

629
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,200
 There are a lot of people out there

630
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,400
 who are non-player characters who don't have a soul.

631
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,560
 They are simply moving about society,

632
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,320
 and they don't have the life force

633
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,040
 that the rest of us have.

634
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,360
 One thing I thought was interesting,

635
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,680
 and this guy's dropping knowledge,

636
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,160
 dude, this guy's dropping bombs.

637
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,640
 Not literally, he's not dropping atomic bombs.

638
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,120
 He says that a lot of the UFOs we see are remote controlled,

639
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,960
 which is back in 1982, remote control obviously was a thing,

640
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,040
 but it's not as popular as with drones are today,

641
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,520
 but he goes, most UFOs you see are not piloted by life forms.

642
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,640
 Most of them are remote controlled.

643
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,600
 They're on the other side of the moon,

644
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,120
 there's a base on the dark side of the moon,

645
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,280
 there's a base over there, so I'm not gonna,

646
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,720
 he didn't give an actual statistic like nine out of 10,

647
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,680
 he just says most of them.

648
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,000
 Most of the UFOs you see,

649
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,880
 if they crash there'd be nothing on board,

650
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,160
 which wouldn't make sense.

651
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,000
 The risk is much lower to be discovered,

652
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,320
 the chances of losing an entire experienced crew is zero,

653
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,760
 if they're on a base somewhere and they're flying the UFO.

654
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,880
 Like, because drone technology has advanced so much,

655
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,520
 you would have to assume that alien drone technology

656
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,480
 would be light literal light years ahead of us.

657
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,680
 It wouldn't make sense to put three tiny people on a ship,

658
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,240
 on a crowded little ship and shoot them across the cosmos.

659
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,080
 You could shoot them across the cosmos,

660
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,640
 but then they set up a base on Mars

661
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,760
 and they use that to interact with us,

662
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,920
 sending little UFOs down.

663
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,360
 He ends his conversation with this,

664
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,960
 he says that on his planet,

665
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,480
 there's a population of 200 million people.

666
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,480
 There's no skyscrapers, all the buildings are pretty level,

667
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,320
 we'll get into that,

668
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,120
 that's a really important detail in a second.

669
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,240
 He says there's no starvation because they all eat albumin,

670
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,640
 which I oughta look that up.

671
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,680
 It's egg white, that's their entire diet is egg white.

672
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,400
 And he goes, they make it, they have this process

673
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,640
 that they can make tons of albumin in one minute.

674
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,760
 They don't need a ton of chicken,

675
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,560
 they're like step one, get 10 trillion chickens.

676
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,440
 No, they can mass produce this albumin and they eat it.

677
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,680
 That's the only food they need.

678
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,840
 I'm sure they probably make it tastier,

679
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,040
 like putting spices in it and make it shaped like a chicken

680
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,480
 and then eat it, who knows?

681
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,680
 Maybe they do, but it doesn't matter,

682
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,360
 that's all they eat, it doesn't matter what it looks like.

683
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,760
 It's still egg white.

684
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,600
 And he goes, there's no starvation.

685
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,360
 And he offers L, the recipe.

686
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,440
 He goes, how would you like to be able

687
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
 to make tons of albumin in a minute?

688
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,720
 And she refuses, she's like, that's so disgusting.

689
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,880
 That's so gross.

690
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,960
 Even though I live in the Soviet Union in 1982,

691
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,800
 I would rather stand in a bread line

692
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,400
 than just eat egg white.

693
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,840
 That's pretty much the end of the conversation.

694
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,440
 He does say, I'll see you again every four years.

695
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,360
 And they did return in 1986, 1990 and 1994.

696
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,040
 It's a typical alien story.

697
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,920
 We have kind of a communication of ideas.

698
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,680
 You have her kind of being shocked

699
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,200
 by the presence of these guys, very typical.

700
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,480
 The reason why I wanted to cover it

701
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,400
 is not for all that stuff.

702
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,000
 It is interesting, I always think it's interesting

703
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,320
 when aliens talk about religion.

704
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,160
 It seems like such a man-made thing,

705
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,040
 but we see all these stories

706
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,600
 that make us think of something else.

707
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,600
 But what if aliens are dumb is the point of this story?

708
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,120
 'Cause I saved some stuff here for the end.

709
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,960
 We kind of sprinkled it on throughout.

710
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,920
 But the, I still, I think science,

711
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,960
 I think science is wrong.

712
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
 I think you could have undiscovered elements out there.

713
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,160
 I do.

714
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,480
 I think that we don't know what we don't know.

715
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,800
 It's a phrase I use a lot in my personal life.

716
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,720
 We don't know what we don't know.

717
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,840
 But then there's stuff that this alien says

718
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,360
 that is knowably false.

719
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,680
 It's absolutely not true.

720
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,600
 So let's go back to when he said

721
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,400
 that the buildings on his planet were not skyscrapers.

722
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,760
 He's talking about climate change.

723
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,160
 He's talking about the elements.

724
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,800
 He's talking about life being eternal,

725
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,880
 flowing through the universe.

726
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,880
 He also says that we are a lopsided part

727
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,320
 of a lopsided planet.

728
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,760
 He tells this woman in 1982, listen lady,

729
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,880
 I know you're just some girl walking through the woods,

730
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,520
 but you have a serious problem you need to address.

731
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,520
 People have built buildings on the wrong side of the planet.

732
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,280
 So because we have skyscrapers

733
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,320
 and they're not evenly spread out,

734
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,960
 like our civilizations tend to be along the coastlines

735
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,260
 and along rivers,

736
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,080
 we've actually unbalanced the world.

737
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,720
 The buildings are making the world wobble a little too much

738
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,960
 and it's actually gonna make the earth.

739
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,060
 If you don't, lady, if you don't

740
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,440
 in the middle of the woods and Russia fix this,

741
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,160
 if you guys keep building cities

742
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,800
 and the population keeps growing,

743
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,400
 the planet earth is actually going to fly out of orbit.

744
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,680
 It's actually gonna get so wobbly.

745
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,720
 You're like fine, you're putting the last rivet

746
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,240
 in this new building, they're like hand me that rivet Tony.

747
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,600
 Finally, this building is done,

748
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,120
 (imitates popping)

749
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,320
 and then all of a sudden,

750
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,760
 (imitates popping)

751
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,440
 the next thing you know, we're orbiting Jupiter.

752
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,960
 That is not possible.

753
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,080
 I don't even think I have to explain the science

754
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,120
 of why that's not possible, but I will

755
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,520
 because I actually think it's super interesting.

756
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,680
 Everything on this planet is from this planet.

757
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,240
 Like when we build a massive skyscraper,

758
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,400
 all that stuff is from the planet.

759
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,520
 We're not adding anything to the planet

760
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,000
 or taking anything away.

761
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,440
 We're just building this skyscraper.

762
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,760
 And I did an episode on this a long time ago

763
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,660
 'cause I was curious about this, I had to look it up.

764
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,400
 The earth gets heavier every single year

765
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,240
 by tons, gets heavier every single year

766
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,220
 through space dust and meteorite impacts.

767
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,220
 So the world gets heavier and bigger every year.

768
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,080
 It doesn't matter what we do as far as building the stuff.

769
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,760
 It's interesting because as he, so on his planet,

770
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,080
 there's no uneven buildings.

771
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,840
 All everything was perfectly mapped out.

772
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,200
 So their planet didn't go wobbling off into the cosmos.

773
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,240
 If we keep building along coastal lines,

774
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,680
 and it's not, I keep saying skyscraper,

775
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,200
 it's not even only the size of the buildings.

776
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,000
 Like that's part of it, but just if you have

777
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,560
 too many even small buildings on one side of the planet,

778
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,960
 the planet's gonna flat out orbit.

779
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,480
 People forget how massive earth is.

780
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,820
 That's the thing with the flat earth theory.

781
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,760
 They go way up and they're like, I don't see the curve.

782
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,040
 The earth is so huge.

783
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,940
 Like even just the size of the earth

784
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,120
 can be mind boggling sometimes.

785
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,920
 What's interesting is if coastal,

786
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,200
 he talked about the climate change,

787
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,320
 if the coastal cities are wiped out in 2050,

788
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,000
 that'll actually reset the clock.

789
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,280
 'Cause all of that coastal buildings,

790
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,940
 all of those uneven cities will actually save.

791
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,400
 So he's saying climate change is good.

792
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,800
 So take that YouTube, take that YouTube algorithm

793
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,080
 that's gonna hear me say climate change is good

794
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,680
 and do something funky to this video.

795
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,280
 He also says that, you know, when he was showing the,

796
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,600
 I left this part out 'cause I wanted to add it to the end.

797
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,320
 He said when he was showing the map of the ancient world,

798
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,080
 he said the pyramids were built

799
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,560
 with the assistance of aliens.

800
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,240
 In fact, it wasn't just myself.

801
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,640
 I'm not 10,000 years old.

802
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,120
 Wasn't just our alien race.

803
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,880
 There were five different star systems worth of aliens.

804
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,160
 They all came down to build these pyramids.

805
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,160
 But the pyramids exude an ionized poison.

806
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,640
 So you can't go near them.

807
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,320
 If you're around the pyramids too long,

808
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,440
 it'll kill both humans and aliens

809
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,560
 'cause they're just these powerful aliens.

810
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,840
 That's not true.

811
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,680
 That's not true.

812
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,000
 Now, if you told somebody that in 1982, Russia,

813
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,640
 it might, I mean, there weren't bumpkins

814
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,880
 that might've raised an eyebrow or three

815
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,440
 'cause she's living near that radioactive bomb factory.

816
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,840
 But that's not true.

817
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
 Like there are, I'm not saying there's like

818
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,040
 people living right next to the pyramids,

819
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,120
 but there are people who make their job,

820
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,560
 their tour guides around the pyramids.

821
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,200
 They're not mutants.

822
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,600
 They're not ionized poisonous freaks

823
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,200
 unless that's the biggest cover up of all.

824
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,800
 Maybe I've exposed the biggest conspiracy.

825
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,480
 I just dropped the ultimate red pill, the pyramid pill.

826
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,320
 So it's an issue.

827
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,720
 This story is just kind of interesting to look at

828
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,720
 because the aliens fly away and she has this information.

829
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,480
 She passes it on to the journalist

830
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,400
 and we have this story.

831
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,480
 She wrote, "What if aliens arang?"

832
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,520
 Aliens are interesting

833
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,040
 'cause it's the one paranormal phenomenon

834
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,000
 that we assume is smarter than us.

835
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,240
 Like sure, people look to angels and demons for guidance.

836
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,840
 Well, people look to demons for shortcuts.

837
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,480
 People look to demons for shortcuts

838
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,720
 'cause they wanna get rich and famous

839
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,480
 and they don't have any of that Serban DNA in them.

840
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,400
 They weren't lucky enough to have that made up thing

841
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,280
 put inside their body.

842
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,760
 So they'll turn to demonic forces

843
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,600
 to become rich and famous.

844
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,440
 They'll look for shortcuts.

845
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,520
 People talk to angels for protection.

846
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,840
 But ghosts, people even when they're like talking to ghosts

847
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,360
 maybe they'll wanna know the future

848
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,720
 but no one's ever like using a Ouija board

849
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,840
 to find the answer to some equation

850
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,280
 or to find the cure for cancer

851
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,120
 or to do something like,

852
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,040
 which they should know that the thing about it,

853
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,960
 we did cover the soul phone.

854
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,000
 The people who were trying to build the phone,

855
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,320
 we'll put that episode in the show notes.

856
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,520
 Every time I say that phrase,

857
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,920
 it costs me five extra minutes at work.

858
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,160
 Guys, I have to go pull up the episode

859
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,240
 but the soul phone,

860
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,960
 they were trying to get this phone built

861
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,080
 so they could talk to the dead

862
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,360
 and to help with scientific advances.

863
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,320
 But for the most part,

864
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,120
 go start to spooky people who hang out in your closets

865
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,320
 and stand in dark hallways.

866
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,480
 Bigfoot is just a big old dummy

867
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,520
 trying to hook up with some dudes at Cock Rock in Oregon.

868
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,400
 You know what I mean?

869
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,280
 Cryptids are just these monsters.

870
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,840
 Aliens are the ones we assume are smarter than ourselves.

871
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,240
 And it's interesting because it is,

872
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,920
 it does have a bit of the demonic in it

873
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,880
 that we want them to solve our problems.

874
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,200
 There's people who believe aliens

875
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,020
 are gonna invade the planet

876
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,440
 but there's a lot of alien enthusiasts

877
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,920
 who believe they're gonna save the planet.

878
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,760
 They're gonna help cure us,

879
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,400
 they're gonna bring us together.

880
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,240
 In a good way,

881
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,560
 we become part of the space brotherhood.

882
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,640
 It's a shortcut.

883
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,160
 'Cause we can't do it ourselves.

884
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,560
 We can't do it ourselves, right?

885
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,740
 We can't see past each other's differences

886
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,000
 and we can't hold each other's hands

887
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,920
 with people that we absolutely hate

888
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,760
 and realize that all of this stuff

889
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
 is so fleeting, what's the point?

890
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,440
 Let's be together now.

891
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,280
 We can't do that.

892
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,400
 We can't do that as a people.

893
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,640
 We can't do that as cultures.

894
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,960
 So aliens can do it.

895
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,440
 It's a shortcut, it's a shortcut.

896
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,360
 We don't wanna do it ourselves.

897
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,440
 But what if they're wrong?

898
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,760
 Like what if they are wrong?

899
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,880
 The uneven city thing just is scientifically invalid.

900
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
 It's an interesting story

901
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,000
 because what he's saying is false.

902
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,400
 And we put a lot of faith in these aliens

903
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,360
 to come down and save us.

904
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,640
 And we covered recently,

905
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,960
 like what if aliens are demonic?

906
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,200
 What if they're trying to take over the world?

907
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,560
 What if it's not even that sinister?

908
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,240
 What if they're just as dumb as we are sometimes?

909
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,200
 They just give bad advice.

910
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,320
 What if a fleet of UFOs came down tomorrow

911
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,600
 and said this stuff?

912
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,520
 You'll find these undiscovered elements.

913
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,000
 Life is eternal.

914
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,880
 Move your cities around or the world's gonna go full.

915
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,920
 How would people take that?

916
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,740
 They clearly are smarter than us.

917
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,920
 They have this fleet of UFOs.

918
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,040
 They've descended from the heavens.

919
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,080
 They're clearly more technologically advanced from us.

920
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,640
 Would we as a species be smart enough to go, you're wrong?

921
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,520
 Like you may be smarter than us in some stuff,

922
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,760
 but that's not true.

923
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,760
 We know your planet may be wobbly.

924
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,240
 It's funny, I said, well, we do, we know the answer.

925
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,720
 Most people would acquiesce to the aliens.

926
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,920
 They go, well, they must know more than us.

927
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,280
 Let's start changing the way we build cities.

928
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,680
 And that would be the least of my worries, right?

929
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,440
 Imagine if they go, these aliens, no way more than us.

930
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,720
 They have all this advanced technology.

931
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,480
 They've shown us where these riches are.

932
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,200
 We haven't found these undiscovered elements yet,

933
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,880
 but they've shown us where these riches are.

934
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,480
 We've moved our cities and everything seems to be great.

935
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,580
 They also only have a population of 200 million.

936
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,800
 We're seven billion.

937
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,640
 They know more than us.

938
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,920
 Maybe that's the correct thing to do as well.

939
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,760
 Sometimes when we listen to the so-called

940
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,040
 smartest people in the room,

941
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,040
 we end up making the dumbest and deadliest decisions.

942
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,720

 I'm glad you listened to it today.
