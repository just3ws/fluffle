 containers at your local garden center. Proven Winners, the brand gardeners trust.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:37,460
 A real life outbreak of werewolves in modern-day South America. And then we

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,020
 travel to Malawai, a small country in Africa, where a spate of vampire attacks

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,620
 forces the citizens to take the law into their own hands today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,820
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,220
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great

12
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:10,420
 day too. Day five of Vampire Week, fifth episode recorded in one day. I've never

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,900
 done this before. I'm feeling it a bit. I'm feeling it a bit. I still have to go

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,500
 back and edit Monday's episode, so I'm not done yet. But if I, the sooner I can get

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,580
 all these episodes over, the sooner I can get back to my true passion, Minecraft.

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,540
 Avoiding creepers deep under the earth. You know, I've thought about this. Get back

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,220
 to me and tell me if you guys think this is a good idea. But for the Patreon

18
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,260
 supporters, and I talked to Dan, Ash, and Carson about this last night. Again, this

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,500
 is a week for you guys, but Patreon supporters, or people thinking about

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,500
 becoming Patreon supporters, would you be interested in having a private

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,020
 Minecraft server where we can all play Minecraft together? Let me know through

22
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,780
 email or comments or whatever. But yeah, I think it'd be fun. I'm just looking for

23
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,580
 an excuse to play more Minecraft. I'm getting, I think I'm getting to the point

24
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,140
 where it's getting a little too boring, but yeah, I'm still playing it. Let's go

25
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,580
 ahead and get started with the episode here, so I can get to editing the first

26
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,260
 episode. Now, Mason Norbeck is the guy who sent me all these Vampire Links, and

27
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,740
 it's funny now that I've recorded the week's worth episode. I think I only

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,260
 used like two of his ideas. I saved the rest. We may use those in the future, but

29
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,500
 I really appreciate the suggestions, Mason. Today's episode includes two of his

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,500
 suggestions, actually. And the first one, he declared as gross. Sent it to me anyways.

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,460
 Sent it to me anyways, but said it was gross. I had actually read the article

32
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,060
 before he sent it to me, so I had all my research done, and I just plugged his

33
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,740
 little name into it, and it was very, very easy to do. So this is a request by

34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,620
 Mason. That actually happens a lot. I'll have a story ready to go, and someone

35
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,580
 will be like, "Hey, have you thought about doing this?" Just throw them in there.

36
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,820
 So, because I always appreciate hearing recommendations from you guys. So,

37
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,060
 we are going to Spain. We were just there earlier in the week for the running of

38
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,660
 the balls, and now we're back. We were in Costa del Sol. Actually, damn it. I

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,100
 realized in the introduction I said this story took place in South America. It

40
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,420
 actually takes place in Spain, and I'm not going to edit that. So, just

41
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,940
 retroactively thank, well, technically Spain, colonized South America, so

42
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,900
 never mind. There's nothing working around that. Anyways, so Spain,

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,700
 Costa del Sol. So, kids were having tummy aches. It's a totally true story, by the

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,020
 way. Tons of photos about this. Kids are like, "Oh, mommy, my tummy hurts. I was

45
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,620
 eating too much spicy food, and I told you not to eat all those jalapenos,

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,860
 and he's like, "I know, but it's a stereotype. I have to fulfill my stereotype."

47
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,060
 She's like, "Drink some milk," and they're like, "Uh, maybe." But they're tummy

48
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:42,580
 hurts. So, their moms, their collective moms, go get them antacid, specifically

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,900
 omeprazole. Omeprazole. And I think that's either prilosec or one of the main ones.

50
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,660
 That's the ingredient. Omeprazole. Kids are like, "Take the pill." They're like, "Oh,

51
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,500
 they're starting jalapenos again." The mom's like, "No, stop eating it. You're more than

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,660
 just the stereotype." They're like, "But am I mom? Am I?" They're having an existential crisis.

53
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,420
 They're eyeing that bowl of jalapenos. She's like, "Eat a peach." They're like, "Okay, I'll

54
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,660
 eat a peach." Kids are eating peaches now. Their stomach feels better. And then they wake up the

55
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,100
 next morning. I don't know if it's the next morning, but just for the sake of the story,

56
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,300
 they wake up the next morning and they're rubbing their eyes. They're like, "Uh,

57
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:23,140
 so tired. It's such a go..." I don't know why I'm yawning. Say I'm tired. It's the morning. They're

58
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,460
 like, "Huey Lewis and the new songs play in. They're getting ready. They go to brush their teeth.

59
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,300
 They're doing everything they can possibly do without looking in the mirror." And then they look

60
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,180
 in the mirror and they're covered in hair. They're like, "No!" And they call their mom. They all have

61
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,580
 one mom. Again, it's the mom of the village. They're like, "Mom, mom, and think of turning into a dog."

62
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:49,780
 And she's like, "Yeah, it doesn't appear that way, son and/or daughter." So what happened was

63
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,420
 there was a tainted batch of this antacid medicine. It was mixed with monoxidil. So

64
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:06,660
 all the parietal is for its tummy aches and monoxidil is for people with alopecia, so hair loss.

65
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:14,100
 So these kids were getting this rapid hair growth all over their body. 16 kids in Spain basically

66
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,380
 became werewolves because they had a tummy ache. And it was kind of unclear. They said if they stopped

67
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,420
 taking the medicine, which I'm sure they would, they're not gonna be like, "Mmm, furry or stomach ache.

68
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,820
 Like, just stop eating spicy food for a day, guys." If they stopped taking the medicine,

69
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,380
 they'd stop growing the hair, but it was unclear. I don't think their hair just would fall off.

70
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,020
 I think they would still have to shave their face and their entire body because they would look like

71
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,140
 little puppy people. They looked like dogs. Now, I know what you guys are thinking. You're like,

72
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,660
 "Hey, where can I get myself some of this tainted stuff?" I want to be furry too. Unfortunately,

73
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,100
 only works on children. So if you have a desire to become a werewolf or just look like one or have

74
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,580
 a great Halloween costume, that'd be dope. You walk into the party, you're like, "Hey guys, what's

75
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,500
 up?" You're like, "Dude, that's a great Teen Wolf costume." You're like, "Yeah, it's pretty good.

76
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,540
 Do you have any spicy food I can eat?" Because trust me, I can eat anything now. It doesn't work

77
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,540
 on adults though. It only works on kids. However, you can make your kids take it and they become

78
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,860
 all furry. You're like, "Look at me. I got Ewoks for Halloween." And they're like, "Dad, please.

79
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,780
 I want to go back to school. I'm tired of looking like this." Shut up. You wouldn't even stop taking

80
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,420
 it November 1st. So yeah, werewolf story. Thank you, Mason. Little kid's turning into werewolves.

81
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,580
 That's hilarious. It's adorable too. You should see the photos. Like, I mean, yeah, they're probably

82
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,220
 quite miserable, but they're little puppy people. Little puppy people. Here's a new segment. I'm

83
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,620
 never going to do this again. I'm just doing it because it's Friday and this is my fifth episode

84
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,020
 recording a row. Today's segment, and feel free to skip ahead five minutes, today's segment is

85
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,860
 Jason pitches a movie to an audience who has no power to make said movie. Great segment, but it

86
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:07,860
 only be done once. The year is 2080. Long time in the future, right? And all the cars are self-driving.

87
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,340
 It's a beautiful, shining city. These cars are like, "Doo." It's like a row of cars perfectly

88
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,660
 ordered coming through town. The roads are all like robotic censored and stuff. C-3PO Street.

89
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,980
 All the automated cars are coming down the road. Perfect orderly society. Everyone's just waking

90
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,500
 up to go to work. Everyone's wearing like shiny, shiny clothes. They look like the future for

91
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,540
 Minority Report mixed with the future from Demolition Man. They're just just a really like

92
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,900
 bright future. You're like, "Didn't a bunch of people die in those movies?" Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm

93
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,100
 just talking about the Asiatic. Asiatic? Whatever. It looks nice. And as these cars are doing their

94
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,060
 commute down this automated road, you're like, "Jason, just tell a goat story." As these cars are

95
00:07:51,060 --> 00:08:00,340
 doing their commute down an automated road, a monster truck flattens a bunch of cars,

96
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:06,980
 just running off the roads. Now, the police cars are also like self-driving. The cops are just

97
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:13,140
 in the backseat and they're like, "Go, car, go!" But in the road like shifts so the cop car can

98
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,540
 get to where it's going, but it's still like on an automated road. It has no off-road capability.

99
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:23,140
 While they're watching this big, big monster truck with these giant wheels just jump over the roads

100
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,940
 and smash cars, he gets in front of a bank. A bunch of people come out with guns, kick on the door,

101
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,860
 steal the money. And while the cops are still trying to get their automated car there,

102
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:39,620
 big truck goes off. And then they're back in the police precinct and the sheriff, not the sheriff,

103
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:46,820
 the police chief is like, "This is the third big wheel monster truck robbery this week. We've got

104
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,420
 to stop these guys." And they're like, "But sir, all the roads are automated. We don't know how to

105
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:56,660
 make our cars." Do that. That's like old technology. That technology was made illegal like 50 years ago

106
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,860
 when they had all these greenhouse emission gas policies passed. You can put a little political

107
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,340
 thing in there. They're like, "Yeah, remember when that president took over and he made us get rid of

108
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,420
 like cow farts or whatever?" And they're like, "Yeah, yeah, I know." So they had to get rid of all the

109
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,700
 vehicles. So that's why it's this beautiful green, everything solar powered, right? You get a little

110
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:21,380
 bit of political subtext in there. So anyways, you know, or not, I don't care, whatever backstory.

111
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,660
 Cars are illegal. Everything is solar powered, little eight pod cars that are self-controlled.

112
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,420
 Maybe people are getting too many traffic tickets. Whatever. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

113
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,860
 That's for you guys to figure out. You're the producer. So anyways, they're like,

114
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,500
 "We have to stop this monster truck. We can't. None of our cars can catch it." And then one of the

115
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,420
 young officers goes, "Wait a second. I think I have a plan." And then he's like walking through

116
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,740
 the streets because he doesn't want to drive a car because he knows they suck. And you hear

117
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,980
 like limp biscuits start playing over the soundtrack. Roll and roll and roll and roll and

118
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,420
 what? Keep rolling and roll. And the guy's walking and he goes into this museum like this

119
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,980
 deserted automobile museum and he's walking through it. Of course it's deserted. Otherwise,

120
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,100
 he would have come up with this plan earlier. He's walking through the museum and he finds what

121
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:15,860
 he's looking for. And then we see that officer's name tag. It's Lieutenant Toretto and he's looking

122
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:23,860
 at his great-great-grandfather's Dodge Charger. This movie is fast and the furious, but it takes

123
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:32,580
 place in the future. It's called The Last of the Furious. And it's Dom Toretto's great-great-grandson

124
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,300
 driving around this car and the whole movie is just smashing over nerds and they're like

125
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:43,700
 efficient, fuel efficient vehicles. And you're like, "Jason, that's cool. I know. Thank you."

126
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,980
 And here's the end of the trailer. You see the big rig driving through like this high tech building

127
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,060
 and Lieutenant Toretto's driving and he's like has some hot chick who just magically appears in

128
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:01,300
 the passenger seat. She was in the museum. She was in the museum the whole time. She got locked in

129
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,540
 so she's dressed like a hot chick from 2013 and there was enough food for her for six years

130
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:16,500
 and she hasn't aged, but anyways. The car, so the big... The monster truck is driving through this

131
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,220
 high tech building. The charger's right behind it and you see the monster truck like smash

132
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:29,060
 through the wall and then Dom Toretto Jr. is driving the car and he goes, turns to the hot

133
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,460
 chick and he's like, "Hold on." And then he goes through the window. They're on the...

134
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:42,500
 They're on the moon. So they've left this domed city on the moon and we just see the vehicle

135
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:54,180
 flying up into the night sky. They're like, they're just going too fast. They can't even be held on

136
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,700
 the moon with the gravitational pull. So the last shot you see the trailer is just this big rig.

137
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:06,260
 This monster truck flying through space and this charger flying after it. Dude, tell me you wouldn't

138
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:12,100
 watch that movie. James Wan. I know you listen to this podcast, make it happen. The last,

139
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:18,580
 the last of the furious. Okay, there we go. Let's go ahead and get back to the actual topic

140
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:27,380
 of this podcast. Don't worry guys, I won't do that again. Okay, let me drink some of this Jason

141
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:36,020
 juice. What is it? J juice? It's the same cup. Anyways, here we go. Let's go to Mollewa.

142
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,580
 Mason Norbeck also recommended this story. This is the last story of Empire Week.

143
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,420
 It's been a fun week. It's been a fun week. So let's go to Mollewa. We're going to take

144
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,740
 Dom Torino's charger. We're going to drive from the moon. We're going to crash land in Mollewa.

145
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,860
 We're going back to 2017. Very, very recent story. Very recent story. And I tried to see if it's

146
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,820
 happening nowadays and I'm pretty sure it is, but you'll understand why we're not getting any reporters

147
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,340
 over there. Mollewa is the country. This is, this mostly affected regions in the south, but again,

148
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,420
 it's pretty widespread. It's, and it actually has gone over into other countries as well.

149
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,220
 There's a Belgian couple driving through Mollewa. And as they're driving on the road, a mob just

150
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,100
 kind of appears out of nowhere and begins attacking the vehicle, begins dragging them out. And

151
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,580
 obviously you're going to be petrified. You're driving on the road, your car gets surrounded

152
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,740
 by 20 people. They have our armed machetes. They're armed with rocks. They're banging on your car.

153
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,140
 They're able to get through the windows. They start punching through the windows if you're a lucky.

154
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,220
 They're trying, they're dragging you out of the car. But what they're calling you,

155
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,940
 sends shivers up your spine. They're calling you bloodsuckers. They're kicking you in the face.

156
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:53,220
 Vampires beating you up. Cops show up, disperse the mob. There was this entrepreneur, this business

157
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:00,020
 owner named Orlando Champanda. Also in the same area. He's at his house enjoying just like reading

158
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,580
 the newspaper. He says there's nothing printed because all the reporters have left. They're like,

159
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,780
 screw this. I'm not going to be here. It's the Daily Malawi and it's just, it's just they give

160
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:16,980
 you a notepad and they're like, make your own news up. We're out. He's sitting at home. 2,000 people

161
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,020
 show up at his house. You're like, party? No. Mob. You should have guessed it from the first part.

162
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:31,620
 Mob shows up, calling him a vampire, calling him a drinker of human blood. They lay siege to his

163
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,460
 house. They're also armed with machetes and stones and he's hiding in his house. They're laying

164
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,940
 siege to his house. The police show up and it takes the police five out, I think 2,000 people

165
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,420
 surrounding a house. Like he had to, I'm sure it was probably like, like a home alone type thing.

166
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,620
 He was like heating up irons and they're like hitting people on heads and like taking ladders

167
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,780
 and putting tax in them or whatever. He's able to evade the attackers for five hours, which is

168
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,260
 quite the feat. The police show up and it takes them five hours to disperse this crowd. 2,000

169
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,180
 people is a lot of people. Police finally start shooting tear gas into the crowd, which really,

170
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,180
 that should be happening in the first five minutes, but they get the crowd dispersed.

171
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,540
 Now this was reported in 2017. It had been happened earlier that year. What had happened

172
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,460
 where you have in these mobs of people, surround dudes, chicks, it doesn't matter, killing them.

173
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:25,700
 They had nine people killed over the past previous months. A lot of people just attacked,

174
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,540
 but nine people killed. One of them was a dude with epilepsy and they're like, ah, the vampire,

175
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,780
 look at that weirdo vampire over there, stoned them and then set them on fire while he was still

176
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,740
 alive. So basically they were just attacking these people. They believed that vampires had

177
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,620
 invaded their country August 2018. It's funny because we talked about, I talked about the

178
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,180
 daycare center on yesterday's episode and I was like, it's nothing like that story. It's just a

179
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,260
 daycare center that's gross looking. People have created this whole myth about it. And then you

180
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,420
 have this here. You have this little story I'm about to tell you completely under the rug, never

181
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,060
 heard about it before. It should be fodder for conspiracy theorists. I don't know why it's not.

182
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:08,500
 In 2018, the BBC sent a television crew, sent a film crew out to go document a string of murders

183
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,740
 in Malawi. They find the killer. They go undercover, right? They meet up with the killer and the killer

184
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:21,140
 is killing children and selling the blood and body parts of the children to wealthy people.

185
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,780
 So all of that stuff you want to pretend happens in Salt Lake City, I'm not going to preach about

186
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,740
 that again, but all this stuff you want to pretend about happens in Salt Lake City,

187
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,140
 what's happening here? The point where an investigative film crew was able to track him

188
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,060
 down and get him to talk about, oh yeah, I know, I kill kids and I sell the body parts to all these

189
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,420
 wealthy people. It's a conspiracy theorist's wet dream, really. As they're doing this undercover

190
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:49,060
 sting on this guy, much of vampire hunters show up. A mob shows up and lays siege to these guys and

191
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,460
 the killer gets away. They never found him again. And the BBC crew, they're like, we thought we

192
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,460
 were going to die. Like, we didn't know what was happening. We just got surrounded by a mob,

193
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,860
 people are calling us vampires attacking us. Now, Malawi is the sixth poorest nation in the world.

194
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:13,300
 And it's the reaction to all of this is so bizarre. So here's where, let's go ahead and go back to

195
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,500
 where these stories came from. You started getting people in towns saying, I woke up in the middle

196
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,540
 of the night and there was a light like fire in my room. And I felt like the blood was getting

197
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,340
 sucked out of me. Here's a quote from one of the people who said they were attacked by a vampire.

198
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:35,140
 This is not hearsay. I know my blood was sucked. I saw light on the corner of my roof. I failed to

199
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,780
 stand up from my bed and felt something piercing my left arm. The other person who said they saw

200
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,260
 the light like fire in the room, they also felt a piercing in their finger. Now, those aren't the

201
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,500
 only two people. Other people have reported these things, but those two quotes were used over and

202
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,540
 over again because the problem is, is like, humanitarian groups were pulling their people

203
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,020
 out. They're like, we cannot guarantee your safety. There was like some UN outreach group

204
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,460
 pulled their people out. They're like, we can't guarantee your safety. These mobs are just

205
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,100
 thanking everyone's a vampire. So there aren't a lot of reporters on the ground to get more quotes,

206
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:13,060
 but this surge of attacks getting your blood sucked out. So what's weird though is that the

207
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:19,540
 accounts we do have from, or the articles we do have regarding this, everyone seems to go,

208
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:25,700
 oh, they don't really believe in vampires. They believe in this. Let me read you two of these

209
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,700
 headlines here. I think they're interesting way, the way that Western journalists are looking at

210
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:36,260
 this story. One of the headlines is, "How colonialism fueled deadly anti-vampire hysteria in Malawi."

211
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:43,860
 Another headline, "Climate change is creating vampires in Malawi." Fairly click baity, but what

212
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,780
 these articles, almost every article I read on this set, listen, these people don't actually believe

213
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:55,220
 in physical vampires. What they believe in is the inequality between the rich and the poor. They see

214
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,740
 themselves as very poor and they see other people with money and it's a metaphorical vampire. You

215
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,860
 see, it's not a real vampire. And that's when they say, oh, the climate change is destroying the farm

216
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:11,060
 land. It's mostly agricultural and they're upset at what's going on. So they've created the rumor

217
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,500
 of the vampire to focus their anger on the people who are more wealthy than them. Now, even some

218
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,740
 people who do believe it's a physical vampire say, listen, I'll be honest with you, there's a bunch

219
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,420
 of crooks, a bunch of thieves and thugs that are using the cover of the vampire story to go around

220
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:32,180
 and beat people up and steal stuff. I'll be honest with you. However, I do believe vampires are, it's

221
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:39,700
 sucking people's blood. The president of Malawi said in a statement, if people are using witchcraft

222
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:48,100
 to suck people's blood, I will deal with them. That was president Peter Mathurica. But later,

223
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,460
 he said, there is no evidence of bloodsuckers. It is a lie meant to destabilize the region.

224
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:01,620
 Those spreading rumors will face the law. Why are they pushing the idea so hard

225
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,660
 that these are metaphorical vampires? I find that really weird and I don't really subscribe to the

226
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,540
 fake news thing a lot. But I find that really weird when in the same articles people are like,

227
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,220
 yeah, I was sleeping in bed and something came into my room and started sucking my blood. In those

228
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,620
 same articles, they'll say, really, people don't believe in vampires. It's just a way for them to

229
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,340
 focus their anger at the rich. But I'm like, you just included two accounts of people who said they

230
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,420
 were physically attacked by vampires. They didn't say Bill Gates and Donald Trump came into their

231
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,420
 room and took their money. They said, I saw a light and something pricked my finger and the

232
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,660
 blood got sucked out. In Mozambique, neighboring country, which is where this really started,

233
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:45,140
 the vampire paranoia spread from Mozambique, the people started saying there was this town and

234
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,300
 these people said, vampires are attacking us and you're not doing anything about it.

235
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:56,580
 And the police are like, well, there's no vampires. And then the people go, you're protecting the

236
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:02,740
 vampires. The police is actively protecting the vampires that are attacking us. And it got so

237
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:09,220
 bad the town's administrator, which like the top dog, had to leave the city because the people were

238
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,460
 convinced that the police and the local government were aiding vampires and attacking the populace.

239
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,780
 Let's look at a couple of the theories here. One is that the media is correct and this is all just

240
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,980
 a big misunderstanding. When they say bloodsuckers and vampires, what they really mean is income

241
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,620
 inequality. So that's why they're attacking people. It's not because they actually believe in

242
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:39,780
 witchcraft and vampires, it's that they are trying to, you know, economic revolution. Forget that

243
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,420
 the president said anything about going after people who suck people's blood. No, no, no, no.

244
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,620
 Remember his second statement saying, no, no, no, no, it's to destabilize the region. It's just

245
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,860
 a rumor. This, when I was reading the story, it reminded me of the Chupa Chupa. That was,

246
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,220
 that was I think that was like episode 70 something where I covered Operation Plate. It was

247
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,180
 Brazil's biggest, Brazil's Roswell is what I called it, one of the biggest UFO sightings in

248
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,020
 Brazil. And it went on for months and people would say they'd wake them in the middle of the night,

249
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,980
 there'd be a bright light in their room and they would have piercing pains in parts of their body.

250
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,060
 They felt that the blood was being sucked out of them, so they called them chupa chupas or suck

251
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,620
 sucks. And when I was reading this story, that's really what it reminded me of, honestly. I was

252
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,220
 thinking maybe there's more of like an alien belief here, more of an alien connection. People weren't

253
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,700
 safe in their houses, it was happening all the time. Now in Brazil, it was in one particular

254
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,220
 region and they're just like, well this sucks. And they didn't really know what to do and they got

255
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,860
 some outside help and then the Air Force ended up showing up, the Brazilian Air Force, investigating

256
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,820
 it and it went away after a couple months. This one, these dudes aren't messing around. One, I don't

257
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,460
 think Malawi has an Air Force. And two, they're like, oh no, I got bit by a vampire, I'm going to

258
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,540
 smash your house to pieces. Now people have said in Malawi, because you go, well how come it's only

259
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,100
 like the Belgian couple or other than the epileptic guy, the other entrepreneur, stuff like that,

260
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:05,300
 the BBC film crew, people have said in Malawi, kind of, there's nothing for free. If you have

261
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,500
 nice things, it means you did something bad to get them. So that's a real conspiratorial belief.

262
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,300
 Someone's doing better than you, they must be a vampire. But that doesn't mean that I think

263
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,380
 they're hunting metaphorical vampires and that seems to be, you see someone who's doing something

264
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,700
 nice, you go, oh they must be a physical vampire, so let's go attack them. Because if I don't,

265
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,220
 then they're going to kill me. These type of rumors aren't new in 1930s in Zambia, which I don't

266
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,300
 think is around anymore, but colonial Zambia. There was a rumor that Europeans were taking the blood

267
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:41,540
 out of native African people and turning them into cough drops. So again, I think there is kind of,

268
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,260
 you can kind of draw a connection between like colonialism people coming into your country

269
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:52,820
 and you thinking of them as being blood suckers. But it's one thing for me to go, my boss really

270
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,940
 abuses me versus my boss sneaks into my room at night, pricks my finger and drinks my blood.

271
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,740
 Like I think that that is what they feel is actually happening. They're under physical

272
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,860
 assault and that's why they're physically assaulting other people and killing other people. But here's

273
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:14,500
 the thing, now of course I don't expect Vice Magazine or wherever I got these articles from.

274
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,820
 And thanks for this too, Mason. Mason, I don't know if I said this earlier, this is one of the

275
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,180
 topics Mason sent me, but British Newspapers, BBC.com, Vice.com, I don't expect them to say

276
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:29,860
 vampires are real, but let's look at this logically for a second. If you were a vampire,

277
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:36,740
 where would you go? Like really, if you were a vampire and you wanted to feed indiscriminately,

278
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,780
 people have always said, oh you know you go to like war, I think I said that on an early

279
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,380
 episode too, go to a war, go to a war-torn area. You feed off all sorts of people, but you'd also

280
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,700
 have a higher chance of getting blown up by a mortar shell. It's not like a vampire from the

281
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,580
 17th century is like, oh I got Bayoneted, big deal, pulls it out, stabs a guy. I mean you're

282
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,820
 walking through a battlefield, a moab falls on top of you. I don't think Dracula can tink a bomb

283
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,940
 that's built to wipe out battalions of troops. I don't think Dracula can even walk away from that.

284
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,260
 So you could go to a battlefield, but you know, then some like Nazi may break out a flamethrower

285
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:16,420
 and set you on fire. If you were a vampire and you wanted to hunt indiscriminately, if you can

286
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:23,060
 find one of the top 10 poorest countries on the planet, that's a place to go. You wouldn't be a

287
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,660
 vampire in Beverly Hills. You would be a vampire in Malawi. I don't even think you'd be like a

288
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,460
 vampire in a bad neighborhood in LA, because again there's just too much stuff going on.

289
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,460
 But if you just wanted to eat, that's where you would go. It'd be the perfect cover for you.

290
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:45,780
 And if you were one of those highfalutin vampires who took all of his money from the 16th century

291
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,780
 and like invested it, you would totally be connected to everything and be like, I just hope

292
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,340
 it's funny because they go out of their way to say no, no, these vampires aren't real.

293
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:59,780
 But the average person who reads it, including me, goes, no, duh, of course they're not.

294
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,780
 Like you don't have to tell me that vampires aren't real. Vampires are one of the things that I

295
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,420
 would like to be real. Like Bigfoot, I could take them or leave them, but I would have loved if vampires

296
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,420
 really existed. But they don't have to say, I know vampires aren't really attacking. I don't know

297
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,580
 what is going on down there. Maybe some weird superstition, maybe UFO, could be vampire. I don't

298
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,180
 know. But then the fact that the thing is, is they try so hard to prove to me that it's not a

299
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:30,180
 vampire by making all of these cultural or colonial or environmental, the environmental one

300
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,060
 was the weirdest thing, but environmental connections to it, that that makes me more

301
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:41,060
 suspicious. I was just like, what? Like just say, oh, it's an old folklore tale. Of course there's

302
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,060
 not vampires there. I don't know why they have to keep doing these write-ups saying, no, no, vampires

303
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,380
 over there. It's this. It's the fact that there hasn't been any rain that's making the vampires

304
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,700
 attack people. And the weirdest thing of all was the serial killer who was killing kids. You

305
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,220
 didn't think I was going to get back to that. I wouldn't tantalize you with that horrible detail.

306
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:08,580
 The serial killer who as a business is killing kids and selling their blood and body parts to

307
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:16,500
 wealthy people was only in one article, the BBC article. And that is the most important detail

308
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:27,140
 because that is proof of not necessarily vampires, but a vampiric activity. Was an legend, was an

309
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:36,260
 a myth or a fable. He was a man under investigation who got away. Something is haunting the people

310
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:43,300
 of Malawi. They could simply be haunted by their fears of a paranormal creature. And whenever they

311
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:50,180
 wake up with an unusual pain or see something odd at night, they attribute it to a vampire.

312
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,980
 They may be haunted by the ghosts of the past still affecting them economically and culturally.

313
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:05,140
 They could be haunted by thieves using the guise of supernatural enemies to lay siege to people's

314
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:13,460
 personal belongings. They may be haunted by all those things, but we know for sure that they are

315
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:24,500
 haunted by a man who kills and sells kids body parts. We know that for a fact. Who is that dude

316
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:33,540
 selling blood and body parts to? There is no reason why you would need blood and body parts from

317
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,620
 children unless you were a vampire. There is no other reason. Someone is not running a cloning

318
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:46,260
 workshop over there. The only reason you would need to buy that stuff is if you were a vampire.

319
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:54,740
 In Molo, I don't understand that. And the fact that this guy can make a living doing it means

320
00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:00,740
 that either he is getting a lot of money for what he does or he has multiple clients or both.

321
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:09,380
 If there are vampires anywhere in the world, they are in Molo. I find it convenient that we have

322
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,820
 all these other explanations for why people say there are vampires. I find it incredibly convenient

323
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,420
 that the president changed what he said. I also find it convenient that every news story regarding

324
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:31,860
 these incidents ended in 2018. We haven't heard anything since. Secrecy, confusion, chaos, paranoia.

325
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:45,620
 The perfect place for a vampire to hunt is Molo. And it's even better if you have that blood

326
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:53,380
 and gore delivered right to your doorstep. When the president of the country changes what he said

327
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:59,860
 to say vampires don't exist even though he previously said that they did, he's protecting

328
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:07,300
 somebody more powerful than he is. And how can a mob try to fight something that powerful?

329
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:13,060
 They can't. They can just constantly be redirected to attack the wrong targets.

330
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:21,540
 And all the while it is the perfect cover for a creature that feeds on human blood.
