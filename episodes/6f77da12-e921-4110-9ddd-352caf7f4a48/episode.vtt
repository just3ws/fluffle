00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960
 When a man who loves animals so much, society tells him to change.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.960
 He's gonna fight the system.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.920
 But will his nose be a friend or foe?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.920
 That made zero sense.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.420
 What are you talking about?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.420
 Hold on.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.420
 Just keep listening to the episode.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.080
 And then we travel to Japan to take a look at a conspiracy theory that the Japanese Red

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.080
 Cross used young men's own horniness to get them to donate blood.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 Sounds like a pretty cool deal, honestly if you ask me.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.360
 But does this fun story point us towards a much bleaker future?

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.480
 One where the AI controls everything we do.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:59.720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.640
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, and I'm having a great day.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.160
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend doing whatever you're doing.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.000
 I hope you guys are also still working on your 90 days to a better you challenge.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.600
 We started that a couple weeks ago, a couple weeks ago, but you can start whenever it doesn't

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.960
 matter 90 days to a better you.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.560
 Pick a goal and try to complete it within 90 days.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.480
 You're like running for president all of a sudden and you're like "Ah, I only have

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.480
 90 days."

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.980
 Any more than that.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.520
 It's great, it's fun, I'm doing it, a lot of my listeners do it.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.400
 It's free too, this isn't some sort of money making scam.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.920
 Set a goal and see what you can achieve in 90 days.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.840
 Trust me, if you do it, you will be better for it.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.800
 I guess I can't guarantee that you want to be the world's best bank robber you end up

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.960
 in jail and you're like "No, my life sucks now."

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.560
 Not someone who robs banks and never gets caught walking into Dead Rabbit Command right

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.440
 now, everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.920
 Lord Shin 2021.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.400
 Yeah, woohoo, come on in Lord Shin 2021.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.960
 Lord Shin, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy and get this episode

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 started.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.280
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're going to drive all the way out to a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 psychiatrist's office.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.560
 If you're a new listener to the show, you probably didn't notice anything different,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.800
 but long time listeners of the show noticed that I left something out of that intro.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.080
 Normally, I say, if you can't swear to the Patreon, that's fine too, just help spread

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.640
 the word about Dead Rabbit Radio means a lot, but this episode I have some homework for

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640
 you.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.400
 In that psychiatrist, this is real, this is not real, I need this, I need this.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.480
 Everyone is listening to this episode, do you now have a homework assignment?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.800
 In this psychiatrist's office is an item.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.040
 Now it's not just in this psychiatrist's office, apparently this is a tool that many

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.480
 psychiatrists use and I want one of these.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.720
 I kind of need one of these, I'm becoming obsessed, I feel like as I'm talking about it, I'm

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.960
 Indiana Jones looking down a dark jungle tunnel only to see a golden idol sitting on a stone

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.960
 wall.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.080
 I need this.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.320
 Let's take a look at the story of this guy who is experiencing this truly cursed item

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.240
 on the knife, anything comes close to the necromanon, it's this thing, or the necronomicon, I've

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.400
 been told I've been pronouncing it wrong for the past 46 years of my life.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.040
 A cursed object, this guy named Vah Sasha posted this online, we're gonna call him

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040
 Josh.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.840
 Josh, even the story starts off where it's missing so much context, because the story

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.360
 starts off with Josh being arrested for committing bestiality.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.960
 I don't know what that part happened, right?

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.880
 I can't imagine how you get caught doing that.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.600
 I mean, I guess there's a bunch of different ways, right?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.320
 People videotaped themselves doing it, which I get it, sure like rappers will videotape

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.640
 themselves juggling fentanyl and they're like, "This is where I get my money," and they're

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.560
 like sitting on a bunch of dollar bills, not dollar bills, $100 bills, right?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.200
 And they get arrested.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.480
 There is a one famous rapper in San Francisco, actually he wasn't famous, he was famous

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.280
 at underground scene, his name was Kraz, I think it was, and he would rap about how much

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.040
 money he made selling weed, and they scooped him up.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.920
 He's still in prison as far as I know, he got like 20 years for dealing, because he

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.040
 was dealing so much, he was shooting music videos about how much weed he was selling,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040
 but that's fine, right?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.920
 I don't think it's actually illegal, it was illegal back then, at least this was back

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.920
 in the early 2000s.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.160
 He actually might be getting out soon, now that I think about it, but hopefully.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.280
 That's one thing, right?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.240
 You're filming yourself, throwing around money, whatever, it's artistic license, sure you're

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.400
 committing a crime, whatever.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.400
 I don't understand why someone would film such a disgusting act, but people do.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.440
 So maybe they found video footage of him, maybe, which is fine, right?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.400
 On the funnometer, on the laughometer, it's out of 10, it's probably like a one or a

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.960
 two, right?

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.960
 Whatever, but I'm thinking, wouldn't it have been funnier?

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.120
 But first, I'll look back up and say, this is a horrible crime, it's animal abuse, I'm

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.800
 trying not to make a light of it as I'm laughing, but if you had to arrest someone for beast

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.200
 reality, all of a sudden this hypothetical fell in your lap, would it rather be that

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.040
 you caught video footage of him doing it, or that some nosy neighbor, some nosy neighbor

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.560
 looked over the fence and caught him in the act?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.560
 That'd be way, that'd be way funny.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:44.200
 Jason, courts, judges don't care how funny it is, how funny it is that they got caught.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:53.200
 I just imagine some old woman baking muffins in her kitchen and she hears a sound in the

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.560
 backyard and there's a guy kissing a dog and she's like, what?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.640
 And then I imagine a little family circle type cartoon strip on this wall.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:09.240
 Poking her head up over, okay, so here's the thing, obviously I'm approaching this, I'm

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.960
 not being super sensitive to the topic, I'm sorry, I would not be laughing so much, I

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.080
 wouldn't be like, oh he kicked that dog to death, but did he get caught in a funny way?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.160
 It's different, still animal abuse, hopefully people aren't subscribing to the show right

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.720
 now, but I'm just saying, there's a funny way to get caught committing a crime in a boring

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.160
 way, so hopefully he got caught by a neighbor or a policeman who was just passing by and

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.960
 he heard a "mmm" on a dog.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.920
 Anyways, Josh got arrested committing beast reality and he made a deal, he made a deal,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:51.080
 he would serve no prison time for his crime and really more importantly, let's say off

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.760
 the sex offender registry, that's the big thing, right, you can do a year or two in

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.120
 prison standing on your head, as long as you keep to yourself, but if you're on the sex

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.680
 offender registry, you can't work, you can't, you know, get a place to live, all this stuff.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.240
 Now it's kind of gross because he actually did have sex with an animal, we don't know

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.800
 if it was a dog, I'm assuming it's a dog for what's coming up later, but it doesn't

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.640
 matter, it's not like they're like, "Oh, it's just a squirrel, we'll let you off with

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.640
 a warning."

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.680
 He had sex with an animal, most likely a dog, even if he's not on the sex offender

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.480
 registry, he's still a sex offender, but you can make deals so you don't appear on

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480
 that?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.800
 This guy, he can stay off the sex offender registry, even though he's a sex offender,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.880
 and a creepy one at that, like again, we haven't even gotten started, if he completes a version

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.120
 therapy, so he's like, "Yeah, that's awesome, like I can stay out of prison, I don't have

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.800
 to be on the registry, I just have to do this version therapy, I can do that."

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.320
 But then he goes, "What's a version therapy?"

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.560
 And they go, "Well, it's not what you think, it's not like we attach electrodes to you,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.560
 it's not torturous."

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.840
 And he's like, "Oh, okay, good."

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.880
 They said, "What we do is we're going to hook your penis up to this machine, this electrical

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.000
 machine, right, it is kind of electrical, they hook your penis up to this thing called

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.760
 a PPG test that I actually tell how aroused you're getting, and it's like a lie detector

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.360
 for your penis, and we're going to show you deviant images."

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.920
 He's like, "Sounds like a good Saturday afternoon to me, they show you deviant images while

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:35.080
 you're hooked up to this PPG, and if you show arousal, we take this vial of smells, we have

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.920
 like these little jars in the office, this is what I want guys, I want one of these."

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.880
 They have these jars in these offices, and they go, "Well, hold it under your nose, and

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.600
 you just take three deep breaths, and that is the aversion therapy, we'll just do that,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.000
 you know, once a week, takes about 30 minutes an hour to go through it."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.720
 And he's like, "Dude, I can totally do that, that's totally fine."

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:04.080
 Now what's creepy is he's writing this, and he says multiple times, "Listen, I committed

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.840
 the crime, and I understand that, and I'll never do it again, however, I don't want to

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.840
 change who I am inside."

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.680
 He says this a couple of times over two different posts, "I don't want to change who I am inside."

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.160
 See, he's an animal lover.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.520
 He really, really loves animals, so that's such an intrinsic part of his personality,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.080
 he does not want to let go of that.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.960
 Anybody who knows anything about therapy knows that that's the goal, right, is to get rid

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.960
 of that.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.680
 "Oh, I don't want to gamble all my money away, but I don't want to get rid of the risk-taker

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.680
 that I really am inside."

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.320
 Well, that's what's causing that problem in the first place, right?

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.840
 I don't want to change who I am, it's actually part of his personality that he's a Zoua file.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:51.520
 So he decides to start doing this aversion therapy, and what happens is he's posting

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.360
 a story online on week five.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.080
 He's been doing this for five weeks now, and he posts online, and he's like, "I have

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.240
 no idea what I signed up for, none."

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.400
 Because I'm failing the PPG test.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.240
 They are hooking me up to this thing, they're showing these animals, they're doing stuff,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240
 right?

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.280
 Not playing, there's not a bunch of dogs playing poker, even though that is deviant.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.360
 It's sex stuff with dogs, and he's getting aroused by it, and then the therapist brings

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.320
 this, brings these vials to him, and makes him sniff them.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.920
 He goes, "I can barely even get too deep breaths."

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.840
 And I begin retching uncontrollably.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:38.320
 He goes, "I'm so nauseous that even when it's over with as I'm leaving the office going

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.640
 home, I still feel like I'm on a puke."

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.520
 These scents are animal related, right?

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.520
 Makes sense.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.960
 One of them is rotten meat, just like the most pungent rotten meat smell right under

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.360
 your nostril, and you have to sniff.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.240
 Did I tell you guys not to eat before this segment?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.080
 I don't know if I included that part.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:07.640
 Rotten meat right underneath your nose, you have to sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:13.360
 get three deep nostril folds of this smell.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.760
 The other one is cat spray, right up under your nostrils, and then I've never smelled

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.560
 this, I've smelled the first two, right?

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.960
 But this one, I've heard horror stories about this.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:29.640
 I've never had a pet dog, but I have had friends that have, and they've told me about

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:38.480
 times they've had to interact with the dog's anal gland, and that's the smell.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.280
 It's just pure undiluted, the scent of a dog's anal gland right under your nose, and you're

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.560
 forced to smell it.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.280
 Not like you can pull away and be like, "No, no, no, no, no more.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.280
 Take the dog to the vet.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.920
 I was tired of doing this myself."

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.320
 No, this is part of your therapy, and it lasts about an hour or a week.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.640
 Now part of this therapy is he also has homework to do, which sounds hilarious.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.440
 They give him just a chunk of rotten meat in a little lunchbox, a little he-man metal

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.440
 lunchbox.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.480
 They're like, "Now you gotta go home and do this, do this connect the dots."

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.120
 And once you realize what it's a picture of, you gotta smell that rotten meat.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.000
 He has homework to do, but this is again where he says, "I don't want to change who

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 I am."

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.120
 So I really haven't been doing the homework.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:28.360
 But it's week five now, and my therapist is able to tell that I'm not in it to win it.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:35.560
 The therapist can actually tell I'm not committed to changing things.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.640
 And it's interesting the therapist said, "Listen, society has decided that what you did is

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.080
 so wrong that you have to do this.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.340
 We have to change you so you don't have these desires anymore.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.440
 If you do not, by the end of the year you will be in jail and a registered sex offender.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.320
 So it's your choice, but you have to start working on it and taking this seriously.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.680
 Or I'm going to bring out the stronger sense."

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.920
 And he's freaking out.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.680
 He goes, "Stronger sense?

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.440
 It gets worse than what I'm smelling now."

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:21.180
 And that's when the therapist goes, "What you're smelling now is diluted."

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.780
 The normal smells are ten times as strong.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.340
 So you have to make a decision right now.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.140
 Are you going to stick with this or not?

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.900
 You got to do your homework, you got to figure this out.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.860
 He posted that back in June.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.900
 He has to do this program for a year.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.900
 It's once a week.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.140
 It lasts about an hour.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.540
 And he has to get his act together.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.720
 Well just earlier this month, Josh posted again online.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:53.240
 He said, "Guys, I can't do this anymore.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.920
 It's been three months.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.200
 Really four months since this started.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.400
 And now I have to go twice a week and they're using the stronger smells."

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.120
 And because he's failing, right?

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.700
 He's still looking at these images and getting aroused.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.980
 He has this PPG machine up to which I kind of hope all sorts of sound effects.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.820
 It's all a boing.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.020
 And therapist is like, "Oh, it made the boing noise again."

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.820
 It's a little less than the ogre.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.620
 But still, no boings allowed looking at this picture.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.060
 He's getting the charts ready.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.060
 The guy's like, "No."

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.980
 This seems like clockwork orange level stuff.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.740
 I don't know what country this is happening in.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.180
 I'm assuming America.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.060
 But I didn't know they did stuff like this anymore.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.560
 And it seems kind of effective, right?

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.000
 Not for this guy, but he's been doing this for four months and hasn't changed him.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.120
 He wasn't doing the homework, right?

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.440
 He wasn't doing the paint by numbers and revealing these disgusting pictures that he's throwing

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.960
 up at home.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.840
 He wasn't committed to it and now they're using these more powerful smells.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.280
 He has to go twice a week.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.000
 And he goes, "These smells, I used to just be three deep breaths."

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.520
 He goes, "Now they hold it under my nose for 15 seconds."

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.900
 And I have to just be breathing it in the whole time.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.900
 And it's interesting.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.780
 I didn't think about this.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.180
 You have to switch up the smells, otherwise you would get used to it, right?

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:20.780
 That's why they would use the rotten meat, the dog anal gland and the cat pee.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.980
 Because you would just be like, "Oh, I have a sense of cat pee.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.980
 That reminds me of sparkles, my family cat."

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.020
 Like, if you smelled a smell enough, even if you got taken away from me and put it back,

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.580
 you would build up an immunity to it.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:35.020
 But you didn't know if you were going to get rotten meat or dog anal gland.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.600
 I mean, out of those two, I'd rather have rotten meat.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.360
 But you don't know it.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.360
 Like, psychs your brain out.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:46.280
 Well, now they're still doing the dog anal gland and the cat pee, but there's a nuisance

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.280
 involved.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.120
 And it's funny because he goes, when I ask, "What is that smell they never tell me?"

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.720
 He goes, "I can put two and two together.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.080
 I know the smell of rotten meat.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.000
 I know the smell of dog anal gland."

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.080
 He goes, "This new one, I don't really know what the smell is."

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.760
 The way he describes it is he's sticking under his nose.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:08.260
 And he says it smells like rancid dog breath.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.260
 Rancid dog breath.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.500
 And he goes, actually more than that, he goes, "Imagine that if a dog with dental problems,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:24.580
 like you had a dog with rotten teeth, just ate roadkill and feces, and then walked up

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:32.840
 to you and put its face right under your nose and breathed into your nostrils for 15 seconds

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.440
 straight."

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.560
 And he says in this, again in his post, he goes, "I don't want to change who I am."

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:46.040
 But in this post, when he's talking about the therapy, he says, "What I hate about

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:53.000
 it is that it works."

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.940
 So even though he's failing this PPG test, he's getting aroused by these images, he's

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.900
 smelling these scents, it is changing his attraction towards animals.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.500
 The smells are so strong.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.220
 They're held under his nose for so long.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.660
 It is changing who he is inside.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:15.220
 Now who he is inside is someone who's very likely to commit criminal acts against innocent

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.720
 animals, right?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.980
 Who he is inside is someone who wants to engage in bestiality.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:30.940
 He holds that as a core character identity and it's being erased.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.780
 And he's fighting that psychological battle and he's losing.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.780
 He's losing out to one of the five senses of the human body.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.620
 Isn't that fascinating to think about something that you, I mean he's a sicko, right?

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.820
 I'm not saying that.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.820
 I'm not just defending anything he's doing.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:53.500
 He didn't laugh about it a lot ten minutes ago, but he's a sicko.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.940
 And again, he could have chosen to just go to jail and be on the sex of indiregistry

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.420
 for ten years, the rest of his life, whatever the sentence was.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:05.580
 He chose this and it's changing who he is for the better, right?

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.180
 Now he doesn't want to have sex with animals, but crazy.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.540
 It seems so simple, right?

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:16.140
 A smell can actually, like could that work against somebody else, right?

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.860
 Let's say that it wasn't something egregious.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.660
 Let's say, I mean you figure it would, right?

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:25.620
 If you were an overeater, you loved, not anymore, to listen to this episode, you're like, "I'm

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.620
 done.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.620
 I'm done."

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.500
 But yeah, imagine if every time you wanted to eat a chicken pot pie, they're showing you

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.500
 these photographs of this delicious food, they stuck a disgusting smell under your nose.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.900
 I wonder if you could actually make someone starve themselves to death.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.020
 Like you could actually turn them off of all food.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.540
 But I mean that's like a biological necessity.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.660
 What if there was something?

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.860
 What if you loved art?

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.180
 You loved looking at paintings.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:55.460
 Could you override somebody's core programming, part of someone's soul, simply by assaulting

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.180
 one of their five senses?

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.220
 I mean you could obviously torture people.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.020
 1984 is all about that, right?

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.900
 How badly do you have to beat a man before he stops loving symphonies?

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.740
 The spoiler alert, that's basically 1984 in one sentence.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.380
 But even that's like physical torture, fear and stuff like that.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.860
 It's just this breathing and stuff.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.060
 And someone else replied on one of his posts, this guy named YicLoke.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.060
 And it's interesting, he said, "Listen, by the end of the year, you'll either be in

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.140
 jail or be a registered sex offender, or the mere sight of a dog is going to be enough

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.180
 to give you the dry heaves.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.580
 Pick one."

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.380
 And that would be true, right?

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.260
 Like just by looking at them, he would get sick.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:41.060
 He wouldn't be able to even have a normal human relationship with an animal.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.220
 He would just be disgusted by them.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.420
 Fascinating, right?

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.660
 Like the fact that you could change something about somebody, whether it's good or bad,

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.660
 right?

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.180
 This is a bad thing that he either needs to do time for or change.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.260
 But you could probably also obviously do it for good stuff.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.340
 A very compassionate person, if every time they saw two people hugging, you shoved dog

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.340
 puke up their nostrils.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.340
 I'm pretty sure they'd stop being compassionate.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.020
 Fascinating, and I want one of these vials.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.860
 I want one of these.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.460
 I've actually been looking for them online to buy.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.420
 I can find skunk spray.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.940
 I can find dog pee.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.100
 Boring.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.340
 I want a jar.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:28.380
 I want a jar that contains the smell of a rancid dog's breath.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:33.940
 I actually was looking up a version therapist in my area to ask.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.620
 I wanted to...I very rarely do interviews on this show.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.540
 I think I've done maybe three or four.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.980
 I'll talk to people behind the scenes and stuff like that to get more information.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.380
 I couldn't find one.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.380
 Then I started.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.140
 That's when I would go, "Maybe I can just buy one."

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.420
 There's some black market therapist out there.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.340
 He's walking around with a trench coat, a very, very smelly trench coat, holding it open.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.580
 What do you want?

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.380
 I want one of these vials, man.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.340
 I could do so much with one of these vials, right?

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.100
 I'm pretty much throwing people.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.500
 That's kind of all I can think of.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.060
 I can sit there and I can check it.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.020
 I would keep it as a relic next to my balloon boy.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.900
 I have a piece of the balloon boy balloon.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:20.220
 Not a piece of the balloon boy himself, but I want a vial of rancid dog breath.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.860
 Actually now that I've thought about it, someone could just send me a vial and go, "Here you

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.980
 go."

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.380
 And wonder whether or not I would open it up.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:33.220
 I would just trust them or would I go, "Yeah, that's rotten dog teeth."

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.340
 I want one of these vials.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.500
 I want the scent.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.500
 That's so fascinating.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.500
 The story's fascinating.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.020
 I didn't even know this therapy was still around.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.500
 Apparently it works.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.140
 Crazy, insane, true crime story.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.300
 But let's go ahead and get on to our next one.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.140
 Because trust me, I can keep talking about that one.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.140
 Let's go ahead.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.140
 This next one, though, is even weirder.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.420
 If you were able to stomach that last one, this one's not gross, but it has some really

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.500
 interesting implications for you, for you specifically.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.700
 Lord Shin 2021, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonar copter.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.500
 We are leaving behind this therapist's office with clothespins around our nose.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.500
 I'm not.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.500
 I'm breathing it in, baby.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.620
 Ah, that's the stuff.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.620
 Fly us out of here.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:22.860
 We're headed all the way out to Japan.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:28.580
 First off, I gotta give a shout out to one of our dead rabbit radio loyal listeners,

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.420
 Shizawa Raised by Wolves.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.820
 Shizawa Raised by Wolves recommended this story to me.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.820
 Absolutely fascinating.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.420
 They posted it on the Dead Rabbit Radio subreddit.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.420
 Never heard of it.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.420
 Great story.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.420
 Thank you so much.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.620
 This story is really summed up in one sentence.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:52.900
 The question is, did the Japanese government target nerds in Japan, male nerds, for blood

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.900
 donations?

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:59.500
 And then the other follow up question would be why them, right?

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.460
 Would there be a reason why you'd want nerds to do this?

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:07.100
 Or Otaku is the term, you know, Otaku is actually worse than a nerd.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.820
 Otaku is almost like an insult.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.300
 It's like a shut-in in Japan who does nothing but play video games, read manga and watch

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.300
 anime.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.140
 It sounds totally awesome, right?

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.140
 It sounds totally awesome.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.140
 I wish I could do that.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.140
 I used to.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.220
 But, um, yeah, Otaku is more of like an insult over there.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.940
 Nerds, we have nerd culture and all that stuff over here and everything.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.260
 I used to get beat up for being a nerd, right?

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:33.180
 Now I get to see people wear my culture on their shirts.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.780
 Sir, let me have a word with you.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.260
 Anyways, 2019 is when our saga takes place.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:45.020
 There was this manga written by a guy named Taki, and he wrote it.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.940
 You could obviously tell I was questioning the pronunciation as I said it.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.020
 He wrote this manga called Uzaki Chan Wants to Hang Out, and what it's about?

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.380
 It's about these two college kids.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.540
 One of them is kind of a loner, just kind of wants to go through the motions and get

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.420
 through school, whatever.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:06.940
 And then there's this girl named Hana Uzaki, and she's like always trying to get him to

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.580
 do stuff, and she's super annoying.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.100
 And kind of the set of is, will they won't?

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.100
 Do they?

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.660
 Like, will he eventually fall for her?

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.420
 Does she really have feelings for him?

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.620
 It's kind of like a soap opera type thing.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:26.100
 Hana Uzaki, her character, other than being annoying and vivacious and just a glimmer

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.300
 of light, a glimmer of hope in this poor dude's life.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.340
 She also has size J boobs.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:37.460
 She has these giant boobs, and she's just living her best life.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.460
 With giant boobs, and what I'm assuming crippling back pain as well.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.700
 She's running around, they're going on these adventures.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.940
 It's more like a slice of life manga, right?

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.540
 It's not like they're fighting Dr. Doom or anything like that.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.420
 Anyways, so back in 2019, they've done this before.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:58.180
 The Japanese Red Cross will team up with manga creators and anime creators to have them

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.140
 draw stuff.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.020
 Basically like a little poster, right?

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.980
 You donate blood, you get a poster.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:12.060
 And they've done this before, and this particular time they got ahold of Taki, and they said,

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.820
 "Hey, Uzaki-chan wants to hang out.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.820
 Do you want to do something for the Japanese Red Cross?"

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.100
 And he jumped at it.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.420
 He said, "Absolutely," and this is so interesting.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:28.300
 Back in 1995, the author was seriously injured during the great Hanshin earthquake of 1995.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.500
 Which we all know was caused by magical princess Minky Momo.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.260
 Put that episode in the show notes.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:39.140
 He was really badly injured in this earthquake, and he survived because of blood donations.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.820
 He survived because the Japanese Red Cross had enough blood of the type that he needed.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:49.580
 And so he has always loved supporting the Japanese Red Cross and supporting blood donation

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.980
 drives and stuff like that.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.700
 So when they approached him, he goes, "Yeah, totally."

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.420
 He might have even approached them at this point, but they were totally ready to do this.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.540
 So the file for this one, and these posters were kind of posted around town apparently

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:06.300
 too, was a picture of Hana Uzaki.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.460
 She's wearing this really tight black shirt.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.780
 Her clothes are normally pretty tight.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.300
 She's wearing this normal, like, this button-up black shirt, but it's pretty tight.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:20.140
 She's holding, this is probably a cultural thing, she's holding a tray of fruits and veggies.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.540
 And then she's yelling.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:26.260
 It looks like she's screaming at you, but she's saying, "Sanpai, have you not donated

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.260
 blood yet?

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:31.060
 Are you perhaps scared of needles?"

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.060
 That's the whole thing, right?

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.460
 It was just this image, and on the back was her and the dude pretending to be spies or

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.900
 something like that.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.260
 You had this.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.860
 And the conspiracy theory is about this.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.860
 That's all true.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.940
 All that stuff really happened is that they specifically chose this character, this bust,

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.020
 even though she's not like, super sexualized.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.780
 The comic book is apparently PGPG13.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.500
 She's not like, it's not a nude one, right?

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.660
 But the reason why they chose Hana Uzaki is they were specifically targeting males to

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:07.660
 donate blood in Japan because you, the conspiracy theory goes that less women were donating

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.220
 blood.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.520
 And the Japanese Red Cross goes, "If we can't get more women to donate blood, let's get

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.780
 more men to donate blood."

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:18.060
 So we're going to use this woman, this busty woman, and we're going to get more guys in

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.060
 here.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.860
 Now, that's where a conspiracy theory comes from because obviously we don't know what

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.020
 they were thinking.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.020
 We don't know if that was their master plan.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:30.420
 We can look at the statistics, and she's now raised by wolves.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.740
 Send me some of these statistics.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.300
 Thank you very much for this.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:44.060
 We look at, in 2020, you had 1.5 million women donating blood, and 3.6 million men donated

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.060
 blood that year.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:49.260
 So by the net, this started in 2019, we see in 2020 that there is a huge difference.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.180
 In most countries, it's 50/50.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.180
 50% men, 50% women.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.380
 There's a few countries where a lot more men than women, like Greece and parts of Italy

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.380
 as well.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.460
 It's like 60/30 difference, but generally it's 50/50.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:07.260
 So you are seeing a huge increase of men donating blood.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.620
 I couldn't find the statistics for 2019.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.620
 Neither could they.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.940
 We couldn't get them.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.020
 But we do have a rise there.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.860
 So did they plan for this?

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.580
 Did they say, listen, not enough women?

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.700
 And we can't see statistics from 2014 to 2020.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.340
 There was a dip in blood donations.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:32.300
 We can actually look at dropping pretty regularly until 2019, and then it started to rise again.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.820
 So we did see that.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.100
 Now people may have been donating more blood for all sorts of reasons, but we definitely

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.860
 have these coincidences, you could say.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.240
 So did they plan that?

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.420
 Did the Japanese, Red Cross go, we need to make up for the females not donating, so let's

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.220
 get more males to donate blood?

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.900
 And then there was even a more interesting spin on that conspiracy theory.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.820
 It wasn't that they just wanted more men to donate blood.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.380
 They wanted nerds to donate blood.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:05.060
 They wanted the otaku to donate blood because, and this is pretty common, right?

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.980
 I think it's the same thing in America.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:14.980
 To be a blood donor, you have to have not had sex with a new partner within the past

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.460
 six months.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.380
 So if you're married, you're with the same person forever, it doesn't matter.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.620
 If you haven't had sex in six months, it doesn't matter.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.780
 But if you're out Tomcatting around Tokyo, banging women at bars and stuff like that,

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.940
 you can't donate blood.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.820
 So they specifically targeted guys who weren't getting laid very often, right?

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.500
 That's the conspiracy theory because if they just marketed to men in general, you'd get

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.780
 guys walking in and being like, "Yo, I just had sex with one of your nurses in the back

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.300
 room, don't know her name, but it's time to give blood."

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.540
 They're like, "Sir, you can't do that also.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.580
 You should probably get yourself checked out.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.140
 She's full of disease.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.260
 We won't let her donate either."

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.660
 They wanted specifically men who weren't sexually active.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.500
 So they took a character from like a romance manga.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.100
 Again, it was not like a horny, X-rated one, right?

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.500
 It's almost like a soap opera for guys manga.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.460
 You're getting these guys coming in and they're walking away with this little picture of Hana

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.460
 Uzaki.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.980
 It's an interesting conspiracy theory.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.220
 And again, the events are real.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.860
 The conspiracy theory comes down to when they were coming up with this decision in the office,

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.500
 because that what was going on, they go, "We need to boost the levels of nerd blood in

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.660
 our system."

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.540
 How do we do that?

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.300
 This is what this is the plan they came up with.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:41.460
 They get a busty girl from a popular Japanese manga soap opera, Slice a Life type comic book.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.140
 And there you go.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:50.100
 And actually after this first campaign of 2019, it was so popular, they ended up doing

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.460
 an anime of this.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.700
 Two people walking around in college.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.500
 I guess it's a cartoon where people were like, "Did you study for your test?"

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.500
 And he's like, "No."

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.500
 And she's like, "You should."

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.500
 I put the cliffhanger to that.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.260
 I mean, I guess people watch soap operas in real life.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.900
 I watch lifetime movies all the time.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.500
 I mean, I guess I can't criticize it.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.980
 But I mean, if you have the ability to animate anything, I mean, literally you can draw anything

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.980
 you could possibly think of.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.260
 People walking around a college setting.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.780
 I know it's popular.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.980
 I know Slice a Life anime is super popular.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.660
 I'm just like, can't they at least punch each other or slice people up with swords and stuff

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.660
 like that?

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.660
 I guess not.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.540
 Because that's illegal and unrealistic.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.820
 And this is supposed to be a realistic cartoon comic.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.820
 People love it.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.900
 But anyways, fascinating conspiracy theory and one that we won't know.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.900
 And it's so mundane, right?

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.420
 It doesn't affect anyone's life.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.220
 There's some guy who only had one gallon left of blood in him and he's just super horny.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.180
 He's like, "Oh, I really want that picture of that girl.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.500
 I'll take some more of my blood."

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.380
 It doesn't really affect anyone.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.860
 And these are the conspiracy theories that I think are super likely, right?

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:57.740
 But I want to segue into something else because what you have, like let's step back from it.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:03.940
 It's kind of a fun story about, I mean, it may not be a conspiracy theory at all, right?

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.100
 Or it could be them going, "We need more nerd blood.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.420
 Let's do this tactic."

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:16.060
 But it could be more sinister because at the end of the day, what's going on and why they're

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.380
 doing it, they're saving lives.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.380
 It involves people's health.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.380
 So they're blood.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.220
 You kind of manipulate in people to give your blood to get this little picture of this girl.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.380
 But you have a bunch of blood.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.140
 Blood replenishes itself pretty quickly.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:35.460
 So I spent about five weeks in California with my mom recently during the summer.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.340
 And I bought her this thing for a year called Friendly.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.980
 Friendly TV.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:46.340
 It's basically, this isn't an ad, but I love the service because, you know, nowadays you

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.700
 either pay $100 for your cable package or you have all these streaming channels that don't

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.580
 show what you want anymore.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.580
 Friendly has this thing.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.540
 I think it was like $70 for a year.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.980
 And it gave you like 32 channels of television.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.460
 And some of them were like, "You'll get local news and stuff like that because my mom watches

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.460
 local news."

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.740
 But then it has like a Hallmark channel and it has Vice.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.020
 I was watching Vice and stuff down there.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.860
 But I was watching a ton of Lifetime channel movies.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.300
 I watched Lifetime, I call it Pretty Girl Television.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.820
 Lifetime channel, I go watch it seriously all day long.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.780
 It's one of my vices.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.780
 Jessica Morris.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.740
 Oh my goodness, she's a goddess.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.020
 But anyways, you sit there and you're watching this television.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.020
 Now it's streaming, but it plays like regular television.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.620
 It has advertising.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.940
 And I'm sitting there and we're watching it, watching, you know, stalked by my cheerleaders

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.540
 coach or whatever.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:43.740
 And then it cuts to the commercial break.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.060
 I'm like, "Oh no, are they going to get away from the cheerleader coach?"

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.540
 You would watch the commercial and it would be like normal commercials.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.100
 So we'd see commercials for like local restaurants, right?

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.380
 You know, like chilies or whatever.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.980
 Stuff they want to show commercials for up here.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.980
 For example, where I live.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.060
 And there's no chilies, unfortunately.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.620
 We're seeing these local commercials.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.980
 We're seeing these national commercials for like, well, chilies is national, but you

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.980
 know what I mean?

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.980
 Like regional restaurants.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.460
 Then they have like Charmin commercials and stuff like that.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.460
 It wasn't like YouTube commercials.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:16.940
 It wasn't like commercials that are a total waste of my time for like politicians I don't

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.500
 even know the name for.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.500
 Whatever.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.620
 Well, I guess that's what I'm advertising because I don't know their names.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.580
 You know, YouTube advertising is so shotgun, right?

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.900
 It never seems to really apply to you yet.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.220
 That's kind of what I'm getting to here.

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.900
 Watching this friendly television.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:40.500
 And then what I saw down there was so interesting because I don't know where friendly is getting

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.500
 these ads.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:46.860
 I don't know if we're actually watching the ad package for the Lifetime Moving Network.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:52.320
 Like had I gone to my brother's house, he does pay $100 a month for cable and all those

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.500
 streaming services and everything.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.020
 I don't know if I was watching Lifetime Moving Network at his house at the same time.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:02.620
 We would see the same commercials, right?

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.900
 We may.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:09.540
 We may be watching basically the cable equivalent of Lifetime or we may be watching an internet

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.860
 streaming version of it.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.380
 So the ads are changing.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.980
 I don't have the answer to that.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:21.780
 But what I do know is as we're sitting there watching I saw more commercials for Crohn's

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.140
 disease.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:30.660
 Like medications for Crohn's disease than I've ever seen.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.900
 Now my mother suffers from Crohn's disease.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.500
 And it took like maybe 10 or, you know, commercials you don't even really pick out at first unless

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.860
 they're really funny or super weird.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.020
 It wasn't until like three or four days watching Lifetime Moving Network that I realized why

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.900
 are they showing all these commercials for Crohn's medication?

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.820
 What are all these popping up for?

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:57.060
 And I started to think about it and I go, if this is internet based, obviously we're

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.300
 on my mom's Wi-Fi.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.580
 I've been researching Crohn's medicine for her trying to find stuff.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.380
 She's doing really, she's doing good, right?

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:08.580
 But it's like $1200 a month for her medicine.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.620
 I'm like looking for alternatives and stuff like that.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.380
 I'm like, here just eat these A-seeds and drink thistle milk and that won't work, but

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.380
 it sure is yummy.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.020
 You know, I'm trying to look for alternatives.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.020
 She's totally fine.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.900
 She doesn't have any complications from it or anything.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.740
 But I started to think what if this is internet?

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.860
 Like what if it's because we're talking about it and all the microphones in the house are

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:28.860
 picking it up, right?

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.540
 Everything's smart even if you don't know it.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.940
 And that's why we're getting those commercials.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.460
 Is it possible because I'm doing these Google searches that it's showing those commercials?

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:44.980
 YouTube will do stuff like that from time to time because of the videos I watch on YouTube.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.780
 Every so often YouTube will start showing me ads.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.780
 This is not a joke.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.140
 I might have even talked about it before.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.140
 They'll start showing me ads for schizophrenia magic medication.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.860
 That is one ever cent true.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.860
 And I'm sure you guys have gotten them too.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.620
 It's those real creepy videos.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.620
 Those really creepy ads.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:03.380
 They're like, I was in Washington DC when the hallucinations began again and it's all

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.260
 in these black and white charcoal drawings.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.900
 I'll see if I can find one to put it in the show notes.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:12.660
 They're actually like really kind of cool, creepy ads.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.060
 But if I'm watching enough stuff, you type in Alex Jones, you're going to start getting

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.300
 those schizophrenia ads.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.220
 I think it could be something like that, right?

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.300
 It could be something that we're simply talking about on the internet is go, oh, they're looking

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.300
 into this?

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:30.180
 Well, let's give them this medication that's just been invented and barely tested on anyone.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.540
 But then I thought, interesting, right?

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.540
 I thought that was interesting.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:39.540
 I thought this Hana Uzuki story was interesting.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.460
 And then I wanted to peanut butter and jelly it together and we're going to wrap it up

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:52.780
 with this conspiracy theory because what I predict is going to happen.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.140
 My mom has Crohn's.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.820
 She's had it for decades, right?

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.140
 And they're talking about this medication.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:05.660
 I predict that eventually we will begin to see ads for diseases.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.420
 We don't even know we have picture this picture.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:14.780
 This is weird and it's 100% believable.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:21.140
 Based on your internet history, I think you could predict future health problems based

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.900
 and remember, it's not only that.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.580
 It's not just what you're typing into Google.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.140
 It's everything you're saying around any electronic device.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.580
 I hang out at Sabine's house once a week, maybe.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.580
 It's far less than that lately.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.740
 Most of the time we're hanging out in my place.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:44.380
 When I'm at my place and I start Googling stuff, she starts getting ads for it.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.380
 She'll get ads.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:49.820
 She'll wake up one morning and she'll check the news and it'll be ads for none checks.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:54.580
 It'll be ads for it's constantly weapons and then they'll stop for a while.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.020
 And then she'll start seeing it.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.580
 She goes, "Jason, are you planning on buying a gun?"

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.380
 Because they started getting all of these ads for holsters and stuff like that.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.980
 I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I've been thinking about it."

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.220
 It's kind of coming to that point where it's almost irresponsible for me not to have a

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.220
 gun.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.300
 I don't think anyone else would agree with that statement.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:18.420
 But anyways, so you're sitting around, you're talking about, you're talking to a friend

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:22.100
 about how your stomach hurts, right?

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.620
 Maybe you're playing a game and you're on your headset and you're talking about your

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.740
 stomach's not feeling good and you've noticed you started to have a little bit of pain in

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.820
 your joints.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.260
 And the AI is picking all of that stuff up.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:40.900
 And I predict eventually by the time you realize that you have, let's just say, type 2 diabetes,

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:45.940
 you've been seeing ads for it a month or two before you even realize it.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.860
 It will start to detect your symptoms by what you talk about.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.700
 Because one of the first things I do when I get sick is I Google it.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.540
 Is this normal?

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.540
 I didn't tell you guys.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.540
 I got Lyme disease.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.540
 I didn't tell you guys that.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:03.420
 I got Lyme disease over the summer and I Googled, like, "I have a circle on my arm.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.780
 I have a rash that's a perfect circle.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.660
 I watched it appear over the course of one day with a little dot in the middle of it.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:13.780
 And I started getting pain in my knee and pain in my left foot.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.820
 And I went to the doctor and I had to go on a bunch of antibiotics.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.740
 It cleared up.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.180
 But yeah, that's the first thing I do, right?

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.980
 And so people are going to be typing this stuff, "Why does my stomach hurt?

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.700
 Why does my heart beat fast when I wake up?"

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:33.700
 All of these ailments we type in, we type in, we look at WebMD, we go, "Oh, it's nothing."

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.260
 Or it could be one of these 10 things, but that's super obscure.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.260
 I don't think it's anything like that.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.260
 We go about our lives.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.180
 The AI remembers that, right?

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.580
 And when I'm saying AI, I'm not talking specifically about Skynet.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.180
 I guess just the algorithm.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.180
 That's a better term right now.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.380
 The algorithm remembers that.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.380
 And it stores all that.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.500
 And you're putting in all of your symptoms over the course of six months to a year.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.860
 The algorithm will figure out, "Oh, this guy is going to have gastrointestinal bleeding

00:40:58.860 --> 00:40:59.860
 in the next year."

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.700
 So, let's start advertising.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.500
 And you're going to see ads for things.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.700
 You're like, "Well, that's kind of weird."

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.420
 Like, I don't have that.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.580
 Like, "Now you're super paranoid about all those ads you see for toenail fungus because

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.900
 we all get them, right?"

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.820
 I have the best feet in the world.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.820
 They are hobbit feet.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:18.500
 And I have those toes that can pick up pencils and stuff like that.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.060
 I have quarters that can pick up stuff with my feet.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.580
 But we all get the gross ads because it makes us look at them.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.700
 But what if those ads stop being like these gross shocking ads that we click on because

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.100
 we want to see some gross photos?

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.580
 And you look in here, "I don't have that.

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.460
 I don't have an underactive thyroid."

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.740
 But you do.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.820
 You just haven't been diagnosed for it yet.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.260
 Based on all of your symptoms.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.260
 I mean, think about it.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.460
 It could even tell the fact that you're like waking up late at night and going online.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.780
 It could, the algorithm could register doesn't sleep all the way through the night.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.220
 Restless sleep, fitful sleep.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.340
 It's putting all this stuff in and it's diagnosed.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:58.700
 I'm telling you, if this doesn't exist now, it will.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:04.100
 You will be marketed cures for diseases you don't even know you have.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.700
 And that is interesting and potentially life-saving, right?

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:09.940
 You're being marketed drugs.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.380
 So the second that you start to have that and the doctor says, "Hey, I think that you

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.660
 have this problem."

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.660
 You could be like, "That's so weird.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.220
 I haven't seen ads for that."

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.900
 And you kind of have maybe a little bit more information to go off of.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.300
 Maybe.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:28.060
 In a good way, the algorithm's storing this information and pre-diagnosing you because

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:32.580
 so many of our illnesses, you can tell you're going to get them.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.260
 Not all of them, obviously, right?

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.700
 There are a lot of illnesses.

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.540
 You can fit a genetic factor for depression.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.540
 You can fit a genetic factor for Crohn's.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.580
 You can have these things and they go, "You have a high chance of getting Crohn's or

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.900
 having Crohn's already.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:48.900
 You just don't know it.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:49.900
 IBS."

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.900
 All this stuff.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:55.300
 But then also, we have to look at the dark side of the algorithm because this could work

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.800
 both ways, right?

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:02.460
 It could pre-diagnose you and then it could misdiagnose you on purpose.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.900
 The algorithm could look at you and say, "Just like we could go back to this conspiracy theory,

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.740
 the nerds, we need blood.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.100
 We can't have had sex with a new person in six months.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.580
 We're going to target them specifically.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:19.500
 What if the algorithm and some shady people, medical companies behind the scenes, right,

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.980
 they go, "We need to boost the profits of drug X.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:30.420
 We need to get more people to take this drug to meet our quarterly goals."

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:36.100
 They can use the algorithm to look for people who fit that type.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:41.780
 Not that they necessarily have the disease, but that they could.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:47.980
 They find single men who are 46 years old, who are overweight, who spend a lot of time

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.940
 in a haunted closet.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:54.100
 They pump all this stuff in and they start marketing me for drugs because they know what

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.100
 my symptoms are, right?

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.100
 They can go, "That's interesting."

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.260
 He said recently that his stomach hurt.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.260
 We picked it up on the mic.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.540
 The algorithm says this guy's 45 years old, 46 in what, two weeks?

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.620
 My birthday's coming up.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.620
 There's this about him, this about him.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:08.620
 He wakes up in the middle of the night.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:12.020
 He only gets like five hours to sleep a day, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.020
 blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.980
 We have all of this stuff about him and we know that this drug, because they're specifically

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.940
 looking for people that this drug will work for.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.380
 They go, "Let's start marketing him this drug."

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.380
 It won't hurt him.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.380
 Maybe.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.380
 I don't know.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.380
 It won't help him.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.460
 He doesn't have the disease, but if we start trying to convince him, "Hey, if you have

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.900
 a stomach ache, you can't sleep all night and sometimes you find yourself in a haunted

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.980
 closet.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:37.220
 Take this pill."

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.340
 You can start seeing this ad and you're like, "Well, that is weird.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.860
 I do always wake up in the middle of the night and I do often have a sour stomach and I do

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.980
 often have all these other things."

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.460
 You start looking in with medication.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.460
 You don't need.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.380
 The algorithm is selling you a product.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:55.540
 They're misdiagnosing you on purpose.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.900
 I predict both of those things will happen and it will be something no one will be aware

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:00.900
 of.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.820
 It will be a conspiracy theory in a board room somewhere.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:08.060
 They'll just be ... because they just harvest this information, whether it's for a political

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:12.180
 campaign or a marketing campaign, that people just sell it.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:16.380
 We willingly give it out every time we talk in front of a smart device, be it a phone,

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:20.060
 a watch, a computer, a fridge.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.140
 They take all that.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:27.260
 They can pre-diagnose you and possibly save a lot of lives by making money still, right?

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.540
 They're not doing it out of the kind of center of their heart.

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:33.020
 They're making money or they can misdiagnose you on purpose to make money and maybe risk

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.020
 lives.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.740
 But one or I predict both of those things will happen.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.220
 If they're not happening now, they'll start happening within the next couple years and

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:45.100
 we won't know about it until years after that when it's exposed.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:55.220
 By the time it's exposed, there will already be a new trick they're working on.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.780
 DeadRabber Radio at gmail.com is going to be our email address.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.620
 You can also use it at facebook.com/deadrabberradio.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.140
 Tic-toc is @deadrabberradio.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.460
 DeadRabber Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:07.940
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.540
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.660
 Have a great day.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:31.940
 This is the story of a daughter of handstands, lemonade stands, and first corsages.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.260
 And that perfect driver's license picture.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.980
 Travelers, this is Carlos.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.480
 Someone just hit my car.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.480
 Is everyone okay?

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.480
 Are you safe?

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.220
 It's also the story of an insurance company that believes people always come first.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.700
 If it matters to you, Travelers Insurance will help protect it.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.060
 Travelers, it's better under the umbrella.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.820
 Speak to an independent agent today.
