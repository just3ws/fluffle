1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 The drama of taxes has already begun.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 No, because Bus Mobile gives you free money,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 a Samsung Galaxy A23 5G when you change,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 and with the power of the 5G networks, the country is bigger.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 The more drama, the more it will be.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Change your bus and take a Samsung Galaxy A23 5G for free.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Offert for limited time, only new clients are available on certain networks.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 The 5G service is not available everywhere, it is a device for free,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 and taxes apply additional restrictions. Visit a store for details.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 How do you stop a man made of stone?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And then we take a look at possibly one of the most powerful stories we've ever covered.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Is it possible to hack the universe today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 [Music]

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I hope you guys have a great weekend coming up.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I hope this is the prelude to an awesome, awesome weekend.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 So we're gonna get started.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Newcom.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Newcom, thank you so much for supporting this show.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Newcom actually just graduated from high school.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Class of Newcom High!

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I don't know that, he's probably too young to remember that reference.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But Newcom, thank you so much for supporting the show.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You are going to be our captain, our dude, this episode.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine as well.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Really, really helps the show grow.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 It's totally awesome.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And also we have a merch store, and that is in the links.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 We also have a Minecraft server.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 So if you guys want to play some Minecraft with me and other fans of the show,

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Minecraft server in the notes as well.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 So Newcom, I want you to snap, get ready to snap your fingers,

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 because you're gonna have a magical power.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 We're actually going to just go back to the end of the last episode.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 So you ready?

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 You ready to snap your fingers?

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Now, previously on Dead Rabbit, everyone of the Cherokee Nation get together.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Hey everyone, hey listen, this dude he's talking.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Yes, yes, there's this woman called Spearfinger.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Ah, stack, ah, I've been stabbed, I've been stabbed in my liver.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Dramatic quick cuts of a bunch of people, people laying around, no livers on,

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 there's a whole bunch of them.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 How do we defeat Spearfinger?

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And then the medicine man is like throwing dust and stuff,

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 and he goes, "I explained it on the last episode, but here's a quick overview.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Spearfinger can be killed if you chop her hand off, because her heart is in her hand."

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And everyone's like, "Oh, that's pretty cool."

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Except for Spearfinger, she didn't like that, she's all, "Shh, I thought that was a secret."

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But Spearfinger had a mortal enemy, then like,

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 "Cuts, quick cuts of this man in a cave."

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 [Groans]

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 His name was Stone Man, and he also ate people's livers and stuff,

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 so it's more quick cuts, more bodies.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 [Groans]

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Everyone's starting to get motion sickness from this flashback.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 This auditory flashback.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 [Groans]

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And so anyway, make a long story short, the last episode, now the medicine man is just totally like,

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 "Whatever, I'm giving up the gimmick."

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 The last episode was about this woman, this cryptid, this monster,

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 that preyed on people of the Cherokee Nation in Northern Carolina and Tennessee way way back in the day,

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 and she was stabbing people and eating their livers.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Now she had the weakness, now I'm doing a recap of the recap.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 She had a weakness of the heart in her hand, they chopped her hand off,

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 but she also had a mortal enemy named Stone Man.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And when Stone Man saw that spearfinger had been killed,

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 they both traveled in the same territories, they both eat human livers,

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 and they both have the power of stone,

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 the Stone Man sees this happen.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 It probably better off if you just listened to yesterday's episode at this point.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Stone Man sees that spearfinger was killed,

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 and he whistles to himself, "Woo, woo, he can't call himself."

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And he goes, "Oh, well finally my only source of competition for food has been killed,

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 and no one will ever guess my weakness."

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And so he walked off into the night, seeing in a song about eating human livers.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And now the next episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So, it's funny because Stone Man's story isn't super long,

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 and it's actually when I was reading about spearfinger,

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 every version of the spearfinger legend ended with,

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 "And no one knew how to defeat Stone Man, so he simply walked away into the night."

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And I was like, "Oh, that's kind of a weird ending."

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And then I found another one, and they're like,

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 "And little did they know that Stone Man was watching them from afar,

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 going, 'No one will ever guess my weakness.'"

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And he walked in, and I'm like, "What is this dude's..."

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I didn't know that the medicine men of the Cherokee Nation,

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 like, were building a shared universe.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Like, they were having these separate...

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Oh, if you want to know the rest of the legend,

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 you got to come back next summer,

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 and then eventually all of their legends formed together to make one...

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 I guess that's actually what mythology is, really.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It's a shared universe.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Some guy makes up Zeus, and a couple years later,

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 someone made up Artemis, and then he goes,

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 "Whoa, what if they're related?"

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Eventually everyone sat down, and Socrates and Herodotus were sitting there,

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 and talking about, like, this shit.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 They're basically the Kevin Feige and Zack Snyder of the ancient world.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 So, here's the thing.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So, I'm going to make a long story short,

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 to be honest, I recorded a 20-minute version of this,

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 and went on and on and on.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 So, we have this...

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 We have Spearfinger, we talked about her.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 We have Stone Man, who says nobody knows his weakness.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And he continued his reign of terror.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 He would just go into villages, he'd eat people's livers.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Now, as far as I could tell, he wasn't a shapeshifter.

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 He had to be more slick, but he was an old man.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 He looked like an old man.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 He looked totally normal until you tried bashing his brains in with the club.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 The club would break, he'd turn around,

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 [exhales]

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 and then your liver would be gone.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 So, he had the same power set, basically, except for shapeshifting.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 He ate at your liver, he was indestructible.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Once his main nemesis was gone, he could eat all the livers he wanted,

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 as long as he could catch them on his old man legs.

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 He also had this stick that was capable of doing two things.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 One, far more badass than the other.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 First off, you could take the stick, and he could throw it,

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 [imitates throwing]

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 and it would turn into any form of rock.

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 You're like, "Jason, that's actually..."

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He throws it, and he's like, "Oh, no!"

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 I threw it in a geology museum place, whatever they're called.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Probably just geology museum.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 "Where's my wand?"

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And it's like mixing with a bunch of rocks.

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 No, he could throw it and make rock structures.

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 So, "Oh, no, there's this chasm I have to cross."

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 [imitates rock]

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Giant, like bridge, right?

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Or...

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I don't know.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I can think of another reason why you'd want a big rock in front of you.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 "Oh, no!"

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 "Um, it's really hot, and I want some shade."

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 [imitates rock]

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 But, he could do that.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And he could, like, I could think, wave it and, like, rocks would fly around and stuff like that.

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I don't know, I could be just retconning.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I could just be making that part up.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 There's not a lot of information on Stone Man.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 But his other ability that the stick would allow him to do is he could smell people with it.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 So, there's a story I was able to find.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 This hunter was out in the woods hunting.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 He sees this old man walking around with his stick,

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 and he's, like, smelling the stick.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 He was pointing in different directions and then smelling it,

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 pointing in another direction, smell it, pointing in another direction, smell it,

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 and then eventually he points it in a direction.

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I know that this has been since killing you, right?

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Will he ever smell a human?

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 He points it in a certain direction, smells it,

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 "Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the stuff.

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 That's a good old homo sapien."

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And he then starts walking in the direction and throws the stick and makes a big bridge.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And a hunter's watching all this stuff.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Now, the hunter knows the direction he's headed in is where his tribe is in.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So, the hunter beats feet back to his tribe and he's, like,

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 "Dude, you guys, three guesses to what I just saw."

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So, the hunter's telling the story.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 The medicine man in the village hops out of his house and he goes,

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 "I'm going to stop you right there, dude."

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Like, I heard what you were saying.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I wasn't supposed to be eavesdropping his rude,

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 but I need you to find seven women who are menstruating right now.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And they're like, "Wait, what? We're talking about smell--"

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 The medicine man goes, "I need seven menstruating women right now."

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 This isn't for my sicko hobby that I have.

178
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And everyone's like doing the side eye.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 They're like, "He does have that weird thing for menstruating women."

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I know I normally do.

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I need seven menstruating women and maybe an extra two for me, you know?

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 And people are getting grossed out.

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 He's like, "Okay, just the seven. Just the seven.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Don't take them to my hut. Put them on the road leading into town."

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So, everyone's a little skieved out by what's going on.

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Medicine man's like, "Maybe I will get an extra two."

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Long story short, I'm not joking.

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 The segment is now taking me 30 minutes to record.

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I have to keep editing stuff out.

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Seven menstruating women are now standing on the road.

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I could have just jumped to that part, right?

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I could have just said, "Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Wrap Radio."

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Seven menstruating women standing on a road.

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And a stone man cannot walk past a menstruating woman.

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I don't know how they figured this out.

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I don't know what the medicine man was doing to be like,

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 "You know what? We've tried stabbing it, shooting arrows at it,

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 and clubbing it on the brain, but a menstruating woman."

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So, stone man's walking into the village and he's seeing...

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Oh, and the women were completely naked and he walks past...

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Imagine this. You're walking into town.

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Whether or not you want to eat people's liver,

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 you're just going to go buy a Domino's Pizza.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 You're walking into town.

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 You see a naked menstruating woman standing by the side of the street.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Now, he walks by and he goes, "Oh, no, dear, you're sick."

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And he walks by her.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And then he sees the next naked menstruating woman

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 and he's like, "Oh, no. Oh, that's so..."

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And he begins throwing up blood.

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Now, I hope that they've...

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Now, the thing about it, I hope they told menstruating women,

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 "Hey, by the way, some monster's going to walk by,

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 so if he starts acting weird, just be normal."

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Because if someone just said, "Hey, stand out there naked on your period."

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And didn't explain to you why.

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And you see an old man walking down the street and he goes,

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 "Oh, my dear, you're so sick."

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 You might have to do a little bit of therapy sessions after that.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Anyway, so by the time he gets to the seventh woman,

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 he's done.

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 He just falls over and...

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 and blood is pouring out of his mouth.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And at that point, the warriors come out of the village

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 and the medicine man shows up and they stake him with seven stakes into the ground.

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Stick, stick.

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Ah! Stick, stick, stick.

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And then they built this giant funeral pyre on him,

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 like just threw a bunch of wood and stuff on him.

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And then...

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 lit him on fire.

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 He's like, "Uhhh."

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And then he lived for like 12 hours after that.

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 He slowly burned.

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And what was interesting, I mean, it's all interesting.

236
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 A man was killed by walking past seven menstruating women.

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 As he's burning, he goes,

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 "Medicine, medicine man, come here."

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 "Uhhh. Uhhh."

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And medicine man gets close and the stone man goes,

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 "A bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad."

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Instead of that, he was actually saying real words.

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And he taught the medicine man all the secrets to like the universe and stuff.

244
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Isn't that eloquent?

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 He's telling the old man the stuff.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And then eventually after 12 hours, he just turns to dust.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 He burns up.

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And then there was two things laying in there.

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 There was a magical rock, like a red magical rock and a pile of red, like, goo.

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Which tends to come out of ten bodies.

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Not the magical rock thing.

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And it was funny because the medicine man picks up the rock and they're like,

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 "Oh, is that a new, like, gem for our village?"

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And he goes, "No, this is for me."

255
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And he puts it in his pocket.

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He does not give anyone else the access to the magical rock,

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 but there's a pile of goo there, red goo.

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And the medicine man goes, "I'm gonna keep the rock."

259
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Like, for payment for coming up with this plan.

260
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And then if you can get seven ladies to stop on my place later and the warriors are like,

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 shaking their head, he's like, "Fine, fine.

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I'll just keep the rock."

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And he takes the red goo and he draws on the villagers' faces and he goes,

264
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 "Tell me what you wish for."

265
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And they'd be like, "I wish to be a great hunter."

266
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And he'd go, "Done."

267
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And then the guy would become a great hunter.

268
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And a couple of people wished for like, long life or something like that.

269
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And then, so yeah, and then everyone lived happily ever after, I guess.

270
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 The liver-eating monster was destroyed and everyone got their wish granted.

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Everyone got their wish granted.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Now, I don't think you could have said it.

273
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I would have wished I would have been like, "Old man."

274
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Sorry, that's disrespectful.

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Medicine man, put this ink on my face.

276
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 "I wish for your magical gem."

277
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And then it appears in my hand.

278
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 I don't actually think about it.

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I don't think it became the genie.

280
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 I just think it was a way of blessing them.

281
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And maybe the liver dude, the stone man, I guess was his technical name.

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Maybe that was his way of giving back to all the people.

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 It turns out that he wasn't eating our livers.

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 We were eating his.

285
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Maybe it's like a lesson like that or something like that.

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 He was giving back to the community.

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 His sacrifice will not be in vain.

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.

289
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I actually, I don't know how long this is going to be edited,

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 but that honestly took me around 40 minutes to record.

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 So, so I look over, throw my arm around.

292
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Nukem, I'm like, "You ready to get out of here, kid?"

293
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Nukem just looks, suddenly gives me a nod.

294
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 He's throwing up blood.

295
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He's like, "My weakness is menstruating women too."

296
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Run, run, run.

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Throw him the keys of the carbonicopter.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Let's get inside, guys.

299
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 We are headed out.

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 We're leaving behind old, timey America.

301
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 We are headed out to the center of the universe.

302
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 It's an ambitious place to be flying the carbonicopter,

303
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 but Nukem can do it.

304
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 We're flying.

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 There's black holes everywhere.

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Two black holes are like hitting each other,

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 and then they become a blacker hole.

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I bet you that's a thing.

310
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Science, figure it out.

311
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 We're flying around.

312
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Now, there's some weird stuff involved in this story,

313
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 and I kind of want to do a little exercise first.

314
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I came across, we're going to be talking about hacking the universe.

315
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 That's why we're in this place with nothing but black holes.

316
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Nukem's like, "Come on, man.

317
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 If my first time flying the carbonicopter,

318
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 I have to navigate event horizons.

319
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Yeah, yeah."

320
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Quit whining.

321
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Helicopter's flying around.

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Now, first off, I want to do a little exercise with you guys.

323
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 There's this thing.

324
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 You know me.

325
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I'm not a big--

326
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I'm not really big into like channeling and like aliens

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 talking to people's brains and stuff like that.

328
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 I'm usually pretty skeptical of that,

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 but I came across this thing that came from an alien.

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 All that being said, I came across this thing online

331
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 supposedly from some sort of alien angel something called Abraham.

332
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 So there's this woman named Esther Hicks,

333
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 and some of you guys are like, "Oh, great."

334
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Some of you guys are shutting the podcast on now.

335
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Now, I don't know a lot about Esther Hicks.

336
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I do know that she believes she's channeling some sort of being

337
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 called Abraham Hicks, and she was also one of the--

338
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 this is how she perked my attention up.

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 She's one of the original people who was involved in The Secret.

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 You know that book by what was it?

341
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Rhonda Bynes or something?

342
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Brynes or something?

343
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And you guys know I'm a big law of attraction visualization guy.

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 So this kind of popped up on my radar.

345
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Now, I don't know much about Esther Hicks,

346
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 so I'm not really going to talk about her much.

347
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I know that she was originally involved in The Secret,

348
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 and then there was some sort of falling out between the two people.

349
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And I always think it's weird when--

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 and you see this a lot.

351
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 You see this a lot.

352
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 You see that they have connections to the universe

353
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 or connected to these higher powers or know all these secrets.

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And they get involved in lawsuits.

355
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Isn't that weird?

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 This isn't abnormal.

357
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 A lot of times when you look at these self-help groups,

358
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 there's a lot of lawsuits involved.

359
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 So, I mean, everyone's bogged down by mortal concerns, right?

360
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 But anyway, she doesn't work with The Secret

361
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 like they took her out of the documentary.

362
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 But apparently, it was kind of like a--

363
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 just a schism over long-term rights.

364
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 It's just weird.

365
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 So, you guys hold the keys to reality,

366
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 but you need to have this percentage of royalties, whatever.

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I'm not knocking Esther Hicks.

368
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I don't know enough about Esther Hicks.

369
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 But I did see this.

370
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I thought this was--

371
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 and maybe we'll go back and look at Esther Hicks

372
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 if it turns out to be interesting.

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 But I came across this.

374
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Now, again, it came from a space alien

375
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 from 10,000 years ago.

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 But let's try it out.

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Let's try it out,

378
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 because there are some interesting things in this.

379
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 We're going to try to hack the universe right now.

380
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000

 So, it's easier to do it with just kind of elemental forces.

494
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 But, so that's a little homework for this week.

495
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And I want you guys to do that.

496
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And I want you guys to try that out.

497
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But that is just a little taste of what I want to talk about.

498
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And we're talking about hacking the universe.

499
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Let's go ahead, Newcombe.

500
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Let's fly into one of those black holes.

501
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 We're actually headed back to Earth.

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Let's whip out our cell phones.

505
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 So, there's a new app out called Rando Nautica.

506
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And what's interesting, there's a couple of interesting things about it.

507
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 But I think one of the most interesting things,

508
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 and again, this is part of the mystery that can be solved right away.

509
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 I just need one person's help.

510
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 I got a request to cover this story not too long ago.

511
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And I actually did a series of live streams where I was testing it.

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And then I went to do the story,

513
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 and I couldn't find out who recommended this story.

514
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 I looked all over Twitter, all through my email,

515
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 all through YouTube, all through Instagram.

516
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Could not find who recommended me this story.

517
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And I was like, "I know someone, bro."

518
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 I actually remembered seeing the logo of the app in my DMs.

519
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 But I didn't know where it was at.

520
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And then I was coming through all this stuff.

521
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I kept putting the story off.

522
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I was supposed to do this story last week.

523
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And then I came across a note I had written myself

524
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 that said "insta" - Nick 44, which means Instagram.

525
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Someone on Instagram named Nick 44.

526
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 I went to my DMs, wasn't there.

527
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 I'm not friends with anyone named Nick 44.

528
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 The account's gone.

529
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Q. Zeraphim Music, whatever that thing's called.

530
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 [imitates sound effect]

531
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Now, obviously Nick 44, if you listen to the show,

532
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 you can go, "Oh, my account got deleted.

533
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 I was doing this, that, or the other thing,

534
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 or it got hacked or something like that."

535
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 But as far as I can tell, Nick 44, I don't follow them.

536
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 They don't follow me.

537
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I couldn't even find the account when I searched for it.

538
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Again, I am not in any way shape or form saying

539
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 that Nick 44 sent me this from an alternate reality.

540
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And since I've used the Rando Nautica app in real life,

541
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 I've shifted into one where Nick 44 doesn't exist.

542
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I am in no way saying that.

543
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I'm slightly implying it.

544
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 But if Nick 44 gets back to me,

545
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 and I can see the DM they sent me,

546
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 because anyone can make up a fake Nick 44 account at this point.

547
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 But maybe it was just an error on my part.

548
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 But I am slightly implying that Nick 44 never existed in the first place.

549
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Nick 44, if you do exist in this reality,

550
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 thank you for recommending the story.

551
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Also, John from Scar Group, we were talking about this as well.

552
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 So I wanted to give him a shout out.

553
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 But Rando Nautica.

554
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Let's take a look at this.

555
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 This is an app where you pull it up on your phone and you go,

556
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 "Bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits."

557
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And then you hit a button and it will give you a random location in your area.

558
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And the theory is you go there and you will see a bunny rabbit.

559
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Or an outline of a rabbit.

560
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Or a rabbit foot.

561
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Or a Volkswagen rabbit.

562
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Or a copy of 8 Mile on DVD.

563
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 This is the theory behind Rando Nautica.

564
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And it gives you truly random places to go,

565
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 because it uses quantum mechanics.

566
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 It's not, or a quantum number generator,

567
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I think is the exact term.

568
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 A quantum random number generator.

569
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 They said a normal number generator does have some sort of pattern to it.

570
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 But a quantum random number generator can truly take you to a completely random place.

571
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 You can also do the opposite.

572
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 You can go bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits.

573
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And then it will send you to a place where there is likely no bunny rabbits,

574
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 say Elmer Fudd's house.

575
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 So it has an attractor setting, it has a void setting.

576
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And it's become a hot new toy among millennials in Generation Z and Podcast hosts,

577
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 and really anyone who has a smartphone.

578
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 There's been a couple articles written about this.

579
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Now what's interesting was I said this earlier.

580
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I had come across this story months ago before Nick 44 slipped into our reality and told me about it.

581
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 But what I had heard it described as is something totally different than what it is now.

582
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Which I find another odd thing.

583
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 But let's look at what it is now.

584
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Let's look at what it supposedly is now.

585
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 You think about something, you go to the location on the app, you'll see it.

586
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 You have a whole subreddit dedicated to these people.

587
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 They'll say, "I was thinking of something unexplainable."

588
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 They go out to the location, there's a chair in the middle of a field.

589
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 What a super unexplainable bunch of upvotes.

590
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I thought of the Illuminati, this is actually a real one.

591
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I thought of the Illuminati and I went out in the field.

592
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 This has to be a joke, but it got the upvotes.

593
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 People thought it was real.

594
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Or I assume that humanity is not as insane as it is.

595
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 This guy was thinking about the Illuminati, he went out in the field and he took videotape of a smashed watermelon and a slice of pizza.

596
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And I go, "What is a watermelon?"

597
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 What do either of these things have to do with the Illuminati?

598
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Ah, I'm not...

599
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Apparently I haven't taken enough red pills.

600
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 A slice of pizza looks like a what?

601
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Triangle.

602
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I don't know what the watermelon has to do with anything, but got a bunch of upvotes.

603
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I don't want to knock the people who invented randonautica too much.

604
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Obviously they can make this app, it's really cool, it's free, it'll allow you to have a nice walk.

605
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 You'll see the reddit, it's just stuff like that.

606
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 One guy goes, "I was out with my sister, I hadn't even opened the app yet and an owl flew out of a tree."

607
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And then I walked by another tree and there was a photo of a baby in it.

608
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I'm like, "That's... First off, where do you expect owls to fly from?"

609
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Right?

610
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 That's not super weird.

611
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And then, yeah, he took a picture of like a birch tree.

612
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And in the birch tree is a photo of a newborn baby.

613
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Now that to be fair, that is weird.

614
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 That is weird.

615
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 But it doesn't... I mean, he hasn't even used the app yet.

616
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 He's just walking on the street and he sees all this stuff.

617
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Again, the owl flying out of the tree, that's totally normal.

618
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I've seen that if you keep it vague, if you think of sunshine and you go outside and the sun's in the sky,

619
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 or if you think of beauty or hope, but those are all too vague, right?

620
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 You can walk anywhere.

621
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 You can think of hope and walk into a Walmart and be like, "I hope my car doesn't get broken into it."

622
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And ta-da!

623
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 There you go.

624
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 So you have all this different stuff.

625
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 What's weird about this?

626
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 What's super weird about this, other than the fact that people are taking photographs of slices of pizza in the woods?

627
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Is that this is not the app.

628
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 This is not what I was originally told it was for.

629
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Now, again, when I was doing the research for this story, I could not find where I had originally found my sources.

630
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 So it could be, one, sloppy note keeping.

631
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 It's very likely that.

632
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Two, I slipped into an alternate dimension.

633
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Three, the reason for the program changed because the technology changed.

634
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Or four, the reason for the program changed.

635
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Because it's supposed to truly be hidden.

636
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Now, out of those four, it's most likely bad note taking, right?

637
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 We gotta be honest.

638
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I probably found the information first and then didn't write down my source and here we are.

639
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 But what's interesting is none of the current stuff involving randonautica, I could not find this replicated.

640
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 This is how I was originally told this program was supposed to work.

641
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Before Nick44 got ahold of me, this was months ago.

642
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 There is nothing random in life.

643
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 So, how do you go out for a walk? You're walking on the street.

644
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Your goal is to walk to Burrito Barn.

645
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And as you're walking to Burrito Barn, you go, "You know what? I'm gonna take a left here."

646
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I never really take a left, but I'm gonna take a left here.

647
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 So you take a left there, it's a longer walk, but it's really nice.

648
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Maybe you find a shiny nickel on the ground.

649
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Next time you're going to Burrito Barn, you decide, "You know what? I'm gonna take a left."

650
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 No, no, no, I'm gonna keep going straight.

651
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And that little bit of a divergence there may have changed something.

652
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 But none of that is random, right?

653
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Those are you still making decisions.

654
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 That's still the universe wanting you to find that nickel that day.

655
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Or to hesitate on your decision the next day.

656
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 That's the universe setting things out for you.

657
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 The way that I was told randonautica originally worked, and it actually wasn't even being called randonautica at that point.

658
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 The app didn't exist or wasn't available to the public when I first started looking into this.

659
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Was this was a way to hack the universe?

660
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 The universe has a plan for all of us, and all of those little decisions you make during the day are part of the plan.

661
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 I tried recording this episode about 9 o'clock this morning,

662
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 but there was a bunch of noise in the neighborhood, and I put it aside and played Minecraft and ate lunch,

663
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 and played some more Minecraft, and here I am.

664
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 But that was the universe's plan for me to be recording the episode right now, when it's 80 degrees and I'm dripping with sweat.

665
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 But none of those events were random, it was all planned out that way.

666
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 The way that I originally came across randonautica was this.

667
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Because you were using true randomness, because you were using a quantum random number generator,

668
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 you were doing something that the universe could not expect.

669
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 The universe could predict you to download the app, and the universe could predict you to hit that button,

670
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 but the universe could not predict the quantum numbers that assigned you to go to a location.

671
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 It gave you...

672
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 The first time I saw it, I did not come across anything with...

673
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 You think about something and it takes you there.

674
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 The goal was you would go someplace completely random.

675
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 The universe did not expect you in that moment there.

676
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 It was a way to hack the universe.

677
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 It was a way to basically glitch out the universe.

678
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 If you could outthink, outsmart, outlast reality, what would happen?

679
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 But it's weird because I can't find...

680
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 I'm not saying that people still aren't saying that today,

681
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 but when I'm looking at the main sources for randonautica and randonauts,

682
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 they're talking about finding slices of pizza and owls flying around.

683
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 I'm not seeing anyone saying, at least the popular ones,

684
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 again, these things could be out there, but they're not...

685
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 That using this app can break reality.

686
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Because reality has a plan for you and you're throwing in quantum mechanics to that plan.

687
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 I'll admit, I will admit, after I did the livestream experience

688
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 and I was doing these going on this random walk,

689
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 it was assigning me to these random locations, places that I don't go normally at all.

690
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Just go in there.

691
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And then, what, like a day or two later, there was supposed to be a riot in Hood River?

692
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Which is completely out of character for Hood River.

693
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 It's kind of in character for me, but it's completely weird for this town.

694
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 I remember thinking, did I crack reality?

695
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 No, no, no, and I would tell myself, no, no.

696
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 This is just something that's happening right now.

697
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 I mean, let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second.

698
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Let's talk about that this is what the app can actually do.

699
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 It can actually send you to a location that the universe did not expect you there at that time.

700
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 It has no preloaded assets for you to do or experience.

701
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 So it's basically doing stuff on the fly.

702
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 The idea is that the universe rewards you for your exploration.

703
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 You're basically clipping through the walls of reality and it's rewarding you with that.

704
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 It's the law of attraction in a sense, but you're not necessarily attracting anything in particular.

705
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 You're attracting new experiences.

706
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 You're letting the universe know, hey man, I'm ready to push the bounds, what you got, what you got for me.

707
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 And when I was looking at the early reports of this a couple months ago,

708
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 people were saying their lives had changed for the better.

709
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Again, that could be completely anecdotal.

710
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 What it's definitely anecdotal, that could be completely, you know, a confirmation bias is what I mean to say.

711
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 If you do something and your life gets better, you may always think of the machine when I did it,

712
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 and all of a sudden there was armed men in the city, and I was like, what in the world is going on?

713
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Because I did this, is that why this threat happened here on this particular day?

714
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Now, it could obviously be confirmation bias.

715
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Some people though, occasionally you would see a report online where people would say, don't do this, don't do this.

716
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Ever since I did this, my life has been terrible.

717
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And to be honest, that kind of made me hesitate on running the program when I first got it.

718
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 First off, I had just done an episode about a guy who had an Uber app on his device

719
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 and ended up causing a mass shooting because he got possessed by a devil.

720
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And I think two days later I was like, hey, I'm going to try this new app. Boop!

721
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 But it did make me concerned because you would occasionally very rarely get a report of someone saying, don't use this app.

722
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 It made my life worse.

723
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 What's interesting is that if you hack the universe, there's no guarantee that your hack will be beneficial.

724
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Just like if you're hacking a video game, you could hack a video game, put in aimbot, put in X-ray vision and all this stuff.

725
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 But it's also no guarantee that you do the hack wrong and it crashes the game and makes it unplayable.

726
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 You are seeing lots of people tell these reports of them doing it and having these great experiences afterwards, they're getting jobs.

727
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 I mean, that was what was weird about it. That was the overwhelming amount of resources I saw back then.

728
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 And again, they may still exist now, but they're not talking about it on the reddit.

729
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 They're talking about mirrors and slices of pizza and chairs in the middle of nowhere.

730
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 So, with our conspiracy caps falling on our head, you have to wonder is this app designed to hack reality.

731
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And when it was being used by a select group of people and their lives were benefiting from it, did people go, this is great.

732
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 This could be really helpful, but then as it got released to the masses, weird things started happening, bad things started happening.

733
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Reality began to crack.

734
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Now it's just an app so you can find bunny rabbits or pictures of babies in trees.

735
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 If the app was designed to hack reality and it was hacking reality, you think you would still want to...

736
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 That would be a selling point, right? Everyone could be a god. Everyone's lives could be better.

737
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 But if it turns out that on average, it's not everyone's lives better and there's a small group of people who kind of mess things up.

738
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Because here's the thing. There's little hacks you can do for the universe where you sit and you concentrate for 17 seconds or 68 seconds

739
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 or do visualization like Wallace Waddles, follow the secret, things like that, little hacks that you can do to make your life better.

740
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 That's one thing, but to actually try to defeat the universe at its own game is something far more dangerous.

741
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 Because whether or not you like it, the universe has a plan for you. It figured it out and it figured out your piece, your little tiny piece

742
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 and how it relates to supernovas on the edge of the universe. Like everything is interconnected like that.

743
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 And if you can figure out a way to upset that plan, who knows what you're doing.

744
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 One, the plan the universe has set out for you may have a great ending, not just for you, but for the people around you.

745
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 And you've all of a sudden thrown a wrench into that. And that may mess up the plan for you and for the people around you.

746
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 But if millions of people start throwing wrenches into the machinery over the course of a few months, who knows what will happen to reality?

747
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 The universe has a plan. It might not be the most fun plan for you, but it has a plan.

748
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 It has a plan that was crafted before reality even began.

749
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And if you can corrupt that plan with an app that you download from the Google Store, things are going to get really weird, really fast.

750
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Is Randall Nautica a harmless app? Or is it the last app that humanity will ever download?
