 Is it true that there is a phone app out there that can make you a powerful psychic?

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,600
 And then we travel to Virginia City in Nevada to take a tour of a haunted art center.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:57,600
 Is it true that by day, old women paint things, but at night, bloody chains appear hanging from the walls today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 I don't know, I'm a walk breakdown.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,600
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 I hope you guys are staying warm, all my listeners in the United States.

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 I don't know why all of a sudden I kind of pronounce the word "united."

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,600
 Am I seeing the future? Civil war incoming?

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
 We'll talk about seeing the future. There's no civil war coming from those of you who got worried instantly,

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,600
 but we'll talk about the fact that I can see the future now.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 But before we get into all of that, first off, because it's winter themed, everyone's chilly, everyone has a bunch of Parkinson's.

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
 In comes one of our legacy Patreons. He's dressed like a penguin.

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
 He's sliding on his belly into Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
 It is Jimmy Moore. Everyone give a round of applause to Jimmy Moore.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,600
 He's a longtime listener of the show. He's been around forever. Jimmy, we really appreciate your support.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,600
 See, waddles in. Little penguin outfit. You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,600
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys happen to be humans, that's okay, too.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
 Just helps read the word about the show really, really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
 Talk about it online. Talk about it in person. Get the word out.

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 Jimmy, I want to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalapi. We are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
 We are headed out to Wall Street.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
 [imitates walking]

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
 Jason Jalapi's driving on the road. I'm going to take this as an opportunity as well.

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
 It's Friday, so you guys got the weekend. I wanted to say this.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,600
 I've been doing really good on my 90 days to a better you challenge, because I'm doing it as well, obviously.

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,600
 And to those of you who are still trying to figure things out or have already started doing things,

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,600
 this is an interesting way to look at this. What do you really want to do?

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,600
 See, the last time I did a 90 days to a better you challenge, I was focused on losing weight.

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 I was looking at that scale, that number on that scale, trying to make that number go down.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 But that's not really what I wanted. It's not really what I wanted. I wanted to be healthy. I wanted to be fit.

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 So you know what I did? I actually took my scale and I took the batteries out and I put it in the closet.

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,600
 And I'm gauging my 90 days by how much weight I'm lifting.

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,600
 And the gains have been amazing. Just in the past couple weeks.

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:24,600
 I'm reusing that old muscle that I built up in high school and college when I was seriously lifting weights.

44
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,600
 I thought I wanted to be thinner, but I want to be stronger and healthier and fit.

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,600
 And then the weight loss comes from that. So it's very important to look at what you actually want.

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,600
 If I dropped down to 220 pounds, yeah, I'd be fine. I would look good, but I want to be strong.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,600
 And because that's what I really want, those gains are just piling on top of each other.

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 So think about what your real end goal is. I for years wrote.

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
 I was an author for years and years and years and was writing and putting this stuff out.

50
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 I couldn't keep my production schedules up. It turns out I didn't want to be a writer.

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,600
 I wanted to be a storyteller. As a child I wanted to be a director.

52
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,600
 As an adult I wanted to write. I've written scripts, I've written books, I've written short stories, all sorts of stuff.

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:26,600
 But I wanted to be a storyteller. And once I realized that and I started doing this podcast where I tell two stories a day, ten stories a week,

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,600
 with cool little sci-fi twists at the end of the episodes, this is what I wanted to do.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,600
 And once I realized that I wanted to be a storyteller, it didn't matter what the medium was, I wanted to tell stories to people.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,600
 Everything fell into place. So if you are thinking, "I want to be a rock and roll guitarist," is that what you really want?

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
 Or do you want to be in the music industry? You know what I mean?

58
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 Think about what your true motivation is that might help you click.

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 And this goes past the 90 days to a better you challenge. This could be something that opens up whole new gateways for you.

60
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 So think about that. Think about what you really want to do. Because once I stopped worrying about that needle on the scale and started worrying about the weights being attached

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,600
 and just lifting heavy, I can't wait to work out. I can't wait to see how strong I am now.

62
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,600
 Think about what your end result is and that will help you become a better you. 90 day challenge and beyond.

63
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,600
 Wanted to get those words. Hopefully those words motivated you. Jimmy Moore is coming out of the car. He's lifting weights.

64
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,600
 Little penguin arms lifting weights. Go for it. Go for it. But we also got to go to Wall Street.

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,600
 So Jimmy Moore is back in the Jason Jalaphy and we are on the way.

66
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,600
 Maybe we'll get him a little... Maybe we'll weigh down the steering wheel.

67
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
 So as he's steering it, it's like lifting weights. It's also super hard to drive.

68
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,600
 The reason why we're headed to Wall Street is because I want to talk about this app that I talked about a while ago.

69
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,600
 It's a couple episodes ago. I mentioned the Fortien map and I mentioned this app called the Remote Viewing Tournament.

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,600
 I think it was last week or the week before. I said, "Hey, I'm going to announce it over..." It was actually farther back than that, I think.

71
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,600
 I'm going to announce this and I'm going to try it out and if I see anything from it, then I'll let you guys know.

72
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 Dude, this is awesome. You guys... I made jokes that this is going to get you kidnapped by Professor X.

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,600
 It might. And I might be the first to go. First off, I got to give a shout out to Nate, a Patreon supporter.

74
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
 He's the one who brought it to my attention, so thank you so much, Nate.

75
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
 I would not have known what an amazing human... No, human.

76
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,600
 "Homo superior" is the actual term that I'm giving myself. Let's talk about the app though real quick and then we'll get into how amazing it is.

77
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:53,600
 So this guy named Michael Ferrier invented this app and basically he was listening to Coast to Coast AM one day and they had like a remote viewing exercise

78
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,600
 and he did it and he guessed it right and he goes, "Ah, maybe there's something to this."

79
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 But obviously he's a bit of a paranormal fan if he's listening to Coast to Coast in the first place, but he's been thinking about remote viewing for a while

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,600
 and like, is there any science behind it? Started investigating it and then he does what really everyone does or everyone wants to do.

81
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 He takes a passion, which is paranormal stuff and remote viewing, and how can I make money doing this?

82
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 So is this app free? Yeah. He actually pays winners, quote unquote, "winners" out of his own pocket.

83
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 So at the end of each month, the top 10 people get $10. And then at the end of the month, the top 10 people for the life of the app get $10.

84
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
 So it's not a ton of money. That's what? $200 that you're paying out of your pocket.

85
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:48,600
 But what he does is this. He's trying to use, and he's very open about this, isn't hidden, he's done interviews on this, it's actually in the apps, frequently asked questions.

86
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:56,600
 He uses the information that app users give to buy and sell stock on the stock market.

87
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 He's been doing this since September 2019 and so far he's made $7,000. Some days he buys, some days he sells.

88
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,600
 And that actually, he said that on average he has a 55.7% chance of being correct.

89
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:20,600
 If he bases what he's going to do on the stock market on the results of the app, it's more than average. That he'll actually make money.

90
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,600
 When you, and I showed, I did a Patreon live stream last Saturday and I showed them how it's done.

91
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:34,600
 I'll try to explain, it's a little hard to explain, but every day at 1.30pm, right after the stock market closes, your phone alerts yourself.

92
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 If you have this app, if you don't have this app, this isn't going to happen. You're like, "Dang it, why is my phone not doing this?"

93
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,600
 I have the app, at 1.30pm it gives me a white screen and I draw an image of what I think I'm going to see.

94
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
 And then I submit it and then it gives me a choice of two images.

95
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 And basically that image, one of those two images will be presented to me the next day at 1.30pm.

96
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
 And I have to predict which image it is.

97
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:15,600
 He says he gives, it gets complicated from there, but using this weird math, science, psychic stuff, he basically, one image means buy and one image means sell.

98
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,600
 And if more people saw the buy image in the future, he buys.

99
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
 And if more people saw the sell image in the future, he sells.

100
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
 But you go, "Jason, how does it pre-do?" It gets a little more complicated than that.

101
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 He says that it's randomized, so some people see one image for buy and other people see one image.

102
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 That same image will mean sell, so it's this weird algorithm thing.

103
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:44,600
 But he apparently has it working because he's made $7,000 using this thing and he's just buying and selling in these stocks.

104
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,600
 His goal is to eventually be able to form out remote viewers.

105
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
 He wants to prove that this thing is a viable option.

106
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,600
 He goes, "I would eventually like to start giving them more money, more shares in what's going on."

107
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 But so for example, the other day my phone does a little beep beep.

108
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,600
 My phone pulled up the white screen and I had in my head an image of something tiny.

109
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,600
 So I drew a picture of a giant chair and a little person standing next to it and then I wrote tiny in that.

110
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
 I submitted it and then it gave me a choice of two images.

111
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 One was a beach with like a beach house and a bunch of chairs.

112
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:27,600
 The other one was a loaf of bread and little tiny pieces of cheese and a tiny German flag.

113
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 I don't know if it was German. It was a European flag.

114
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 Why would it be with bread and cheese? That's in France, but it wasn't a French flag.

115
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
 And I go, "Tiny. Tiny little flag."

116
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 So I clicked that one with 100% certainty and the next day, bam, that was the image.

117
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,600
 So right now, right now, and actually let me see this too. I thought this was real interesting.

118
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:58,600
 There is a thing called decline effect in parapsychology and basically the longer you run a parapsychology experiment, it starts to go to 50%.

119
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,600
 They go, a lot of times when people start doing like trying to guess random cards, like can you see what's, is this a star?

120
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 Is it a cross? That type of effect. Can you read? Is it a black or red card?

121
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
 People, a lot of times will get 60% right and be like, "Oh man, you're psychic."

122
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,600
 But as time goes on, it actually drops down to around 50%.

123
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,600
 And they go, sometimes it's the person who gets a lot of hits early on and then they start second guessing themselves.

124
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 They don't come as easy. They start not trusting their instinct and then it ends up becoming 50%.

125
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,600
 And then they just get totally discouraged because that's normal. That's a homo sapien.

126
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,600
 So I've been doing this app for about three weeks now.

127
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,600
 I told you that story so I could doot doot my own horn. I've been doing this app for about, I don't know, three, four weeks now, every single day.

128
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 There's about 13, 14,000 users of this app.

129
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,600
 Apparently I was reading one of the reports. It actually might be higher. I probably could check it, but let's say 14,000.

130
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:06,600
 I'm in the top 470 psychics who are currently using this app and in the month of February, which is pretty much when I started.

131
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,600
 I think I started like the last week of January. I'm number 12.

132
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,600
 Number 12. And what's cool about this is that it actually will break down your stats.

133
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,600
 So right now, I've done 27 rounds. So I've done it for 27 days. So around a month. I'm 61% correct.

134
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,600
 They said based on this app, they go based on your answers and how confident you are in your answers.

135
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,600
 There is only a 2.3% chance that you are doing this randomly.

136
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:47,600
 And if you even forget the confidence part, if you just pick two images and don't say I'm absolutely for sure, there's only 11% chance that you're doing this randomly.

137
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 I'm a psychic, baby. I'm a remote viewer and I got the numbers to back it up. I've been doing it long enough.

138
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 So interesting thing, if you've ever wanted to have proof that you're psychic, download this. However, again, I'm not responsible of government agents or fictional characters.

139
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,600
 Can nap you and try to turn you into some sort of secret super weapon.

140
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,600
 But if they did, maybe that's part of the 90 days to better you. Maybe you want to be locked up in some government lab.

141
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,600
 You're like, within 90 days, I'll be nine stories deep underneath the Pentagon. Just where I've always wanted to be.

142
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 Try it out. It's a really cool app. See if you can beat my score, but do not. If you win 10 bucks, you gotta give it to me. You gotta give me a referral code.

143
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,600
 Jimmy, let's go ahead and leave behind Wall Street. Call in that carbonar copter. We are headed out to Virginia City, Nevada.

144
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 [imitates car engine]

145
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 You know what's funny? Today's stories I picked, I just kind of wanted a chill day. Honestly, I just wanted a chill day.

146
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,600
 Because yesterday's story really, I hate that story. Like, when I was researching it more, I remembered most of it.

147
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 Then I had a research, and there was the Branson Perry story, and then I was researching it, and I was like, this is so gross.

148
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:04,600
 Then when I was telling it, it's like, ugh, and then I had to edit it, and I was like, oh, I just want to take tomorrow's Friday's episode.

149
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,600
 It's going to be pretty chill. It's an interesting story. I'm glad that I shared it with you. It's truly horrific.

150
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 Why am I glad that I shared that with you? I'm like, that disturbed me for 20 years. Enjoy! Then I just play it.

151
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,600
 Yeah, dude, it's just so creepy. That story is so creepy for me. But anyway, so we're kind of taking a casual trip for this one.

152
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 We are headed out to Virginia City, Nevada.

153
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
 [imitates car engine]

154
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:36,600
 We're walking along this dusty road. There's tumbleweed everywhere, broken down fence, skull, cow skull.

155
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,600
 Don't get scared. Don't get scared. It's not a human skull. It's a cow skull. If you're a cow, though, that's probably terrifying.

156
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,600
 We're walking in front of St. Mary's Art Center, formerly St. Mary Louise Hospital.

157
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,600
 [imitates car engine]

158
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,600
 Lightning striking. There's like a creepy weather vane of a rooster. [imitates car engine]

159
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,600
 Going back and forth. That's how I pictured this place. That's how I pictured this place.

160
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 That's how I pictured most of Nevada. But as we go through the story, you're going to learn like I did after I spent 30 minutes, 45 minutes, research in this place,

161
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,600
 that the truth is far different. The truth is far different than your imagination.

162
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,600
 According to hauntedplaces.org, one of my favorite websites to check out every day, just pick on a random city.

163
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,600
 This is what you see at St. Mary's Art Center. It used to be a hospital, so that's kind of spooky, right?

164
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,600
 You see a bunch of apparitions. You'll hear bootsteps, which is oddly specific.

165
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,600
 Did you hear that? It just sounded like tennis shoes. You hear bootsteps. You hear bootsteps coming out of nowhere.

166
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:54,600
 You hear ladies' voices. Oh my! Look at George and his new boots. And then you smell phantom smells, like rubbing alcohol, flowers, and pipe tobacco.

167
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,600
 Now, rubbing alcohol, I haven't heard that one before. It's interesting, because flowers and pipe tobacco, I hear all the time with phantom smells.

168
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 My grandpa, he was his favorite chair. He passed away every time I go over there, or not every time. But every so often, I smell pipe tobacco in the house.

169
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:17,600
 I've heard that story multiple times from friends of mine. I wonder why pipe tobacco and flowers, too. Flowers and perfume. Flowers, perfume, and pipe tobacco.

170
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:28,600
 Weird. I don't have any theory for that, but maybe those smells, because it's never like, "Oh yeah, this is where my aunt Ma died, and I smelled Virginia Slims every time I walked by."

171
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 It's never some noxious odor, unless it's brimstone. It's pipe tobacco, which actually smells really good.

172
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,600
 The one thing I love the most about hauntedplaces.org is the reviews. Because the little write-up is just like, "Ah, there's bootsteps."

173
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 But then the reviews is where people actually have been to these places. They let us know what's really going on. "Boot's on the ground," you may say.

174
00:16:51,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 So here's a review from McKenna. McKenna's story starts like this. She's going to go with a friend to St. Mary's Art Center because it has a reputation of being haunted.

175
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,600
 She wanted to see a ghost, or what she refers to as a "so-called ghost." Like, she doesn't believe in them, which is fine, you don't have to believe in ghosts.

176
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:17,600
 So that's her introduction. My introduction to this story is I read three to four hours a day. Not literature, not great works of art.

177
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,600
 I just read articles. People always go, "How do you find all your crazy stories?" I read three to four hours a day.

178
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 There's a lot of skimming in this job, because I'll just skim, skim, lights in the sky, lights in the sky, lights in the sky, gun.

179
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,600
 And then I'll start to read it and be like, "He pulled the gun on the alien and stuck it in his mouth and said, 'Earth rules.'"

180
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,600
 Oh, okay, I'm going to read this story. Lights in the sky, lights in the sky, abduction. Uh, reading that? Oh, hippies, they want to bring peace to Earth.

181
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,600
 Skipping, skipping. He's giving instructions on how to cure the Earth's ills. I'm like, "Get rid of that, get rid of that."

182
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,600
 Lots of skimming, because I have to read tons and tons of stuff. So as I'm reading this young woman's account, I'm reading it and it's like,

183
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:03,600
 so we went to St. Mary's and it was dark in the night and then we saw a visible and I was like, "Oh, visible specter."

184
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:12,600
 Okay, that's awesome. The word pops out, because I'm just skimming this visible. You don't really, even in the initial account, they're like,

185
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,600
 "Yeah, there's apparitions, but it's the boot steps that keeps people coming back." So then I saw that there was a word in there.

186
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,600
 I started reading from the top. Her and her friends show up at 10 p.m. on a Friday night.

187
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,600
 So on a night much like this, if you're listening to it on Friday, if not, it's on a Friday night. You've experienced those before.

188
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,600
 They pull up to the house. I'm going to read you this right from her account.

189
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 "We pulled up and there was a car in the driveway and lights at the front door. We saw a visible person walking out of the door and we asked if there was any way we could go inside.

190
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,600
 He was actually a worker for the art center." What? Have you ever been like, have you ever described one of your coworkers?

191
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:07,600
 Man, that guy sure is visible. You're like, "What? Hey, man, you got to meet my friend. He's really cool. He's good at chess. He's visible."

192
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 Why would you use the word visible to explain a normal human walking out of a building?

193
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:24,600
 But at this point, I was already reading the article and I had a hunch from that. I had a hunch from that.

194
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:31,600
 I don't know if she knew the way that I read and the way that I skim. I don't know if this was some sort of time bomb, literal time bomb, because it's sucking up my time.

195
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:41,600
 But I had a hunch. If McKenna was making such an odd statement this early on in her narrative, there's basically two stories I look for.

196
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,600
 The bizarre and the ridiculous. That's why there's so many poop stories in this podcast.

197
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 So McKenna meets this visible person. She's all touching him. She's all, "Is he real?" Yeah, I'm real. Quit poking me.

198
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,600
 He works for the art center. Now, it's 10 o'clock at night. It's 10 o'clock at night here, but maybe they had some new paint delivered.

199
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,600
 Maybe they're getting some new art supplies delivered. He goes, "Hey, would you like me to show you gals around?"

200
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 I don't know if he's sounding that disgusting, but he does offer to show the girls around. The girls are like, "Yeah, fine."

201
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 I'm assuming these girls are late teenagers, because they're out driving by themselves. So, you know, you have a guy working in an art center.

202
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 Every woman he sees is over the age of 50. He sees a couple of co-eds walking. "Yeah, yeah, I'll show you around. I am a worker at the art center, after all."

203
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:41,600
 They start walking around, and she goes, "The first thing we did when we walked inside was there was creepy dolls everywhere.

204
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:50,600
 Not just dolls in their packaging, not just American girl dolls. Creepy dolls. Here's the thing. All dolls out of their native environment are creepy.

205
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 A doll not found in a girl's room or in the vicinity of a girl is a creepy doll. A girl walking up the street holding a doll, that's fine.

206
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:08,600
 That exact same doll covered in dust sitting on the side of the freeway. Literally the same doll. It could be brand new. It's terrifying."

207
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,600
 This guy showing McKenna and her unnamed friend around, and he's like, "Look at all this stuff."

208
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,600
 And as she's walking with him into the building, they're past the creepy dolls. He doesn't seem to remark on that.

209
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 He takes them into a room where he has a bunch of cameras set up.

210
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,600
 Now, you and me, we talked about this on yesterday's episode, the Branson Perry's episode, "People Being Naive."

211
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,600
 I want to walk into some abandoned building. It's not abandoned. See, that's the thing.

212
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 Okay, well, we'll get into that in a second, but apparently the building's abandoned and she walks, her and her friend walk into it with this guy.

213
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
 And now he has a bunch of cameras set up and he says that he works there.

214
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,600
 We wouldn't go in the building in the first place. We may go, "Nah, we're good."

215
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 Man, did you see that guy? How visible he was. Oh dude, that was super spooky. You want to write that on the internet?

216
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:01,600
 And then we'll double back when the dude's gone and then we'll go in and start messing with spooky ghost dolls and stuff like that.

217
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,600
 I'm not going to roll around with some stranger that I don't know and there's the former hospital now Art Center.

218
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,600
 These girls are apparently naive. They walk in here. There's a bunch of cameras, which listen man, there's only a few types of people who have cameras.

219
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,600
 Photographers, actually there's a lot of people who have cameras. There's a lot of people who have cameras.

220
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,600
 Some people just like taking pictures, but also perverts. They ruin it for everything, right?

221
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,600
 That's why I don't eat Chex Mix anymore because one day I saw a pervert eating Chex Mix and now that's all I can think about.

222
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,600
 So, room full of cameras. Now, they don't think anything of this.

223
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 If you went into a dirty place full of spooky dolls at 10 o'clock at night with a stranger and he said, "Come this way and you saw a room full of cameras."

224
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,600
 You're going to assume you're in a saw movie. You're going to assume these cameras are recording and there's a snuff film going on.

225
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,600
 And through eating Chex Mix you see a guy in the corner. "Let the party begin!"

226
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 At this point the girls go, "Whoa, what are all these cameras doing here?" And he tells McKenna, "Oh, I'm a ghost hunter. These are my ghost hunting devices."

227
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:13,600
 So, he lied. He totally lied. He doesn't work for the Art Center. He's a ghost hunter.

228
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,600
 He broke into the building, became visible, and then a car full of girls showed up.

229
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,600
 Well, two girls, so half a car full of girls, showed up.

230
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,600
 He said, "Come in. I work here. It's okay." And then he's a ghost hunter too.

231
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,600
 But again, McKenna's not thinking that. At that point we'd bounce because he already lied once. What else is he going to lie about?

232
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,600
 He takes them up to the nursery room. Now, remember this used to be a hospital, so it makes sense that there was a nursery room.

233
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:47,600
 And according to McKenna, this room held kids of all ages, specifically, preemies to eight-year-olds.

234
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,600
 That is the worst combination to anyone who knows anything about human biology. And I don't know much.

235
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 I do know that preemies are incredibly fragile. And eight-year-olds like to wrestle.

236
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,600
 Eight-year-olds just watch white warm power rangers. They're like, "Stay away, putties!"

237
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:13,600
 And they're like kicking one-year-olds across the room. You can't combine eight-year-olds and preemies.

238
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,600
 Now, there were other kids in there too. It wasn't just those two age groups. Then everyone else is another ward.

239
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,600
 So it would be even worse. You've got a bunch of six-year-olds trying to assert dominance over the eight-year-olds.

240
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,600
 And then you've got the preemies all huddled up and they've got their umbilical cords all connected.

241
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 And they're sharing food and secrets. They're plotting. They're reform one giant eight-year-old.

242
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,600
 They're like, "All of our ages add together. We're 10." They're like, "No!" They're punching them.

243
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
 Anyway, so that's not true, right?

244
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 Like, this is the point where you should start to realize that either this photographer/checksomixenthusias/ghosthunter

245
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,600
 is lying to her, saying this room used to house all these different ages of kids, or McKenna is lying,

246
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:07,600
 or she's incredibly delusional. They go then to the basement, because that's where the ER was, according to McKenna.

247
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,600
 They have the basement, which is actually, that makes a lot of sense, because emergency room is what ER stands for.

248
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,600
 And there's nothing like an emergency that you have to go down three stories, right?

249
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,600
 The doctor's like, "Oh, no, I got a call. This guy's having a heart attack."

250
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,600
 There's the elevators going down. It's always leg day for the doctors there.

251
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,600
 Emergency rooms are always on the first floor, specifically for that reason, actually right next to the door.

252
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
 So whatever. This woman, McKenna, has obviously never been in a hospital.

253
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
 I'm sorry, I think she's never left her computer. So we have that.

254
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 She's given us this layout, this theater of the mind. So we have the nursery, a.k.a. "Thundered Home" for ages eight and under.

255
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 You have the ER in the basement. Then, on the top floor of this art center, formerly hospital, was an insane asylum.

256
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,600
 So this is a pretty all-functioning hospital, right? You can give birth. You can give birth in the hospital.

257
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,600
 And then you can be rushed to ER, not rushed. You know, you have to go down the elevator, someone else is hitting the button.

258
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,600
 You have to go back up to the top, bunch of insane people get on it.

259
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,600
 You can do everything in this hospital. You have emergency room. You have the...

260
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,600
 You don't want to have the nursery in the same building as the insane asylum.

261
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,600
 You probably don't even want it on the same city block.

262
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,600
 But they must have not had a lot of space in Nevada, because Nevada is known to be very crowded metropolitan state.

263
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,600
 It looks like Coruscant. You have the insane asylum at the top floor.

264
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 You have the nursery. You can hear the crazy people are like, "I can hear the babies vibrate through the floorboards."

265
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,600
 Besides the fact of having an insane asylum anywhere near a nursery, or in a emergency room.

266
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,600
 They're like, "First, we go down to the emergency room, get all the scalpels and surgical sauce."

267
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:57,600
 You don't want to have an insane asylum on the top floor of a building, because they're insane.

268
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,600
 They're just going to jump out windows. It's very interesting. That's a callback to an old episode I did.

269
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,600
 Very, very popular conspiracy theory. I'll put it on the show notes about the United States fighting Nazis in Antarctica.

270
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,600
 It's a ridiculous conspiracy theory. It was a really good episode. It didn't make any sense that what you start to think about the conspiracy theory doesn't make sense.

271
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:23,600
 But one of the parts of the conspiracy theory is one of the guys who supposedly was a whistleblower jumped out of an insane asylum.

272
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,600
 He was on the eighth floor, and they were saying you never put jumpers on the eighth floor.

273
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,600
 You put them on the second floor, but for some reason he was transferred up there.

274
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,600
 That's one of the sticking point. They go, "Well, this guy killed himself, or he was assassinated because he knew too much."

275
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 Forget that there was 30,000 other US soldiers involved in this battle, and you don't have other soldiers coming out saying, "I was also there. I shot down a spaceship."

276
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,600
 And Hitler was shaking his fist at me. He's like, "Meow, mine got to all get you, Yankee."

277
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,600
 So, you know, whatever. But anyways, that's an interesting episode. Give that one a listen.

278
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 But that was what made me think of this. I go, "Yeah, you don't never put an insane asylum on the top story."

279
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,600
 I learned that from insane conspiracies involving Nazis in Antarctica.

280
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:27,600
 McKenna also said on the top floor was, quote, "scratches up and down the walls, blood drips all over the floors, chain locks on the bed, creepy children's toys, and a deck of cards."

281
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:34,600
 Unquote. Why would she add that part? How does that add anything to the imagery?

282
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:44,600
 Scratches up and down the walls, bloody prints on the floor, bloody puddles, chains on the bed, and a deck of cards? I don't care.

283
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 Were they hunted? Did the Joker of the deck of cards wink at you? No, it was just a deck of cards. How does that add to any of the menace there?

284
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:06,600
 Then they say that a door slammed super hard. After all of that, after seeing blood on the floor and being escorted around this location by a man who lied to you,

285
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:15,600
 what scared them the most was the door slamming. Here, this is, because these are reviews. This is on the review, so this is the ending of McKenna's review.

286
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:25,600
 Quote, "I have never in my life had an actual ghost experience until then." The slamming door, by the way, not the blood, not the fresh human blood dripping.

287
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:33,600
 "I have never in my life had an actual ghost experience until then. It freaked us all out, and we left and never went back."

288
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:42,600
 I am so willing to go back for a second time, though, because that event changed my life and totally made me believe in the afterlife.

289
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:52,600
 Quote, "So we have someone who, in the beginning, didn't believe in ghosts. Now it turns out they were full-on agnostic, possibly atheist, didn't believe in the afterlife at all.

290
00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:00,600
 They figured when you died, it was the black void for eternity. I don't know what I was like before I was alive, so I don't care what it's like after I'm alive.

291
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:09,600
 Let the void swallow us all until the door slammed, until the door slammed, and then she straight up scooby-dooed out of there."

292
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,600
 So we have that story. Now I've never been there. I've never been there, and when I'm telling you that story, you're thinking, "Okay, maybe McKinnon's exaggerating.

293
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,600
 I've been to a lot of places, but I've never seen a deck of cards. I've never seen a deck of cards out of place."

294
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 Spooky dolls. Maybe there's like, it's like hobos running around there, stuff like that.

295
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:36,600
 Here is another comment right underneath hers, because again, this is so great about this website, that someone can tell a tale like that and someone go, "Ugh, there's this comment underneath this."

296
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:47,600
 Quote, "My friend rented the place out for the night. My children slept in the room that I guess was covered in scratches with chains, etc. I didn't see any of that."

297
00:30:47,600 --> 00:31:01,600
 So I'm thinking, why would you rent out? Why would you ever be like, "Come on, kids. Let's go to this abandoned ex-hospital now. It's this abandoned art center where sometimes adults will just hang out with cameras in a room.

298
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,600
 Bring your dolls, BYOD, bring your own dolls. Why would you rent this place out?"

299
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:14,600
 It turns out, because again, I've never been here, but after I read her, after I was tricked into reading her narrative by using the word "visible," that's all it takes.

300
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,600
 Putting the word "visible" in there for not anymore. Now I'm gonna need to read a little bit more before I continue.

301
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:27,600
 I was imagining this spooky abandoned art hospital, maybe it was an art center in the '60s when a bunch of hippies took it over, and now it's just this decimal place.

302
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:37,600
 It is a place where, to this day, it's completely all done up. They have art festival stuff. Well, not now, because the pandemic's going on, but they're starting to open it up.

303
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 It's basically a place where a bunch of old women would go and paint in the backyard. It's this beautiful building that is-- the only time there has probably ever been a creepy doll around there is on Halloween,

304
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:57,600
 because it is known to be haunted in every Halloween for like three days. They have these big, like, paranormal tours.

305
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:05,600
 Other than that, bring your-- it's BYOP. It's bring your own paint, and you sit out there, and there's like ducks walking around. Jimmy Moore's trespass of England.

306
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,600
 He's waddling by, there are painting pictures of him. It's that. It's an art center. You go, there's like a basket weaving section, and a yarn.

307
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,600
 You just look at yarn, and you're like, "Oh man, I really wish I could do something with that." They're like, "No, no, that's the advanced class."

308
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:30,600
 Lots of painting and stuff like that. It has been shut down during the pandemic, but it's not abandoned. There's no bloody chains. There's no deck of cards. There's not a deck of cards to be seen.

309
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:39,600
 There is two interesting questions about this, though. One is, this is me being conspiratorial, you are not allowed to go ghost hunting in that building.

310
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:49,600
 It is a known ghost-haunted location. It's on hauntedplaces.org, right? But you can't do any ghost hunting there, UNLESS you talk to the wigs.

311
00:32:49,600 --> 00:33:02,600
 Now, I guess this makes sense. I'm a classic ghost hunter. I used to break into haunted places. Graveyard, and houses, you know, hold the flashlight over long, jumping over people's fences, and stuff like that.

312
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:14,600
 Okay, you may call it criminal ghost hunting, but that's classic ghost hunting. This is before ghost hunting shows, and before things like laws and permits and trespassing orders and all that.

313
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:23,600
 It's back in the day, man. But I guess the wigs control this side of the ghost town. They control this part of ghost town.

314
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:39,600
 The wigs are a group, they're called the Women Investigating Ghost Sightings. I bet you could never guess about wigs. You're like, "I didn't even know it was an acronym. I just thought it was a bunch of old-timey political party, was walking around hitting people with canes."

315
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 Now, the wigs is Women Investigating Ghost Sightings. It's a woman-obviously, woman-based ghost group. They control the St. Mary beat.

316
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:58,600
 I wonder if you showed up and said, "I would like to learn how to paint, please." You're always painting pictures of ghosts, and the wigs show up, they're knocking over your easel, they're like, "Get out of here, you bum!"

317
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:09,600
 Or you show up and you're like, "One yarn, I'd like to buy one piece of yarn, please." And then, like, you pull out your little EVP reader and you're like, "When did you die? When did you die?"

318
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:16,600
 They're like, "What?" And the wigs come out of nowhere. They start beating you up, they're breaking your EVP recorder. They're like, "Record this, smash." You're like, "I just did."

319
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:31,600
 My other EVP recorder. They have a lock on this place. You can't investigate it. You can't investigate it. So that's just weird. I don't know how they got that contract. I don't know why they would want that contract, but apparently that's the way it is.

320
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:39,600
 The other weird thing, and we'll wrap it up like this, this much more lighthearted episode than yesterday's episode, even though I referenced it multiple times.

321
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:54,600
 What in the world was McKenna talking about? Here's the thing, she was either completely making it up, totally lying about this place, because none of it matches up.

322
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:14,600
 You could say, "Maybe she went on Halloween, or around Halloween. She didn't mention all the trick-or-treaters, all the visible 10-year-olds trick-or-treating." If it was like they were setting up for a haunted house or something like that, there wouldn't have been a man there setting up the cameras, because wigs is a woman group.

323
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:29,600
 So there wouldn't have been a dude there setting up cameras, definitely wouldn't be setting them up at 10pm by himself. So she's either totally making the story up, flat out fake, or she went to the wrong location.

324
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,600
 Here's the thing, the most likely answer is that she totally made it up. That's just the most likely answer.

325
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:47,600
 However, if that was the case, she could have made it up on Reddit, she could have made it up anywhere that wouldn't be tied to this location. She could have easily posted it somewhere where someone could have instantly fact-checked it.

326
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:54,600
 She could have posted it on Reddit and goes, "Me and my friend, we once went to this spooky place out in the middle of Nevada, I forgot the name of it, and tell the same narrative."

327
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:04,600
 And she'd get all this karma and people would be like, "Oh, that's super spooky." She could have posted it as creepypasta, she could have done a bunch of stuff, she tied it to this location in the very next comment, someone goes, "That's not true."

328
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:10,600
 "My kids hang out there. My kids, my kids range from age-premie to eight. It's perfect for them."

329
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:25,600
 What if she went to a different location and all of this stuff IS real? The dude with the cameras, the blood on the floor, the deck of cards, the creepy dolls, humans are visible, it's all sorts of madness.

330
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:34,600
 There may be some other place in Nevada that is this. There may be another abandoned hospital in Nevada that is this.

331
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:41,600
 OR even more terrifying, she did show up to the right location.

332
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:53,600
 Amber Alert, did you like that? Did that scare you as much as it scared me?

333
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:59,600
 Let me give you one more thing for a wrap this episode up to, guys. It's never going to be the perfect time to start your project.

334
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:08,600
 While I've been recording this episode, I've had people walking up and down and slamming doors and dogs barking, there's always cars driving by, people listening to really loud television in the place next door to me.

335
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:15,600
 I got an Amber Alert going off on my phone. Do it. Anyways, there's never a perfect time to start your project. The perfect time is now.

336
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:25,600
 The perfect time was yesterday. I've been recording this show 620 some-odd episodes. It's never the perfect time. It's never the perfect place. You just do it. You just get it started.

337
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:34,600
 If you wait for the perfect time, you'll be waiting forever. If you wait for the perfect situation, you'll be waiting forever. Just one last piece of inspiration for you for the weekend.

338
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:43,600
 What if she showed up to the right place and this was what she experienced at this art center? She got there. It was gross.

339
00:37:43,600 --> 00:38:05,600
 It was littered with debris from hundreds of hobos moving in and out up on the top floor where women sit with their easels and sketch out the sunset. When she went into that same room, it was covered in chains and blood and scratches.

340
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:18,600
 If she went back to that place, what she says, she wants to go back to that place, would she find a completely different location? She walks in and she goes, "When did you guys do all this renovation?"

341
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:26,600
 It looks beautiful on the outside. Look at all this. There's new tile on the ground. There's no dolls everywhere.

342
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:33,600
 This place has been renovated like this since the 70s. It's been an art center. People have been using it every single day.

343
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:46,600
 When she went out to prove whether or not ghosts existed and ended up hearing a door slam behind her, it blew her mind and made her think that there is life after death.

344
00:38:46,600 --> 00:39:11,600
 What would happen if she found that when she visited this place, it was a totally different place. It was from a different reality, a darker reality, where this hospital was not reused as an art center, but fell into disrepair and became a blight on the landscape.

345
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:32,600
 Somehow she transcended through reality and entered a haunted building. And maybe the door slam wasn't so much the wind or even a ghost, but reality itself closing in on her.

346
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:41,600
 We don't know what happened to McKenna after this story, but what if she traveled home and everything was fine?

347
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:53,600
 But the next day when she goes to work, the building that her office normally stood in seems decrepit. Seems like no one has been there for years.

348
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:01,600
 She figures she's lost, she doesn't really think anything of it, she doesn't seem to be the most bright as bulb, so she goes to her local college.

349
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:18,600
 It takes her 10-15 minutes before she realizes she's the only one on campus. She looks through the window of a classroom, it looks like it's been abandoned for decades.

350
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:32,600
 As she walks back out to her car, she realizes the city is quiet. No sounds of humans, no sounds of cars, no sounds of anything, but her own beating heart.

351
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:45,600
 She thought she was just going out on a Friday night to visit a haunted house, but instead she found herself walking into a new world, a haunted world.

352
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:54,600
 Her entire world is slowly turning into a wasteland, and that's when the shadows begin to move.

353
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,600
 She's not alone, but she will soon wish that she was.

354
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:09,600
 McKenna better start believing in the afterlife, because she's living one right now.
