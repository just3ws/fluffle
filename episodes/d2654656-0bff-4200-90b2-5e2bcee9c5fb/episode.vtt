 Aw, man! Really?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000

 Oh, hey, Dave. Yeah.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 The window and the door and the siding and the roof.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000

 When a gay man is found dead at the bottom of a cliff,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 it's real to suicide.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 When 88 gay men are found dead at the bottom of cliffs,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 the police finally open an investigation.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 And then we take a whirlwind tour of India

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 to look at some of their amazing haunted places.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Amazing in air quotes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 because these places are ridiculously bizarre.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 [Music]

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Hey, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 I hope you guys are going to have an awesome weekend.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporters.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 It's the fabulous Levas, Timothy Leva and Beatrice Leva.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Beatrice, you may remember.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 She's the one who broke the news about Forrest Finn's treasure being found,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 and she sent us the 2028 man story.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Really, really appreciate that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Both her whole family's fans of the show. It's totally awesome.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine, too.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Just go ahead and get the word out about the show.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 That really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 So, Timothy, let me touch the keys of the carpenter copter.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 [Copter whimpers]

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Catch him in your hand.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Catch him in the ignition.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Do helicopters even have keys now that I think about it?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 I think you just press buttons.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Timothy, take us up in that beautiful carpenter copter.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 We're headed out to Australia.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 [Copter whimpers]

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 We're flying. We're cutting lines right over the beautiful Pacific Ocean.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 This first story's a little dark.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 So, sorry about that, Timothy. Sorry that you're flying us today.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 We're going to do a lot of traveling, so you'll be able to go to other places.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 The beach risks are going to take turns, but we're flying over the Pacific Ocean.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 We're headed out to Australia.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 We're specifically headed to Bluefish Point.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 That's in North Head, Australia.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 It's December 10th, 1988.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 There's a man named Scott Johnson.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 He's 27 years old.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 He's a gay man.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 He moved from America to live in Australia with his lover.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 But when his naked body's found at the bottom of a cliff--

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 I can't, I told you this story is going to be dark--

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 when his naked body's found at the bottom of a cliff,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 it's ruled as a suicide.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Now, his brother-- this is one of those things that just happens to be serendipitous.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 His brother was extremely wealthy, powerful man.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 His brother's name is Steve Johnson.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 He's a tech entrepreneur.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 He's the one who actually commercialized the first algorithm to send photographs online.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 So, he ended up selling that to AOL and got a job.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 He was like an executive with AOL after that.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Very, very powerful rich man.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 So, when his brother commits suicide, he doesn't really buy it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 He doesn't really like-- it doesn't really make sense to him.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 What happens is, his brother's lover who's still in Australia one day calls up Steve.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 He says, "Hey, there was another gay guy who was found at the bottom of this cliff."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 And police are starting to think that maybe your brother didn't kill himself.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 They're going to start investigating this a little closer.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 But, at the call-- he got that call in 2005-- his brother died in 1988.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 So, it was a long span of time where Steve had to deal with this idea that his brother killed himself.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Steve Johnson begins to use his contacts and his wealth,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 and he sends a team of private investigators down there.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Because at first off, you think it's just a one-off thing, an unfortunate one-off thing.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 He didn't sit right with them, though.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 He sends a team of investigators down there.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 They begin working with local law enforcement.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 They begin to put these together.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 So, first you had Steve-- that was ruled as a suicide.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 The police opened this thing, it was called Operation Parabell.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 From 1976 to about the year 2000, the police were able to find 88 gay men

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 who had jumped off the-- quote-unquote jumped off these cliffs over that round 30-year period.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 88.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 They had all been considered suicides or accidents.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 One of the key details, the coroner kept going, it was a suicide, it was a suicide, it was a suicide.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 After about 20 years of the coroner saying this, someone brought up to the coroner,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 "Yeah, you know that's where a lot of gay people go to like hook up?"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 The coroner is like, "What?"

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's like a known area where gay men will go to hook up."

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And the coroner said, "Had I known that back then, when I first started looking at these bodies?"

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 It wouldn't have been so quick to say suicide, because if a location is going to attract gay men to have hook up sex,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 it's also going to attract people who hate gay people.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 So the coroner goes, "I kind of wish I had known that ahead of time."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 What they find out, they've now ruled 27 of those 88 as homicides.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 They believe that 27 of those 88 deaths were homicides, were murdered.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 And just recently, this is how I came across this story.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 In May 20th, 2020, police knock on Scott White's door.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 He's a 49-year-old man.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 The guy opens the door and he looks at the cops and he goes, "Yeah, I knew you were coming."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 This guy, Scott White, was at that area with Scott Johnson.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 December 10th, 1988, Scott White was standing there with Scott Johnson.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 And something happened that prompted Scott White to punch Scott Johnson and that man fell to his death off that cliff.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 He hasn't really admitted to saying why he did it.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 It's possible that he went there and was thinking about doing something and started to feel guilty.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 It's possible that he went there with the intent to murder him.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 We don't know. He hasn't admitted to any of that yet.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 But he does, he was there. He did do it.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 The motive is the question.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 The New South Wales police did end up issuing this statement recently.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 It said, "The New South Wales police acknowledges, without qualification, both its and society's acceptance of gay bashings and shocking violence directed at gay men and the LGBT community between 1976 and the year 2000."

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 There's just something that, you know, a couple guys get rowdy.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 They beat up a gay dude.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 The police might investigate it.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 88 people falling off cliffs from 1976 to 2000.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 That's when you start to look at possible conspiracy, a possible cover-up.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 One, two, you know, that could be a coincidence.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 One's not even a coincidence. It's just a tragic thing.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 But 88, 27 of them have been considered murderous.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 They don't think that the Scott White guy killed the other 26.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 They think it was other groups of people pushing them off the cliff.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Horrifying, horrifying story.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 And for the longest time, no one was even investigating it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Timothy, get us out of here with this carpenter copter.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Disturbing story.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 I actually debated whether or not it would be a good Friday story.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Does it something -- I tend to have more -- I like to have more uplifting stuff on Fridays, but I think it's an important story.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 And I think it does have the happiest ending we can have.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 We have justice being served.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 We have a man's name being cleared that he didn't commit suicide.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 And you have a brother realizing that his -- the justice for his brother was found.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 So it's as good as an ending as we could hope for in this type of situation.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Timothy, let's take us up in that carpenter copter.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And while we are in midair, we're going to figure out some way to do this.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 We're going to move around.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Okay, I'm going to hold the steering wheel.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Beatrice, you are going to take Timothy's place.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 He has to sit in the back now.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Fly us on out in this beautiful carpenter copter.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 We're headed out to India.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 We're flying.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 We are actually going to do a lot of stops this episode.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 First off, Beatrice, fly us over to Bandgad Fort.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 We're flying over this giant fort.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 It was built in 1573, so we're actually going to a little bit around that time period.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Hit that button right there or going back in time.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 We're now flying over this giant earthworks fort.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Massive fortress.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 10,000 people live inside of it.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 We're in the Alwar district in the Rajasthan state of India.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 And now we're going to land.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 We're going to walk around.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 We'll walk up to the front gate.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Hey, let us in.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 And that's a magic word.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 That's the password to get in.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Whether that was the gate opening up, not a constipated old man.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 We walk into the gate.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 It's old timey.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 It's like in the 1500s and everyone's like walking around doing their stuff.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 But in the middle of town is the most beautiful woman around.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 It's Ratnavati.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Ratnavati, she's the princess of Bangra.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 So Ratnavati is walking around and all the men are like wanting to marry her.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Quote unquote, marry her.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 We know what they really want to do.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 But she has not taken a suitor yet.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 And the men are like, oh, I can't wait to high shifts from side to side to marry her.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 But she's super beautiful.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Everyone wants her.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Most importantly though, in the background is this old man named Singhaya.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 And he's like, ha ha ha, she is the one I must possess.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Imagine Gaston, but disgusting looking.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Actually imagine Gaston, but he's the beast.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 And he's also a super powerful wizard.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 And he's not the beast where he has a lovable heart.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 He can actually have a lovable heart.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Wasn't he like a vein jerk?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 And then he turned into a monster and then someone stabbed him in the back.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 And he goes, oh, maybe I shouldn't be such a horrible person.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Did he really change that much?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Like thinking about that story, he didn't really come around.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 He basically was just like, oh no, I'm about to become a monster.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 She fell in love with him.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 But I don't think they never showed him like being nice to the cup, right?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 He wasn't like, oh, I'm not going to make you dance for my own enjoyment.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 I'm not going to eat food out of you anymore, Mrs. Boll.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 He's basically a monstrous man inside and out.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And he's a super powerful wizard.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 But he wants Rat Navati so bad that he watches her go into this perfume store all the time.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 And he knows what her favorite perfume is.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 And he's like, disguised, he's basically disguised as a perfume bottle in the corner.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 A wizard sized perfume bottle.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 He realizes, hmm, that's her favorite perfume.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 What if I added a love potion to it?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 And then stands right next to her, she'll love me forever.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Here's a tip.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 I'm not an evil doer or anything like that.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 But don't announce your plans where your victim can hear it.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Ha ha!

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 If only this bank knew I was going to rob it at 2.45 p.m.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Yes, I would like to withdraw $100, please.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Yeah, you don't do that, right?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 Because he must have done it relatively in her ear shop because she knows of the planet.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 So he goes and he creates a love concoction.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 He puts it in a bottle.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 He makes it look like the bottle of the perfume she loves and she walks up to it one day.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And he's sitting there, oh yes, here she comes.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Soon she'll be mine.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 And she picks up the perfume that has a love potion in it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 And she knows if she sprays it on her, she'll fall in love with this horrible magician.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 She does really, it's quick thinking, right?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 I guess the quick thinking is just don't even engage with the bottle.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Because what if it accidentally had a crack in her or something like that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 But anyways, she picks the bottle up and she smashes it against the boulder.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And the wizard's like, "No, you figured out my plan.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 I'll just have to try another love spell."

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Wait, no, no.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 And he looks and the boulder is moving towards him.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 [Bullet noises]

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 And he's like, "No, the boulder can't love.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 It has no soul."

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 And the boulder starts chasing the wizard through the street.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Because the boulder is madly in love with him.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Eventually the boulder crushes the wizard all over the city streets.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 And then just lays on top of him.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 And he's underneath the boulder and he goes, "Uh, that was a pretty good trick.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 It was a pretty good trick, but now everyone in this city will."

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Everyone's like, "Well, golly, I wonder what he cursed us with.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 I wonder what that evil wizard cursed us with.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Everyone in the city is going to get rich and powerful.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Woohoo, I'm not moving."

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Well, no, that's not what was the curse.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 He cursed everyone to die in the city.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 And sure enough, according to the legend,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 sometimes a couple days later, sometimes up to a year later,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 the city was laid siege by a rival army

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 and slaughtered everyone in the city, including the princess.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Nobody survived.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 So apparently the battle is historical.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 The question is, how much of the other stuff is historical?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 The princess might have actually been around.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 There could have been a wizard walking around,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 but I don't necessarily believe that he was able to concoct love potions.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 If the love potion was so powerful, it would make a boulder fall in love with you.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 The boulder grows giant cartoony eyelashes and big pink lips.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 It's trying to kiss you.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 If you gave that to a human, she would have been just as obsessed.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Like, you want a girl to be into you, but at a certain point, you're like,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 "Uh, I gotta do my own thing. How magic spells the cast, babe?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 I want you, I want you, I want you."

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Nobody wants that level of devotion.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 So you probably put a little too much power in it anyways,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 but it doesn't matter.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 He got his revenge, he cursed the fort for everybody to die,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 and I actually forgot this part of the story.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 This is a separate story.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 When they went to build the fort, there was an old wizard, a different wizard.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Apparently there's just a bunch of wizards in this area.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 There was another wizard, and they came to build this fort, and the people go,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 "Hey, we know you're like a powerful wizard and all that stuff,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 but we're gonna build the fort nearby."

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 You know, just 'cause.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And the wizard goes, "That's fine, I'll allow you to build the fort,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 but none of your buildings can be taller than my house."

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 And for whatever reason, the fort people were nice enough to ask him permission.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 They obviously knew this guy was powerful enough that they should get his permission.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 But then they're like, "Whatever, we're just gonna build it as big as we want."

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 So they built a giant anyways.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 He said you can build it, just don't make it taller than my house,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 'cause he didn't want any shadows on his house.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 So he cursed it.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Now, there's a lot of curses going around in the story.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 The one guy, he gets crushed by a rock, and he curses it

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 so everyone's going to get slaughtered.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 10,000 people, remember?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Everyone's gonna get slaughtered in this thing, and it came true.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 This first wizard must have just been having an off day,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 'cause he goes, "If you build this fort bigger than my house,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 a horrible curse will befall you."

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 The curse is, "There's no roofs."

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Roofs are constantly collapsing, so...

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 I mean, the other guy did get 10,000 people killed.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 You just made it so shoddy engineering happens.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 Supposedly, I kept coming across this, and it may be true,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 but supposedly the Archaeological Survey of India,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 they're in charge of this, it still exists, it's a monument.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 You can go on tours.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Only during the day, the Archaeological Survey has banned anyone from visiting it at night,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 'cause they said there's too many ghosts.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 They said it's too spooky, that's what it actually says in the government handbook.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Too spooky, you can't go out there at night.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 There's a bunch of... there's like 10,000 ghosts,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 there might still be some love potion floating around.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 You might accidentally see a rock, and you're like,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 "Ooh, I'm gonna take a nap against this rock,"

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 and then like, you get it on your back.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 You get a little bit of love potion, it goes through your shirt,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 and the next thing you see is a member of the Archaeological Survey of India walk by,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 and you're like, "Vaboo!"

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 You're chasing them around all comically.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 They don't want that happening.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 So that is our first stop on our ghost Indian tour.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Let's just move over. Let's let Timothy back in that Carbonarcopter.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 We're gonna take turns.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 We're headed out to the Lambi Dehar Mines in Masori.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 The Lambi Dehar Mines of Masori's, what this is known as.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Helicopter, we're leaving behind the fort.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 We're leaving behind that super cute boulder.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Checking it out.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 It's all super shapely.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Looks like one of those fertility statues.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Jason, quit staring at the boulder.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Give us directions.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 We're headed out to the Lambi Dehar Mines.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 The Radden District of Yatarkhand.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 So in this mine, this is giant mining system.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 We're back in time. There's just a bunch of miners.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 The job, not the age group.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 Knocking down rocks and stuff like that.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Making holes in mountains.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 So when I'm saying back in time, this is one of those stories that I thought was so weird.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Let me tell you this story, and then I'll tell you the time period that it takes place in.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 So what's weird about the story is, I don't know much about the working conditions of India,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 but if this story is any example of what it's like to work in a mine in India,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 oh my god, this is insane, because they're doing this mining operation, right?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 And it said that there has to be something wrong.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 There has to be something wrong with, there has to be multiple errors with this passage.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 So what's going on is they're working on this mine,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 and of course when you're doing any sort of mining, it has a high fatality rate.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 A lot of people die mining.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 In this particular mine, 50,000 people died.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 50,000 people died.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 You go Jason, you know, mines are, you just said mines are super dangerous,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 and you know, this mine's probably been in operation for a long time,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 and maybe not had the best working conditions.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 I don't know what the unions are like over in India, or if the unions even exist.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 50,000 people can die in mines in a given time period.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 I would agree with you if this story took place, like from the 1800s to today.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 50,000 people died in the 1990s.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 When we were listening to Ace of Base and watching TRL,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 50,000 people died mining in this place.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 Saved by the bell was still on the air, bro.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 50,000 people died, and I can't, what is going on over there?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 And the way that they died, 50,000 people died, you figure,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 okay, maybe 100 fall down a shaft, a thousand, you know, just get lost in there.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Most of these people died, almost all of them died from choking on their own blood.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 Okay, like I get it, people build bridges, people fall into the concrete as it's being poured,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 like that great song of the highwaymen.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 That's where I get all my tragedies from, is country music songs.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 I did this story recently by the Husak Tunnel, people are getting blown up doing that.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 50,000 people died, most of them from vomiting blood.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Who was like, "Ugh, what time is it? Oh man, I'm running late, better get to the choking blood mine."

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Hopefully I'm not one of those guys who chokes on his own blood today.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 No, Surrey, nobody knows what's causing it.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 You go there, they give you all the protective gear possible.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Will this help? I don't know, we don't know what's causing people to choke on their own blood.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And honestly, I don't think they were handing out protective gear if 50,000 people died in the 1990s.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Anyways, these choking blood mines, that's where these people worked.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 If 50,000 people died, I can only imagine there would have to be what, a million people working there?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 I hope it wasn't, they had a labor force of 55,000 people, and they're like, "Well, there's 5,000 of you left, good job."

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 "Good thing you guys didn't choke on your own blood."

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 "I'll see you guys at the next mine."

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 You're like, "What, next mine? Apparently made it out of this one."

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 People don't like to go to these mines. I wouldn't, right?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 I don't think you'll ever see the ghost hunters go out there.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 They're like, "Yeah, before we can go in here with our ghost equipment, what exactly caused everyone to choke on their own blood?"

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 The foreman's like, "I don't know, he never could."

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Blood's pouring out of his mouth.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 I think ghost hunters, I think Zach Baggins is a little more intelligent,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 then go to a place where blood is just pouring out of people's throats, but the people in town don't go there.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 They don't go there at all.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Why not? Why do you ask?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Other than the fact that 50,000 humans died here, while Amy Grant still had a number one album.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Here's this quote of why they don't travel there.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 "Locals refuse to venture close to the mines after sunset, as they believe that the place is held by a witch,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 whose blood-curdling shrieks could be heard in the deathly silence of night."

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 Oh yeah, dude, thousands of people dying, the serious blood-coughing disease, yeah, whatever.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 Witch? What?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Do you hear a spooky noise in the distance?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Oh no, a witch is screaming, I better go hide in this cave.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 I think the reason why you wouldn't go there wouldn't be the witch.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 The witch noise, which is probably just a fox.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Don't go there because 50,000 people died there.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Don't go there because while I was watching Terminator 2 at the movie theater,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 50,000 people were spilling blood out of their own throat into a cave floor.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 I don't care about the witch, I don't know if the mines are still in operation.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 I hope the mines still aren't in operation.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 I don't even know what they're mining, they're mining hebo-globin.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 The CEOs, like, a little do they know what we really want is that sweet, sweet plasma.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 They're throwing it up in a bucket.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 Anyways, Beatrice, Timothy, this time you guys are going to share control of the carbonic copter, each holding onto a joystick.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 It's going to make it super chaotic, but we are flying out to our last location we're visiting.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 We're flying out to Dow Hill, that's in Kursong in West Bengal.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Now I was getting most of this information from a website called OYO Travel Guide.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 This was an article entitled "Bone-Curtainling Adventures at India's Most Haunted Places."

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Actually, before we get into the last one, one of the places they listed was this bizarre story about this woman who said she was a princess

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 and the British government owed her a bunch of money and they took all of her stuff and the government was like,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 "We don't really think you're a princess, we just think you're kind of nuts, but we will give you this patch of land called Moucha Mahal."

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 So she went there, she was living with her kids.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 It was super gross, it was this rundown hunting lodge.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 And she is so disgusted with her living situation, she used to be a princess.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And again, people are saying historically she actually wasn't a princess, but she felt she was owed more than this,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 so she decides to kill herself.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Her two young kids are still there, she decides to kill herself by swallowing diamond dust.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 I mean, I'm not, I am totally anti-suicide, but if you gotta go, if you can swallow enough diamond dust to take you off the mortal plane,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 that's baller, dude.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 That's something that I think Rick Ross would want to do.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 That is straight up like a baller move.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 But, I mean, she leaves her two kids there and they're like, "No, no, our fortune!"

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Swallows all this diamond dust.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 That is actually, first off, that's a great name for a band.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Secondly, if I knew someone who killed himself on diamond dust, I'd be like, "That's unfortunate!"

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 But I'm cutting that stomach open, dude, we're getting some of that diamond dust.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Apparently she did have some money set aside, and then I had this great quote.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 I don't even know why I said we're going to the next location, because I wanted to include this one.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Here's this quote about the, so the kids are living on, here's this quote.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 "The eerie story of how these two humans," referring to the kids.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 "The eerie story of how these two humans have survived here for so long,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 in a place that does not have any electricity, water supply, and is surrounded by trees and a forest is chilling.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 They wear only black robes.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 And the brother sometimes goes out on his bicycle to buy food and supplies."

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 They kind of lose the mysterious quality, right?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Like, if there's a bunch of hermets living in the woods, "Uhhh..."

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 And you, like, walk by the house late at night, and like, you might see like a candlelight moving through the house of no electricity.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 And the next day, you see a guy in a black robe getting a slurpee.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 "Hey, Jason, how's it going?"

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 "Oh yeah, the hermit life's really good. Super spooky. I saw you walk by, huh? I had that candle."

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 "Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh?"

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 "Oh, the slurpee's so good."

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 "Yeah, yeah, and I'm going to get some beef jerky for my sister, and then I'm going to ride on my bike, wearing a hooded black cloak."

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 How's that, how's that part even possible?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 You know he took the cloak off.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 You know, like, when he's hanging at home with his sister, he's like, "Oh, yes, we are servants of darkness."

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 "I need to go and get some more refreshments." Then he leaves, puts his cloak and his backpack.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 He's all dressed up snazzy as a tank top on underneath, driving through town, playing video games in the arcade, and then comes back.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 He's like, "Ahhh, sister, you won't believe the madness outside."

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 But anyways, so yeah, I just thought it was a funny visual. It doesn't everything do with ghosts.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Those two kids are dead now, too.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 I should say they did grow up to become adults, and they're dead.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 But that story was real. That story is actually documented.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Let's, again, we're turning the carbonicopter back around. You guys are both in control of it.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 We're headed to Dahl Hill. That's in Kursong, West Bengal.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 We're going to wrap it up like this. This quote just speaks for itself.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Remember, this is from that OYO travel guide, that article, "Bone, Kirtling Adventures in India's Most Haunted Places."

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 The Victoria-- so this is a private school area.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 The Victoria Boys High School in Dahl Hill Girls' Boarding School in Kursong, Darjeeling, are believed to be the residence of many spirits whose footsteps can be heard echoing through the hallways.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 There have been countless murdered bodies found in the woods surrounding the schools, and several locals and tourists report being followed by a headless boy who then disappears into the woods.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 That's classic ghost story stuff. We don't have 50,000 people coming down with a mysterious disease.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 We don't have rocks that fall in love with humans, or suicide via diamond dust.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 We have this great story. We have countless murdered bodies in the woods surrounding the school, and people being haunted by a headless boy who disappears into the woods.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 That's what we're here for, India. Thank you so much.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Right underneath this story on that OYO travel website, there's a button.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 "Find best hotels in Darjeeling."

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 I don't want to go to a hotel there, bro. You basically made it, so I never want to go to a hotel there.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Who reads that? I mean, literally, there's a button right underneath that paragraph.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Who's reading that and goes, "Honey, you know how we always talk about seeing a headless boy? I found a place. Countless bodies, count me in. I can't wait to go."

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 This is going to be so awesome. Who went madman?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 First off, they should have a tag.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 So any hotel that gets a reservation from that particular button, they put that person in a room far away from everyone else.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 If anyone read that passage and then tries to book a hotel in that area, they need to be completely segregated from society.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Absolutely terrifying.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 India is one of the oldest cultures on the planet. I was actually surprised. There weren't many ghost stories.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 I went through about three or four top ten most haunted places in India lists. A lot of them were repeated.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 These were the four most intriguing ones, and the one with the woman eating all the diamond dust.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 You can even have a ghost in it, which is kind of a weird location of visit. You can still see that hunting lodge.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 I was actually surprised that there weren't more ghost stories.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 A lot of the hauntings could be happening out in the wilderness.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 It may not be an issue where you have a haunted house in the middle of town that everyone knows about,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 but it could be the hunting lodge, or the clearing in the woods, or the rugged mountain path.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Because in a culture that old, everything has been tinged with memories.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Everything should be carrying some sort of resonance.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 One of the reasons why we don't get a ton of ghost stories out of India is because a lot of people don't survive them.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 I had that story a long time ago, and it's one of the ones that I think about from time to time.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 We're close to 500 episodes on this show, and it's a story that pops up in my head all the time.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 There's about the two friends who were watching The Conjuring 2, and one of them just died.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 One of them died in the movie theater, and then the friend was driving him to the hospital in an auto rickshaw,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 and they've never been seen since. The rickshaw's gone, the body's gone, the guy driving the rickshaw completely disappeared.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Think about it, we're almost at 500 episodes, and all the stories I've told, there are a few stories that stick with me.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 That's one of them. I think that we may not have a huge variety of ghost stories in India.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 The country's so huge, the country's so old, that I think it would be much easier to go missing in that country,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 to be walking down that rugged path, be whistling as you're hiking through that forest,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 to walk into that house at the very, very edge of town and simply go missing.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Your loved ones would look for you, of course, but would they ever find you?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 These are the ghost stories we hear of, because these are the ghost stories that people come back from, and are able to tell us,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 "Oh, I was out there, I saw a witch," as they wipe blood away from their mouth.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 "Where'd you get that coffee at?" "Oh, no big deal."

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 The one with park services and tour guides and all that stuff.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 But the true hauntings, the terrifying hauntings, are the ones you don't come back from.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 And if you don't survive the encounter to tell the story, it never will end up on a top 10 list.
