 When a gay man is found dead at the bottom of a cliff,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 it's real to suicide.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 When 88 gay men are found dead at the bottom of cliffs,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 the police finally open an investigation.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And then we take a whirlwind tour of India

18

 to look at some of their amazing haunted places.

 Hey, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 I hope you guys are going to have an awesome weekend.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporters.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 It's the fabulous Levas, Timothy Leva and Beatrice Leva.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Beatrice, you may remember.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 She's the one who broke the news about Forrest Finn's treasure being found,

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 and she sent us the 2028 man story.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Really, really appreciate that.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Both her whole family's fans of the show. It's totally awesome.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine, too.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Just go ahead and get the word out about the show.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 That really, really helps out a lot.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 So, Timothy, let me touch the keys of the carpenter copter.

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Catch him in the ignition.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Do helicopters even have keys now that I think about it?

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I think you just press buttons.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Timothy, take us up in that beautiful carpenter copter.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We're headed out to Australia.

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 [Copter whimpers]

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 We're flying. We're cutting lines right over the beautiful Pacific Ocean.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 This first story's a little dark.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So, sorry about that, Timothy. Sorry that you're flying us today.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 We're going to do a lot of traveling, so you'll be able to go to other places.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 The beach risks are going to take turns, but we're flying over the Pacific Ocean.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 We're headed out to Australia.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 We're specifically headed to Bluefish Point.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 That's in North Head, Australia.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 It's December 10th, 1988.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 There's a man named Scott Johnson.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 He's 27 years old.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 He's a gay man.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 He moved from America to live in Australia with his lover.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 But when his naked body's found at the bottom of a cliff--

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I can't, I told you this story is going to be dark--

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 when his naked body's found at the bottom of a cliff,

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 it's ruled as a suicide.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Now, his brother-- this is one of those things that just happens to be serendipitous.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 His brother was extremely wealthy, powerful man.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 His brother's name is Steve Johnson.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 He's a tech entrepreneur.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 He's the one who actually commercialized the first algorithm to send photographs online.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 So, he ended up selling that to AOL and got a job.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 He was like an executive with AOL after that.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Very, very powerful rich man.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So, when his brother commits suicide, he doesn't really buy it.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 He doesn't really like-- it doesn't really make sense to him.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 What happens is, his brother's lover who's still in Australia one day calls up Steve.

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 He says, "Hey, there was another gay guy who was found at the bottom of this cliff."

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And police are starting to think that maybe your brother didn't kill himself.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 They're going to start investigating this a little closer.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 But, at the call-- he got that call in 2005-- his brother died in 1988.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So, it was a long span of time where Steve had to deal with this idea that his brother killed himself.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Steve Johnson begins to use his contacts and his wealth,

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 and he sends a team of private investigators down there.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Because at first off, you think it's just a one-off thing, an unfortunate one-off thing.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 He didn't sit right with them, though.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 He sends a team of investigators down there.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 They begin working with local law enforcement.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 They begin to put these together.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So, first you had Steve-- that was ruled as a suicide.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 The police opened this thing, it was called Operation Parabell.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 From 1976 to about the year 2000, the police were able to find 88 gay men

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 who had jumped off the-- quote-unquote jumped off these cliffs over that round 30-year period.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 88.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 They had all been considered suicides or accidents.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 One of the key details, the coroner kept going, it was a suicide, it was a suicide, it was a suicide.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 After about 20 years of the coroner saying this, someone brought up to the coroner,

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 "Yeah, you know that's where a lot of gay people go to like hook up?"

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 The coroner is like, "What?"

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's like a known area where gay men will go to hook up."

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And the coroner said, "Had I known that back then, when I first started looking at these bodies?"

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It wouldn't have been so quick to say suicide, because if a location is going to attract gay men to have hook up sex,

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 it's also going to attract people who hate gay people.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So the coroner goes, "I kind of wish I had known that ahead of time."

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 What they find out, they've now ruled 27 of those 88 as homicides.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 They believe that 27 of those 88 deaths were homicides, were murdered.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And just recently, this is how I came across this story.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 In May 20th, 2020, police knock on Scott White's door.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 He's a 49-year-old man.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 The guy opens the door and he looks at the cops and he goes, "Yeah, I knew you were coming."

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 This guy, Scott White, was at that area with Scott Johnson.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 December 10th, 1988, Scott White was standing there with Scott Johnson.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And something happened that prompted Scott White to punch Scott Johnson and that man fell to his death off that cliff.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 He hasn't really admitted to saying why he did it.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 It's possible that he went there and was thinking about doing something and started to feel guilty.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 It's possible that he went there with the intent to murder him.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 We don't know. He hasn't admitted to any of that yet.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But he does, he was there. He did do it.

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 The motive is the question.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 The New South Wales police did end up issuing this statement recently.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 It said, "The New South Wales police acknowledges, without qualification, both its and society's acceptance of gay bashings and shocking violence directed at gay men and the LGBT community between 1976 and the year 2000."

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 There's just something that, you know, a couple guys get rowdy.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 They beat up a gay dude.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 The police might investigate it.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 88 people falling off cliffs from 1976 to 2000.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 That's when you start to look at possible conspiracy, a possible cover-up.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 One, two, you know, that could be a coincidence.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 One's not even a coincidence. It's just a tragic thing.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 But 88, 27 of them have been considered murderous.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 They don't think that the Scott White guy killed the other 26.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 They think it was other groups of people pushing them off the cliff.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Horrifying, horrifying story.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And for the longest time, no one was even investigating it.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Timothy, get us out of here with this carpenter copter.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Disturbing story.

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 I actually debated whether or not it would be a good Friday story.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Does it something -- I tend to have more -- I like to have more uplifting stuff on Fridays, but I think it's an important story.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And I think it does have the happiest ending we can have.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 We have justice being served.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 We have a man's name being cleared that he didn't commit suicide.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And you have a brother realizing that his -- the justice for his brother was found.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So it's as good as an ending as we could hope for in this type of situation.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Timothy, let's take us up in that carpenter copter.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And while we are in midair, we're going to figure out some way to do this.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 We're going to move around.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Okay, I'm going to hold the steering wheel.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Beatrice, you are going to take Timothy's place.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 He has to sit in the back now.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Fly us on out in this beautiful carpenter copter.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 We're headed out to India.

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 We're flying.

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 We are actually going to do a lot of stops this episode.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 First off, Beatrice, fly us over to Bandgad Fort.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 We're flying over this giant fort.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It was built in 1573, so we're actually going to a little bit around that time period.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Hit that button right there or going back in time.

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 We're now flying over this giant earthworks fort.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Massive fortress.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 10,000 people live inside of it.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 We're in the Alwar district in the Rajasthan state of India.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And now we're going to land.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 We're going to walk around.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 We'll walk up to the front gate.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Hey, let us in.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And that's a magic word.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 That's the password to get in.

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Whether that was the gate opening up, not a constipated old man.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 We walk into the gate.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 It's old timey.

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It's like in the 1500s and everyone's like walking around doing their stuff.

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 But in the middle of town is the most beautiful woman around.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It's Ratnavati.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Ratnavati, she's the princess of Bangra.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So Ratnavati is walking around and all the men are like wanting to marry her.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Quote unquote, marry her.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 We know what they really want to do.

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 But she has not taken a suitor yet.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And the men are like, oh, I can't wait to high shifts from side to side to marry her.

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 But she's super beautiful.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Everyone wants her.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Most importantly though, in the background is this old man named Singhaya.

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And he's like, ha ha ha, she is the one I must possess.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Imagine Gaston, but disgusting looking.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Actually imagine Gaston, but he's the beast.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And he's also a super powerful wizard.

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And he's not the beast where he has a lovable heart.

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 He can actually have a lovable heart.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Wasn't he like a vein jerk?

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And then he turned into a monster and then someone stabbed him in the back.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And he goes, oh, maybe I shouldn't be such a horrible person.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Did he really change that much?

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Like thinking about that story, he didn't really come around.

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 He basically was just like, oh no, I'm about to become a monster.

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 She fell in love with him.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 But I don't think they never showed him like being nice to the cup, right?

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 He wasn't like, oh, I'm not going to make you dance for my own enjoyment.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I'm not going to eat food out of you anymore, Mrs. Boll.

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 He's basically a monstrous man inside and out.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And he's a super powerful wizard.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 But he wants Rat Navati so bad that he watches her go into this perfume store all the time.

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And he knows what her favorite perfume is.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And he's like, disguised, he's basically disguised as a perfume bottle in the corner.

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 A wizard sized perfume bottle.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 He realizes, hmm, that's her favorite perfume.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 What if I added a love potion to it?

203
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And then stands right next to her, she'll love me forever.

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Here's a tip.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I'm not an evil doer or anything like that.

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 But don't announce your plans where your victim can hear it.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Ha ha!

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 If only this bank knew I was going to rob it at 2.45 p.m.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Yes, I would like to withdraw $100, please.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Yeah, you don't do that, right?

211
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Because he must have done it relatively in her ear shop because she knows of the planet.

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 So he goes and he creates a love concoction.

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 He puts it in a bottle.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 He makes it look like the bottle of the perfume she loves and she walks up to it one day.

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And he's sitting there, oh yes, here she comes.

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Soon she'll be mine.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And she picks up the perfume that has a love potion in it.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And she knows if she sprays it on her, she'll fall in love with this horrible magician.

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 She does really, it's quick thinking, right?

220
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I guess the quick thinking is just don't even engage with the bottle.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Because what if it accidentally had a crack in her or something like that.

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 But anyways, she picks the bottle up and she smashes it against the boulder.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And the wizard's like, "No, you figured out my plan.

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I'll just have to try another love spell."

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Wait, no, no.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And he looks and the boulder is moving towards him.

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 [Bullet noises]

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And he's like, "No, the boulder can't love.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 It has no soul."

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And the boulder starts chasing the wizard through the street.

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Because the boulder is madly in love with him.

232
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Eventually the boulder crushes the wizard all over the city streets.

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And then just lays on top of him.

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And he's underneath the boulder and he goes, "Uh, that was a pretty good trick.

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 It was a pretty good trick, but now everyone in this city will."

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Everyone's like, "Well, golly, I wonder what he cursed us with.

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I wonder what that evil wizard cursed us with.

238
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Everyone in the city is going to get rich and powerful.

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Woohoo, I'm not moving."

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Well, no, that's not what was the curse.

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 He cursed everyone to die in the city.

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And sure enough, according to the legend,

243
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 sometimes a couple days later, sometimes up to a year later,

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 the city was laid siege by a rival army

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 and slaughtered everyone in the city, including the princess.

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Nobody survived.

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 So apparently the battle is historical.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 The question is, how much of the other stuff is historical?

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 The princess might have actually been around.

250
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 There could have been a wizard walking around,

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 but I don't necessarily believe that he was able to concoct love potions.

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 If the love potion was so powerful, it would make a boulder fall in love with you.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 The boulder grows giant cartoony eyelashes and big pink lips.

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 It's trying to kiss you.

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 If you gave that to a human, she would have been just as obsessed.

256
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Like, you want a girl to be into you, but at a certain point, you're like,

257
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 "Uh, I gotta do my own thing. How magic spells the cast, babe?

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I want you, I want you, I want you."

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Nobody wants that level of devotion.

260
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 So you probably put a little too much power in it anyways,

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 but it doesn't matter.

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 He got his revenge, he cursed the fort for everybody to die,

263
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 and I actually forgot this part of the story.

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 This is a separate story.

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 When they went to build the fort, there was an old wizard, a different wizard.

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Apparently there's just a bunch of wizards in this area.

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 There was another wizard, and they came to build this fort, and the people go,

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 "Hey, we know you're like a powerful wizard and all that stuff,

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 but we're gonna build the fort nearby."

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 You know, just 'cause.

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And the wizard goes, "That's fine, I'll allow you to build the fort,

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 but none of your buildings can be taller than my house."

273
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 And for whatever reason, the fort people were nice enough to ask him permission.

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 They obviously knew this guy was powerful enough that they should get his permission.

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 But then they're like, "Whatever, we're just gonna build it as big as we want."

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 So they built a giant anyways.

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He said you can build it, just don't make it taller than my house,

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 'cause he didn't want any shadows on his house.

279
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 So he cursed it.

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Now, there's a lot of curses going around in the story.

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 The one guy, he gets crushed by a rock, and he curses it

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 so everyone's going to get slaughtered.

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 10,000 people, remember?

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Everyone's gonna get slaughtered in this thing, and it came true.

285
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 This first wizard must have just been having an off day,

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 'cause he goes, "If you build this fort bigger than my house,

287
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 a horrible curse will befall you."

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 The curse is, "There's no roofs."

289
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Roofs are constantly collapsing, so...

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I mean, the other guy did get 10,000 people killed.

291
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 You just made it so shoddy engineering happens.

292
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Supposedly, I kept coming across this, and it may be true,

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 but supposedly the Archaeological Survey of India,

294
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 they're in charge of this, it still exists, it's a monument.

295
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 You can go on tours.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Only during the day, the Archaeological Survey has banned anyone from visiting it at night,

297
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 'cause they said there's too many ghosts.

298
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 They said it's too spooky, that's what it actually says in the government handbook.

299
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Too spooky, you can't go out there at night.

300
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 There's a bunch of... there's like 10,000 ghosts,

301
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 there might still be some love potion floating around.

302
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 You might accidentally see a rock, and you're like,

303
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 "Ooh, I'm gonna take a nap against this rock,"

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 and then like, you get it on your back.

305
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 You get a little bit of love potion, it goes through your shirt,

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 and the next thing you see is a member of the Archaeological Survey of India walk by,

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 and you're like, "Vaboo!"

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 You're chasing them around all comically.

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 They don't want that happening.

310
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So that is our first stop on our ghost Indian tour.

311
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Let's just move over. Let's let Timothy back in that Carbonarcopter.

312
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 We're gonna take turns.

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 We're headed out to the Lambi Dehar Mines in Masori.

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 The Lambi Dehar Mines of Masori's, what this is known as.

315
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Helicopter, we're leaving behind the fort.

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 We're leaving behind that super cute boulder.

317
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Checking it out.

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 It's all super shapely.

319
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Looks like one of those fertility statues.

320
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Jason, quit staring at the boulder.

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Give us directions.

322
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 We're headed out to the Lambi Dehar Mines.

323
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 The Radden District of Yatarkhand.

324
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So in this mine, this is giant mining system.

325
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 We're back in time. There's just a bunch of miners.

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 The job, not the age group.

327
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Knocking down rocks and stuff like that.

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Making holes in mountains.

329
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 So when I'm saying back in time, this is one of those stories that I thought was so weird.

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Let me tell you this story, and then I'll tell you the time period that it takes place in.

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 So what's weird about the story is, I don't know much about the working conditions of India,

332
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 but if this story is any example of what it's like to work in a mine in India,

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 oh my god, this is insane, because they're doing this mining operation, right?

334
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And it said that there has to be something wrong.

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 There has to be something wrong with, there has to be multiple errors with this passage.

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 So what's going on is they're working on this mine,

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 and of course when you're doing any sort of mining, it has a high fatality rate.

338
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 A lot of people die mining.

339
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 In this particular mine, 50,000 people died.

340
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 50,000 people died.

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 You go Jason, you know, mines are, you just said mines are super dangerous,

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 and you know, this mine's probably been in operation for a long time,

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 and maybe not had the best working conditions.

344
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I don't know what the unions are like over in India, or if the unions even exist.

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 50,000 people can die in mines in a given time period.

346
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I would agree with you if this story took place, like from the 1800s to today.

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 50,000 people died in the 1990s.

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 When we were listening to Ace of Base and watching TRL,

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 50,000 people died mining in this place.

350
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Saved by the bell was still on the air, bro.

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 50,000 people died, and I can't, what is going on over there?

352
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And the way that they died, 50,000 people died, you figure,

353
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 okay, maybe 100 fall down a shaft, a thousand, you know, just get lost in there.

354
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Most of these people died, almost all of them died from choking on their own blood.

355
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Okay, like I get it, people build bridges, people fall into the concrete as it's being poured,

356
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 like that great song of the highwaymen.

357
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 That's where I get all my tragedies from, is country music songs.

358
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I did this story recently by the Husak Tunnel, people are getting blown up doing that.

359
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 50,000 people died, most of them from vomiting blood.

360
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Who was like, "Ugh, what time is it? Oh man, I'm running late, better get to the choking blood mine."

361
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Hopefully I'm not one of those guys who chokes on his own blood today.

362
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 No, Surrey, nobody knows what's causing it.

363
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 You go there, they give you all the protective gear possible.

364
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Will this help? I don't know, we don't know what's causing people to choke on their own blood.

365
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And honestly, I don't think they were handing out protective gear if 50,000 people died in the 1990s.

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Anyways, these choking blood mines, that's where these people worked.

367
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 If 50,000 people died, I can only imagine there would have to be what, a million people working there?

368
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I hope it wasn't, they had a labor force of 55,000 people, and they're like, "Well, there's 5,000 of you left, good job."

369
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 "Good thing you guys didn't choke on your own blood."

370
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 "I'll see you guys at the next mine."

371
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You're like, "What, next mine? Apparently made it out of this one."

372
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 People don't like to go to these mines. I wouldn't, right?

373
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 I don't think you'll ever see the ghost hunters go out there.

374
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 They're like, "Yeah, before we can go in here with our ghost equipment, what exactly caused everyone to choke on their own blood?"

375
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 The foreman's like, "I don't know, he never could."

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Blood's pouring out of his mouth.

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I think ghost hunters, I think Zach Baggins is a little more intelligent,

378
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 then go to a place where blood is just pouring out of people's throats, but the people in town don't go there.

379
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 They don't go there at all.

380
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Why not? Why do you ask?

381
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Other than the fact that 50,000 humans died here, while Amy Grant still had a number one album.

382
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Here's this quote of why they don't travel there.

383
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 "Locals refuse to venture close to the mines after sunset, as they believe that the place is held by a witch,

384
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 whose blood-curdling shrieks could be heard in the deathly silence of night."

385
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Oh yeah, dude, thousands of people dying, the serious blood-coughing disease, yeah, whatever.

386
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Witch? What?

387
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Do you hear a spooky noise in the distance?

388
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Oh no, a witch is screaming, I better go hide in this cave.

389
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I think the reason why you wouldn't go there wouldn't be the witch.

390
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 The witch noise, which is probably just a fox.

391
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Don't go there because 50,000 people died there.

392
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Don't go there because while I was watching Terminator 2 at the movie theater,

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 50,000 people were spilling blood out of their own throat into a cave floor.

394
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I don't care about the witch, I don't know if the mines are still in operation.

395
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 I hope the mines still aren't in operation.

396
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 I don't even know what they're mining, they're mining hebo-globin.

397
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 The CEOs, like, a little do they know what we really want is that sweet, sweet plasma.

398
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 They're throwing it up in a bucket.

399
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Anyways, Beatrice, Timothy, this time you guys are going to share control of the carbonic copter, each holding onto a joystick.

400
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's going to make it super chaotic, but we are flying out to our last location we're visiting.

401
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 We're flying out to Dow Hill, that's in Kursong in West Bengal.

402
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Now I was getting most of this information from a website called OYO Travel Guide.

403
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 This was an article entitled "Bone-Curtainling Adventures at India's Most Haunted Places."

404
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Actually, before we get into the last one, one of the places they listed was this bizarre story about this woman who said she was a princess

405
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 and the British government owed her a bunch of money and they took all of her stuff and the government was like,

406
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 "We don't really think you're a princess, we just think you're kind of nuts, but we will give you this patch of land called Moucha Mahal."

407
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 So she went there, she was living with her kids.

408
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It was super gross, it was this rundown hunting lodge.

409
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And she is so disgusted with her living situation, she used to be a princess.

410
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 And again, people are saying historically she actually wasn't a princess, but she felt she was owed more than this,

411
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 so she decides to kill herself.

412
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Her two young kids are still there, she decides to kill herself by swallowing diamond dust.

413
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 I mean, I'm not, I am totally anti-suicide, but if you gotta go, if you can swallow enough diamond dust to take you off the mortal plane,

414
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 that's baller, dude.

415
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 That's something that I think Rick Ross would want to do.

416
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 That is straight up like a baller move.

417
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 But, I mean, she leaves her two kids there and they're like, "No, no, our fortune!"

418
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Swallows all this diamond dust.

419
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 That is actually, first off, that's a great name for a band.

420
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Secondly, if I knew someone who killed himself on diamond dust, I'd be like, "That's unfortunate!"

421
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 But I'm cutting that stomach open, dude, we're getting some of that diamond dust.

422
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Apparently she did have some money set aside, and then I had this great quote.

423
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 I don't even know why I said we're going to the next location, because I wanted to include this one.

424
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Here's this quote about the, so the kids are living on, here's this quote.

425
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 "The eerie story of how these two humans," referring to the kids.

426
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 "The eerie story of how these two humans have survived here for so long,

427
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 in a place that does not have any electricity, water supply, and is surrounded by trees and a forest is chilling.

428
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 They wear only black robes.

429
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And the brother sometimes goes out on his bicycle to buy food and supplies."

430
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 They kind of lose the mysterious quality, right?

431
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Like, if there's a bunch of hermets living in the woods, "Uhhh..."

432
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And you, like, walk by the house late at night, and like, you might see like a candlelight moving through the house of no electricity.

433
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And the next day, you see a guy in a black robe getting a slurpee.

434
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 "Hey, Jason, how's it going?"

435
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 "Oh yeah, the hermit life's really good. Super spooky. I saw you walk by, huh? I had that candle."

436
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 "Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh?"

437
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 "Oh, the slurpee's so good."

438
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 "Yeah, yeah, and I'm going to get some beef jerky for my sister, and then I'm going to ride on my bike, wearing a hooded black cloak."

439
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 How's that, how's that part even possible?

440
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 You know he took the cloak off.

441
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 You know, like, when he's hanging at home with his sister, he's like, "Oh, yes, we are servants of darkness."

442
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 "I need to go and get some more refreshments." Then he leaves, puts his cloak and his backpack.

443
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 He's all dressed up snazzy as a tank top on underneath, driving through town, playing video games in the arcade, and then comes back.

444
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 He's like, "Ahhh, sister, you won't believe the madness outside."

445
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 But anyways, so yeah, I just thought it was a funny visual. It doesn't everything do with ghosts.

446
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Those two kids are dead now, too.

447
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I should say they did grow up to become adults, and they're dead.

448
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 But that story was real. That story is actually documented.

449
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Let's, again, we're turning the carbonicopter back around. You guys are both in control of it.

450
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 We're headed to Dahl Hill. That's in Kursong, West Bengal.

451
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 We're going to wrap it up like this. This quote just speaks for itself.

452
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Remember, this is from that OYO travel guide, that article, "Bone, Kirtling Adventures in India's Most Haunted Places."

453
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 The Victoria-- so this is a private school area.

454
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 The Victoria Boys High School in Dahl Hill Girls' Boarding School in Kursong, Darjeeling, are believed to be the residence of many spirits whose footsteps can be heard echoing through the hallways.

455
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 There have been countless murdered bodies found in the woods surrounding the schools, and several locals and tourists report being followed by a headless boy who then disappears into the woods.

456
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 That's classic ghost story stuff. We don't have 50,000 people coming down with a mysterious disease.

457
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 We don't have rocks that fall in love with humans, or suicide via diamond dust.

458
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 We have this great story. We have countless murdered bodies in the woods surrounding the school, and people being haunted by a headless boy who disappears into the woods.

459
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 That's what we're here for, India. Thank you so much.

460
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Right underneath this story on that OYO travel website, there's a button.

461
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 "Find best hotels in Darjeeling."

462
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 I don't want to go to a hotel there, bro. You basically made it, so I never want to go to a hotel there.

463
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Who reads that? I mean, literally, there's a button right underneath that paragraph.

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Who's reading that and goes, "Honey, you know how we always talk about seeing a headless boy? I found a place. Countless bodies, count me in. I can't wait to go."

465
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 This is going to be so awesome. Who went madman?

466
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 First off, they should have a tag.

467
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 So any hotel that gets a reservation from that particular button, they put that person in a room far away from everyone else.

468
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 If anyone read that passage and then tries to book a hotel in that area, they need to be completely segregated from society.

469
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Absolutely terrifying.

470
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 India is one of the oldest cultures on the planet. I was actually surprised. There weren't many ghost stories.

471
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 I went through about three or four top ten most haunted places in India lists. A lot of them were repeated.

472
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 These were the four most intriguing ones, and the one with the woman eating all the diamond dust.

473
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 You can even have a ghost in it, which is kind of a weird location of visit. You can still see that hunting lodge.

474
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I was actually surprised that there weren't more ghost stories.

475
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 A lot of the hauntings could be happening out in the wilderness.

476
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 It may not be an issue where you have a haunted house in the middle of town that everyone knows about,

477
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 but it could be the hunting lodge, or the clearing in the woods, or the rugged mountain path.

478
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Because in a culture that old, everything has been tinged with memories.

479
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Everything should be carrying some sort of resonance.

480
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 One of the reasons why we don't get a ton of ghost stories out of India is because a lot of people don't survive them.

481
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 I had that story a long time ago, and it's one of the ones that I think about from time to time.

482
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 We're close to 500 episodes on this show, and it's a story that pops up in my head all the time.

483
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 There's about the two friends who were watching The Conjuring 2, and one of them just died.

484
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 One of them died in the movie theater, and then the friend was driving him to the hospital in an auto rickshaw,

485
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 and they've never been seen since. The rickshaw's gone, the body's gone, the guy driving the rickshaw completely disappeared.

486
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Think about it, we're almost at 500 episodes, and all the stories I've told, there are a few stories that stick with me.

487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 That's one of them. I think that we may not have a huge variety of ghost stories in India.

488
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 The country's so huge, the country's so old, that I think it would be much easier to go missing in that country,

489
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 to be walking down that rugged path, be whistling as you're hiking through that forest,

490
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 to walk into that house at the very, very edge of town and simply go missing.

491
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Your loved ones would look for you, of course, but would they ever find you?

492
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 These are the ghost stories we hear of, because these are the ghost stories that people come back from, and are able to tell us,

493
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 "Oh, I was out there, I saw a witch," as they wipe blood away from their mouth.

494
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 "Where'd you get that coffee at?" "Oh, no big deal."

495
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 The one with park services and tour guides and all that stuff.

496
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 But the true hauntings, the terrifying hauntings, are the ones you don't come back from.

497
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And if you don't survive the encounter to tell the story, it never will end up on a top 10 list.

498
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
