00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.760
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.360
 Somewhere out in the ocean,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.480
 a cruise ship moves slowly through the water,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.480
 unmanned, except for hundreds and hundreds of rats.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.920
 And then we travel to Black River Falls in Wisconsin.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.960
 Today it's a normal town, pleasant to the eye,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.840
 but for 20 years, at the turn of the 20th century,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.560
 rumors of satanic worship and demons

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.000
 led people to do unspeakable things.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.760
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.340
 (upbeat music)

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.120
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.280
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.120
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.560
 We got a lot of stuff to talk about,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.360
 so we're just gonna jump right in quick.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.180
 Okay, so let's go ahead and jump into the first story here.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.460
 So we are on a beach.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.360
 We're on a beach somewhere near your hometown.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.960
 Assuming you don't live in the desert,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.120
 you're like, oh man, I wish I had water near me.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.600
 We're at a beach.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.080
 We're standing there with binoculars

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.320
 looking out at the ocean.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.200
 And you're like, Jason, why are we looking at the ocean?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.120
 There's so many better things we could be doing.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.440
 And I'm like, well, there's a reason

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.640
 for you on this whole setup.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.840
 There's a reason for this.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 I throw my arm over your shoulder.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560
 I'm like, look out there.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.040
 I point out into the ocean.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.200
 I point out, I'm like, look over there, look over there.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.480
 And while you're looking over there,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.720
 I'm going to whisper in your ear the story

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.400
 of the MV "Louis Bove Orlova."

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.280
 Louis Bove Orlova.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.600
 You put the binoculars down, you're like,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.400
 you don't know how to pronounce any of this, do you?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.800
 And I was like, no, no, no, I don't, I don't.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.160
 But I know the story.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.680
 Put the binoculars back up

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.760
 and let's gaze back out of the ocean.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.600
 Seagulls.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.040
 (coyote howling)

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.240
 Flying by.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.400
 So the boat, we'll call it the Orlova

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.600
 'cause I know how to say that part at least.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.160
 So the Orlova was this big, giant cruise ship

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.800
 that was built to withstand like icebergs and stuff,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.040
 which is pretty good considering stuff

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040
 that's happened in the past.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.320
 It was made by the Russians and they said,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.440
 we're going to build this cruise ship

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.560
 and it's specifically to like take cruises around Antarctica.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.280
 So you could go, I don't know what there would be to see

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.160
 out there, you just go near Antarctica,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.760
 see a bunch of penguins and you leave.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.600
 And so it goes around Antarctica

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.760
 and so it had to be built like super sturdy,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.120
 more sturdy than like say a Carnival

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.560
 or like a Disney cruise ship.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.640
 I don't actually know if that's true.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.640
 I'm just assuming it's dirtier built

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.720
 'cause I don't think normal cruise ships can take an iceberg.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.520
 This one was built to go around Antarctica.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.320
 But it did end up running a ground on a place called,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.360
 I keep wanting to call it Decepticon Island,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.840
 which would be cool, but it went a ground

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.240
 on this island by Antarctica called Deception Island.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.680
 And it's actually called Deception Island

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.160
 'cause it's not an island, it is a volcano.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.520
 It's like a caldera.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.040
 So it's like you think it's an island

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.440
 and then you get on shore and you realize

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.520
 it's an active volcano too.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.560
 A bunch of nerds were there doing science stuff a while back.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.760
 They put up all their outposts, all those nerds

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.360
 with all their stuff on Deception Island.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.080
 And then there was a massive earthquake

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080
 and it destroyed all their research stations,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.000
 which is hilarious when even like nature

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.160
 is picking on nerds.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.120
 They're like, get out of here.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.520
 Now it's basically a tourist stop

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.880
 and I think the Swedes have something there.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.320
 But anyways, it ran a ground on Deception Island

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.640
 and that was kind of the start of its bad luck.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.240
 The Orlova though was able to get pulled off the island

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.720
 and started going around.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.280
 But by the year 2010 showed up,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.520
 all that stuff happened like in the early 2000s.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.280
 In the year 2010, the boat ends up sitting at St. John's,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.280
 which is in Newfoundland, Canada.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.240
 Through a series of mishaps and business deals

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.440
 falling through and stuff like that,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.360
 a bunch of money was owed on the boat

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.760
 and eventually the city of St. John,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.400
 it had been sitting there for two years,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.240
 was just sitting in the harbor.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.360
 So the city says we're just gonna sell the ship

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360
 'cause no one's ever gonna pay all these fees that are on it.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.720
 We're gonna sell the ship to someone else

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.660
 so they can take it out and they can scrap it.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.560
 We just want it out of our harbor.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.080
 Now boats have a rat problem.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.440
 There are certain things you can do

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.640
 to prevent rats from coming onto your boat,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.480
 but not for two years.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.080
 Like eventually rats, they're not the smartest thing,

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.240
 but they're also not the dumbest thing.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.920
 They eventually are gonna find a way to get on the boat.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.400
 It was a cruise ship and they were preparing to do a cruise.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.460
 So any amount of food on the ship and there would have been,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.880
 I'm not gonna say the thing had like a,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.720
 oh you can eat buffet,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.800
 but it did have food supplies on the ship.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.200
 Rats would become drawn to it

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.840
 and they would start eating it.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 And more importantly, banging each other

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.240
 and having rat babies.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.440
 So this rat infested ship is sitting at the harbor

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.280
 and finally they're like,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.720
 let's just pay someone to get rid of it.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.600
 So the rats are just hanging out,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.120
 they're wearing their little like tuxes and stuff

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.720
 and then you have the rats in steerage

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.060
 that are dressed in like rags

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.560
 and they're like, oh, wonderful,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.160
 fine true love in the upper decks.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.280
 And the boat starts getting pulled away from the harbor

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.280
 and they're like, ah.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.720
 And as a tugboat is pulling it away from the harbor,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.360
 the tow line breaks.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.080
 So now the cruise ship is just floating around by itself.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.040
 They had to hire another company to come out,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.360
 start towing it farther out to sea.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.280
 'Cause at this point it was like flowing around oil,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.560
 Derrick's, and they're like,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.800
 this thing's gonna cause a huge catastrophe.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.880
 It's an unmanned cruise ship just floating around Canada.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.440
 But the boat is headed towards,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.560
 I think Jamaica where they're gonna scrap it.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.540
 And what happened was the people who got hired to tow it,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.400
 they finally towed it far enough out to sea

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.000
 and they just said, let's just cut the line.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Just cut the line, dude.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.920
 We're not gonna take this thing all to Jamaica.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.560
 We'll just cut the line and it'll eventually sink.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.680
 So I don't think they actually had a guy out there

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.560
 with a knife cutting this rope,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.440
 but and the rats are watching, they're like,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.280
 no, don't cut the line, don't cut the line.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.240
 And the dude cuts the line and the boat starts kind of,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.740
 and then it just kind of starts sailing away.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.020
 Now what's funny is that they really shouldn't have done that.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.340
 They said it wasn't safe to take it all the way to Jamaica,

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.240
 but nobody knows where the boat went.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.620
 People thought that it was gonna end up in Ireland.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.840
 Some people thought it was gonna end up in Iceland,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.480
 but this cruise ship is just cruising around.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.920
 And the whole time in the pitch darkness of that ship,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.180
 just rats just crawling all over each other,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.000
 eating the food and just breeding and breeding

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.800
 and breeding, but what would happen

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.240
 is all the food would run out eventually.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.880
 Rats would start to check out each other.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.360
 That people in the steerage, like awfully yummy

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.400
 in the steerage people are like,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.640
 there's more fuss than there are of you, 99%,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.300
 90 and they would start eating each other,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.080
 which you eat a couple of rats and then you're like,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.800
 oh my belly's full, it's time to have sex

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.640
 and then you have more of your baby rats

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.120
 and then you start eating rats.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.160
 As of today, nobody knows what happened to the boat.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.000
 Some people say it's already sunk.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.400
 There was an alarm that went off,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.960
 this Irish station picked up an alarm

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.880
 that only goes off if the boat's taking on water.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.720
 People don't know.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.520
 Some people have said because the boat was built to withstand,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.920
 it was like basically an icebreaker cruise ship,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.800
 it would last quite a while.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.960
 There may be a cruise ship floating around out there,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.800
 full of rats, just clawing their way through the darkness

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.560
 'cause it would be pitch black.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.480
 They wouldn't even be able to see each other,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.720
 there would just be so many of them,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.600
 they would just crawl over each other,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.800
 they would know there was another rat there through scent

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.400
 or they would feel those little rat hands

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.920
 crawl across their back,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.880
 just sailing out there still in the ocean today.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.200
 A true ghost ship full of cannibal rats.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.600
 So the boat may still be out there

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.160
 and at any moment it may crash into a shoreline

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.200
 and spill out its bloated guts

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.120
 of nothing but big black rats all over the countryside.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.360
 Or the ship did sink,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.860
 but one dedicated rat was able to get off

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.680
 and he swam across the ocean,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.900
 eating fish the whole way, big old fish,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.360
 getting bigger and bigger

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.880
 until finally he sees a drainage pipe

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.280
 leading right into your sewer line.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.000
 And tonight you'll hear a

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.680
 as your closed toilet lid keeps getting pushed up

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.040
 a little bit at a time.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.760
 But you ignore the sound, you ignore it,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.760
 you go to bed and at night that big black rat

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.920
 finally lifts off the toilet seat cover

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.560
 and crawls out into your bathroom.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.360
 And then looks at the camera and goes,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.480
 (shushing)

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.440
 Story may continue in your bathroom tonight.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.800
 You know what's funny?

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.000
 I was looking, the story took place in Canada,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.880
 I have another story to take place in Canada

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.160
 and I thought I should try to do a Canada specific episode.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.320
 I go, I wonder what Canadian,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.840
 I wonder what Canadian cryptids I want.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.800
 Now I know about the wind to go,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.640
 he's a pretty popular Canadian cryptid,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.440
 but I was like, I wonder if there's any Canadian cryptids,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.440
 dude, Canada, first one I came across was a cryptid tree.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.200
 And I was like, oh, does it eat people?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.240
 No, it's just a tree, it's a yellow tree

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.400
 in the middle of the forest that got cut down.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.800
 That one of Canada's cryptids is a yellow tree.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.440
 It's a spruce or something like that,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.120
 that people were like, oh my God,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.000
 it's like such a rare genetic mutation,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.840
 they shouldn't exist.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.200
 And then some environmentalists cut it down

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.520
 to protest industrial logging.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.520
 And then the tree, then they tried cloning the tree

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.900
 and it never worked, they can never make a copy of the tree.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.920
 So they took what was left of the tree

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.400
 and turned it into a guitar celebrating Canadian history.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.140
 And also part of the guitar was Pierre Trudeau's ore

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.200
 and Wayne Gretzky's hockey stick.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.200
 They cobbled it all together to make a guitar.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.000
 What is wrong with you, Canada?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.760
 Okay, America has Bigfoot, Africa has the Groot Slang,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.080
 South America has like a thousand of them,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.400
 it has the Amboonshe, we've covered all that stuff.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.080
 Canada has a yellow tree.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.000
 That's ridiculous, dude,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.560
 that might be one of the worst cryptids

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.480
 I've ever come across.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.580
 Sure, there's photos of it,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.800
 there's evidence that existed,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.280
 but turned into a guitar with an ore and a hockey stick.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.040
 Come on, you make my job so difficult, Canada.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.240
 I was looking for a cool cryptid story.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.320
 I'm sure I'll find one, but that was a bad one

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.600
 to come across first.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.680
 Oh, and here's a little interesting segment,

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.320
 make that slightly interesting.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.600
 The dude who chopped down the tree went missing

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.760
 'cause they were looking for him

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.680
 because he destroyed this quote unquote national landmark,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.980
 this mutant tree, that's all you have.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.780
 Anyways, he went missing and is presumed dead.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.140
 They found some of his supplies

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.780
 on like a rocky beach somewhere.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.260
 So they're wondering,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.460
 authorities think he was either murdered

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.780
 for counting the tree down,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.940
 someone really liked that tree,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.580
 a lot of people really liked that tree,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.820
 or that he just died in an accident.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.420
 I would assume he most likely just died in an accident,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.900
 some people think he faked his death or whatever.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.580
 Who knows, oh, I mean, that part's a little intriguing.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.700
 Cryptid tree.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.640
 There's man eating plants out there.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.580
 There are stories of man eating plants

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.760
 and your tree doesn't even do that, it doesn't move,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.820
 it doesn't sing, it died and became a guitar,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.320
 that's part or and part hockey stick.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.040
 He also took some ballerina's outfit

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.980
 and added that to the guitar or something like that.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.380
 I couldn't make heads or tails of that.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.760
 At that point it was midnight

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.340
 and I was like, I'm done researching this nonsense.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.920
 But anyways, let's go ahead, thanks Canada.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.040
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.160
 We're saying goodbye to Canada,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.280
 we're saying goodbye to the beach.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.580
 We are headed to Wisconsin, the cheese state

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.200
 in the United States of America.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.920
 Every state has a theme, California is the state

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.040
 of like yuppies, I guess.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.300
 That's how it was when I was a kid.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.340
 It was like a yuppie state.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.540
 I guess now it's more like hippies and homeless people.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.100
 But when I was a kid, it was just like yuppies

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.940
 and stuff like that.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.780
 And then Oregon's the state of like people

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.700
 who smoke a lot of marijuana.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.240
 I'm not gonna go through all 50 states.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.120
 But anyways, Wisconsin is the cheese state.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.720
 That's where all the cheese comes from.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.980
 So I think so, right?

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.840
 Yeah, Green Bay Packers aren't they in Wisconsin?

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.880
 Is it Green Bay?

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.860
 Well anyways, it doesn't matter.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.440
 We're ignoring all that,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.500
 but we're eating as much cheese as we can.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.880
 I hope you're not lactose intolerant

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.100
 as we spend time in Wisconsin.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.940
 We're specifically going down

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.280
 to a tiny little town in Wisconsin

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.080
 known as Black River Falls.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.580
 Established in 1839.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.360
 Today has a population of a little less

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.980
 than 4,000 people I believe.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.440
 Tiny little town, it looks similar to Hood River.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.360
 You're like, that doesn't help me.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.780
 I've never been to Hood River.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.100
 But it's how you would imagine a tiny town to be.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.900
 At least according to the photos that I saw.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.020
 It's basically just a stretch of like one street town.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.560
 And then it kind of branches off a bit.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.620
 It's not a major city.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.000
 It's a tiny little burb.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.380
 And you had in this town, back in the late 1800s,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.960
 it was a booming lumber mill town.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.700
 There was mines in the area.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.760
 You had your town.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.160
 You had your people, your houses all around the town,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.420
 jetting out into wilderness.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.660
 People had farmland.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.100
 It was a great place to be.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.140
 We can look at news article.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.220
 This is all true by the way.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.660
 At the ending, I'm not gonna go.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.220
 And then I've debunked all this stuff.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.900
 Like this, I've researched this a lot.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.180
 These stories are all true.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.900
 A little, some of them may have been a little exaggerated

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.220
 but I'll point those ones out

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.980
 'cause there were some different encounters and stuff.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.080
 But all of the stuff I'm about to tell you

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.340
 has been verified from newspaper clippings at the time

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.680
 and then a book that was written about it later

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.160
 and then a movie that was written about it,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.000
 not written about it,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.880
 a movie that was made about it later as well.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.400
 So it was a booming economy for a long time.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.800
 Well, about 70 years, which is good amount of time.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.160
 In the late eighties, as we got closer to the year 1900,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.800
 things started to fall south.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.840
 First off, a string of freak winters came.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.680
 (exhales)

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.640
 They're like, "Where are the freaks?"

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.560
 Dun dun dun, they're like punk rock winters,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.400
 big ol' mohawks and stuff like that.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.420
 Coming through, (exhales)

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.340
 and it would just paralyze the town

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.820
 and they would get back over it

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.780
 and they'd start doing their duties and stuff like that.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.660
 And then the next winter, it was just as bad, if not worse.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.940
 So when you have any sort of outdoor,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.260
 all of this stuff is outdoor economy.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.760
 It's trees and going through mines,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.740
 I guess it's kind of indoor,

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.580
 but still you don't wanna be down there during a blizzard.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.580
 Farmlands can't really operate during freezing, freezing colds.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.040
 You started to have kind of a mini,

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.040
 before the depression I found out research in this,

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.800
 there was kind of a mini depression,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.920
 which I guess technically is a recession.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.960
 So the economy wasn't doing that great around,

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.600
 in the United States around that time to begin with.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.480
 You had this small town that was getting just pummeled

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.000
 by freak weather.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.720
 And I'm gonna tell you this too,

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.680
 I guess I should tell you this too,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.760
 this story is really, really dark.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.440
 Like I think parts of it are kind of funny and amusing,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.860
 but this one, I packed it with the rat episode,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.420
 'cause this is basically like a horror episode,

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.060
 'cause both of these stories you're just like,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.580
 "Ugh, the imagery is really gross,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.020
 "and a lot of bad things happen in the story."

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.940
 But anyway, so you have these freak winners,

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.540
 so if you wanna shut the episode off, that's fine,

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.380
 I'll see you tomorrow.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.420
 Just fair warning, the winners are paralyzing the town.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.700
 The lumber mills start to shut down,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.220
 so that hurt a lot of people

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.220
 who are working on lumber mills obviously.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.940
 The banks started to leave the area,

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.320
 so now you're getting to a place where there's no way

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.200
 that you can do business at all in this area.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.000
 It was so bad, trains in the area were offering people

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.560
 one way free tickets out of the area.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.240
 If you wanted to, 'cause it was that bad,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.880
 everyone knew it was that bad,

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.920
 but people who had plied their trade there,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.520
 who owned land there, who had large families,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.120
 really any family at all, they decided to stick it out.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.720
 So not everybody left,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.440
 but a lot of young single men did.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.180
 Figure, I'm just gonna try my luck somewhere else,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.660
 but if you had a big family, you don't wanna start from zero,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.460
 you'd rather take your chances and Black River falls,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.800
 and that was not a wise decision.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.500
 From about 1890 to 1910,

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.180
 an entire city descended into madness,

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.220
 and we know about these things

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.020
 because of news article clippings from the time,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.220
 and a lot of photography took place as well.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.300
 The town still seemed to try to be normal,

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.520
 and you may go about your day

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.000
 and not encounter anything bizarre.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.080
 You may go wake up, go to your unemployment,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.400
 you don't work, so then you just walk to your next chair

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.560
 and sit down in your living room,

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.840
 you're like, "Ugh," and then after eight hours of that,

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.760
 and then you go and you sit back down in your living room,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.520
 and nothing bad happens, but that wasn't always the case.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.120
 There was a statistic,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.800
 this is one of the things I don't know exactly how true it is,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.040
 but it will set the tone for the rest

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.600
 of what we're talking about.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.220
 That one, so this took place in Jackson County, Wisconsin,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.980
 one out of every 472 inhabitants were considered insane.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.580
 A lot of the people of this town

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.500
 were ended up getting shipped off to jails

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.460
 and insane asylums.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.700
 They simply couldn't deal with what was going on.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.300
 And so your thing, and Jason will tell me what's going on.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.080
 Nobody knows why these events happened.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.760
 There were rumors of devil worship,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.380
 there were whispers of demons.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.420
 Some people said they could hear the voices

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.140
 of demons in their heads and it made them do these things.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.160
 Some people said, "Ah, it's just the economy was bad.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.180
 "It was a bad economy for 20 years

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.220
 "and this is how people act up."

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.840
 But let's talk about some of these incidents

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.440
 of why Black River Falls is so famous today.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.980
 There was a woman named Mary Sweeney,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.460
 she was a former teacher, makes sense, no one had jobs.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.620
 No, I don't think anyone was going to school.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.180
 Maybe they were, but anyways,

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.780
 former teacher, she leaves her husband, right?

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.820
 And then begins using cocaine.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.980
 And now before you're like, oh dude, what is she, 25?

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.300
 She's super hot and she's using Coke on the weekends.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.580
 No, no, no, it's woman 60 in her late 60s.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.100
 She snorting Coke and one day she goes,

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.500
 I gotta break a window, I gotta break a window,

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.700
 gotta break a window.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.060
 And she goes and she busts the window.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.780
 Oh, that felt so good.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.540
 That felt almost as good as Coke,

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.620
 but here, let me compare that again.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.740
 Doesn't Coke, she's like, no, Coke's way better,

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.060
 but she doesn't stop there.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.140
 She ends up doing, so remember,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.060
 this story takes place in the early 1900s.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.980
 She ends up doing $50,000 worth of all the time money,

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.220
 damage, just breaking windows, all over town.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.220
 She was known as not just the Black River Falls

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.740
 window smasher, she was known as

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.540
 the Wisconsin window smasher.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.140
 There was no one in the entire state

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.220
 who smashed windows as good as she did.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.340
 Jailed 100 times eventually shipped off to an insane

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.540
 asylum, that's the last anyone ever heard of her.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.260
 You're like, Jason, that's not too weird.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.380
 I smashed windows, no, no, I'm sure you do

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.700
 smash windows on the weekend, it is quite satisfying,

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.540
 but let's move on.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.020
 Famous opera singer moves into town,

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.340
 singing through the streets, oh, they get noise everyone.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.940
 But opera singer says, you know what I'm gonna start doing?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.780
 I'm gonna start as a hobby making homemade Ouija boards.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.500
 Oh, it's pretty creepy, right?

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.740
 But it doesn't stop there, according to reports,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.740
 which is a very vague way to say that

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.180
 when I run on the internet, one day this opera singer

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.020
 is walking through the streets of Black River Falls.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.980
 Just (mimics opera singer)

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.220
 They can see from behind his shoulders are kind of moving.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.020
 Like, he's walking away, he's supposed to be,

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.700
 okay, you can tell he's eating from behind,

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.900
 is what I'm trying to say.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.940
 And then he turns around and he's just eating chicken.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.540
 And you're like, that's not scary,

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.140
 I eat chicken all the time.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.140
 But do you eat live chickens?

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.500
 This guy went crazy from making Ouija boards

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.140
 and then would just pick up chickens

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.340
 as he walked down the street and eat them.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.580
 And you go, Jason, what's the most?

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.260
 Like, how many chickens are walking through the street?

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.380
 How many chickens could you possibly find

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.220
 just walking through the street?

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.700
 Ah, let me move on to this next story.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.860
 There was this guy who had a farm named Sheldon Farm.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.580
 So I'm pretty sure his name was Sheldon.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.660
 Either first year or last name.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.020
 Again, so a lot of these reports are old,

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.860
 so we don't have a ton of information on him.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.380
 But one day he comes out of his house,

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.380
 looks at his farm, 18 headless chickens laying in the ground.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.380
 - Fuck.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.380
 - Actually, they wouldn't be doing that

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.700
 'cause they don't have heads.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.700
 Now he thinks that Satan worshipers have attacked his farm.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.380
 That Satan himself has led them here

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.780
 to chop off all these chicken heads.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.580
 It would seem ritualistic that their heads were chopped off.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.220
 So this is where the insanity starts.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.980
 What would you do if you came out

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.780
 and you saw 18 chopped off chickens heads?

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.140
 You didn't see the heads, you just saw the bodies.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.660
 You walk out of your, well, if you did it,

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.620
 you don't know the farm, you'd be like,

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.680
 "Where did all these chickens come from?"

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.540
 But if you owned a farm and you walked out

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.040
 and you saw a bunch of headless chickens dead,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.260
 you would go, "Dag, nav it, damn Satanists came back,

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.940
 and probably good old hoof foot is back as well."

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.900
 And then go and clean up all the chickens

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.740
 and go about your business.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.980
 He thought the only way to get rid of the devil

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.520
 was he just burned his property down, just torched it all.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.180
 So now he's homeless and his business is gone.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.620
 And the funniest part is,

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.980
 is that we know who chopped off the chicken heads.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.740
 Apparently, off in the forest, there was a 50 drifter.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.620
 So I mean, basically, that is like a division

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.320
 of homeless people had come through his farm

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.620
 and chopped off the chicken heads

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.220
 and then left and ate them.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.340
 But here's my question.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.820
 Why would you leave the chicken?

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.620
 Like, wait a second.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.360
 Now I'm thinking I might have read this wrong.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.680
 Maybe they left the heads and took the chickens.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.240
 But the way I read it was that they were eating chicken heads

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.520
 in the woods.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.280
 And then one of the homeless people go,

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.960
 "Hey, I think we got this backwards.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.020
 We went through all this trouble

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.400
 and we just got a little tiny piece."

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.320
 And they were like, "Oh, yeah, right.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.120
 We should have grabbed the whole chicken."

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.440
 I think he came out and found just 18 chicken heads.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.280
 I think.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.560
 Anyways, he freaked out.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.600
 He went insane.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.720
 He thought the devil was there.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.460
 Burn his whole farm down, burn his house down,

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.300
 got rid of it.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.580
 One woman, she had a sore on her back.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.740
 She's like, "Oh, I think I have cancer.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.820
 I think I have this lump on my back, which is sad.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.180
 That's a horrible thing to be afraid of.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.380
 I have a friend right now who has some lumps.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.420
 He thinks he might have cancer.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.020
 It's terrifying."

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.660
 But rational person would go to the doctor.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.100
 Let's say there's not a doctor in town.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.580
 A rational person would just be like,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.340
 "Maybe I'll get my friend to like cut it out with a knife.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.180
 I don't know."

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.620
 She covers herself in gasoline and lights it on fire.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.140
 That is not something you do

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.760
 if you think you have any disease at all.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.880
 Oh, I have water on the brain.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.120
 Well, maybe if I boiled it.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.280
 No, it doesn't work like that.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.040
 Fire is not a medical tool.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.400
 Now, all of this, imagine all of these things.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.920
 I know it just seems disconnected

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.040
 like it's all these stories.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.880
 Imagine you are living in this town right now

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.280
 and you wake up and you're like,

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.440
 "Hey, what ever happened to Betty?"

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.560
 And they're like, "Oh, you didn't hear?

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.840
 She's lit herself on fire."

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.680
 What?

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.600
 Yeah, she thought she had cancer on her back.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.800
 You'd be like, "What is going on?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.880
 Well, I better go to my job at the farm here.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.140
 I have 18 chickens I have to feed."

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.300
 And as you're walking across town and going to that farm,

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.340
 you're the one guy with a job.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.380
 You see the farm on fire.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.820
 The guy's like, "It's okay. It's okay.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.020
 I destroyed the devil.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:15.860
 Peace on earth."

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.100
 And you're like, "What?

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.020
 I see homeless people out there eating chickens."

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.860
 And he's like, "Nah, nah, it's an illusion.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:23.860
 I killed the devil."

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.700
 Goes around and around.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.620
 There's one little girl named Lydia Berger.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.260
 We have a name for some of these people.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.540
 She was 15.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.380
 Dad beat her up.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.380
 That's not funny.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.700
 Dad beats her up.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.300
 She goes to say to the neighbor's house,

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.760
 the neighbors take her in, start taking care of her.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.600
 She burns their house down.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.040
 And then starts burning houses down all over town

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.680
 until eventually she's caught and arrested.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.720
 Just nutty stuff.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.280
 This one actually might,

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.960
 this one is, this is where we start to get really, really dark.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.960
 Those ones were quite playful.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.240
 This is where, the woman burned herself alive,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.440
 but this is where we start to get a little more dark.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.800
 There was a guy who was named Christ Wold.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.660
 He was a farmer and the bank collapsed

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.100
 and he was gonna lose his land.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.060
 He was unemployed.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.180
 He had no money.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.220
 He had nothing.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.420
 So he decides to take his own life.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.780
 He decides to take his own life.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.900
 The way he goes about it though, again,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.820
 there are traditional ways.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.500
 I'm anti-suicide.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.700
 If you're ever having trouble with suicide or anything like that,

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.980
 you need to reach out.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.460
 I'm against suicide.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.380
 I guess when you're like at end of life type thing,

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.540
 that's different for me,

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.180
 but depression and things like that,

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.620
 things can always get better.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.180
 I guess I have no segue from that.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.180
 This guy, I just find this so bizarre

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.460
 that this is his go-to method.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.140
 I guess it would be quite painless

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.700
 and a little theatrical, but still.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.100
 It would seem like it would be more grim.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.820
 He basically digs a hole, okay?

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.980
 And then puts his head in the hole.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.980
 Still attached to him though.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.300
 So he's laying down on the ground

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.780
 and he has his head in the hole.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.820
 Then he grabs a piece of dynamite and lights it

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.060
 and throws it in the hole with his head and blows up.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.220
 Now you could say, "Well, that's instantaneous, man."

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.660
 Yeah, but I gotta look at a wick

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.260
 slowly burning down a dynamite stick that.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.420
 I mean, you would have to look at that.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.500
 Even if you close your eyes, you would still hear that.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.940
 It almost seemed to be more terrifying

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.420
 than any other form of suicide.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.540
 Just, "And what if it was a dud

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.500
 and then you gotta go get another stick?"

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.140
 Horrible, horrible.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.820
 Sorry guys.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.660
 Sorry guys.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.500
 You have this girl, we have her name, Sarah Smith.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.340
 She died and is buried in Rosedale Cemetery.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.100
 Eventually though, the cemetery gets investigated

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.340
 'cause they weren't doing stuff right.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.820
 So they're like, "Okay, dig up all those graves.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.580
 You gotta make sure you did the funeral stuff

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.500
 right on those graves.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.540
 Dig her up.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.420
 Half her hands are eaten."

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.860
 And they go, "Oh, yes, sorry.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.660
 We buried that one alive."

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.860
 I guess that one's not necessarily like insanity.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.540
 I think that just adds to the overall terrifying circus

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.860
 that was Black River Falls.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.260
 Again, all of this stuff happened

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.820
 within a 20-year time span

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.220
 and I'm leaving out the child murders

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.820
 and the wife beatings.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.340
 'Cause there was a lot of those.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.260
 I'm like, I'm not even touching those.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.540
 There was a lot of stories of just people

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.140
 just beating their kids to death

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.980
 or beating their wives to death.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.100
 Drowning, I'm leaving all that stuff out.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.900
 Anything, Lydia Berger, the 15-year-old who got beat up

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.980
 and then started burning stuff down,

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.780
 that was the lowest age that I was gonna do.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.700
 And that's just basically

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.020
 because she became some sort of fire-based vigilante.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.140
 I'm leaving out a ton of stuff.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.300
 Imagine any one of these events happening in your town

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.220
 over the course of 20 years, people would be like,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.500
 "Dude, they buried that woman alive

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.540
 and she bit her hands off."

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.780
 All of this stuff is happening in two decades, in one town.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.620
 And we got a few more though, if you'll indulge me

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.860
 and then we'll kind of dig into what I think's behind it.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:52.020
 Drifter, a homeless person is invited over by a family.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.700
 Nice little family meal, sitting down,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.340
 puts a little napkin in a shirt

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.820
 and he goes, "Oh, that's great. Thank you so much.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.820
 It's such a good meal."

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.580
 And as they're eating, the Drifter pulls a gun out,

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.980
 shoots himself in the neck, dies.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.820
 What? Like that is the idea of insanity.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.900
 Like you have as normal as you can get in this town.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.140
 A guy is invited in to have a meal

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.960
 and he's eating a meal with these people

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.020
 and something just snaps in him

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.300
 and then he blows himself away.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.460
 Wall, everyone else is eating.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.060
 Ruining their meal as well.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.660
 None of those kids are gonna be able to eat spaghetti

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.500
 after that.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.300
 Like that is a horrible thing to do.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.260
 That is insane.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.380
 There's a difference between like depression,

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.820
 which is walking out in the woods and shooting yourself

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.420
 and then waiting until you have an audience of a family

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.740
 that is feeding you and then killing yourself

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.140
 and then to really drive the nail home

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.420
 and to wrap it up with this.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.700
 There was a bar in Black River Falls.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.020
 Oh, I'm sure there was more than one,

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.060
 but there is this particular bar in Black River Falls.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.300
 One day a guy walks into the bar and says,

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.140
 "What time is it?"

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.300
 And the guy told him the time and he goes,

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.340
 "Okay."

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.860
 And then he continued to drink and drink and drink

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.660
 and drink until he died.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.420
 Now that is the bartender's fault.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.900
 The bartender should have cut him off at a certain point,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.700
 but the bartender also may have just been like,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.500
 "I know what's outside this bar."

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.140
 That same bar another guy walks in later,

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.660
 not the same day, although that would be hilarious.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.260
 I don't know how this is possible,

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.420
 but it's stated he ate cigar butts until he died.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.100
 I don't know if he came back every day

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.620
 and ate nothing but cigar butts

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.980
 until his stomach became nothing but filter,

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.780
 but apparently that's what happened.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.820
 He just ate, again, that is an insane way to kill.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.740
 That is the definition of insanity.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.820
 "Hey, what are you doing this weekend?

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.740
 "I'm eating cigar butts."

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.220
 Oh, same thing you did last weekend.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.300
 Same thing I do every day too.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.500
 I'm trying to kill myself eating cigar butts.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.460
 Here's cigarette butts.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.340
 I know that it will eventually kill me,

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.100
 but it just seems like it's so hard to do,

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.140
 although it's possible that he just

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:47.980
 shoved them all in his mouth.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.860
 Jay, you're like Jason, you're just reading out.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.420
 You're spending the whole episode talking about

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.140
 people blowing themselves up and dying in horrible ways.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.220
 What does any of this have to do?

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.980
 Is this just you being morbid?

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.820
 Well, no.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.980
 So here's the thing.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.660
 We've talked about missing towns in the past,

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.660
 like Dublin, Wisconsin, and what was it?

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.220
 Belray, the Belray, Surge.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.780
 Those are really early episodes, really early episodes,

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.740
 but go back and listen to those if you haven't.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.500
 So we've talked about missing towns

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.900
 and things like that in the past.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.820
 Now, both of those have basically been inconclusive.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.660
 Did this town exist?

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.780
 Nobody knows.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.460
 But we have a town that is that with documentation.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.340
 This town, I'm detailing all these events

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.860
 because this town almost did kill itself.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.860
 The written records exist because people live there today

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.340
 and they could be like, oh yeah,

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.020
 let's go through these old newspapers.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.140
 But you had such rapid self-destruction in this town

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.500
 that the town itself very easily could have just fallen

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.900
 into disrepair, people leave, it wasn't worth it,

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.100
 and it would have been littered with these bodies,

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.060
 these stories, these victims of their own mind.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.820
 This town would have just disappeared,

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.420
 been swallowed up by the wilderness,

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.420
 and historians would say,

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.260
 we can see references to a town called Black River Falls

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.020
 and we believe it was in this area,

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.020
 but all that's out there now is a burned down building.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.140
 So we don't know what happened there.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.220
 All we know is maybe the mills closed

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.380
 because we saw freak weather during that year

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.860
 and then everyone left.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.580
 And they wouldn't have the detail of these stories.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:28.340
 So the disappearing town phenomenon could be real.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.420
 It really could be something that cities have existed.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.900
 We know it happens worldwide.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.500
 The question has always been is,

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.380
 does it happen more recently?

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.860
 Could it happen within the past two, 300 years

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.980
 of a town simply disappearing off the map

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.060
 and being completely forgotten?

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.380
 Towns do get unincorporated and just fall apart

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.140
 and things like that, but like a ghost town.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.980
 We're talking about a town that people,

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.640
 forget was ever really there.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.960
 This town tried really hard to prove that that's possible.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.900
 This town tried really hard to destroy itself,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.820
 but I, economies go bad.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.300
 Okay, there's bad natural disasters.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.380
 There are entire countries that suffer through economies

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.540
 far worse than what was happening in Black River Falls.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.860
 And I believe there has to be another component to this.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.860
 The madness, the insanity, and the sheer violence

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.500
 that took place over these 20 years

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.300
 in this one town is staggering.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.020
 There has to be something else there.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.860
 I get it, the human condition, depression,

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.860
 bleakness, hopelessness may drive a man crazy.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.660
 May drive a woman to drown her children.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:51.260
 But come on, I mean like this stuff is beyond the pale.

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.840
 It all started with rumors that those freak winters

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.760
 were brought by satanic worship, by demons.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.840
 It all started after that first freak winter

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.900
 when people believed that something paranormal

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.120
 was happening in that town.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.960
 Is it possible that the stories of Satan worshiping

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.960
 was true?

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:18.460
 Is it possible that some sort of curse was put on this town?

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.560
 If so, why?

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.320
 Who did it?

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.240
 But more importantly, could it happen again today?

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.440
 Could there be a town somewhere out there,

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:36.440
 picturesque, peaceful, that is right now on the verge

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.340
 of becoming the next Black River Falls?

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.600
