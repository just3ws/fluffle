14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,760
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,360
 Somewhere out in the ocean,

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,480
 a cruise ship moves slowly through the water,

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,480
 unmanned, except for hundreds and hundreds of rats.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
 And then we travel to Black River Falls in Wisconsin.

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,960
 Today it's a normal town, pleasant to the eye,

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,840
 but for 20 years, at the turn of the 20th century,

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,560
 rumors of satanic worship and demons

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,000
 led people to do unspeakable things.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,340
 (upbeat music)

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,120
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,280
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,120
 I'm having a great day.

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,560
 We got a lot of stuff to talk about,

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,360
 so we're just gonna jump right in quick.

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,180
 Okay, so let's go ahead and jump into the first story here.

33
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,460
 So we are on a beach.

34
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,360
 We're on a beach somewhere near your hometown.

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,960
 Assuming you don't live in the desert,

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,120
 you're like, oh man, I wish I had water near me.

37
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,600
 We're at a beach.

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,080
 We're standing there with binoculars

39
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,320
 looking out at the ocean.

40
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,200
 And you're like, Jason, why are we looking at the ocean?

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,120
 There's so many better things we could be doing.

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,440
 And I'm like, well, there's a reason

43
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,640
 for you on this whole setup.

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,840
 There's a reason for this.

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,280
 I throw my arm over your shoulder.

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,560
 I'm like, look out there.

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,040
 I point out into the ocean.

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,200
 I point out, I'm like, look over there, look over there.

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,480
 And while you're looking over there,

50
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,720
 I'm going to whisper in your ear the story

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,400
 of the MV "Louis Bove Orlova."

52
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,280
 Louis Bove Orlova.

53
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,600
 You put the binoculars down, you're like,

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,400
 you don't know how to pronounce any of this, do you?

55
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
 And I was like, no, no, no, I don't, I don't.

56
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,160
 But I know the story.

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,680
 Put the binoculars back up

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,760
 and let's gaze back out of the ocean.

59
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
 Seagulls.

60
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,040
 (coyote howling)

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,240
 Flying by.

62
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,400
 So the boat, we'll call it the Orlova

63
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,600
 'cause I know how to say that part at least.

64
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,160
 So the Orlova was this big, giant cruise ship

65
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,800
 that was built to withstand like icebergs and stuff,

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
 which is pretty good considering stuff

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
 that's happened in the past.

68
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,320
 It was made by the Russians and they said,

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,440
 we're going to build this cruise ship

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,560
 and it's specifically to like take cruises around Antarctica.

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,280
 So you could go, I don't know what there would be to see

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,160
 out there, you just go near Antarctica,

73
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,760
 see a bunch of penguins and you leave.

74
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,600
 And so it goes around Antarctica

75
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,760
 and so it had to be built like super sturdy,

76
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,120
 more sturdy than like say a Carnival

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
 or like a Disney cruise ship.

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,640
 I don't actually know if that's true.

79
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
 I'm just assuming it's dirtier built

80
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,720
 'cause I don't think normal cruise ships can take an iceberg.

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,520
 This one was built to go around Antarctica.

82
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,320
 But it did end up running a ground on a place called,

83
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,360
 I keep wanting to call it Decepticon Island,

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
 which would be cool, but it went a ground

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,240
 on this island by Antarctica called Deception Island.

86
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,680
 And it's actually called Deception Island

87
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,160
 'cause it's not an island, it is a volcano.

88
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,520
 It's like a caldera.

89
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,040
 So it's like you think it's an island

90
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,440
 and then you get on shore and you realize

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,520
 it's an active volcano too.

92
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,560
 A bunch of nerds were there doing science stuff a while back.

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,760
 They put up all their outposts, all those nerds

94
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,360
 with all their stuff on Deception Island.

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,080
 And then there was a massive earthquake

96
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
 and it destroyed all their research stations,

97
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,000
 which is hilarious when even like nature

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,160
 is picking on nerds.

99
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,120
 They're like, get out of here.

100
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,520
 Now it's basically a tourist stop

101
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,880
 and I think the Swedes have something there.

102
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,320
 But anyways, it ran a ground on Deception Island

103
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,640
 and that was kind of the start of its bad luck.

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,240
 The Orlova though was able to get pulled off the island

105
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,720
 and started going around.

106
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,280
 But by the year 2010 showed up,

107
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,520
 all that stuff happened like in the early 2000s.

108
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,280
 In the year 2010, the boat ends up sitting at St. John's,

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
 which is in Newfoundland, Canada.

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,240
 Through a series of mishaps and business deals

111
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,440
 falling through and stuff like that,

112
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,360
 a bunch of money was owed on the boat

113
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,760
 and eventually the city of St. John,

114
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,400
 it had been sitting there for two years,

115
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,240
 was just sitting in the harbor.

116
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,360
 So the city says we're just gonna sell the ship

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
 'cause no one's ever gonna pay all these fees that are on it.

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
 We're gonna sell the ship to someone else

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,660
 so they can take it out and they can scrap it.

120
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,560
 We just want it out of our harbor.

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,080
 Now boats have a rat problem.

122
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,440
 There are certain things you can do

123
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,640
 to prevent rats from coming onto your boat,

124
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,480
 but not for two years.

125
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,080
 Like eventually rats, they're not the smartest thing,

126
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,240
 but they're also not the dumbest thing.

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,920
 They eventually are gonna find a way to get on the boat.

128
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,400
 It was a cruise ship and they were preparing to do a cruise.

129
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,460
 So any amount of food on the ship and there would have been,

130
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,880
 I'm not gonna say the thing had like a,

131
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
 oh you can eat buffet,

132
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
 but it did have food supplies on the ship.

133
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
 Rats would become drawn to it

134
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,840
 and they would start eating it.

135
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
 And more importantly, banging each other

136
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,240
 and having rat babies.

137
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,440
 So this rat infested ship is sitting at the harbor

138
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,280
 and finally they're like,

139
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,720
 let's just pay someone to get rid of it.

140
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,600
 So the rats are just hanging out,

141
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,120
 they're wearing their little like tuxes and stuff

142
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,720
 and then you have the rats in steerage

143
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,060
 that are dressed in like rags

144
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,560
 and they're like, oh, wonderful,

145
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
 fine true love in the upper decks.

146
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,280
 And the boat starts getting pulled away from the harbor

147
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
 and they're like, ah.

148
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,720
 And as a tugboat is pulling it away from the harbor,

149
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,360
 the tow line breaks.

150
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,080
 So now the cruise ship is just floating around by itself.

151
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,040
 They had to hire another company to come out,

152
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,360
 start towing it farther out to sea.

153
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,280
 'Cause at this point it was like flowing around oil,

154
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,560
 Derrick's, and they're like,

155
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,800
 this thing's gonna cause a huge catastrophe.

156
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,880
 It's an unmanned cruise ship just floating around Canada.

157
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,440
 But the boat is headed towards,

158
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,560
 I think Jamaica where they're gonna scrap it.

159
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,540
 And what happened was the people who got hired to tow it,

160
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,400
 they finally towed it far enough out to sea

161
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,000
 and they just said, let's just cut the line.

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Just cut the line, dude.

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,920
 We're not gonna take this thing all to Jamaica.

164
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,560
 We'll just cut the line and it'll eventually sink.

165
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
 So I don't think they actually had a guy out there

166
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,560
 with a knife cutting this rope,

167
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,440
 but and the rats are watching, they're like,

168
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
 no, don't cut the line, don't cut the line.

169
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,240
 And the dude cuts the line and the boat starts kind of,

170
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,740
 and then it just kind of starts sailing away.

171
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,020
 Now what's funny is that they really shouldn't have done that.

172
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,340
 They said it wasn't safe to take it all the way to Jamaica,

173
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,240
 but nobody knows where the boat went.

174
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,620
 People thought that it was gonna end up in Ireland.

175
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,840
 Some people thought it was gonna end up in Iceland,

176
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,480
 but this cruise ship is just cruising around.

177
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,920
 And the whole time in the pitch darkness of that ship,

178
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,180
 just rats just crawling all over each other,

179
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,000
 eating the food and just breeding and breeding

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
 and breeding, but what would happen

181
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,240
 is all the food would run out eventually.

182
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,880
 Rats would start to check out each other.

183
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,360
 That people in the steerage, like awfully yummy

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
 in the steerage people are like,

185
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,640
 there's more fuss than there are of you, 99%,

186
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,300
 90 and they would start eating each other,

187
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,080
 which you eat a couple of rats and then you're like,

188
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,800
 oh my belly's full, it's time to have sex

189
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,640
 and then you have more of your baby rats

190
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,120
 and then you start eating rats.

191
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,160
 As of today, nobody knows what happened to the boat.

192
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,000
 Some people say it's already sunk.

193
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
 There was an alarm that went off,

194
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,960
 this Irish station picked up an alarm

195
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,880
 that only goes off if the boat's taking on water.

196
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,720
 People don't know.

197
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,520
 Some people have said because the boat was built to withstand,

198
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,920
 it was like basically an icebreaker cruise ship,

199
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,800
 it would last quite a while.

200
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,960
 There may be a cruise ship floating around out there,

201
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,800
 full of rats, just clawing their way through the darkness

202
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,560
 'cause it would be pitch black.

203
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,480
 They wouldn't even be able to see each other,

204
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,720
 there would just be so many of them,

205
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,600
 they would just crawl over each other,

206
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,800
 they would know there was another rat there through scent

207
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
 or they would feel those little rat hands

208
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,920
 crawl across their back,

209
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,880
 just sailing out there still in the ocean today.

210
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,200
 A true ghost ship full of cannibal rats.

211
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,600
 So the boat may still be out there

212
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,160
 and at any moment it may crash into a shoreline

213
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,200
 and spill out its bloated guts

214
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,120
 of nothing but big black rats all over the countryside.

215
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,360
 Or the ship did sink,

216
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,860
 but one dedicated rat was able to get off

217
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,680
 and he swam across the ocean,

218
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,900
 eating fish the whole way, big old fish,

219
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,360
 getting bigger and bigger

220
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,880
 until finally he sees a drainage pipe

221
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,280
 leading right into your sewer line.

222
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,000
 And tonight you'll hear a

223
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,680
 as your closed toilet lid keeps getting pushed up

224
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,040
 a little bit at a time.

225
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,760
 But you ignore the sound, you ignore it,

226
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,760
 you go to bed and at night that big black rat

227
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,920
 finally lifts off the toilet seat cover

228
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,560
 and crawls out into your bathroom.

229
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,360
 And then looks at the camera and goes,

230
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,480
 (shushing)

231
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,440
 Story may continue in your bathroom tonight.

232
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,800
 You know what's funny?

233
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,000
 I was looking, the story took place in Canada,

234
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,880
 I have another story to take place in Canada

235
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,160
 and I thought I should try to do a Canada specific episode.

236
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,320
 I go, I wonder what Canadian,

237
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,840
 I wonder what Canadian cryptids I want.

238
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,800
 Now I know about the wind to go,

239
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
 he's a pretty popular Canadian cryptid,

240
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
 but I was like, I wonder if there's any Canadian cryptids,

241
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,440
 dude, Canada, first one I came across was a cryptid tree.

242
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,200
 And I was like, oh, does it eat people?

243
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,240
 No, it's just a tree, it's a yellow tree

244
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,400
 in the middle of the forest that got cut down.

245
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,800
 That one of Canada's cryptids is a yellow tree.

246
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,440
 It's a spruce or something like that,

247
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
 that people were like, oh my God,

248
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,000
 it's like such a rare genetic mutation,

249
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,840
 they shouldn't exist.

250
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,200
 And then some environmentalists cut it down

251
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,520
 to protest industrial logging.

252
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,520
 And then the tree, then they tried cloning the tree

253
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,900
 and it never worked, they can never make a copy of the tree.

254
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,920
 So they took what was left of the tree

255
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,400
 and turned it into a guitar celebrating Canadian history.

256
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,140
 And also part of the guitar was Pierre Trudeau's ore

257
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,200
 and Wayne Gretzky's hockey stick.

258
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,200
 They cobbled it all together to make a guitar.

259
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
 What is wrong with you, Canada?

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,760
 Okay, America has Bigfoot, Africa has the Groot Slang,

261
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,080
 South America has like a thousand of them,

262
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,400
 it has the Amboonshe, we've covered all that stuff.

263
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,080
 Canada has a yellow tree.

264
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,000
 That's ridiculous, dude,

265
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,560
 that might be one of the worst cryptids

266
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,480
 I've ever come across.

267
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,580
 Sure, there's photos of it,

268
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,800
 there's evidence that existed,

269
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,280
 but turned into a guitar with an ore and a hockey stick.

270
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,040
 Come on, you make my job so difficult, Canada.

271
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,240
 I was looking for a cool cryptid story.

272
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,320
 I'm sure I'll find one, but that was a bad one

273
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,600
 to come across first.

274
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,680
 Oh, and here's a little interesting segment,

275
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,320
 make that slightly interesting.

276
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,600
 The dude who chopped down the tree went missing

277
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,760
 'cause they were looking for him

278
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,680
 because he destroyed this quote unquote national landmark,

279
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,980
 this mutant tree, that's all you have.

280
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,780
 Anyways, he went missing and is presumed dead.

281
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,140
 They found some of his supplies

282
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,780
 on like a rocky beach somewhere.

283
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,260
 So they're wondering,

284
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,460
 authorities think he was either murdered

285
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,780
 for counting the tree down,

286
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,940
 someone really liked that tree,

287
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,580
 a lot of people really liked that tree,

288
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,820
 or that he just died in an accident.

289
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,420
 I would assume he most likely just died in an accident,

290
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,900
 some people think he faked his death or whatever.

291
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,580
 Who knows, oh, I mean, that part's a little intriguing.

292
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,700
 Cryptid tree.

293
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,640
 There's man eating plants out there.

294
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,580
 There are stories of man eating plants

295
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,760
 and your tree doesn't even do that, it doesn't move,

296
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,820
 it doesn't sing, it died and became a guitar,

297
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,320
 that's part or and part hockey stick.

298
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,040
 He also took some ballerina's outfit

299
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,980
 and added that to the guitar or something like that.

300
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,380
 I couldn't make heads or tails of that.

301
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,760
 At that point it was midnight

302
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,340
 and I was like, I'm done researching this nonsense.

303
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,920
 But anyways, let's go ahead, thanks Canada.

304
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,040
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

305
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,160
 We're saying goodbye to Canada,

306
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,280
 we're saying goodbye to the beach.

307
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,580
 We are headed to Wisconsin, the cheese state

308
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,200
 in the United States of America.

309
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,920
 Every state has a theme, California is the state

310
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
 of like yuppies, I guess.

311
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,300
 That's how it was when I was a kid.

312
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,340
 It was like a yuppie state.

313
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,540
 I guess now it's more like hippies and homeless people.

314
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,100
 But when I was a kid, it was just like yuppies

315
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,940
 and stuff like that.

316
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,780
 And then Oregon's the state of like people

317
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,700
 who smoke a lot of marijuana.

318
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,240
 I'm not gonna go through all 50 states.

319
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,120
 But anyways, Wisconsin is the cheese state.

320
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
 That's where all the cheese comes from.

321
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,980
 So I think so, right?

322
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,840
 Yeah, Green Bay Packers aren't they in Wisconsin?

323
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,880
 Is it Green Bay?

324
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,860
 Well anyways, it doesn't matter.

325
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,440
 We're ignoring all that,

326
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,500
 but we're eating as much cheese as we can.

327
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,880
 I hope you're not lactose intolerant

328
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,100
 as we spend time in Wisconsin.

329
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,940
 We're specifically going down

330
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,280
 to a tiny little town in Wisconsin

331
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,080
 known as Black River Falls.

332
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,580
 Established in 1839.

333
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,360
 Today has a population of a little less

334
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,980
 than 4,000 people I believe.

335
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,440
 Tiny little town, it looks similar to Hood River.

336
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,360
 You're like, that doesn't help me.

337
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,780
 I've never been to Hood River.

338
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,100
 But it's how you would imagine a tiny town to be.

339
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,900
 At least according to the photos that I saw.

340
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,020
 It's basically just a stretch of like one street town.

341
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,560
 And then it kind of branches off a bit.

342
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,620
 It's not a major city.

343
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,000
 It's a tiny little burb.

344
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,380
 And you had in this town, back in the late 1800s,

345
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,960
 it was a booming lumber mill town.

346
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,700
 There was mines in the area.

347
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,760
 You had your town.

348
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,160
 You had your people, your houses all around the town,

349
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,420
 jetting out into wilderness.

350
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,660
 People had farmland.

351
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,100
 It was a great place to be.

352
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,140
 We can look at news article.

353
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,220
 This is all true by the way.

354
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,660
 At the ending, I'm not gonna go.

355
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,220
 And then I've debunked all this stuff.

356
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,900
 Like this, I've researched this a lot.

357
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,180
 These stories are all true.

358
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,900
 A little, some of them may have been a little exaggerated

359
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,220
 but I'll point those ones out

360
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,980
 'cause there were some different encounters and stuff.

361
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,080
 But all of the stuff I'm about to tell you

362
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,340
 has been verified from newspaper clippings at the time

363
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,680
 and then a book that was written about it later

364
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,160
 and then a movie that was written about it,

365
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,000
 not written about it,

366
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,880
 a movie that was made about it later as well.

367
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,400
 So it was a booming economy for a long time.

368
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,800
 Well, about 70 years, which is good amount of time.

369
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
 In the late eighties, as we got closer to the year 1900,

370
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,800
 things started to fall south.

371
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,840
 First off, a string of freak winters came.

372
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,680
 (exhales)

373
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,640
 They're like, "Where are the freaks?"

374
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,560
 Dun dun dun, they're like punk rock winters,

375
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,400
 big ol' mohawks and stuff like that.

376
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,420
 Coming through, (exhales)

377
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,340
 and it would just paralyze the town

378
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,820
 and they would get back over it

379
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,780
 and they'd start doing their duties and stuff like that.

380
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,660
 And then the next winter, it was just as bad, if not worse.

381
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,940
 So when you have any sort of outdoor,

382
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,260
 all of this stuff is outdoor economy.

383
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,760
 It's trees and going through mines,

384
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,740
 I guess it's kind of indoor,

385
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,580
 but still you don't wanna be down there during a blizzard.

386
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,580
 Farmlands can't really operate during freezing, freezing colds.

387
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,040
 You started to have kind of a mini,

388
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
 before the depression I found out research in this,

389
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
 there was kind of a mini depression,

390
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,920
 which I guess technically is a recession.

391
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,960
 So the economy wasn't doing that great around,

392
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,600
 in the United States around that time to begin with.

393
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,480
 You had this small town that was getting just pummeled

394
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,000
 by freak weather.

395
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,720
 And I'm gonna tell you this too,

396
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,680
 I guess I should tell you this too,

397
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,760
 this story is really, really dark.

398
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,440
 Like I think parts of it are kind of funny and amusing,

399
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,860
 but this one, I packed it with the rat episode,

400
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,420
 'cause this is basically like a horror episode,

401
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,060
 'cause both of these stories you're just like,

402
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,580
 "Ugh, the imagery is really gross,

403
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,020
 "and a lot of bad things happen in the story."

404
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,940
 But anyway, so you have these freak winners,

405
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,540
 so if you wanna shut the episode off, that's fine,

406
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,380
 I'll see you tomorrow.

407
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,420
 Just fair warning, the winners are paralyzing the town.

408
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,700
 The lumber mills start to shut down,

409
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,220
 so that hurt a lot of people

410
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,220
 who are working on lumber mills obviously.

411
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,940
 The banks started to leave the area,

412
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,320
 so now you're getting to a place where there's no way

413
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,200
 that you can do business at all in this area.

414
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,000
 It was so bad, trains in the area were offering people

415
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,560
 one way free tickets out of the area.

416
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,240
 If you wanted to, 'cause it was that bad,

417
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,880
 everyone knew it was that bad,

418
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,920
 but people who had plied their trade there,

419
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,520
 who owned land there, who had large families,

420
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,120
 really any family at all, they decided to stick it out.

421
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
 So not everybody left,

422
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,440
 but a lot of young single men did.

423
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,180
 Figure, I'm just gonna try my luck somewhere else,

424
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,660
 but if you had a big family, you don't wanna start from zero,

425
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,460
 you'd rather take your chances and Black River falls,

426
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,800
 and that was not a wise decision.

427
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,500
 From about 1890 to 1910,

428
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,180
 an entire city descended into madness,

429
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,220
 and we know about these things

430
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,020
 because of news article clippings from the time,

431
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,220
 and a lot of photography took place as well.

432
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,300
 The town still seemed to try to be normal,

433
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,520
 and you may go about your day

434
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,000
 and not encounter anything bizarre.

435
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,080
 You may go wake up, go to your unemployment,

436
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,400
 you don't work, so then you just walk to your next chair

437
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,560
 and sit down in your living room,

438
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,840
 you're like, "Ugh," and then after eight hours of that,

439
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,760
 and then you go and you sit back down in your living room,

440
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,520
 and nothing bad happens, but that wasn't always the case.

441
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,120
 There was a statistic,

442
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,800
 this is one of the things I don't know exactly how true it is,

443
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,040
 but it will set the tone for the rest

444
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,600
 of what we're talking about.

445
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,220
 That one, so this took place in Jackson County, Wisconsin,

446
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,980
 one out of every 472 inhabitants were considered insane.

447
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,580
 A lot of the people of this town

448
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,500
 were ended up getting shipped off to jails

449
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,460
 and insane asylums.

450
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,700
 They simply couldn't deal with what was going on.

451
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,300
 And so your thing, and Jason will tell me what's going on.

452
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,080
 Nobody knows why these events happened.

453
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,760
 There were rumors of devil worship,

454
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,380
 there were whispers of demons.

455
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,420
 Some people said they could hear the voices

456
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,140
 of demons in their heads and it made them do these things.

457
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,160
 Some people said, "Ah, it's just the economy was bad.

458
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,180
 "It was a bad economy for 20 years

459
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,220
 "and this is how people act up."

460
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,840
 But let's talk about some of these incidents

461
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,440
 of why Black River Falls is so famous today.

462
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,980
 There was a woman named Mary Sweeney,

463
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,460
 she was a former teacher, makes sense, no one had jobs.

464
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,620
 No, I don't think anyone was going to school.

465
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,180
 Maybe they were, but anyways,

466
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,780
 former teacher, she leaves her husband, right?

467
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,820
 And then begins using cocaine.

468
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,980
 And now before you're like, oh dude, what is she, 25?

469
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,300
 She's super hot and she's using Coke on the weekends.

470
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,580
 No, no, no, it's woman 60 in her late 60s.

471
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,100
 She snorting Coke and one day she goes,

472
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,500
 I gotta break a window, I gotta break a window,

473
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,700
 gotta break a window.

474
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,060
 And she goes and she busts the window.

475
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,780
 Oh, that felt so good.

476
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,540
 That felt almost as good as Coke,

477
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,620
 but here, let me compare that again.

478
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,740
 Doesn't Coke, she's like, no, Coke's way better,

479
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,060
 but she doesn't stop there.

480
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,140
 She ends up doing, so remember,

481
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,060
 this story takes place in the early 1900s.

482
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,980
 She ends up doing $50,000 worth of all the time money,

483
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,220
 damage, just breaking windows, all over town.

484
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,220
 She was known as not just the Black River Falls

485
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,740
 window smasher, she was known as

486
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,540
 the Wisconsin window smasher.

487
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,140
 There was no one in the entire state

488
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,220
 who smashed windows as good as she did.

489
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,340
 Jailed 100 times eventually shipped off to an insane

490
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,540
 asylum, that's the last anyone ever heard of her.

491
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,260
 You're like, Jason, that's not too weird.

492
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,380
 I smashed windows, no, no, I'm sure you do

493
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,700
 smash windows on the weekend, it is quite satisfying,

494
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,540
 but let's move on.

495
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,020
 Famous opera singer moves into town,

496
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,340
 singing through the streets, oh, they get noise everyone.

497
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,940
 But opera singer says, you know what I'm gonna start doing?

498
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,780
 I'm gonna start as a hobby making homemade Ouija boards.

499
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,500
 Oh, it's pretty creepy, right?

500
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,740
 But it doesn't stop there, according to reports,

501
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,740
 which is a very vague way to say that

502
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,180
 when I run on the internet, one day this opera singer

503
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,020
 is walking through the streets of Black River Falls.

504
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,980
 Just (mimics opera singer)

505
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,220
 They can see from behind his shoulders are kind of moving.

506
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,020
 Like, he's walking away, he's supposed to be,

507
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,700
 okay, you can tell he's eating from behind,

508
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,900
 is what I'm trying to say.

509
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,940
 And then he turns around and he's just eating chicken.

510
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,540
 And you're like, that's not scary,

511
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,140
 I eat chicken all the time.

512
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
 But do you eat live chickens?

513
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,500
 This guy went crazy from making Ouija boards

514
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,140
 and then would just pick up chickens

515
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,340
 as he walked down the street and eat them.

516
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,580
 And you go, Jason, what's the most?

517
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,260
 Like, how many chickens are walking through the street?

518
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,380
 How many chickens could you possibly find

519
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,220
 just walking through the street?

520
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,700
 Ah, let me move on to this next story.

521
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,860
 There was this guy who had a farm named Sheldon Farm.

522
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,580
 So I'm pretty sure his name was Sheldon.

523
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,660
 Either first year or last name.

524
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,020
 Again, so a lot of these reports are old,

525
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,860
 so we don't have a ton of information on him.

526
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,380
 But one day he comes out of his house,

527
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,380
 looks at his farm, 18 headless chickens laying in the ground.

528
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,380
 - Fuck.

529
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
 - Actually, they wouldn't be doing that

530
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,700
 'cause they don't have heads.

531
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,700
 Now he thinks that Satan worshipers have attacked his farm.

532
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,380
 That Satan himself has led them here

533
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,780
 to chop off all these chicken heads.

534
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,580
 It would seem ritualistic that their heads were chopped off.

535
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,220
 So this is where the insanity starts.

536
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,980
 What would you do if you came out

537
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,780
 and you saw 18 chopped off chickens heads?

538
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,140
 You didn't see the heads, you just saw the bodies.

539
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,660
 You walk out of your, well, if you did it,

540
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,620
 you don't know the farm, you'd be like,

541
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,680
 "Where did all these chickens come from?"

542
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,540
 But if you owned a farm and you walked out

543
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,040
 and you saw a bunch of headless chickens dead,

544
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,260
 you would go, "Dag, nav it, damn Satanists came back,

545
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,940
 and probably good old hoof foot is back as well."

546
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,900
 And then go and clean up all the chickens

547
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,740
 and go about your business.

548
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,980
 He thought the only way to get rid of the devil

549
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,520
 was he just burned his property down, just torched it all.

550
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,180
 So now he's homeless and his business is gone.

551
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,620
 And the funniest part is,

552
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,980
 is that we know who chopped off the chicken heads.

553
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,740
 Apparently, off in the forest, there was a 50 drifter.

554
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,620
 So I mean, basically, that is like a division

555
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,320
 of homeless people had come through his farm

556
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,620
 and chopped off the chicken heads

557
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,220
 and then left and ate them.

558
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,340
 But here's my question.

559
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,820
 Why would you leave the chicken?

560
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,620
 Like, wait a second.

561
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,360
 Now I'm thinking I might have read this wrong.

562
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,680
 Maybe they left the heads and took the chickens.

563
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,240
 But the way I read it was that they were eating chicken heads

564
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,520
 in the woods.

565
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,280
 And then one of the homeless people go,

566
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,960
 "Hey, I think we got this backwards.

567
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,020
 We went through all this trouble

568
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,400
 and we just got a little tiny piece."

569
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,320
 And they were like, "Oh, yeah, right.

570
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,120
 We should have grabbed the whole chicken."

571
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,440
 I think he came out and found just 18 chicken heads.

572
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,280
 I think.

573
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,560
 Anyways, he freaked out.

574
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,600
 He went insane.

575
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,720
 He thought the devil was there.

576
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,460
 Burn his whole farm down, burn his house down,

577
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,300
 got rid of it.

578
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,580
 One woman, she had a sore on her back.

579
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,740
 She's like, "Oh, I think I have cancer.

580
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,820
 I think I have this lump on my back, which is sad.

581
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,180
 That's a horrible thing to be afraid of.

582
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,380
 I have a friend right now who has some lumps.

583
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,420
 He thinks he might have cancer.

584
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,020
 It's terrifying."

585
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,660
 But rational person would go to the doctor.

586
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,100
 Let's say there's not a doctor in town.

587
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,580
 A rational person would just be like,

588
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,340
 "Maybe I'll get my friend to like cut it out with a knife.

589
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,180
 I don't know."

590
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,620
 She covers herself in gasoline and lights it on fire.

591
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,140
 That is not something you do

592
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,760
 if you think you have any disease at all.

593
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,880
 Oh, I have water on the brain.

594
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,120
 Well, maybe if I boiled it.

595
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,280
 No, it doesn't work like that.

596
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,040
 Fire is not a medical tool.

597
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,400
 Now, all of this, imagine all of these things.

598
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,920
 I know it just seems disconnected

599
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,040
 like it's all these stories.

600
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,880
 Imagine you are living in this town right now

601
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,280
 and you wake up and you're like,

602
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,440
 "Hey, what ever happened to Betty?"

603
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,560
 And they're like, "Oh, you didn't hear?

604
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,840
 She's lit herself on fire."

605
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,680
 What?

606
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,600
 Yeah, she thought she had cancer on her back.

607
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,800
 You'd be like, "What is going on?

608
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,880
 Well, I better go to my job at the farm here.

609
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,140
 I have 18 chickens I have to feed."

610
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,300
 And as you're walking across town and going to that farm,

611
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,340
 you're the one guy with a job.

612
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,380
 You see the farm on fire.

613
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,820
 The guy's like, "It's okay. It's okay.

614
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,020
 I destroyed the devil.

615
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,860
 Peace on earth."

616
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,100
 And you're like, "What?

617
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,020
 I see homeless people out there eating chickens."

618
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,860
 And he's like, "Nah, nah, it's an illusion.

619
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
 I killed the devil."

620
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,700
 Goes around and around.

621
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,620
 There's one little girl named Lydia Berger.

622
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,260
 We have a name for some of these people.

623
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,540
 She was 15.

624
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,380
 Dad beat her up.

625
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
 That's not funny.

626
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,700
 Dad beats her up.

627
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,300
 She goes to say to the neighbor's house,

628
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,760
 the neighbors take her in, start taking care of her.

629
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,600
 She burns their house down.

630
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,040
 And then starts burning houses down all over town

631
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,680
 until eventually she's caught and arrested.

632
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,720
 Just nutty stuff.

633
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,280
 This one actually might,

634
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,960
 this one is, this is where we start to get really, really dark.

635
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
 Those ones were quite playful.

636
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,240
 This is where, the woman burned herself alive,

637
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,440
 but this is where we start to get a little more dark.

638
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,800
 There was a guy who was named Christ Wold.

639
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,660
 He was a farmer and the bank collapsed

640
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,100
 and he was gonna lose his land.

641
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,060
 He was unemployed.

642
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,180
 He had no money.

643
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,220
 He had nothing.

644
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,420
 So he decides to take his own life.

645
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,780
 He decides to take his own life.

646
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,900
 The way he goes about it though, again,

647
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,820
 there are traditional ways.

648
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,500
 I'm anti-suicide.

649
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,700
 If you're ever having trouble with suicide or anything like that,

650
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,980
 you need to reach out.

651
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,460
 I'm against suicide.

652
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,380
 I guess when you're like at end of life type thing,

653
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,540
 that's different for me,

654
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,180
 but depression and things like that,

655
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,620
 things can always get better.

656
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,180
 I guess I have no segue from that.

657
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,180
 This guy, I just find this so bizarre

658
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,460
 that this is his go-to method.

659
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,140
 I guess it would be quite painless

660
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,700
 and a little theatrical, but still.

661
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,100
 It would seem like it would be more grim.

662
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,820
 He basically digs a hole, okay?

663
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,980
 And then puts his head in the hole.

664
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,980
 Still attached to him though.

665
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,300
 So he's laying down on the ground

666
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,780
 and he has his head in the hole.

667
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,820
 Then he grabs a piece of dynamite and lights it

668
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,060
 and throws it in the hole with his head and blows up.

669
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,220
 Now you could say, "Well, that's instantaneous, man."

670
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,660
 Yeah, but I gotta look at a wick

671
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,260
 slowly burning down a dynamite stick that.

672
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,420
 I mean, you would have to look at that.

673
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,500
 Even if you close your eyes, you would still hear that.

674
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,940
 It almost seemed to be more terrifying

675
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,420
 than any other form of suicide.

676
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,540
 Just, "And what if it was a dud

677
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,500
 and then you gotta go get another stick?"

678
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,140
 Horrible, horrible.

679
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,820
 Sorry guys.

680
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,660
 Sorry guys.

681
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,500
 You have this girl, we have her name, Sarah Smith.

682
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,340
 She died and is buried in Rosedale Cemetery.

683
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,100
 Eventually though, the cemetery gets investigated

684
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,340
 'cause they weren't doing stuff right.

685
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,820
 So they're like, "Okay, dig up all those graves.

686
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,580
 You gotta make sure you did the funeral stuff

687
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,500
 right on those graves.

688
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,540
 Dig her up.

689
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,420
 Half her hands are eaten."

690
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,860
 And they go, "Oh, yes, sorry.

691
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,660
 We buried that one alive."

692
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,860
 I guess that one's not necessarily like insanity.

693
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,540
 I think that just adds to the overall terrifying circus

694
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,860
 that was Black River Falls.

695
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,260
 Again, all of this stuff happened

696
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,820
 within a 20-year time span

697
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,220
 and I'm leaving out the child murders

698
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,820
 and the wife beatings.

699
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,340
 'Cause there was a lot of those.

700
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,260
 I'm like, I'm not even touching those.

701
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,540
 There was a lot of stories of just people

702
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,140
 just beating their kids to death

703
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,980
 or beating their wives to death.

704
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,100
 Drowning, I'm leaving all that stuff out.

705
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,900
 Anything, Lydia Berger, the 15-year-old who got beat up

706
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,980
 and then started burning stuff down,

707
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,780
 that was the lowest age that I was gonna do.

708
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,700
 And that's just basically

709
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,020
 because she became some sort of fire-based vigilante.

710
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,140
 I'm leaving out a ton of stuff.

711
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,300
 Imagine any one of these events happening in your town

712
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,220
 over the course of 20 years, people would be like,

713
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,500
 "Dude, they buried that woman alive

714
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,540
 and she bit her hands off."

715
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,780
 All of this stuff is happening in two decades, in one town.

716
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,620
 And we got a few more though, if you'll indulge me

717
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,860
 and then we'll kind of dig into what I think's behind it.

718
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,020
 Drifter, a homeless person is invited over by a family.

719
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,700
 Nice little family meal, sitting down,

720
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,340
 puts a little napkin in a shirt

721
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,820
 and he goes, "Oh, that's great. Thank you so much.

722
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
 It's such a good meal."

723
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,580
 And as they're eating, the Drifter pulls a gun out,

724
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,980
 shoots himself in the neck, dies.

725
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,820
 What? Like that is the idea of insanity.

726
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,900
 Like you have as normal as you can get in this town.

727
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,140
 A guy is invited in to have a meal

728
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,960
 and he's eating a meal with these people

729
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,020
 and something just snaps in him

730
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,300
 and then he blows himself away.

731
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,460
 Wall, everyone else is eating.

732
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,060
 Ruining their meal as well.

733
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,660
 None of those kids are gonna be able to eat spaghetti

734
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,500
 after that.

735
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,300
 Like that is a horrible thing to do.

736
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,260
 That is insane.

737
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,380
 There's a difference between like depression,

738
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,820
 which is walking out in the woods and shooting yourself

739
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,420
 and then waiting until you have an audience of a family

740
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,740
 that is feeding you and then killing yourself

741
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,140
 and then to really drive the nail home

742
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,420
 and to wrap it up with this.

743
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,700
 There was a bar in Black River Falls.

744
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,020
 Oh, I'm sure there was more than one,

745
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,060
 but there is this particular bar in Black River Falls.

746
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,300
 One day a guy walks into the bar and says,

747
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,140
 "What time is it?"

748
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,300
 And the guy told him the time and he goes,

749
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,340
 "Okay."

750
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,860
 And then he continued to drink and drink and drink

751
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,660
 and drink until he died.

752
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,420
 Now that is the bartender's fault.

753
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,900
 The bartender should have cut him off at a certain point,

754
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,700
 but the bartender also may have just been like,

755
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,500
 "I know what's outside this bar."

756
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,140
 That same bar another guy walks in later,

757
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,660
 not the same day, although that would be hilarious.

758
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,260
 I don't know how this is possible,

759
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,420
 but it's stated he ate cigar butts until he died.

760
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,100
 I don't know if he came back every day

761
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,620
 and ate nothing but cigar butts

762
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,980
 until his stomach became nothing but filter,

763
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,780
 but apparently that's what happened.

764
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,820
 He just ate, again, that is an insane way to kill.

765
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,740
 That is the definition of insanity.

766
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,820
 "Hey, what are you doing this weekend?

767
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,740
 "I'm eating cigar butts."

768
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,220
 Oh, same thing you did last weekend.

769
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,300
 Same thing I do every day too.

770
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,500
 I'm trying to kill myself eating cigar butts.

771
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,460
 Here's cigarette butts.

772
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,340
 I know that it will eventually kill me,

773
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,100
 but it just seems like it's so hard to do,

774
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,140
 although it's possible that he just

775
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,980
 shoved them all in his mouth.

776
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,860
 Jay, you're like Jason, you're just reading out.

777
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,420
 You're spending the whole episode talking about

778
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,140
 people blowing themselves up and dying in horrible ways.

779
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,220
 What does any of this have to do?

780
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,980
 Is this just you being morbid?

781
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,820
 Well, no.

782
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,980
 So here's the thing.

783
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,660
 We've talked about missing towns in the past,

784
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,660
 like Dublin, Wisconsin, and what was it?

785
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,220
 Belray, the Belray, Surge.

786
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,780
 Those are really early episodes, really early episodes,

787
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,740
 but go back and listen to those if you haven't.

788
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,500
 So we've talked about missing towns

789
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,900
 and things like that in the past.

790
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,820
 Now, both of those have basically been inconclusive.

791
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,660
 Did this town exist?

792
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,780
 Nobody knows.

793
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,460
 But we have a town that is that with documentation.

794
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,340
 This town, I'm detailing all these events

795
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,860
 because this town almost did kill itself.

796
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,860
 The written records exist because people live there today

797
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,340
 and they could be like, oh yeah,

798
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,020
 let's go through these old newspapers.

799
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,140
 But you had such rapid self-destruction in this town

800
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,500
 that the town itself very easily could have just fallen

801
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,900
 into disrepair, people leave, it wasn't worth it,

802
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,100
 and it would have been littered with these bodies,

803
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,060
 these stories, these victims of their own mind.

804
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,820
 This town would have just disappeared,

805
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,420
 been swallowed up by the wilderness,

806
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,420
 and historians would say,

807
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,260
 we can see references to a town called Black River Falls

808
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,020
 and we believe it was in this area,

809
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,020
 but all that's out there now is a burned down building.

810
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,140
 So we don't know what happened there.

811
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,220
 All we know is maybe the mills closed

812
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,380
 because we saw freak weather during that year

813
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,860
 and then everyone left.

814
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,580
 And they wouldn't have the detail of these stories.

815
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,340
 So the disappearing town phenomenon could be real.

816
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,420
 It really could be something that cities have existed.

817
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,900
 We know it happens worldwide.

818
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,500
 The question has always been is,

819
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,380
 does it happen more recently?

820
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,860
 Could it happen within the past two, 300 years

821
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,980
 of a town simply disappearing off the map

822
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,060
 and being completely forgotten?

823
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,380
 Towns do get unincorporated and just fall apart

824
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,140
 and things like that, but like a ghost town.

825
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,980
 We're talking about a town that people,

826
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,640
 forget was ever really there.

827
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,960
 This town tried really hard to prove that that's possible.

828
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,900
 This town tried really hard to destroy itself,

829
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,820
 but I, economies go bad.

830
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,300
 Okay, there's bad natural disasters.

831
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,380
 There are entire countries that suffer through economies

832
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,540
 far worse than what was happening in Black River Falls.

833
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,860
 And I believe there has to be another component to this.

834
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,860
 The madness, the insanity, and the sheer violence

835
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,500
 that took place over these 20 years

836
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,300
 in this one town is staggering.

837
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,020
 There has to be something else there.

838
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,860
 I get it, the human condition, depression,

839
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,860
 bleakness, hopelessness may drive a man crazy.

840
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,660
 May drive a woman to drown her children.

841
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,260
 But come on, I mean like this stuff is beyond the pale.

842
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,840
 It all started with rumors that those freak winters

843
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,760
 were brought by satanic worship, by demons.

844
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,840
 It all started after that first freak winter

845
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,900
 when people believed that something paranormal

846
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,120
 was happening in that town.

847
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,960
 Is it possible that the stories of Satan worshiping

848
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
 was true?

849
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,460
 Is it possible that some sort of curse was put on this town?

850
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,560
 If so, why?

851
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,320
 Who did it?

852
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,240
 But more importantly, could it happen again today?

853
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,440
 Could there be a town somewhere out there,

854
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,440
 picturesque, peaceful, that is right now on the verge

855
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,340
 of becoming the next Black River Falls?

856
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,600
