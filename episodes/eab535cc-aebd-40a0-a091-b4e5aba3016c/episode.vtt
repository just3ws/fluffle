00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.180
 Ho ho ho ho! Han Solo Jingle Donga! It's Santa Claus because it's Christmas. It's not

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.620
 Job of the Hut. It's Santa Claus and today for Dead Rabbits'

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.420
 Chrism-medically-intuced Christmas special, we have three amazing stories.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.740
 First off, what would you do if a bunch of hooligans showed up at your house

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.940
 dressed up as inverted turkeys? That's a real story. That wasn't a joke that other

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.980
 episode. Then we're gonna take a long walk through the woods. Is it possible

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.260
 we will see the future or be killed by the leprechaun? And then we travel to a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.940
 small island straight out of a horror movie. What happens when you visit a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.820
 quaint little village on the wrong day? You get the crap kicked out of you today

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.820
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:36.580
 Hey everyone, welcome back to the Christmas, the Christmas miracle episode of Dead

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.260
 Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day and I'll

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.620
 explain that in a second. I hope you guys are having a great day as well.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.260
 Let's first, we got a ton of stuff to cover. There's probably gonna be a

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.620
 longer episode. But first off, I want to bring in our newest

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.260
 Patreon supporter, Pittlepoo. Everyone give a round of applause to Pittlepoo as

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.700
 he's hang gliding in. Wee, he's doing circles above our head. He's taunting

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.140
 us with the power of flight. Pittle, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.500
 this episode. Can't support the Patreon and totally understand. Just help spread

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.780
 the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot. So, is Pittlepoo flying

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.380
 around in circles? He's getting super dizzy. He's like, "Oh man, I don't even like

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.100
 hang gliding." Let me explain to you where we're at with the show. So, the show is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.980
 coming back at the beginning of January. Today, I've released two episodes. The

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.020
 episode that was right before this one was already recorded. It wasn't edited. I

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.940
 had to go to the hospital because I had AFib. My heart went into AFib.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.420
 Once again, the doctors believe that it's caffeine and nicotine, that it was

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.020
 substances, basically substance abuse. But this time, they're sending me to a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.620
 cardiologist. Last time, they did an echocardiogram. My heart's fine. That's the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.980
 thing. They keep running all these tests. They go, "Your heart's fine. You don't have

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.340
 any blood clots. We see no problems." My biggest issue right now is they said,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.420
 "You're abusing your body with..." They didn't say that. That's dramatic.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.420
 Dr. Houston had come in and kicked my bed. He goes, "You're taking in too much

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.140
 caffeine." So, I'm going through serious withdrawals right now. I was having

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.380
 about nine to ten caffeinated beverages a day. I'm down to one. You hear the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.500
 misery in my voice? On top of that, I started using nicotine again during

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 the summer. I was ingesting about 15 to 20 nicotine

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.660
 lossanges a day. I'm down to two. So, I'm just absolutely miserable right now.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.420
 I've been sitting here for the past week just kind of being miserable,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.500
 eating a bunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for some bizarre reason.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.060
 That helps. I did want to get a Christmas episode out for you guys,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.660
 but I am going to still be taking... There's going to be no more episodes after

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.260
 these yesterday's episode that came out today. I know it's complicated, but then

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.380
 I'm still going to take some time off. I'll be back in the beginning of January.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.140
 But that... I want to let you guys know I was getting a lot of emails. I really

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.180
 appreciated the emails. Some of you guys were telling me to get better.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.900
 Some of you guys were worried. Don't be worried. Just be worried that I'm not

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.500
 going to go and beat up a chicken walking on the street because I'm withdrawing

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.260
 from nicotine and caffeine. It's rough. It's really rough. But my heart...

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
 Health-wise, I'm fine. Health-wise, I'm fine. I'm going to see my cardiologist who

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.780
 actually happened to be... I didn't know this. My cardiologist is going to be the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.180
 guy that I used to do jiu-jitsu with. So, I'm sure I'll get beat up. I'm sure he'll

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.020
 call me a wimp a couple times. "Ah, come on, you big wimp. Your heart's fine.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.300
 Dork?" But I am fine. I'm just really going through with

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.460
 drills and that was... I'm just not feeling good in that sense. But I did need to take

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.660
 time off. So, I appreciate that you guys have given that time to me.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.060
 That's enough of that medical stuff. Pushing it out of the way. Pushing over

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.580
 hospitals. Get out of our way, medical establishment. We have a story to tell.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.060
 Pitilpoo. I want you to jump off of that hang glider. I'm going to give you the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.460
 keys to the festively decorated Jason Jalopy. And it has like...

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.700
 It's just candy canes. Just candy canes hanging everywhere. And there are the...

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.940
 It has elves in the carburetor. They're just living there. They're like, "Oh, this is

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.100
 the worst story ever." That may no sense, but they're in there anyways and I'm not

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.860
 going to edit it. Go ahead. Hit the gas pedal. We are leaving behind

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.380
 Dead Rabbit Command and we are headed out to Finland.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.980
 Cars drive it. It's like the elves in the carburetor. They're completely mashed.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.540
 They're elf jelly now, but the elf jelly gives the car the power to fly.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.300
 So we're flying over the ocean. We get to Finland. Now, I do have to say this.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.620
 One, I am drinking a... I'm drinking a berry smoothie right now. So I have a lot of

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.620
 sugar in me, so I'm a little hyper. Two, I'm excited to be doing the show again,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.860
 so I'm a little hyper. And three, that doesn't have anything to do. That doesn't matter.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.260
 Somebody may have recommended this to me. I am trying really hard to figure out if

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.820
 someone recommended this to me. If you did, go ahead and let me know,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.340
 because I would have notes of it somewhere, but I may have found it on my own. But I just

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.420
 want to say, if this sounds familiar to you, I will give you credit if you did recommend it to me.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:08.820
 Jason Jalopy's flying. Elf-Elf-Ku is dripping out of the exhaust. We're headed out to

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.540
 Finland and we look at the clock and it's January 13th.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.780
 Cars landing in the snow. A bunch of kids are outthrowing snowballs and stuff like that.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.660
 And they're super excited, not because they're withdrawn from nicotine and taking too much

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.820
 sugar. They're super excited because today is nutty day. So they're like, "Nutty day,

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.300
 nutty day." They're like pushing each other, pushing each other in a pile of nuts. He's like,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.740
 "No, I'm allergic. Nutty day." Kids are dancing around and we're like, "What is nutty day?"

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.980
 And the town mayor shows up and he goes, "What? You guys don't know about nut day?"

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.580
 We're like, "We don't know what nutty day is. We probably don't know what nut day is." And he

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:55.220
 goes, "It's an old Finnish tradition, you see." So January 13th is like the day of the Epiphany.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.820
 It's like one of the days of Christmas. So Christmas is over with, obviously, but the

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.780
 tradition carries on. And in Finland, in this part of the world, don't ask me to point out,

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.540
 don't ask me to show you where Finland is at on a map. I think it's above Germany.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.540
 That's as far as I know. It's somewhere around Sweden and Dutch,

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.900
 the Netherlands and things like that. Anyways, it doesn't exist. So I don't even know why I'm

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.980
 worried about it. The mayor goes, "Let me tell you about nut day. Not only am I going to tell you

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.580
 about nut day, I'm going to tell you about nut day according to the Finnish Wikipedia."

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.780
 Now, I've covered this once before. I found the description of Cookie Monster

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:42.180
 on a Brazilian Wikipedia page. So it's not Wikipedia. So every country has its own Wikipedia,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.380
 but then you can translate it to English. And translation errors are sometimes funny.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.180
 Did you really build an entire segment around translation errors? No, no,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:59.380
 kind of. But this one's... Let me just tell you the story. So anyways, according to Finnish Wikipedia,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:10.580
 on nut day, it's January 13th and it's nighttime, a bunch of dudes show up at your house and they're

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.020
 either dressed up as nutcrackers. So they have like, they just send their jaws. They're like,

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.580
 "Maw, get my costume ready." She's like breaking their jaws open so they can lower and then get

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:27.300
 super low. They either dress up as a nutcracker. They either turn themselves into saw traps or

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:34.740
 they dress up as quote, "an old inverted turkey." I'm like, what? I was trying to think like, did

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.180
 they put like turkey carcasses on their head, but then it's inverted. So like, did they peel it

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:46.420
 inside out and the rib bones are like sticking out again, looking like a saw trap? How do you

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.060
 invert it? How do you... I can figure out. If someone said invert a turkey, I could probably figure

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:56.420
 that out, but if someone asked me to dress up like one, I mean, I'm sure I can give me a long

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.140
 and give it over an infinite scale over the until the heat death of the universe. I could probably

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.500
 do it. But these guys do it every year. They show up, they go to house to house. They knock at your

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.340
 door. So you're kind of getting it. It's like, oh, it's like Christmas in January. That's kind of

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:16.180
 dope. It's even better than that because these guys, they can get, they don't really get candy.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:24.180
 They get beer, food or money. And here's a tip. If you didn't know this, you can use money. You can

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.700
 use money to buy beer or food. If they run, oh man, I ran out of beer. Here's some money. You're

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.260
 still good. You're still good. That was the older version of it. I'm sure there's still some older

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.940
 kids dressing up as inverted turkeys. Nowadays, it is a lot like a traditional Halloween,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:46.500
 where the kids show up and they sing and they get candy. No beer for the kids, no money either.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.820
 But you know, you sing, you get candy. The kids show up and you answer the door and you go,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.860
 are the nuts going to sing? And then the kids sing, which I don't think it might actually be more

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:07.140
 irritating because one of the most irritating things in life is a child singing. Where has your

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.420
 soul gone? No, let me finish this. Let me finish this. This is one of the most irritating things in

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:22.820
 the world to me. A child singing and insisting to sing the whole song. Like I get it. Old Town Road.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:28.180
 You sing the first two. I go, it's pretty good. And then they're like, I was like, oh yeah,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.140
 you're pretty good. And then they're like starting going to the bridge. I'm like, oh my god, I get

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:37.620
 it. You can sing. You can verbalize words out of your throat. I don't need to hear the third chorus.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:45.300
 Kids just need to sing a couple lyrics. Tick tock, seven seconds, like a tick tock video.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.500
 And then I'll give them some candy. That irritates me when kids keep singing. It's a weird pet peeve

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:57.940
 of mine. I get it. I was never a fan of kids incorporated. I was like, no, shut it off

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.820
 after seven seconds. Anyways, that would irritate me. I would move. So what is nutty day? It's a

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:08.820
 real holiday. The inverted turkey. Because then I went to the English version of Wikipedia to find

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.460
 out if any of this madness was true. An inverted turkey was a translation error. They dressed up

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:22.100
 as goats, which is actually less terrifying as opposed to a turkey turned inside out. But a goat

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.980
 man. A goat man is pretty scary knocking on your door. So that is a good costume. I would give that

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.860
 guy beer to get him away. The tradition still exists. It's changed into this childlike version

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:40.180
 of Halloween meets Christmas. But nutty day starts with the kids demolishing everything Christmas

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:46.340
 related in their house. First off, they eat all the ornaments. Not like the glass ornaments.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:52.180
 You know, like all the edible ornaments. The popcorn, tin soul, and like the candy canes.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:58.100
 The kids, they have to wait. They have to wait till January 13th. So all that stuff is super stale

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:06.100
 at that point. Super grocers, ants, and the popcorn. But that, you eat all the edible decorations off

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:12.180
 of the Christmas tree. Then they go to the gingerbread house that they've built. Again,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:17.860
 they built it before Christmas. They probably built that. Like on the 20th, at this point,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.980
 this thing is half a month old. They don't eat it. They don't eat the gingerbread house though.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:29.540
 They smash it. They smash it to pieces. They just pound it into dust. And then they might be able

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:35.060
 to eat the dust. I'm not for sure. They leave one gingerbread man to witness all of the destruction,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.140
 and then they save him till next year. They put him in the cupboard and said, "Tell your people

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.060
 what happened to her." And then they shut the cupboard. They shut the cupboard door, and there's

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:49.860
 a bunch of other gingerbread men from past Christmases locked in the darkness. So they don't torture

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:55.300
 the gingerbread population. And then to end it all off, that's not enough, right? Eating your

00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:01.140
 Christmas tree, destroying your house, a gingerbread house, not your own house. They then take their

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.900
 Christmas tree and they get rid of it. And you're like, "Yeah, of course, they just don't like

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:11.060
 keep that." They throw it out their window. Now, you could say, "Yeah, Jason, it's not like

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:16.900
 fall guys. It's not like a stuntman." They open the window up. They throw it out. They do. They

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:23.380
 don't make it smash through their window. However, they usually go to the second story of their house

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:31.060
 and throw it into the street. They just left it there. So by January 13th, towns in Finland

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.180
 would be littered with Christmas trees, not my problem. Someone else would have to pick them up.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:45.300
 That tradition just ended like 10 years ago. Up until the early 2000s, people were still throwing

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.620
 Christmas trees off of second or third-story buildings if you're really rich. You have a third

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:54.100
 story, fourth story. That's only for Bill Gates. But you throw these Christmas trees out of your

00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:01.780
 house. That signifies the end of Nutty Day. So that's a nutty way to spend Christmas. Am I right,

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:08.020
 guys? Am I right? And everyone's just kind of like, "You waited 15 minutes to tell that pun."

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:15.060
 I did. But what I didn't wait for was my blood sugar to go down because I'm obviously still hyper.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.700
 Pitilpuk, haul in that Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're going to say goodbye to this Finnish town as

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.380
 we're dodging Christmas trees getting thrown at us. Take us up, up and away in that Dead Rabbit

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.380
 Durgible. We don't have a far way to go, I don't think, because again, I'm probably for sure

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:31.380
 where it sat on the map, but I'm pretty sure it's close. We're leaving behind Finland. We're headed

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:39.620
 out to Sweden. I guess this is another story, I gotta be honest. I'm pretty sure I found it on

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.500
 my own. I've been sitting on these stories for a long time. I came across these stories like in

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.060
 June, but I wanted to say them for a Christmas episode. But a lot of times people send me stuff

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.980
 from other countries and I kind of stumble across stuff as well. Stefan might have sent

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.740
 this to me, I'm not for sure. But if you sent these stories to me, let me know, I'll make it up to you.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:02.340
 Pitilpuk, take us over the scenic ice-capped mountains of Sweden. You see those little towns

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:07.220
 down there? Just pick one. Just pick any one of them. This is a celebration going on tonight.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:13.460
 It's New Year's Eve. Pitilpuk is perfectly navigating the Dead Rabbit Durgible through the

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:22.580
 darkness. Down on the ground we see people going, "New Year's Eve song, what's the New Year's Eve song?"

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.820
 We don't know. Pitilpuk is bringing that Dead Rabbit Durgible down. We're in Sweden. It's New

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:34.420
 Year's Eve. Most of this, really all this information I got from an article on Atlas Obscura written by

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:40.580
 Kelly Cattlefamon. So thank you so much Kelly. Amazing article, amazing story. I wanted to

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:46.420
 give you credit for that. We find ourselves outside of this town in Sweden. It's New Year's Eve.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.940
 It's midday, coming close to the evening dusk. We see a man leave his house and start to walk

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.940
 into the woods surrounding the town. We start to see a bunch of people leave their houses,

00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:02.660
 and all of them head off into different directions into the woods around town. We can do this too.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:07.300
 We're going to pick a direction. We're going to keep on walking. Eventually civilization

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.980
 disappears. We're walking through the woods. You've got a couple of rules on this walk. No technology.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:19.380
 No iPod. You can't even bring your phone with you. Quite dangerous to us city slickers. Even if you

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:26.340
 were allowed to have a phone on you, you can't talk. You can't eat. You can't drink. You can't

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:32.340
 tell a single person where you're going. But it doesn't matter because everybody knows the purpose

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:42.020
 of this walk. You are doing the Ars Gong. It's an ancient Swedish tradition. What it is is that on

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.980
 New Year's Eve, you have to leave your house. If you want to do the tradition, you have to force

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:52.260
 out a bunch of guards. You're pushing them out. They're like, "Do the Ars Gong." If you want to do

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.580
 this, you have to leave your house. You have to walk out into the wilderness. The point is to

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:03.060
 eventually reach a local church or a graveyard. You go, "Well, Jason, there's one of those right

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.340
 around the corner. Can't I just go? Do I really have to do a giant U-shape walking in the woods?"

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.460
 Yeah, dude. Yeah. You can't just walk down the street, slurping on a milkshake, and go to the

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:18.500
 graveyard. It's about the journey. So even if you have to go out into the woods only to double back

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.940
 at some point to reach that graveyard, that is the journey. So why would you do this? You walk

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:32.180
 to see the future at the point of New Year's Eve, right before New Year's Day. The new timeline is

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:41.140
 being created. On this walk, you will have visions of what the new year will bring. You may see success.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:46.900
 You may see the death of a loved one. You may actually see your own death. So the journey is

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:53.540
 what allows the visions to take place. You just walk over there, like just cut a bunch of corners

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.180
 to get there. Then you're not really going to experience the visions. But the visions come at

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:03.620
 a cost. So we're all walking through the woods together. And I have a special bubble around

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.460
 me so I can talk. I can break all these rules I'm eating. It's like a red chicken. I'm like,

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.180
 I'm eating it. I'm wiping my fingers on the side of the bubble. I continue to talk.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:19.060
 As we're walking through the woods here, look for movement around you. You may see something

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:27.140
 hiding behind the tree. That might be a promotion. You might work for Reptilians Incorporated.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:34.340
 And that was your boss. You may see the image of a beautiful bride standing behind a rock. And you

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.980
 go, oh, maybe that means I'm going to get married. And you start to rush off to behind that boulder.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.700
 And then there's nothing there. So you're like, does that mean I'm not getting married? Well,

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.100
 I don't know whether or not you're getting married. But this is what's weird about this.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.220
 You'll see the, everything's weird about it. A man's eating Kentucky Fried Chicken

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:59.140
 in a bubble explaining to you an ancient Swedish tradition. But you'll see these visions behind

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:05.540
 trees in underneath rivers and things like that. But some of them will tell you the future. And some

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.820
 of them will kill you because there's a bunch of monsters hiding in the woods as well. They're

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:16.660
 watching you. This is the time they know they want to get some sweet, sweet human flesh.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.220
 Everyone's going to be walking in the woods this night. It's basically Blair Witches Match.com.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:26.580
 They'll try to distract you. They'll try to actually take you off course. So if you ran

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:31.060
 around the boulder to see that pretty young bride, it could be a goblin. It could be a

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.140
 bunch of goblins standing on each other's shoulders wearing a wedding dress. Maybe.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.860
 It could have actually been your bride. You don't know. You won't know until you run over there.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.740
 You won't know. But most of the time, you might see a vision of the future, but there's a whole

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:49.620
 bunch of creatures trying to throw you off the track. The creatures are also there to make sure

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.740
 you follow the rules. If you're walking through the woods and you actually encounter another person

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.820
 on the Arsgong, you can walk with them. But you can't talk. You can't say anything. Just walk

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.340
 with them. You can take the journey with them, but you can't really interact with them in any sort

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:10.660
 of way. And because we've had stories of people meeting up and going on this walk together,

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.980
 we've been able to learn what some of the penalties are for breaking the rules.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.780
 One of them is you go insane, which you really don't need a witness for that.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.340
 Someone goes, "bye, honey. I'm going to go try to see the future." And hopefully,

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:29.140
 you don't get away laid by a bunch of monsters. "bye, honey." And then he comes back and he's

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:35.380
 insane. You're like, "oh, I guess that didn't go so well." Some people get their heads distorted.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.220
 I don't know what that means. That's an actual quote. They get their heads distorted. They're the

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.580
 fant- fantastical side of me, thanks. Like, someone walks into the woods and they come out. Maybe

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:51.220
 they have like one of their eyes as moved slightly up. They look like sloth or something like that.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:57.460
 The true crime version of me makes me think that God got his head bashed in by some brute with the

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:03.540
 club. That'd actually be a great place if you were going to be a serial killer to go to a place

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:08.420
 where a bunch of people are always walking around in the woods and if people just disappeared or

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:13.700
 went insane, they'd go out and the police aren't going to investigate it. They're like, "oh, they

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.860
 just probably got attacked by a bunch of goblins in a wedding dress. I don't know." If I was going

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:23.860
 to be a serial killer operating in any area, I would choose this place or the edge of a volcano,

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:30.020
 because I would never be caught. I'd never be any bodies, but they would. The cops would probably

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:35.620
 wonder why there's always this Jason-shaped silhouette on the edge of a volcano. They're like,

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.980
 "we do have a lot of missing people up there." And that guy did say on his podcast that he liked

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:47.860
 pushing people. I never said I liked it. Jury, jury, your honor, I never said I liked pushing

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.420
 people into a volcano. I'm just saying if I was a serial killer, I would either kill people in

00:21:52.420 --> 00:22:00.100
 Sweden or the edge of a volcano. But that aside, that aside, where I don't remember where it was at,

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.060
 oh yeah, distorted head. So I don't know if people are coming out and just like they're cross-eyed for

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:12.900
 a couple days or if they've been brained by some maniac with a pumice club. It could be one of the

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:19.380
 two. We do actually have a live version. Like we have a witness who saw what happened when someone

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:25.460
 broke one of these rules. Here's this story. It's from a book called Folklife in Sweden. These two

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:31.540
 dudes are walking, walking doing the arse gong. The force can pull all sorts of tricks on you.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:37.140
 It wants you to fail. It wants you to fail at this. Two guys are walking. They didn't really know

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:43.700
 each other. There's a stream. And as they're walking, the stream starts to get darker and darker.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:52.180
 It's no longer spring water. It's wine. And one of the guys gets down on all fours. He cups his hands.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:59.300
 He's spaghetti. He's spaghetti. He cups his hands and he's drinking the wine, which is one of the

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.620
 rules you're not supposed to do. Not supposed to drink. He drinks it and then he turns to the other

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:12.100
 guy and goes, "Now the water is wine!" And a voice deep within the wine filled depths goes,

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:19.780
 "And your eyes are now mine!" And these hands shoot out and rip the dude's eyeballs out.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:27.380
 I don't think he was trying not to laugh. He's like, "Oh, that's ticklish."

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.220
 That's something that happens in the Leprechaun movie. I'm not going to say it's not dope,

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:37.300
 because I love the Leprechaun movies. They're my favorite. Leprechaun and Final Destination are my

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:42.100
 favorite horror movie franchises. But that's pretty clever. It's pretty clever. I'm sure that little

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.020
 monster man or whatever was down there the whole time was saying, "I hope he says something I can

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.580
 rhyme with." Hope he wasn't like, "Wait a second! That doesn't make sense now that I think about it."

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:56.580
 Because that homeboy was speaking Swedish. So when it rhymed, it would be like flunkin,

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:01.460
 dunkin, something. And then the creature would be like, "Your eyes, your eye, I'm gonna eat your eye!"

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:09.620
 Like it wouldn't rhyme. It wouldn't rhyme. Man! I don't even want to finish this story now. Anyways,

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:14.660
 I will... Oh yeah, yeah, this one was pretty dope. I will finish this, because this one's actually

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.460
 better. There's another story. This guy was out for a walk. You saw some... Because it can... Again,

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:26.500
 it's all about distracting you. So, sure, getting your eyeballs ripped out. It's pretty big distraction.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:31.140
 I don't think you're gonna finish your walk. But this guy, he didn't drink the wine, he didn't

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:36.900
 follow the goblins in the wedding dress, he didn't let anything bug him. But he saw...

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.860
 Unusual sight. This would distract anyone. He saw a bunch of rats pulling a cart of hay. So it's like

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:50.180
 a little cart of hay, regular sized rat, and they're pulling it across the ice. But even that

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:55.140
 doesn't distract him. That doesn't distract him at all. He's like, "Okay, you see one rat pulling hay?

00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:00.020
 You see them all. I'm on a quest to find out what the future is." Then we get this passage. Quote,

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:08.180
 "One of the rats slipped on the ice and fell on his back, while farting so loudly. It could be heard

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:14.980
 across the whole parish." That's... That's gonna distract you, right? The guy laughed really,

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:21.860
 really loud. This rat farted, and he didn't get to see the future. He didn't get to see the future,

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:28.260
 but he didn't get to see a rat slip and fart. That's all the future. That's all the future you need.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:33.460
 That story you can tell forever. Yeah, sure. You'd be like, "Yeah, the grains are gonna grow. You might

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.100
 die. You might die." They're like, "What? We want to know." I don't know, but I got to see a rat fart.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:44.020
 I know if rat fart so loud, everyone in town heard it. Actually, he probably farted. He probably

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.940
 farted, and then he comes back to town. They're like, "Dude, Johan, what happened?" He's like,

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.380
 "It wasn't me. It was the rat." There's actually a video game based on this,

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.220
 which you can download. It'll be in the show notes. I would play it. It's for the Apple,

00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:01.140
 Apple phone. I don't have those. If you do, though, you can play that. But let's say you don't want

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:06.180
 to walk out in the forest. Let's say there's no forest around you. There is another Swedish tradition

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:11.700
 you can do. If you take the porridge spoon, okay, you have to have porridge. It's not as easy as

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.980
 that. You have to prepare porridge, but if you know how to do that, I think it's just oatmeal,

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:23.220
 right? Oatmeal with yogurt. You take porridge and you take a porridge ladle, it's porridge spoon.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:29.140
 You walk around your house three times counterclockwise. Before Christmas dinner,

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.180
 then you'll see the future. So if you can't run through the forest and have your eyeballs ripped

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:40.420
 out or outrun me as I'm throwing lava at you or hearing rats fart, just make some porridge,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.820
 walk around your house counterclockwise three times. It will tell you the future. So you can

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:51.460
 do that. That is how you can play that at home. But we got one more thing to cover here, guys.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.940
 This episode is a Christmas episode. We're going a little long.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:27:01.060
 Pittle poo. Let's put you in the seat of that carbonicopter. It is festive as well. Candy Canes.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:06.420
 That's all it is. It's just candy canes. All the instruments are made out of gumdrop. So if you

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:12.980
 can fly, I hope you can fly only using visuals. We are leaving behind Sweden and we are headed out to

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:20.260
 the Netherlands. This one was a recommendation. I do know who recommended it to me.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:25.220
 Patron of the show, Rolf. Amazing story. Thank you so much for the recommendation. And

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.780
 it's quite spooky. We're going to end this Christmas episode on a spooky one.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:37.780
 Pittle poo is flying. Now we're going to land right here, right on the Netherlands,

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:43.060
 which is like a country place. But then there's like islands off the side of it.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:50.500
 So not geography. And the reason why I wanted you to land here, Pittle poo, is because part of the

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:59.540
 story is we have to take this ferry. So we see this boat. Coming towards us. Sorry for those of you

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:05.380
 who are sleeping. Ferry is coming towards us. Now it's December 5th. It's every December 5th.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:10.180
 This isn't any particular December 5th. As we're getting on the ferry, we're handed a note.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.340
 Every person getting on the ferry says "warning." I don't know if it said "warning," but it said

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:21.540
 "attention, maybe it's more polite than that." There's a festival going on on the island of Ameland.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:28.740
 Don't come. Don't come this weekend. Find something else to do. Go into Sweden, get your eyeballs ripped

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:35.620
 out. Just don't come this time of year. You're sincerely the Ameland Bureau of Tourists. And

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:42.660
 we're like "what?" Now they don't prevent us from going, but they highly suggest we don't go.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:48.740
 Mainlanders don't come to the island. I nod to Pittle poo. He knows what to do. He's choking out

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.460
 the captain of the ferry, putting on his clothes. We now have control of... We didn't need to do that.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.900
 They would take us there anyways, but we now have control of the ferry. We are headed to Ameland.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:08.740
 It's a tiny little island. Population 3600. That's super small. But on December 5th, it's the week

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.900
 of the celebration.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:20.100
 Berries getting closer to this island. It's like 3 in the afternoon. It's not super spooky,

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:25.780
 but with the right cinematography, without the right filmmaker, it looks super spooky. December

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:32.500
 4th, December 5th is when this is happening. We get there, people see us. They're kind of pissed

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:38.820
 off that we're there. We see a bunch of kids walk on to the ferry. They're like "papa, papa, papa, papa's

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:44.580
 the captain of the ferry. Where is he?" We're like "Pittle poo's ditching the clothes real quick."

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:50.100
 I don't know. He's staying on the mainland. "Papa, is the kids opening the door to the cabin? We're

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.380
 running off." But it doesn't matter whether or not we just kill this guy. Nobody wants us there

00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:02.020
 anyways. They don't want mainlanders there. December 4th, December 5th. We get there, we start to notice

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:09.620
 it's probably like four now. We bought a bunch of train kids. There's not a lot of women on this island.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:16.420
 Well there are, but every time we see one they're running away from us. It's not just because

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:22.020
 the cops are looking for us for murdering a captain. The town is empty and of women.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:29.540
 Children too. We see them kind of running away into their houses. And then there's a period of

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:36.340
 time where it seems like there's nobody on the streets but us. It's 5 p.m. It's kind of dark now.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.260
 Walking through the streets of this little town.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:46.820
 We hear off in the distance.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:56.180
 From another part of town. What was that? Sounds like a man trying to imitate a goat horn.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:05.460
 We're hearing these goat horn sounds all over town. There's no women. There's no children.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:15.220
 There's horrible noises coming from all around us. It's 5 p.m. Soon Klaus has begun.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:24.020
 This is a bizarre phenomenon. It's 100% real. And up until very recently nobody knew about it if

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:29.940
 he didn't live on the island. It's an ancient tradition and the island's not super far off the

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.500
 coast. It's not like the island of Dr. Moreau in the middle of nowhere. It's your fairy. We just

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.900
 take a fairy there all day long. But they've done a really good job at keeping it under wraps.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:45.220
 Rolf was saying most people in the Netherlands don't even know about it. But recently a couple

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:50.740
 like Weiss did an article on it. A couple of journalists have gone there. They heard rumors.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.220
 They went there with cameras. We're taking pictures. I guess I should say this too. I forgot this detail.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:01.140
 The journalists tend to get harassed when they cover this. If I don't come back in January,

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:08.580
 if you find me like under layers and layers of goat fur somewhere out in the middle of some field,

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:14.260
 I probably just had a really good nap. I became a fur trader and quit the podcast. Or I was waylaid

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:21.540
 by Suntan Klaus. But so this is a real thing people still don't know a lot about. And you get in

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:28.980
 trouble if you talk about it. It's a secret society/Christmas celebration. Here's the rules.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.420
 As we're now hiding inside. Here's the rules. We're peeking out and we see this stuff.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:40.740
 If you're a man on this island, you spend a couple months putting together your outfit.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:47.220
 And you have to have an outfit that's so ornate that no one else in town can recognize you. It's a

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:53.220
 town of 3,600 people. So that's pretty. You got to go through a lot of effort to make sure no one

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.180
 recognizes you in such a small town. Also, the costumes are matching. So you run with like five

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:03.620
 other dudes. So you guys may all be like the knocky knocks and you guys will dress up like giant

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:11.220
 doorknobs. They don't do that. It's just like they wear a mask and a big giant robe. But they are

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:16.580
 creepy. They are creepy costumes. I don't know why I thought they would dress like doorknobs but

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.860
 or they call them knocky knocks. Anyways, the point is that they all have matching costumes.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.820
 There are photographs of this. Traditions thing going on. For who knows how long. There's maybe

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:32.260
 10 photographs of these. You can see them in the show notes. You can see a couple of hidden camera

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.500
 things going on as well. So I'm running with my boys. We're the knock knocks. We're all the knock

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.780
 knock crew. And we would walk through town blowing our goat horns and then we come across another

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:47.700
 group of people. Now no one can recognize anybody, which is fine. That's kind of part of the tradition.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:53.380
 It's an old fertility right. But remember the first thing, I maybe don't remember. I didn't see this

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:59.860
 part yet. It's only men. Women and children are not allowed to take part in this. At 5 p.m. every

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:05.140
 woman, every child needs to be inside. The streets belong to the men. So let's say the knock knock

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:11.780
 boys are coming down the street and we see the goobagos. Now we don't know who they are. It's

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:18.020
 all these people dressed up. So how do we tell whether or not they're men? Well a firm handshake,

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:26.420
 you know, you can do that. Or the quote that Rolf sent me was "Inspect their undersides."

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:35.060
 So I don't know if they're just like grabbing or that's what they're doing, right? I don't think

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.860
 there's really any other way if someone's wearing a majestic robe to tell whether or not they're

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:45.220
 a male or a female. But once they are all done grabbing each other's junk, then they move on to

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:52.260
 the next group of guys. I'm sure most of it is a firm handshake, but who knows. We're not allowed.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:56.100
 We're not allowed to go over and test it. I personally don't want to. I'm not really good at

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:01.540
 costumes. I'd wear my Chewbacca onesie. If you guys all want to buy Chewbacca onesies, we can go

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:09.220
 rolling up there. But anyways, so that's how they check. Man, you dude. Yes, yes, shake hands,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:16.100
 grab each other's junk. But what happens if it's a kid or a... if it's a kid, they're going to prison,

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:21.700
 right? If it's a kid, they're like, "Aw, man, celebration's over. The cops coming." They

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:27.700
 arrest that guy. If it's a kid, if it's a woman, they have sticks, not the women and the kids.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:33.300
 See, they're supposed to be inside, but if they're roaming around, they're called "clousmen."

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:39.380
 They're called "clousmen," and that means "clous' uncles." They're basically like... I know this is

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:46.900
 out of order, but my sugar's wearing out. They're basically like Santa Claus' helpers. But they

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.860
 beat you up if you're a woman or a kid. So they have sticks that are wrapped in cloth, and if they

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:57.300
 come across like a random woman walking down the street, they beat her up with sticks. Or if they're

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:03.060
 being less evil, they pick her up. Well, here's the thing. The sticks are covered in cloth, so the

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:09.220
 point isn't to do lasting damage. I wouldn't want to get hit with a stick, no matter how much cloth

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:13.700
 was wrapped in it, but I definitely wouldn't want this other thing. Apparently in this town,

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:21.140
 there's huge open pits of wet liquid cow poop. They pick women up and they throw them into the

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:26.580
 cow poop. So if I had to choose between the two... Because here's the thing. Here's the thing. If

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:31.940
 I was a woman, I would totally be Lisa Simpson. I would totally be like, "What? Society says I

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:36.340
 can't do that? Well, then I'm gonna do that." So when I was reading this, I thought, "What would I

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:43.380
 rather do? Have someone hit me with a stick wrapped in cloth or to get a face, a whole body full of

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:51.300
 warm wet cow poop?" Dry cow poop? I could do that all day long. I get back up and like,

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:57.860
 "Let's go around too." But if it's wet and it's like a puddle, it's like a pit of it. It's not just

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.740
 like, "Whoops, I slipped. I'm taking the stick." But then I think I'm kind of diminishing the stick

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.780
 a bit because while they'll like, hit you with it, which again, it sucks. It's not good that they're

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:12.580
 running around with sticks and hitting women. You have to think, are they actually beating

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:17.380
 these women with this? This story took a dark turn. That's why they don't want people going there.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:22.740
 So they don't want people going there. We have stories of them attacking cars with these sticks

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.860
 and they demolish the cars. The mayor, because you're not supposed to have any lights on during

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.820
 this whole thing. No street lights, no lights coming. Your blinds have to be perfectly closed.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:38.900
 The mayor of town was driving through town and he's trying to get home and he's like, "I gotta go home.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:43.300
 I'm obviously a dude. I just don't have my costume on yet. I gotta go home and put it on." And they're

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:47.620
 like, "Shut off your headlights." And he's like, "No, I'm the mayor of town." They destroyed his car

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:53.380
 in four minutes. Do you remember that bonus stage in Street Fighter II? They did that in real life

00:37:53.380 --> 00:38:01.220
 with sticks. So I don't want to... In my mind, I imagine they're just like

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:08.340
 slapping the women on the butt with the sticks, but they did dismantle a BMW in four minutes

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.540
 with these sticks. The reason why I don't think they're actually kicking the crap out of these

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:17.380
 women is because the point of it is, is this fertility ritual. The women have to stay in

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:23.060
 the house from five to seven fifteen. Can't do anything. And then at seven fifteen, they all go

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:28.820
 to a communal hall and the dudes show up with their sticks and they either hold the stick out and the

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:34.180
 girl jumps over it or they tap the girl on the heel and the girl has to dance for them. There's

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:38.100
 a lot of footage of that and the girls are smiling and the kids are playing with toys and stuff like

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:43.940
 that. So it's really hard to piece this stuff together. So I don't know how much beating is

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:51.220
 going on. No, no, any is bad. Any is bad. Again, I'm not trying to defend these guys at all. I

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:57.780
 find it absolutely bizarre. What I find creepy is that this has gone on for so long and they've been

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:02.820
 able to keep it hidden this long. And when I was doing the research on it, there was an article

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:07.700
 and they go, "No, after we publish this, we begin getting threatening letters from people." So I

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.780
 had to take it down and they said, "The reason why we're keeping these photos up is it was a public

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:17.940
 place, it wasn't a private." They're really trying to shut it down. They're really trying to keep this

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:23.700
 ritual hidden and it could be because it seems to be so violent against women or they may not even

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:28.820
 care about that. They may be trying to keep it under wraps because it's just this old hidden tradition

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.060
 and they want to keep it that way. But if something could happen just a few miles,

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:40.580
 a few miles off the coast in a town that you could visit 364 days a year and not know anything

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:47.380
 about it, but you're there on that night, that's bizarre. It sounds like something out of the

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:52.740
 Wicker Man. It sounds like something out of just a horror movie. There actually is a horror movie

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:58.500
 based on this, but it's in another language and I didn't want to watch it. But it's funny because

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.780
 you watch those movies and you go, "Oh, it's kind of cool. The ritual or Midsummer and things like

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:09.860
 that." But to think that it's real, to think that it's real, that it is violent, that it's happening

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:15.780
 today, it really makes you wonder how many other events like this are happening around the world.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:21.620
 And I know that seems very trite, but in the internet age, the fact that it was up until maybe

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:27.220
 five or six years ago, this was hidden. Even now most of the sources I had to have translated,

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:34.180
 so it's not widespread. How many other small towns in America or small town in Bolivia or small

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:40.740
 town in Russia or small town in Australia has this bizarre ritual that one night a year or one

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:49.300
 night every 10 years, whatever, the town changes. It becomes a dark reflection of itself and visitors

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:58.740
 are not welcome. It sounds like a direct to DVD horror movie, but in fact it is a centuries-old

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:04.100
 Christmas tradition. And I can think of no better way to end Dead Rabbit Radio's second annual

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:15.860
 Christmas special than one that includes Santa Claus, violence, madness, and warm, wet cow poop.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:22.420
 Dead Rabbit Radio, gmail.com is going to be your email address. You can also

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:27.300
 hit us up at facebook.com/deadratvoradio. Twitter is @deadratvoradio.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:31.140
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast. You don't

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:35.140
 have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today. I'll be back in January.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:42.100
 I love you guys. Have a safe and merry Christmas. Happy holidays. All of that. I love you guys.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:51.060
 Bye.
