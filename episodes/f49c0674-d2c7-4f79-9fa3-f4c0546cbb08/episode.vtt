WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 When the world needed a hero, fate sent two heroes.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.080
 Are the stories of a bizarrely dressed man

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.560
 walking around the streets of Chile,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.800
 looking like a supervillain?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.120
 True, that might actually be true.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.360
 But in this particular story, does he also play a flute?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.440
 And then we travel to Pennsylvania

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.280
 to meet a family that lives on the outskirts of town,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.120
 way up on a mountaintop.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.240
 They're just having a normal American life

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.400
 until the aliens invaded.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.020
 (upbeat music)

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.000
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.120
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.080
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.160
 Hope you guys had a lot of fun

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.480
 in between listening to the last episode

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.920
 and listening to this episode.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.160
 And if you happen to be binging them,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.960
 I hope you had a really fun minute

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.680
 as you waited for the new episode to start.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.640
 Speaking of fun minutes,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240
 he's really good at telling time apparently,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 according to the segue.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.440
 Let's give a shout out

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.720
 to our newest Patreon supporter, Reese's Pieces.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.960
 Everyone give him a round of applause.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.800
 He's back.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.320
 He used to support the Patreon a long time ago

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.120
 and he's back just as delicious as ever.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.760
 Now also holding a bunch of clocks.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.120
 Because that's his thing now

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.160
 to make the original joke make sense.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.760
 He walks in, he's juggling clocks.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.240
 He's riding a tricycle.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.640
 All the wheels are clocks.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.240
 Reese's Pieces and he's made of candy.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.400
 Reese's Pieces.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.200
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.560
 You guys can't support the Patreon

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.320
 or you guys aren't as delicious.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 It's fine too.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.920
 Just helps read the word about the show.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.600
 Really, really helps out a lot.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.680
 Reese's Pieces, let's go ahead

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.160
 and hop in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.080
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.480
 We are headed out to Jakarta, Indonesia.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.040
 (imitates engine revving)

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.320
 This story is fascinating to me

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.640
 that we're about to cover.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.840
 Because it's one of those things.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.840
 Recently I did a story and I go,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 "Hey, it was about the Army Hammer thing.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.320
 "If you didn't know, Army Hammer, famous celebrity.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.760
 "He's also a cannibal, allegedly?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.520
 "He denies it, but his DMs

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.760
 "seem to make it look like he's a cannibal."

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.240
 And apparently his ex-husband come forward

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.280
 and said, "Don't look in the basement."

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.720
 Because apparently, allegedly,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.240
 he would buy mannequins.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.040
 This guy, this story is just so weird.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.000
 He'd buy mannequins so he could practice tying them up.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.040
 Allegedly, still,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.720
 that's weird, but anyways.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.640
 So, and my thing about that story was,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.400
 why is no one in the conspiracy community

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.160
 talking about a Hollywood dude who wants to eat people?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.200
 And I couldn't figure it out.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.560
 I said, maybe it was the election.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.920
 We have this other story that should be huge news

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.800
 in the COVID conspiracy group.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.160
 This should actually be,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.640
 they should make flags of these people.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.720
 They should hire a Renaissance painter

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.160
 to go back in time, kidnapped Leonardo.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.040
 They should hire a guy to draw a mural

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.880
 dedicated to these two people.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.600
 This event that I'm about to tell you

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.440
 shatters the mainstream media's view

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.440
 on the coronavirus that also gets this channel demonetized

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.760
 and this video removed.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760
 But I totally believe in the coronavirus.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.280
 I believe it's real COVID-19.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.040
 I'll get my vaccine.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.280
 But I know there's a lot of people out there

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.400
 who don't feel that way.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.160
 A lot of people out there think it's overblown,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.720
 it's a hoax, and I don't understand

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.200
 why this story is on all of their websites.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.440
 All of them.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.960
 Let me read you this headline from The Sun.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.280
 You know you're gonna get a good headline

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.160
 when I'm reading it from The Sun.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.760
 Rona Romp.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.760
 Nurse suspended,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.400
 Army Hammer's Life from Rope?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.640
 Isn't the nurse suspended from Rope?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640
 No, no, no, no.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.000
 Suspended from the job.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.280
 Nurse suspended after stripping off PPE,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.520
 which is the personal protective gear.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.120
 I have to stop and keep cracking jokes into finding words.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.860
 Nurse suspended after stripping off PPE

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.080
 to have sex with COVID infected patient

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.460
 in hospital toilet.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.880
 So what happened was there's a nurse walks in

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.640
 to take care of this patient in Jakarta, Indonesia.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.760
 This was at the Wisma Atlet Emergency Hospital.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.080
 Sure, I'm sure they love this story getting out there.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.400
 They have a COVID ward,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.760
 and then they have the rest of the hospital.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.640
 And you have this nurse, we don't know his name,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.080
 we'll call him Jerry.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.840
 He's walking through the ward.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.680
 ♪ Do do do do do do ♪

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.200
 He's wearing all of his PPEs like the headline said.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.500
 You kind of know where this story is going.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.980
 I don't know why I'm building it up.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.700
 I don't know why I'm building up the dramatic tension.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.500
 I'm all willy.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.900
 The end of the story is he bangs this dude

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.740
 who is a patient at the COVID facility.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.140
 And the guy that he's having sex with takes photos of it.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.860
 What doesn't take photos of the act itself,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.820
 but takes, for lack of a better term, evidence.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.580
 Takes photos of like their clothes on the ground,

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.700
 like the PPE gear on the ground,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.600
 and I imagine he's like putting a Motee Con's

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.560
 being like sexy and cough cough a little coughing,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.520
 happy face.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.040
 They have sex in the hospital toilet.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.800
 Now this guy, this nurse,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.680
 knows that the patient has COVID-19.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.400
 He's in the COVID ward.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.200
 So he was there for a car accident

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.620
 and then got diagnosed later.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.880
 But apparently, I don't know if they matched up on Grindr

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.720
 or something like that,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.160
 and the location thing was all,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.760
 bing bing, and he turns and he looks

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.080
 and it's the COVID ward.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.920
 He bangs this dude.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.040
 Now there's two parts to this story.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.880
 I mean, other than that,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.020
 other than the COVID sex.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.820
 One, in Indonesia,

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.880
 they have these really strict anti-pornography laws.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.340
 So because the guy was taking photos

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.940
 and being like, "Ooh la la,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.780
 me had sexy time in the hospital,"

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.980
 they're both facing 10 years in prison.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.900
 It's like decency laws.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.420
 So now there's an Motee Con of a sad,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.180
 smiley face behind jail bars.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.900
 Like, I don't understand,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.120
 if you're in that country, you should know the laws.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.460
 But they're both facing 10 years in prison for this.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.920
 And that's just human tragedy.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.320
 That's an overblown thing.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.520
 That's an overblown sentence for that.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.320
 But this is what the real kick in the pants is.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.360
 That's what the real pull on the catheter is.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.120
 The guy has COVID, the nurse goes in, they have sex.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.120
 The nurse who was tested was not COVID positive.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.960
 The guy who was in the ward still had COVID

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.840
 after the sex that didn't cure it.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.120
 That wasn't a cure that was being promoted

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.420
 on some health site, darkoutpost.com.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.820
 It's like, if you have man on man sex,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.180
 your COVID will go away.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.300
 No, they didn't say that, that was just a joke

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.140
 'cause I don't know how litigious they are.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.420
 But it wasn't that.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.100
 The guy who had COVID, still has COVID,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.420
 but the guy who had hot, sweaty,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.200
 hospital toilet sex with him did not catch COVID.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.260
 So guys, I don't understand why this is not a rally cry.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.420
 Again, I know that COVID's far more complicated than that.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.920
 And I do believe it's real.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.080
 However, there are a lot of people who don't.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.880
 Why aren't they talking about this story?

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.960
 Why aren't they saying, hey man,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.600
 what are you gonna wear my mask at Walmart?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.160
 Two dudes had put sex in Indonesia and they didn't get it?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.200
 Well, one of them did, but he already had it.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.880
 But I can't buy grapes.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.880
 I can't buy grapes at Walmart.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.900
 What is this?

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.720
 I'm not saying that's a valid argument.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.520
 I wanna be very, very clear

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.200
 to the person who's going to delete this video.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.720
 I'm not saying that's a valid argument.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.820
 What I don't understand is why they're not making that argument.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.300
 Why is it that I can't eat inside a Taco Bell

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.420
 but these two dudes can roll around on a dirty hospital floor

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.620
 and one of them gets up and just goes home?

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.420
 He's totally fine.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.420
 So I don't understand it.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.020
 I actually, this was one of those stories

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.780
 that I sat on for a while, no pun intended.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.220
 And I thought, I thought someone's gonna start talking

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.060
 about this.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.580
 So this is gonna be big in the conspiracy theory community

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.220
 because all of those reasons I gave.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.060
 But nope.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.040
 So hopefully these guys don't do 10 years.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.120
 That's super stiff.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.600
 Again, no pun intended.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.440
 And they didn't even take photos of the sex act.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.640
 It was just like photos of like, apparently the guy was

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.040
 tweeting about how big their genitals were.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.080
 He was like, well, it was definitely bigger.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.040
 He was bragging.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.960
 There was no like actual sex stuff shown,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.800
 but that was enough.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.880
 Indonesia said, no, 10 year prison sentence for both of you.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.480
 It was gross to have sex with a COVID infected person

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.840
 inside of a hospital.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.880
 But I don't think that's,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.380
 I don't think being gross should get you 10 years in prison.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.400
 Reese's Pieces is already taking up the Dead Rabbit

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.240
 Durgeable.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.500
 He's like, no, get your own ride.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.660
 I'm sorry, it was disgusting.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.180
 I'm sorry, I joined the VHN again.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.340
 We coax him back.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.540
 We have a giant flavor Flave Clock

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.220
 that we're gonna put around his neck.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.780
 Reese's Pieces, let's put you at the helm

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.820
 of the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught, our massive battleship.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.060
 We're leaving behind the island nation of Indonesia.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.840
 We are headed out to Chile.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.180
 (explosion)

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.400
 That's the boat going over the waves.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.600
 Did you guys see that trailer for that new movie?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600
 God's Illiverse Kong.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.760
 So as Reese's Pieces is piloting the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.040
 he is taking us out to the country of Chile.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.400
 Specifically, we're going to the city of Vina del Mar.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.360
 It's a coastal city.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.480
 So the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught pulls right up to the port.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.640
 We all jump off, we're magically wearing tourist clothes.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.400
 And we're going to Valparcio.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.120
 That's the commercial section of the city.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.640
 So everyone get your cameras ready, click, click.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.820
 We're like, oh, look at Macy's.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.660
 Click, click.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.940
 Look at McDonald's running in their meat and food.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.680
 We're having a good time at Valparcio.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.680
 But then we hear a (humming)

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.440
 We all kind of turn around at the same time.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.600
 (humming)

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.920
 I think he's a scat man.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.720
 But we hear a song being played on a recorder.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.880
 (humming)

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.820
 We turn around and we're looking for the sound of a recorder.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.000
 And we see it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.340
 It's a man playing a recorder.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.900
 Like it's not a mystery at all.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.580
 Usually there's people playing the recorders.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.960
 Ah-ha, but hold on.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.500
 This man looks like a super villain.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.220
 Really, really low budget super villain.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.660
 (humming)

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.860
 He's dressed in rags.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.920
 Now not like Tom Sawyer rags,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.980
 like jeans that are a little roughed up

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.060
 and he's patches, no.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.760
 He's wearing a rag over his head.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.480
 And then he's wearing like a rag jacket.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.500
 Just rags and then rag gloves.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.060
 And then like he's just, he's just a big old rag.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.380
 It's hard to describe.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.360
 It looks like somebody threw a bunch of dirty rags

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.380
 out of a window and they just landed on someone.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.020
 You really have to look at a picture of them

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.900
 and it's kind of hard to do a podcast

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.020
 where you talk about pictures.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.240
 There's more to the narrative than just what he looks like.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.080
 But he looks like a villain.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.920
 He looks like a henchman in like some '80s cartoon

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.760
 or something like that.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.040
 He just looks like a villain.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.880
 He looks like a terrible person to hang out with.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.360
 There's nobody like singing out with a ragman, right?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.440
 (humming)

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.760
 He has rag shoes.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.840
 How do you even have, are those even shoes at that point?

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.520
 They're just rags wrapped around your feet.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.320
 He's all rags all the time.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.960
 But he has three holes cut in his mask.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.300
 And he fours eyes in his mouth.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.820
 Obviously, how else is he supposed to play the recorder?

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.860
 Now you may think, Jason,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.260
 is this some creepypasta that you found?

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.340
 There's no guy walking around

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.580
 who's made of rags and chile.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.420
 There is.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.740
 There's actually photographs of this dude.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.980
 And not like blurry photographs that someone took

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.940
 just a pile of rags laying on the ground.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.460
 They're like, hey, Jason, love your show.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.460
 Here's a pile of rags in my bathroom.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.540
 I think it's a dude.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.260
 He puts a recorder next to the pile of rags.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.460
 No, this guy's been hanging out in chile

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.140
 for the longest time.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.140
 He's there almost every day.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.540
 And he sits there and he plays as a recorder.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.240
 Now he does talk, but apparently

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.280
 there's no audio footage of him talking.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.560
 But he does speak to people.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.480
 Usually when dogs show up, he hisses at him.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.780
 He doesn't like dogs.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.640
 The dogs run away.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.480
 He does that.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.340
 And sometimes he'll just walk around following people.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.520
 Very, very unsettling man to be followed by.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.400
 Anyone playing a recorder, obviously,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.760
 has some sort of mental issues.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.220
 Then he's also all dressed in rags,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.460
 so it makes it even creepier.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.460
 And sometimes he just isn't playing music.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.540
 He'll just stand on the street corner

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.660
 staring into space.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.380
 Now it's interesting because he's real.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.220
 This is a real guy there's photos of.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.980
 He'd be similar to the cat man of Grenok.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.580
 It's like kind of a local legend, but he's real.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.500
 It'd be similar to Aki in Britain,

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.820
 who was climbing on top of muscle people.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.660
 You're like, what?

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.860
 That's so only bizarre out of context.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.900
 I'll put those in the show notes.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.580
 But just kind of weird local people.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.120
 So of course people make up origin stories for this guy.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.960
 'Cause even though he talks,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.920
 he doesn't really explain things.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.000
 So some people say that it's a fictional character.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Not that he doesn't exist.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.760
 You're like, damn Jason, no, no, no, no.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.880
 Not that he doesn't exist,

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.800
 but it's a gimmick the homeless people have come up with.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.040
 Some people say it's a homeless,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.040
 it's like a group of homeless people

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.360
 who are switching.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.160
 'Cause he's not playing the recorder good.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.200
 Let's just get that out of the way.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.000
 Don't go down there if you wanna hear a concert.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.840
 He sucks at it.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.440
 He's playing a children's instrument.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.980
 Sorry, professional recorder players,

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.540
 but it's a children's instrument.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.700
 It's made of plastic, okay?

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.140
 I don't even know if there are professional recorder players,

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.320
 but I'm sure there is one.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.320
 At least one, this guy, this guy.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.260
 So they think it may be different hobos in disguise.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.300
 Hey, Larry, let me wear the rags today.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.140
 What?

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.740
 No, these rags, these are my rags.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.940
 You go get your own rags.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.780
 They're free.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.780
 I mean, they're just rags.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.380
 You don't need any special rags.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.300
 Some people say that's a that.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.140
 Some people say it's a guy who's hideously deformed.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.840
 And what better way to take attention away from your deformity

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.640
 than to cover yourself in filthy rags, right?

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.040
 Just wear a business suit.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.880
 And everyone will be like, hey, you look really good

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.440
 'cause you're wearing a business suit.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.320
 Some people say it's just a street artist

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.520
 looking for some street cred.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.680
 It's like a Banksy, but smellier

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.080
 and playing a recorder.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.520
 But there are other origin stories involving him.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.520
 This is the most colorful one a long time ago.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.320
 No, not like Asian times.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.600
 This guy's in some sort of

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.100
 vengeful recorder spirit.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.800
 He's like, call my instrument a child's thing, will you?

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.500
 I'll last a thousand years on the streets of Chile.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.700
 No, a long time ago, you know, 30 years ago,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.740
 there was a man, we'll call him Johnny Rags.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.040
 Johnny Rags had two beautiful children,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.000
 a little boy and a little girl.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.440
 And then one day, Johnny Rags was just working

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.940
 at the Rags Factory, he fell in with Vatterags.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.980
 He's like, no, that'd be a better story.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.680
 He's working at the Rags Factory

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.380
 and his daughter is murdered.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.600
 Ah!

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.580
 And he just can't console himself.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.180
 He's like, oh no, and the son's like,

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.200
 sorry, daddy, he's like, I don't like you as much.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.720
 My daughter was my favorite.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.540
 So in his rage and misery, I'm reading this quote here.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.320
 In his rage and misery, he set his house on fire

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.420
 with him and his son inside.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.580
 I told you, I didn't like the son, I told you.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.420
 He's like, oh, I wish my daughter was here.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.820
 He sets the fire with him and his son inside.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.920
 It says, for some reason, he was the only survivor.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.580
 So now he roams the streets, playing the flute

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.900
 his daughter used to own.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:41.980
 So, I mean, to be fair, I didn't look up

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:46.980
 structure fires in that city in Chile from 1972 to 2012.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.460
 I didn't verify that.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.180
 I'm sure some houses burned down

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.500
 and I'm sure people were burnt up in them.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.120
 And people go, you're like this

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.040
 and you just crackin' all these jokes

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.760
 and you're saying now it might be true.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.600
 I'm sure that chain of events happened,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.960
 but we don't know if this guy is actually that.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.400
 I, we don't know.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.840
 It's probably not true.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.640
 Now, to be fair, they do say that the recorder

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.160
 is a popular instrument in Chile for kids to play

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.200
 and also in America.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.800
 It's possible, but again, there's no verification

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.780
 for that, that really sounds so overly dramatic.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.240
 First off, he'd be in jail, right?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.880
 You can't set your house on fire

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.640
 'cause you're boohoo-hooin' it

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.680
 and you kill your son and then you get horribly burned.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.440
 Actually, he doesn't even say that in there.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.360
 It just says he set the house on fire

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.640
 with him and his son inside

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.680
 and then he was the only survivor.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.960
 Did his just clothes get burned?

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.720
 And he's like, ooh, slightly singed pants.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.840
 I'm gonna become a crazy homeless person

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.400
 whereas the implication he got horribly burned.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.800
 But anyways, he'd be in jail.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.360
 He'd be in jail for that.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.380
 So I think that's made up.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.220
 The guy's real, but I think we see so often on this show

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.580
 they'll have a real phenomenon

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.860
 and then people make up a backstory for it.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.700
 I like the suggestion that the hobos

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.860
 are using this as a gimmick and they're alternating it

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.540
 'cause that's pretty snazzy, right?

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.940
 They just have one suit of rags.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.020
 Do you know how smelly that would be?

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.740
 Multiple hobos wearing the same clothes?

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.740
 That's the, I think that's the most likely scenario.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.080
 But you, if you live in Chile, you are allowed to,

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.440
 you are allowed, I'm giving you permission,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.280
 find this guy.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.680
 He's still doing it apparently.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.520
 I don't know if he's doing it this minute,

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.520
 but when I researched this story a couple months ago,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.800
 he was still out there playing the recorder.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.560
 So if you're ever in Chile and you hear the sound

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.720
 of a recorder and you look around

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.840
 and there's no kids to be found, keep looking,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.840
 keep looking.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.240
 If anyone asks, say I'm looking for kids,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.160
 I'm looking for kids and they're like, what?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.080
 You lunatic?

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.320
 But if you don't find any kids,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.600
 you might run into a man wearing rags.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.500
 And if so, just ask him, did you murder your son?

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.700
 And he'll either, either beat you to death

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.100
 or dude, what if he bites you?

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.060
 You're like, no, no.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.380
 And then you, your skin becomes rags.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.580
 And then he gives you a recorder too.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.580
 He has a brand new one he bought from Walmart.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.860
 You're like, aw man.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.780
 And then you have to stand on the street going to go,

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.180
 and then he makes you find your own corner

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.380
 'cause that's his city.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.220
 He gets that money.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.540
 Don't get bit by the rag man of Chile.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.140
 Reese's Pieces is like, I wasn't even playing on going there

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.660
 to get bitten by the rag man of Chile.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.540
 Reese's Pieces, I'm gonna toss you the keys

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.420
 to the Carbenter copter.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.400
 We're leaving behind this town.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.000
 We've lost a couple of loyal DeRabbit listeners.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.500
 They've never had people

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.940
 we're not letting back on the copter.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.340
 They're like, oh, oh, trying to grab on.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.700
 Take up, go, go, go, go.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.300
 Get the Carbenter copter out of here.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.480
 We are leaving behind our loyal listeners.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.780
 But by the time we make it to our new destination,

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.580
 they're cured and I sent them tickets.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.100
 They can just fly coach on an airplane.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.060
 They've come to join us.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.980
 I'm not gonna leave no rag left behind,

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.220
 but you can fly with me.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.300
 You can't fly with me.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.220
 We're now in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.540
 It's June 22nd, 1972.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.820
 Land that Carbenter copter.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.500
 We're in, we're on a mountain top.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.860
 So apparently there's a mountain top

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.780
 on the outskirts of Williamsport,

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.660
 and there lives a family of four.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.740
 You got a mom and a dad and two boys.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.620
 The youngest kid, we're gonna call him Billy.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.380
 He's the narrator of this story.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.260
 He's sitting there, it's 1972,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.860
 so he's probably playing with Howdy Doody

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.380
 or something stupid.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.720
 And his older brother, Nick,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.020
 is outside with the shotgun.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.420
 I got one, dad, Nick says.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.380
 Two more for the kitchen.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.460
 What's going on in there?

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.920
 Nick is out there, this is dope.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.120
 I wish I could do this.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.460
 Nick is out there with the shotgun, shooting bats, dude.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.380
 You know how hard it would be to shoot a bat?

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.380
 Like those dudes must be hell of a hard to hit

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.140
 'cause their wings are so tiny.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.540
 Plus they suck your blood and turn into Dracula.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.700
 You'd have to use wooden bullets.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.380
 Like it'd be an adventure to have to go out.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.420
 And to be fair, I don't think they were eating them.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.700
 I don't know where the two for the kitchen came from.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.160
 They're not hillbillies.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.220
 They live on a mountain top, so they're mountain billies.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.580
 But he's shooting bats.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.780
 And then the family goes,

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.440
 "Is he going to make us eat bats again?"

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.440
 That lunatic, what's he thinking?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.120
 We don't eat bats, he keeps saying,

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.600
 "Two more for the kitchen."

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.120
 We have food, we have a Kroger nearby.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.800
 We go to the supermarket.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.600
 Then they hear Nick scream, he'd for help.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.280
 Ah, ah, guys, get out here, get out here.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.720
 They thank Dracula, let's come back.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.600
 The family runs outside and they see Nick

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.600
 standing there with the shotgun and they see

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.840
 (imitates gun firing)

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.140
 a cigar-shaped object flying through the clouds.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.740
 Now it's moving very slow for a UFO.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.740
 They estimate it's between five to 10 miles per hour.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:57.500
 It's 30 to 40 feet long, but only eight feet in diameter.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.980
 And, you know, they just kind of go,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:00.900
 kind of shrug their shoulders.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.760
 Like that was weird, right?

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.140
 Now they are all heavily armed.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.660
 At any point they probably could have went out there,

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.740
 but I think the dad was probably like,

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.680
 "Now kids, this probably won't be a good idea.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.440
 "It's probably some sort of extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.280
 "Let's not go out there.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.440
 "Let's just, let's not.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.320
 "Let's pick up these bats and feed them to the dog."

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.540
 And Nick's like, "Oh man, a couple days later,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.280
 "dad goes to use the outhouse."

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.800
 Now, I originally said they weren't ill-billies,

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.160
 but they do have an outhouse.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.640
 Their toilet is not built into their house.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.560
 So he's walking out there with a newspaper

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.100
 and an old corn cob to wipe his butt.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.760
 He's walking out to the outhouse.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.320
 And then he walks back in.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.460
 And everyone's like, "That's weird.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.820
 "Dad usually takes way longer to defecate

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.760
 "in the outhouse."

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.000
 He's normally reading the paper.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.340
 He walks back in and he goes, "Nick, grab your shotgun."

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.560
 Nick's like, "What?

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.500
 "We're gonna get more bats?"

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.180
 Nick grabs the shotgun.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.500
 Dad walks over and he grabs a 50 caliber flintlock rifle.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.820
 He's like, "Let's go."

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.800
 They walk outside.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.220
 Now at this point, the mother,

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.860
 who I assume is armed with like dual pistols,

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.680
 and then the little brother Billy,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.400
 they walk out on the porch as well.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.620
 And as the dad and Nick are standing there,

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.080
 in the woods, about 100 yards away, there's a forest.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.040
 They're looking into the forest

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.480
 and they see hundreds of sets

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.700
 of glowing green eyes staring back at them.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.560
 Now, no shots are fired.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.120
 They just watch these eyes from 100 yards away.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.500
 There's no movement on that side as well.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.220
 The family fitfully sleeps that night.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.260
 Next night, dad is watching a little bit of television.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.700
 Brand new episode of MASH.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.860
 He doesn't know what's gonna happen.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.940
 It is not in reruns in 1972.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.660
 He's watching MASH.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.220
 His rest of his family's asleep.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.340
 And then he goes, "Oh man,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.980
 "you know what I really have to do right now?

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.820
 "I have to go use that outhouse I did to use it yesterday.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.620
 "It was all the green eyes, but I gotta use it now."

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.660
 So he gets up, he can't pause it.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.560
 He actually has to get up during a commercial break.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.680
 That's how it was when I was a kid.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.040
 You don't know if you're gonna be able

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.440
 to poop quick enough to come back

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.880
 and watch the rest of the MASH.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.680
 He walks outside and then the family is woken up

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.440
 by him yelling, "Get the guns, get the guns!"

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.280
 So Nick runs, grabs his shotgun.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.640
 The rest of the family comes out.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.480
 The mom gets her rocket launcher.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.840
 They come out onto the porch 50 yards away from the house.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.400
 There's a little grove of peach trees, a little shed.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.300
 There's a stone wall closer to the house.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.340
 So they're looking over this stone wall

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.900
 to see this grove of peach trees, to see this shed.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.580
 But what they see standing in the peach trees

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.420
 is three sets of glowing eyes.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.780
 Now these eyes are actually bigger

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.900
 than the ones they saw before.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.420
 And they're not bigger 'cause they're closer.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.260
 They're actually physically bigger.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.140
 They could tell that even in the distance,

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.660
 those were small creatures, whatever they were.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.020
 It's a very big creature.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.940
 There's only three of them now.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.400
 And they said the eyes are all sitting

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.440
 about three feet off of the ground.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.080
 And they're watching these eyes.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.920
 They're watching back.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.680
 Now at this point, dad's like, "Listen, okay,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.180
 "the last time was kind of spooky

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.880
 "that we should have done something with the cigar shape.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.120
 "I.E. we should have moved out of the area."

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.720
 But he wants to know what these things are.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.560
 So he actually goes around the wall

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.480
 and he gets to his pickup truck.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.440
 He drives his truck towards the peach grove.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.760
 Now his intent isn't to run him over.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.240
 His intent is to see what they are.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.720
 So he turns on his high beams

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.300
 and you still can't see anything.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.660
 You can see the eyes,

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.380
 but he can't make out what these figures are.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.800
 Nick's ready with his shotgun.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.180
 He's standing by the stone wall with his shotgun.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.580
 Billy and the mom are still on the patio.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.660
 And the dad gets out of the truck,

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.940
 has his 50 caliber flintlock rifle

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.380
 and begins walking towards the eyes.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.700
 And at that point, the mother screams, "Don't.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.860
 "Stop where you are.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.580
 "Don't get near him."

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.700
 The dad looks over at the mom.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.340
 He nods.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.120
 Mother knows best, right?

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.640
 That's what the show is, right?

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.040
 Mother knows best.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.680
 He looks at her.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.600
 He nods.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.280
 And then he aims, takes it with his rifle

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.320
 and opens fire on these eyes.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.760
 (imitates gun firing)

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.760
 Without any order needed,

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.160
 Nick also begins just letting loose

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.280
 with his shotgun from over the stone wall.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.640
 (imitates gun firing)

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.480
 Shooting at these eyes.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.640
 They're hitting these three sets of eyes

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.260
 from two different angles.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.420
 The eyes don't move.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.420
 They just continue to stare from the darkness.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.820
 At some point, the family, I don't know,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.820
 runs out of ammo or they just get bored

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.380
 where the commercial breaks over on MASH.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.740
 The eyes don't give,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.460
 but they eventually just kind of pack it up

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.060
 and they go, "Well, let's go inside."

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.420
 That's an interesting point,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.180
 because on one hand you would think,

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.060
 would you stay out there all night looking to the eyes

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.860
 or at a certain point, would you go back inside?

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.620
 'Cause if you get cold or bored

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.980
 or you think maybe I'm just seeing something,

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.020
 like you would think the eyes would disappear first,

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.640
 but there's no note in the story

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.040
 like they shot him and the eyes vanished.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.320
 The eyes were still there.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.720
 They do end up back inside the house.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.680
 The next night, it's not time to use the outhouse.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.960
 I'm sure at this point, dad is pooping during the day,

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.280
 but he does look out the window and the eyes are back.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.720
 This time there's three sets of eyes

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.720
 and they're three feet off of the top of the stone wall.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.040
 They're now maybe 15 yards from the house.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.740
 Dad and son, they probably have their guns,

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.940
 they're ready, they probably didn't even put them away

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.840
 from the night before.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.760
 They grab their weapons, they step out on the porch,

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.380
 they just begin unloading into these eyes,

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.780
 these unmoving sets of eyes that are standing

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.560
 on top of this stone wall.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.460
 The dad actually walks up and places the rifle

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:48.300
 right between the eyes and pulls the trigger.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:53.300
 The eyes don't move, but they never returned after that night.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.400
 After they emptied all their ammo into these things,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.640
 after these point blank shots,

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.700
 the eyes never got closer to the house.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.720
 I got that story from thinkaboutadox.com.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.020
 They got it from New Fork,

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.420
 which is the National UFO Reporting Center.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.020
 It's an interesting story because you have humans

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.420
 engaged in a firefight with eyes.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.740
 And not just eyes, not just eyes

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.060
 that are rolling around on the ground eyeballs,

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.620
 but with alien or so.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.340
 The fact that we see the UFO in the beginning

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.660
 makes us think these are aliens.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.900
 The fact that they're three feet off the ground

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.660
 makes you think it's some sort of gray alien.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.380
 As I was telling the story and reading the story,

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.020
 I imagine them as the typical big teardrop eyes

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.220
 that gray aliens have, but glowing.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.420
 There's a lot of interesting stuff

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.560
 that we can really dissect with this one.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.260
 What happened to the hundreds of eyes in the forest?

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.300
 What was that?

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.180
 And then of course we have the skeptical thing too.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.580
 I gotta throw this in there,

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.460
 that it was not the story was made up,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.500
 but that they were seeing some sort of phenomenon.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.460
 The guy is shooting at a bunch of fireflies

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.380
 that are floating around and they all happen to form,

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.740
 they form a fist and they're shaking, it's fisting them.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.820
 You know, it could have been a natural phenomenon

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.180
 and that would explain why the bullets

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.740
 were having no effect on them.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.980
 That's why they weren't changing

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.140
 when they're being fired upon

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.100
 'cause it's just this natural event.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.300
 But looking at it from a paranormal event,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.580
 you know, I do like to put the skeptical answers

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.540
 in here as well.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.660
 Looking at paranormal event,

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.500
 why were there hundreds of eyes to begin with

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.300
 and then just the three?

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.460
 What happened to those other sets of eyes?

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.060
 Did they go out to investigate other homes in the area?

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.140
 Why did the aliens only get so close to the house

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.060
 and retreat and they were never seen again?

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.380
 Did they eventually, was it that they weren't seen again?

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.380
 It was that the next time they were looking out their windows

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.940
 and they go, we haven't seen those eyes in a couple days.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.500
 But they don't realize these creatures are in the house

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.980
 underneath the stairs, underneath the bed.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.580
 They're basically the boogeyman.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.140
 Every alien just wants to come down

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.300
 and be the boogeyman in your house.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.460
 Grab your ankles as you're walking down this stairs

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.540
 in your basement.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.940
 But I think it's a fascinating story

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.300
 because it gives us an insight to something.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.840
 We'll wrap it up like this.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.820
 All that dad really wanted to do was protect his family

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.840
 and protect his land.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.100
 This was a place that him and his family called their own.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.660
 Should be a safe spot.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.860
 And when this intruder shows up,

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.060
 they do what you would do to protect your place.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.660
 You attack them.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.100
 But the bullets had no effect.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.340
 These aliens were completely undaunted.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.420
 Really, the fact that they were getting shot at

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.260
 didn't affect them.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.240
 They simply got closer and closer and closer.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.440
 They didn't care.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.500
 All these weapons that we used to shoot bats

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.780
 and dogs and bear, I don't know who's shooting a dog,

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.960
 but these weapons that are used to kill animals and men

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.060
 had no effect on these creatures.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.140
 And as I finished that story,

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.820
 I kind of sat back and thought,

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.420
 this could be a parallel to what humanity is facing.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.900
 This family in Pennsylvania saw a phenomenon

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.860
 that was sets of glowing eyes staring at them

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.980
 from the darkness of the forest.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.740
 But humanity may soon experience a different phenomenon.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.460
 We may see the lights of a thousand starships

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.740
 staring back at us from deep space.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.020
 And as the governments of the world

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.500
 try to figure out a way to protect us,

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.860
 to protect this planet,

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.380
 they'll turn to the one thing humans know best,

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.680
 weapons.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.220
 And as we stand there and watch the world's militaries

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.500
 fire their missiles,

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:22.300
 watch these advanced weapon platforms shoot out of silos

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.460
 across the planet and streak through the night sky

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.900
 towards the alien invaders.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.140
 Will we see them impact these starships

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.020
 and tear through them and fire and flame?

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.080
 Or will all of our weapons be as useless

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.400
 as an old man's rifle and his son's shotgun?

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.900
 When the aliens show up, do we stand a chance?

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.100
 That's a question we won't know

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.520
 until it's too late to change the answer.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:56.260
