1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,480
 When the world needed a hero, fate sent two heroes.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,080
 Are the stories of a bizarrely dressed man

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,560
 walking around the streets of Chile,

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,800
 looking like a supervillain?

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,120
 True, that might actually be true.

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,360
 But in this particular story, does he also play a flute?

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,440
 And then we travel to Pennsylvania

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,280
 to meet a family that lives on the outskirts of town,

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,120
 way up on a mountaintop.

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,240
 They're just having a normal American life

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,400
 until the aliens invaded.

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,020
 (upbeat music)

27
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:13,000
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,120
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,080
 I'm having a great day.

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,160
 Hope you guys had a lot of fun

33
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,480
 in between listening to the last episode

34
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,920
 and listening to this episode.

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,160
 And if you happen to be binging them,

36
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
 I hope you had a really fun minute

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,680
 as you waited for the new episode to start.

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,640
 Speaking of fun minutes,

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,240
 he's really good at telling time apparently,

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,360
 according to the segue.

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,440
 Let's give a shout out

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,720
 to our newest Patreon supporter, Reese's Pieces.

43
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,960
 Everyone give him a round of applause.

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,800
 He's back.

45
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,320
 He used to support the Patreon a long time ago

46
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,120
 and he's back just as delicious as ever.

47
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,760
 Now also holding a bunch of clocks.

48
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,120
 Because that's his thing now

49
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,160
 to make the original joke make sense.

50
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,760
 He walks in, he's juggling clocks.

51
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,240
 He's riding a tricycle.

52
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,640
 All the wheels are clocks.

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
 Reese's Pieces and he's made of candy.

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,400
 Reese's Pieces.

55
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,200
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

56
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,560
 You guys can't support the Patreon

57
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,320
 or you guys aren't as delicious.

58
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
 It's fine too.

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
 Just helps read the word about the show.

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
 Really, really helps out a lot.

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,680
 Reese's Pieces, let's go ahead

62
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,160
 and hop in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,080
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,480
 We are headed out to Jakarta, Indonesia.

65
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,040
 (imitates engine revving)

66
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,320
 This story is fascinating to me

67
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,640
 that we're about to cover.

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,840
 Because it's one of those things.

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
 Recently I did a story and I go,

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,400
 "Hey, it was about the Army Hammer thing.

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,320
 "If you didn't know, Army Hammer, famous celebrity.

72
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,760
 "He's also a cannibal, allegedly?

73
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,520
 "He denies it, but his DMs

74
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,760
 "seem to make it look like he's a cannibal."

75
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,240
 And apparently his ex-husband come forward

76
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,280
 and said, "Don't look in the basement."

77
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,720
 Because apparently, allegedly,

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,240
 he would buy mannequins.

79
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,040
 This guy, this story is just so weird.

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,000
 He'd buy mannequins so he could practice tying them up.

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,040
 Allegedly, still,

82
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
 that's weird, but anyways.

83
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,640
 So, and my thing about that story was,

84
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,400
 why is no one in the conspiracy community

85
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,160
 talking about a Hollywood dude who wants to eat people?

86
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,200
 And I couldn't figure it out.

87
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,560
 I said, maybe it was the election.

88
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,920
 We have this other story that should be huge news

89
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,800
 in the COVID conspiracy group.

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,160
 This should actually be,

91
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,640
 they should make flags of these people.

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,720
 They should hire a Renaissance painter

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,160
 to go back in time, kidnapped Leonardo.

94
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,040
 They should hire a guy to draw a mural

95
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,880
 dedicated to these two people.

96
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,600
 This event that I'm about to tell you

97
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,440
 shatters the mainstream media's view

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,440
 on the coronavirus that also gets this channel demonetized

99
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,760
 and this video removed.

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
 But I totally believe in the coronavirus.

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,280
 I believe it's real COVID-19.

102
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
 I'll get my vaccine.

103
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
 But I know there's a lot of people out there

104
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,400
 who don't feel that way.

105
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,160
 A lot of people out there think it's overblown,

106
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,720
 it's a hoax, and I don't understand

107
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,200
 why this story is on all of their websites.

108
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,440
 All of them.

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,960
 Let me read you this headline from The Sun.

110
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,280
 You know you're gonna get a good headline

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,160
 when I'm reading it from The Sun.

112
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,760
 Rona Romp.

113
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,760
 Nurse suspended,

114
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,400
 Army Hammer's Life from Rope?

115
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,640
 Isn't the nurse suspended from Rope?

116
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
 No, no, no, no.

117
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,000
 Suspended from the job.

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,280
 Nurse suspended after stripping off PPE,

119
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,520
 which is the personal protective gear.

120
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,120
 I have to stop and keep cracking jokes into finding words.

121
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,860
 Nurse suspended after stripping off PPE

122
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,080
 to have sex with COVID infected patient

123
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,460
 in hospital toilet.

124
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,880
 So what happened was there's a nurse walks in

125
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,640
 to take care of this patient in Jakarta, Indonesia.

126
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,760
 This was at the Wisma Atlet Emergency Hospital.

127
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,080
 Sure, I'm sure they love this story getting out there.

128
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,400
 They have a COVID ward,

129
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,760
 and then they have the rest of the hospital.

130
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,640
 And you have this nurse, we don't know his name,

131
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,080
 we'll call him Jerry.

132
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,840
 He's walking through the ward.

133
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,680
 ♪ Do do do do do do ♪

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,200
 He's wearing all of his PPEs like the headline said.

135
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,500
 You kind of know where this story is going.

136
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,980
 I don't know why I'm building it up.

137
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,700
 I don't know why I'm building up the dramatic tension.

138
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,500
 I'm all willy.

139
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,900
 The end of the story is he bangs this dude

140
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,740
 who is a patient at the COVID facility.

141
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,140
 And the guy that he's having sex with takes photos of it.

142
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,860
 What doesn't take photos of the act itself,

143
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,820
 but takes, for lack of a better term, evidence.

144
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,580
 Takes photos of like their clothes on the ground,

145
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,700
 like the PPE gear on the ground,

146
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,600
 and I imagine he's like putting a Motee Con's

147
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,560
 being like sexy and cough cough a little coughing,

148
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,520
 happy face.

149
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,040
 They have sex in the hospital toilet.

150
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,800
 Now this guy, this nurse,

151
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,680
 knows that the patient has COVID-19.

152
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,400
 He's in the COVID ward.

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,200
 So he was there for a car accident

154
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,620
 and then got diagnosed later.

155
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,880
 But apparently, I don't know if they matched up on Grindr

156
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,720
 or something like that,

157
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
 and the location thing was all,

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,760
 bing bing, and he turns and he looks

159
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,080
 and it's the COVID ward.

160
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,920
 He bangs this dude.

161
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,040
 Now there's two parts to this story.

162
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,880
 I mean, other than that,

163
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,020
 other than the COVID sex.

164
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,820
 One, in Indonesia,

165
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,880
 they have these really strict anti-pornography laws.

166
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,340
 So because the guy was taking photos

167
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,940
 and being like, "Ooh la la,

168
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,780
 me had sexy time in the hospital,"

169
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,980
 they're both facing 10 years in prison.

170
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,900
 It's like decency laws.

171
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,420
 So now there's an Motee Con of a sad,

172
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,180
 smiley face behind jail bars.

173
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,900
 Like, I don't understand,

174
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,120
 if you're in that country, you should know the laws.

175
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,460
 But they're both facing 10 years in prison for this.

176
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,920
 And that's just human tragedy.

177
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
 That's an overblown thing.

178
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,520
 That's an overblown sentence for that.

179
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,320
 But this is what the real kick in the pants is.

180
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,360
 That's what the real pull on the catheter is.

181
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,120
 The guy has COVID, the nurse goes in, they have sex.

182
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,120
 The nurse who was tested was not COVID positive.

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,960
 The guy who was in the ward still had COVID

184
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,840
 after the sex that didn't cure it.

185
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,120
 That wasn't a cure that was being promoted

186
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,420
 on some health site, darkoutpost.com.

187
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,820
 It's like, if you have man on man sex,

188
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,180
 your COVID will go away.

189
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,300
 No, they didn't say that, that was just a joke

190
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,140
 'cause I don't know how litigious they are.

191
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,420
 But it wasn't that.

192
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,100
 The guy who had COVID, still has COVID,

193
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,420
 but the guy who had hot, sweaty,

194
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,200
 hospital toilet sex with him did not catch COVID.

195
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,260
 So guys, I don't understand why this is not a rally cry.

196
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,420
 Again, I know that COVID's far more complicated than that.

197
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,920
 And I do believe it's real.

198
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,080
 However, there are a lot of people who don't.

199
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,880
 Why aren't they talking about this story?

200
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
 Why aren't they saying, hey man,

201
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,600
 what are you gonna wear my mask at Walmart?

202
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,160
 Two dudes had put sex in Indonesia and they didn't get it?

203
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,200
 Well, one of them did, but he already had it.

204
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,880
 But I can't buy grapes.

205
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
 I can't buy grapes at Walmart.

206
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,900
 What is this?

207
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,720
 I'm not saying that's a valid argument.

208
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,520
 I wanna be very, very clear

209
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,200
 to the person who's going to delete this video.

210
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,720
 I'm not saying that's a valid argument.

211
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,820
 What I don't understand is why they're not making that argument.

212
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,300
 Why is it that I can't eat inside a Taco Bell

213
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,420
 but these two dudes can roll around on a dirty hospital floor

214
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,620
 and one of them gets up and just goes home?

215
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,420
 He's totally fine.

216
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
 So I don't understand it.

217
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,020
 I actually, this was one of those stories

218
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,780
 that I sat on for a while, no pun intended.

219
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,220
 And I thought, I thought someone's gonna start talking

220
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,060
 about this.

221
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,580
 So this is gonna be big in the conspiracy theory community

222
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,220
 because all of those reasons I gave.

223
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,060
 But nope.

224
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,040
 So hopefully these guys don't do 10 years.

225
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,120
 That's super stiff.

226
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,600
 Again, no pun intended.

227
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
 And they didn't even take photos of the sex act.

228
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,640
 It was just like photos of like, apparently the guy was

229
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,040
 tweeting about how big their genitals were.

230
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,080
 He was like, well, it was definitely bigger.

231
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,040
 He was bragging.

232
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,960
 There was no like actual sex stuff shown,

233
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,800
 but that was enough.

234
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,880
 Indonesia said, no, 10 year prison sentence for both of you.

235
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,480
 It was gross to have sex with a COVID infected person

236
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,840
 inside of a hospital.

237
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,880
 But I don't think that's,

238
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,380
 I don't think being gross should get you 10 years in prison.

239
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,400
 Reese's Pieces is already taking up the Dead Rabbit

240
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,240
 Durgeable.

241
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,500
 He's like, no, get your own ride.

242
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,660
 I'm sorry, it was disgusting.

243
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,180
 I'm sorry, I joined the VHN again.

244
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,340
 We coax him back.

245
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,540
 We have a giant flavor Flave Clock

246
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,220
 that we're gonna put around his neck.

247
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,780
 Reese's Pieces, let's put you at the helm

248
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,820
 of the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught, our massive battleship.

249
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,060
 We're leaving behind the island nation of Indonesia.

250
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,840
 We are headed out to Chile.

251
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,180
 (explosion)

252
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,400
 That's the boat going over the waves.

253
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,600
 Did you guys see that trailer for that new movie?

254
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
 God's Illiverse Kong.

255
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,760
 So as Reese's Pieces is piloting the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught,

256
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,040
 he is taking us out to the country of Chile.

257
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,400
 Specifically, we're going to the city of Vina del Mar.

258
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,360
 It's a coastal city.

259
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,480
 So the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught pulls right up to the port.

260
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,640
 We all jump off, we're magically wearing tourist clothes.

261
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,400
 And we're going to Valparcio.

262
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,120
 That's the commercial section of the city.

263
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,640
 So everyone get your cameras ready, click, click.

264
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,820
 We're like, oh, look at Macy's.

265
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,660
 Click, click.

266
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,940
 Look at McDonald's running in their meat and food.

267
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,680
 We're having a good time at Valparcio.

268
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,680
 But then we hear a (humming)

269
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,440
 We all kind of turn around at the same time.

270
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
 (humming)

271
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,920
 I think he's a scat man.

272
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,720
 But we hear a song being played on a recorder.

273
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,880
 (humming)

274
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,820
 We turn around and we're looking for the sound of a recorder.

275
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,000
 And we see it.

276
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,340
 It's a man playing a recorder.

277
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,900
 Like it's not a mystery at all.

278
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,580
 Usually there's people playing the recorders.

279
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,960
 Ah-ha, but hold on.

280
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,500
 This man looks like a super villain.

281
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,220
 Really, really low budget super villain.

282
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,660
 (humming)

283
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,860
 He's dressed in rags.

284
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,920
 Now not like Tom Sawyer rags,

285
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,980
 like jeans that are a little roughed up

286
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,060
 and he's patches, no.

287
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,760
 He's wearing a rag over his head.

288
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,480
 And then he's wearing like a rag jacket.

289
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,500
 Just rags and then rag gloves.

290
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,060
 And then like he's just, he's just a big old rag.

291
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,380
 It's hard to describe.

292
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,360
 It looks like somebody threw a bunch of dirty rags

293
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,380
 out of a window and they just landed on someone.

294
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,020
 You really have to look at a picture of them

295
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,900
 and it's kind of hard to do a podcast

296
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,020
 where you talk about pictures.

297
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,240
 There's more to the narrative than just what he looks like.

298
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,080
 But he looks like a villain.

299
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,920
 He looks like a henchman in like some '80s cartoon

300
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,760
 or something like that.

301
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,040
 He just looks like a villain.

302
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,880
 He looks like a terrible person to hang out with.

303
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,360
 There's nobody like singing out with a ragman, right?

304
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,440
 (humming)

305
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,760
 He has rag shoes.

306
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,840
 How do you even have, are those even shoes at that point?

307
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,520
 They're just rags wrapped around your feet.

308
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,320
 He's all rags all the time.

309
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,960
 But he has three holes cut in his mask.

310
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,300
 And he fours eyes in his mouth.

311
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,820
 Obviously, how else is he supposed to play the recorder?

312
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,860
 Now you may think, Jason,

313
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,260
 is this some creepypasta that you found?

314
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,340
 There's no guy walking around

315
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,580
 who's made of rags and chile.

316
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,420
 There is.

317
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,740
 There's actually photographs of this dude.

318
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,980
 And not like blurry photographs that someone took

319
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,940
 just a pile of rags laying on the ground.

320
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,460
 They're like, hey, Jason, love your show.

321
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
 Here's a pile of rags in my bathroom.

322
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,540
 I think it's a dude.

323
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,260
 He puts a recorder next to the pile of rags.

324
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,460
 No, this guy's been hanging out in chile

325
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,140
 for the longest time.

326
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,140
 He's there almost every day.

327
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,540
 And he sits there and he plays as a recorder.

328
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,240
 Now he does talk, but apparently

329
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,280
 there's no audio footage of him talking.

330
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,560
 But he does speak to people.

331
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,480
 Usually when dogs show up, he hisses at him.

332
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,780
 He doesn't like dogs.

333
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,640
 The dogs run away.

334
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,480
 He does that.

335
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,340
 And sometimes he'll just walk around following people.

336
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,520
 Very, very unsettling man to be followed by.

337
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,400
 Anyone playing a recorder, obviously,

338
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,760
 has some sort of mental issues.

339
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,220
 Then he's also all dressed in rags,

340
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,460
 so it makes it even creepier.

341
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,460
 And sometimes he just isn't playing music.

342
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,540
 He'll just stand on the street corner

343
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,660
 staring into space.

344
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,380
 Now it's interesting because he's real.

345
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,220
 This is a real guy there's photos of.

346
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,980
 He'd be similar to the cat man of Grenok.

347
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,580
 It's like kind of a local legend, but he's real.

348
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,500
 It'd be similar to Aki in Britain,

349
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,820
 who was climbing on top of muscle people.

350
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,660
 You're like, what?

351
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,860
 That's so only bizarre out of context.

352
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,900
 I'll put those in the show notes.

353
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,580
 But just kind of weird local people.

354
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,120
 So of course people make up origin stories for this guy.

355
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,960
 'Cause even though he talks,

356
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,920
 he doesn't really explain things.

357
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,000
 So some people say that it's a fictional character.

358
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Not that he doesn't exist.

359
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,760
 You're like, damn Jason, no, no, no, no.

360
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,880
 Not that he doesn't exist,

361
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,800
 but it's a gimmick the homeless people have come up with.

362
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,040
 Some people say it's a homeless,

363
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
 it's like a group of homeless people

364
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,360
 who are switching.

365
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,160
 'Cause he's not playing the recorder good.

366
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,200
 Let's just get that out of the way.

367
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
 Don't go down there if you wanna hear a concert.

368
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,840
 He sucks at it.

369
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,440
 He's playing a children's instrument.

370
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,980
 Sorry, professional recorder players,

371
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,540
 but it's a children's instrument.

372
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,700
 It's made of plastic, okay?

373
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,140
 I don't even know if there are professional recorder players,

374
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,320
 but I'm sure there is one.

375
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
 At least one, this guy, this guy.

376
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,260
 So they think it may be different hobos in disguise.

377
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,300
 Hey, Larry, let me wear the rags today.

378
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,140
 What?

379
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,740
 No, these rags, these are my rags.

380
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,940
 You go get your own rags.

381
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,780
 They're free.

382
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,780
 I mean, they're just rags.

383
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,380
 You don't need any special rags.

384
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,300
 Some people say that's a that.

385
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,140
 Some people say it's a guy who's hideously deformed.

386
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,840
 And what better way to take attention away from your deformity

387
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,640
 than to cover yourself in filthy rags, right?

388
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,040
 Just wear a business suit.

389
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
 And everyone will be like, hey, you look really good

390
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,440
 'cause you're wearing a business suit.

391
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,320
 Some people say it's just a street artist

392
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,520
 looking for some street cred.

393
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,680
 It's like a Banksy, but smellier

394
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,080
 and playing a recorder.

395
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,520
 But there are other origin stories involving him.

396
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,520
 This is the most colorful one a long time ago.

397
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,320
 No, not like Asian times.

398
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,600
 This guy's in some sort of

399
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,100
 vengeful recorder spirit.

400
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,800
 He's like, call my instrument a child's thing, will you?

401
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,500
 I'll last a thousand years on the streets of Chile.

402
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,700
 No, a long time ago, you know, 30 years ago,

403
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,740
 there was a man, we'll call him Johnny Rags.

404
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,040
 Johnny Rags had two beautiful children,

405
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,000
 a little boy and a little girl.

406
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,440
 And then one day, Johnny Rags was just working

407
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,940
 at the Rags Factory, he fell in with Vatterags.

408
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,980
 He's like, no, that'd be a better story.

409
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,680
 He's working at the Rags Factory

410
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,380
 and his daughter is murdered.

411
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,600
 Ah!

412
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,580
 And he just can't console himself.

413
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,180
 He's like, oh no, and the son's like,

414
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,200
 sorry, daddy, he's like, I don't like you as much.

415
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,720
 My daughter was my favorite.

416
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,540
 So in his rage and misery, I'm reading this quote here.

417
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,320
 In his rage and misery, he set his house on fire

418
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,420
 with him and his son inside.

419
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,580
 I told you, I didn't like the son, I told you.

420
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,420
 He's like, oh, I wish my daughter was here.

421
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,820
 He sets the fire with him and his son inside.

422
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,920
 It says, for some reason, he was the only survivor.

423
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,580
 So now he roams the streets, playing the flute

424
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,900
 his daughter used to own.

425
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:41,980
 So, I mean, to be fair, I didn't look up

426
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,980
 structure fires in that city in Chile from 1972 to 2012.

427
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,460
 I didn't verify that.

428
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,180
 I'm sure some houses burned down

429
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,500
 and I'm sure people were burnt up in them.

430
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,120
 And people go, you're like this

431
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,040
 and you just crackin' all these jokes

432
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,760
 and you're saying now it might be true.

433
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,600
 I'm sure that chain of events happened,

434
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,960
 but we don't know if this guy is actually that.

435
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,400
 I, we don't know.

436
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,840
 It's probably not true.

437
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,640
 Now, to be fair, they do say that the recorder

438
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,160
 is a popular instrument in Chile for kids to play

439
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,200
 and also in America.

440
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,800
 It's possible, but again, there's no verification

441
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,780
 for that, that really sounds so overly dramatic.

442
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,240
 First off, he'd be in jail, right?

443
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,880
 You can't set your house on fire

444
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,640
 'cause you're boohoo-hooin' it

445
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,680
 and you kill your son and then you get horribly burned.

446
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,440
 Actually, he doesn't even say that in there.

447
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,360
 It just says he set the house on fire

448
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,640
 with him and his son inside

449
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,680
 and then he was the only survivor.

450
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,960
 Did his just clothes get burned?

451
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,720
 And he's like, ooh, slightly singed pants.

452
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,840
 I'm gonna become a crazy homeless person

453
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,400
 whereas the implication he got horribly burned.

454
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,800
 But anyways, he'd be in jail.

455
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,360
 He'd be in jail for that.

456
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,380
 So I think that's made up.

457
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,220
 The guy's real, but I think we see so often on this show

458
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,580
 they'll have a real phenomenon

459
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,860
 and then people make up a backstory for it.

460
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,700
 I like the suggestion that the hobos

461
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,860
 are using this as a gimmick and they're alternating it

462
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,540
 'cause that's pretty snazzy, right?

463
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,940
 They just have one suit of rags.

464
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,020
 Do you know how smelly that would be?

465
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,740
 Multiple hobos wearing the same clothes?

466
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,740
 That's the, I think that's the most likely scenario.

467
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,080
 But you, if you live in Chile, you are allowed to,

468
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,440
 you are allowed, I'm giving you permission,

469
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,280
 find this guy.

470
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,680
 He's still doing it apparently.

471
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,520
 I don't know if he's doing it this minute,

472
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
 but when I researched this story a couple months ago,

473
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,800
 he was still out there playing the recorder.

474
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,560
 So if you're ever in Chile and you hear the sound

475
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,720
 of a recorder and you look around

476
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,840
 and there's no kids to be found, keep looking,

477
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
 keep looking.

478
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,240
 If anyone asks, say I'm looking for kids,

479
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
 I'm looking for kids and they're like, what?

480
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,080
 You lunatic?

481
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,320
 But if you don't find any kids,

482
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,600
 you might run into a man wearing rags.

483
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,500
 And if so, just ask him, did you murder your son?

484
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,700
 And he'll either, either beat you to death

485
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,100
 or dude, what if he bites you?

486
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,060
 You're like, no, no.

487
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,380
 And then you, your skin becomes rags.

488
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,580
 And then he gives you a recorder too.

489
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
 He has a brand new one he bought from Walmart.

490
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,860
 You're like, aw man.

491
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,780
 And then you have to stand on the street going to go,

492
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,180
 and then he makes you find your own corner

493
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,380
 'cause that's his city.

494
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,220
 He gets that money.

495
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,540
 Don't get bit by the rag man of Chile.

496
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,140
 Reese's Pieces is like, I wasn't even playing on going there

497
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,660
 to get bitten by the rag man of Chile.

498
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,540
 Reese's Pieces, I'm gonna toss you the keys

499
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,420
 to the Carbenter copter.

500
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,400
 We're leaving behind this town.

501
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,000
 We've lost a couple of loyal DeRabbit listeners.

502
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,500
 They've never had people

503
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,940
 we're not letting back on the copter.

504
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,340
 They're like, oh, oh, trying to grab on.

505
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,700
 Take up, go, go, go, go.

506
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,300
 Get the Carbenter copter out of here.

507
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,480
 We are leaving behind our loyal listeners.

508
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,780
 But by the time we make it to our new destination,

509
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,580
 they're cured and I sent them tickets.

510
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,100
 They can just fly coach on an airplane.

511
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,060
 They've come to join us.

512
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,980
 I'm not gonna leave no rag left behind,

513
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,220
 but you can fly with me.

514
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,300
 You can't fly with me.

515
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,220
 We're now in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

516
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,540
 It's June 22nd, 1972.

517
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,820
 Land that Carbenter copter.

518
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,500
 We're in, we're on a mountain top.

519
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,860
 So apparently there's a mountain top

520
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,780
 on the outskirts of Williamsport,

521
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,660
 and there lives a family of four.

522
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,740
 You got a mom and a dad and two boys.

523
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,620
 The youngest kid, we're gonna call him Billy.

524
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,380
 He's the narrator of this story.

525
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,260
 He's sitting there, it's 1972,

526
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,860
 so he's probably playing with Howdy Doody

527
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,380
 or something stupid.

528
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,720
 And his older brother, Nick,

529
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,020
 is outside with the shotgun.

530
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,420
 I got one, dad, Nick says.

531
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,380
 Two more for the kitchen.

532
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,460
 What's going on in there?

533
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,920
 Nick is out there, this is dope.

534
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,120
 I wish I could do this.

535
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,460
 Nick is out there with the shotgun, shooting bats, dude.

536
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,380
 You know how hard it would be to shoot a bat?

537
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
 Like those dudes must be hell of a hard to hit

538
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,140
 'cause their wings are so tiny.

539
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,540
 Plus they suck your blood and turn into Dracula.

540
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,700
 You'd have to use wooden bullets.

541
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,380
 Like it'd be an adventure to have to go out.

542
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,420
 And to be fair, I don't think they were eating them.

543
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,700
 I don't know where the two for the kitchen came from.

544
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,160
 They're not hillbillies.

545
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,220
 They live on a mountain top, so they're mountain billies.

546
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,580
 But he's shooting bats.

547
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,780
 And then the family goes,

548
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,440
 "Is he going to make us eat bats again?"

549
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
 That lunatic, what's he thinking?

550
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,120
 We don't eat bats, he keeps saying,

551
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,600
 "Two more for the kitchen."

552
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,120
 We have food, we have a Kroger nearby.

553
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,800
 We go to the supermarket.

554
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,600
 Then they hear Nick scream, he'd for help.

555
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,280
 Ah, ah, guys, get out here, get out here.

556
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,720
 They thank Dracula, let's come back.

557
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,600
 The family runs outside and they see Nick

558
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 standing there with the shotgun and they see

559
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,840
 (imitates gun firing)

560
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,140
 a cigar-shaped object flying through the clouds.

561
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,740
 Now it's moving very slow for a UFO.

562
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,740
 They estimate it's between five to 10 miles per hour.

563
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:57,500
 It's 30 to 40 feet long, but only eight feet in diameter.

564
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,980
 And, you know, they just kind of go,

565
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,900
 kind of shrug their shoulders.

566
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,760
 Like that was weird, right?

567
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,140
 Now they are all heavily armed.

568
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,660
 At any point they probably could have went out there,

569
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,740
 but I think the dad was probably like,

570
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,680
 "Now kids, this probably won't be a good idea.

571
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,440
 "It's probably some sort of extraterrestrial intelligence.

572
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,280
 "Let's not go out there.

573
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,440
 "Let's just, let's not.

574
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,320
 "Let's pick up these bats and feed them to the dog."

575
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,540
 And Nick's like, "Oh man, a couple days later,

576
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,280
 "dad goes to use the outhouse."

577
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,800
 Now, I originally said they weren't ill-billies,

578
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,160
 but they do have an outhouse.

579
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,640
 Their toilet is not built into their house.

580
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,560
 So he's walking out there with a newspaper

581
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,100
 and an old corn cob to wipe his butt.

582
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,760
 He's walking out to the outhouse.

583
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,320
 And then he walks back in.

584
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,460
 And everyone's like, "That's weird.

585
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,820
 "Dad usually takes way longer to defecate

586
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,760
 "in the outhouse."

587
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,000
 He's normally reading the paper.

588
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,340
 He walks back in and he goes, "Nick, grab your shotgun."

589
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,560
 Nick's like, "What?

590
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,500
 "We're gonna get more bats?"

591
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,180
 Nick grabs the shotgun.

592
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,500
 Dad walks over and he grabs a 50 caliber flintlock rifle.

593
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,820
 He's like, "Let's go."

594
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,800
 They walk outside.

595
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,220
 Now at this point, the mother,

596
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,860
 who I assume is armed with like dual pistols,

597
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,680
 and then the little brother Billy,

598
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,400
 they walk out on the porch as well.

599
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,620
 And as the dad and Nick are standing there,

600
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,080
 in the woods, about 100 yards away, there's a forest.

601
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,040
 They're looking into the forest

602
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,480
 and they see hundreds of sets

603
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,700
 of glowing green eyes staring back at them.

604
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,560
 Now, no shots are fired.

605
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,120
 They just watch these eyes from 100 yards away.

606
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,500
 There's no movement on that side as well.

607
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,220
 The family fitfully sleeps that night.

608
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,260
 Next night, dad is watching a little bit of television.

609
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,700
 Brand new episode of MASH.

610
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,860
 He doesn't know what's gonna happen.

611
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,940
 It is not in reruns in 1972.

612
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,660
 He's watching MASH.

613
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,220
 His rest of his family's asleep.

614
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,340
 And then he goes, "Oh man,

615
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,980
 "you know what I really have to do right now?

616
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,820
 "I have to go use that outhouse I did to use it yesterday.

617
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,620
 "It was all the green eyes, but I gotta use it now."

618
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,660
 So he gets up, he can't pause it.

619
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,560
 He actually has to get up during a commercial break.

620
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,680
 That's how it was when I was a kid.

621
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,040
 You don't know if you're gonna be able

622
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,440
 to poop quick enough to come back

623
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,880
 and watch the rest of the MASH.

624
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,680
 He walks outside and then the family is woken up

625
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,440
 by him yelling, "Get the guns, get the guns!"

626
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,280
 So Nick runs, grabs his shotgun.

627
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,640
 The rest of the family comes out.

628
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,480
 The mom gets her rocket launcher.

629
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,840
 They come out onto the porch 50 yards away from the house.

630
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,400
 There's a little grove of peach trees, a little shed.

631
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,300
 There's a stone wall closer to the house.

632
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,340
 So they're looking over this stone wall

633
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,900
 to see this grove of peach trees, to see this shed.

634
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,580
 But what they see standing in the peach trees

635
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,420
 is three sets of glowing eyes.

636
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,780
 Now these eyes are actually bigger

637
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,900
 than the ones they saw before.

638
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,420
 And they're not bigger 'cause they're closer.

639
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,260
 They're actually physically bigger.

640
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,140
 They could tell that even in the distance,

641
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,660
 those were small creatures, whatever they were.

642
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,020
 It's a very big creature.

643
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,940
 There's only three of them now.

644
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,400
 And they said the eyes are all sitting

645
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,440
 about three feet off of the ground.

646
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,080
 And they're watching these eyes.

647
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,920
 They're watching back.

648
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,680
 Now at this point, dad's like, "Listen, okay,

649
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,180
 "the last time was kind of spooky

650
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,880
 "that we should have done something with the cigar shape.

651
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,120
 "I.E. we should have moved out of the area."

652
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,720
 But he wants to know what these things are.

653
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,560
 So he actually goes around the wall

654
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,480
 and he gets to his pickup truck.

655
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,440
 He drives his truck towards the peach grove.

656
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,760
 Now his intent isn't to run him over.

657
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,240
 His intent is to see what they are.

658
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,720
 So he turns on his high beams

659
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,300
 and you still can't see anything.

660
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,660
 You can see the eyes,

661
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,380
 but he can't make out what these figures are.

662
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,800
 Nick's ready with his shotgun.

663
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,180
 He's standing by the stone wall with his shotgun.

664
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,580
 Billy and the mom are still on the patio.

665
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,660
 And the dad gets out of the truck,

666
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,940
 has his 50 caliber flintlock rifle

667
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,380
 and begins walking towards the eyes.

668
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,700
 And at that point, the mother screams, "Don't.

669
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,860
 "Stop where you are.

670
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,580
 "Don't get near him."

671
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,700
 The dad looks over at the mom.

672
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,340
 He nods.

673
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,120
 Mother knows best, right?

674
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,640
 That's what the show is, right?

675
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,040
 Mother knows best.

676
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,680
 He looks at her.

677
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,600
 He nods.

678
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,280
 And then he aims, takes it with his rifle

679
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,320
 and opens fire on these eyes.

680
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,760
 (imitates gun firing)

681
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,760
 Without any order needed,

682
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,160
 Nick also begins just letting loose

683
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,280
 with his shotgun from over the stone wall.

684
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,640
 (imitates gun firing)

685
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,480
 Shooting at these eyes.

686
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
 They're hitting these three sets of eyes

687
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,260
 from two different angles.

688
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,420
 The eyes don't move.

689
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,420
 They just continue to stare from the darkness.

690
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,820
 At some point, the family, I don't know,

691
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
 runs out of ammo or they just get bored

692
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,380
 where the commercial breaks over on MASH.

693
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,740
 The eyes don't give,

694
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,460
 but they eventually just kind of pack it up

695
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,060
 and they go, "Well, let's go inside."

696
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,420
 That's an interesting point,

697
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,180
 because on one hand you would think,

698
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,060
 would you stay out there all night looking to the eyes

699
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,860
 or at a certain point, would you go back inside?

700
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,620
 'Cause if you get cold or bored

701
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,980
 or you think maybe I'm just seeing something,

702
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,020
 like you would think the eyes would disappear first,

703
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,640
 but there's no note in the story

704
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,040
 like they shot him and the eyes vanished.

705
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
 The eyes were still there.

706
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,720
 They do end up back inside the house.

707
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,680
 The next night, it's not time to use the outhouse.

708
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,960
 I'm sure at this point, dad is pooping during the day,

709
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,280
 but he does look out the window and the eyes are back.

710
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,720
 This time there's three sets of eyes

711
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,720
 and they're three feet off of the top of the stone wall.

712
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,040
 They're now maybe 15 yards from the house.

713
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,740
 Dad and son, they probably have their guns,

714
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,940
 they're ready, they probably didn't even put them away

715
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,840
 from the night before.

716
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,760
 They grab their weapons, they step out on the porch,

717
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,380
 they just begin unloading into these eyes,

718
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,780
 these unmoving sets of eyes that are standing

719
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,560
 on top of this stone wall.

720
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,460
 The dad actually walks up and places the rifle

721
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,300
 right between the eyes and pulls the trigger.

722
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,300
 The eyes don't move, but they never returned after that night.

723
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,400
 After they emptied all their ammo into these things,

724
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,640
 after these point blank shots,

725
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,700
 the eyes never got closer to the house.

726
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,720
 I got that story from thinkaboutadox.com.

727
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,020
 They got it from New Fork,

728
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,420
 which is the National UFO Reporting Center.

729
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,020
 It's an interesting story because you have humans

730
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,420
 engaged in a firefight with eyes.

731
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,740
 And not just eyes, not just eyes

732
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,060
 that are rolling around on the ground eyeballs,

733
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,620
 but with alien or so.

734
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,340
 The fact that we see the UFO in the beginning

735
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,660
 makes us think these are aliens.

736
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,900
 The fact that they're three feet off the ground

737
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,660
 makes you think it's some sort of gray alien.

738
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,380
 As I was telling the story and reading the story,

739
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,020
 I imagine them as the typical big teardrop eyes

740
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,220
 that gray aliens have, but glowing.

741
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,420
 There's a lot of interesting stuff

742
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,560
 that we can really dissect with this one.

743
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,260
 What happened to the hundreds of eyes in the forest?

744
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,300
 What was that?

745
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,180
 And then of course we have the skeptical thing too.

746
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,580
 I gotta throw this in there,

747
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,460
 that it was not the story was made up,

748
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,500
 but that they were seeing some sort of phenomenon.

749
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,460
 The guy is shooting at a bunch of fireflies

750
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,380
 that are floating around and they all happen to form,

751
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,740
 they form a fist and they're shaking, it's fisting them.

752
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,820
 You know, it could have been a natural phenomenon

753
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,180
 and that would explain why the bullets

754
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,740
 were having no effect on them.

755
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,980
 That's why they weren't changing

756
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,140
 when they're being fired upon

757
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,100
 'cause it's just this natural event.

758
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,300
 But looking at it from a paranormal event,

759
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,580
 you know, I do like to put the skeptical answers

760
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,540
 in here as well.

761
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,660
 Looking at paranormal event,

762
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,500
 why were there hundreds of eyes to begin with

763
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,300
 and then just the three?

764
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,460
 What happened to those other sets of eyes?

765
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,060
 Did they go out to investigate other homes in the area?

766
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,140
 Why did the aliens only get so close to the house

767
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,060
 and retreat and they were never seen again?

768
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,380
 Did they eventually, was it that they weren't seen again?

769
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,380
 It was that the next time they were looking out their windows

770
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,940
 and they go, we haven't seen those eyes in a couple days.

771
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,500
 But they don't realize these creatures are in the house

772
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,980
 underneath the stairs, underneath the bed.

773
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,580
 They're basically the boogeyman.

774
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,140
 Every alien just wants to come down

775
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,300
 and be the boogeyman in your house.

776
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,460
 Grab your ankles as you're walking down this stairs

777
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,540
 in your basement.

778
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,940
 But I think it's a fascinating story

779
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,300
 because it gives us an insight to something.

780
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,840
 We'll wrap it up like this.

781
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,820
 All that dad really wanted to do was protect his family

782
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,840
 and protect his land.

783
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,100
 This was a place that him and his family called their own.

784
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,660
 Should be a safe spot.

785
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,860
 And when this intruder shows up,

786
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,060
 they do what you would do to protect your place.

787
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,660
 You attack them.

788
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,100
 But the bullets had no effect.

789
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,340
 These aliens were completely undaunted.

790
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,420
 Really, the fact that they were getting shot at

791
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,260
 didn't affect them.

792
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,240
 They simply got closer and closer and closer.

793
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,440
 They didn't care.

794
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,500
 All these weapons that we used to shoot bats

795
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,780
 and dogs and bear, I don't know who's shooting a dog,

796
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,960
 but these weapons that are used to kill animals and men

797
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,060
 had no effect on these creatures.

798
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,140
 And as I finished that story,

799
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,820
 I kind of sat back and thought,

800
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,420
 this could be a parallel to what humanity is facing.

801
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,900
 This family in Pennsylvania saw a phenomenon

802
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,860
 that was sets of glowing eyes staring at them

803
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,980
 from the darkness of the forest.

804
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,740
 But humanity may soon experience a different phenomenon.

805
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,460
 We may see the lights of a thousand starships

806
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,740
 staring back at us from deep space.

807
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,020
 And as the governments of the world

808
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,500
 try to figure out a way to protect us,

809
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,860
 to protect this planet,

810
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,380
 they'll turn to the one thing humans know best,

811
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,680
 weapons.

812
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,220
 And as we stand there and watch the world's militaries

813
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,500
 fire their missiles,

814
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,300
 watch these advanced weapon platforms shoot out of silos

815
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,460
 across the planet and streak through the night sky

816
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,900
 towards the alien invaders.

817
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,140
 Will we see them impact these starships

818
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,020
 and tear through them and fire and flame?

819
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,080
 Or will all of our weapons be as useless

820
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,400
 as an old man's rifle and his son's shotgun?

821
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,900
 When the aliens show up, do we stand a chance?

822
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,100
 That's a question we won't know

823
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,520
 until it's too late to change the answer.
