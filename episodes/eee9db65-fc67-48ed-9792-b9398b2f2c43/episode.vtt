00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.400
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.440
 - A recent investigation into the Las Vegas mass shooting

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.160
 incident reveals that the government is actively lying

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.540
 to the American people.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.400
 And then we meet a young woman who's gonna be spending

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.680
 a couple days with her sister and her sister's family.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.240
 But when the only room available in the house

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.720
 is deep in the basement,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.320
 she's beginning to have second thoughts.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.520
 And then we travel to the great outdoors.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.240
 Beautiful farmland as far as the eye can see.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.680
 When a vacationing family makes this journey

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.360
 once a year to grow vegetables

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.720
 and pretend that they're farmers,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.240
 everything seems normal.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.920
 But maybe that's because they're not playing close enough

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.200
 attention to the scarecrows in the field.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.780
 (upbeat music)

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.880
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.720
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.840
 I'm your host Jason Perpenter.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.760
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.400
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.480
 in the world doing your thing.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.720
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.120
 So first off, leaking into Dead Rabbit Command,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.560
 crawling all over the floor.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.840
 It's a big old puddle of one of our legacy patrons.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.480
 Everyone give it up for Space Vomit.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.120
 Woohoo, yeah, we're all standing on chairs.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.320
 So it doesn't get on our shoes.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.200
 Woohoo, Space Vomit is leaking into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.680
 Space Vomit, you're gonna be our captain,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.720

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760
 Just helps rid the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.920
 That helps out so much.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.080
 That's a way you can help the fluffle grow

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.280
 Space Vomit, I'm gonna go ahead and scoop you up

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.680
 in a big old fishbowl,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.000
 and I'm gonna put you in the Jason Jet.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.160
 I'm trying to pour it all over the seat.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.480
 Go ahead and fly us out of Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.520
 We're headed to Vegas, baby.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.180
 (air whooshing)

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.000
 We're headed out to Vegas, but not to Gamble.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.580
 To take a look at, oddly enough, a very...

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.080
 We don't really talk about this mass shooting anymore.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.360
 And you can go Jason, well, there's a lot of mass shootings,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.800
 but it's not that.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.920
 That's not the, well, that's part of the reason why,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.360
 but we still talk about Columbine, right?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.280
 Like as a society, a culture,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.260
 we still talk about Columbine.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.040
 We still talk about these other mass shooting events,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.080
 but one that you don't hear much of anymore,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.320
 and it's the most mysterious one of all

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.080
 is the Las Vegas Massacre.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.520
 This happened back on October 1st, 2017,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.160
 just a quick refresh for Jason.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.040
 I don't wanna be reminded of this.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.540
 Absolutely bizarre.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.540
 It's really the biggest mass shooting event

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.280
 that we've seen as far as just full-on fatalities

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.120
 and injuries.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.880
 It was Steven Paddock.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.080
 Hold your questions till the end.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.280
 I know there's conspiracy theories

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.320
 about whether or not he did that,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.360
 but brief overview, Cliff Notes version.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.640
 Steven Paddock, 64-year-old man, right?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.520
 Super old for a mass shooter.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.880
 They tend to be younger.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.680
 Steven Paddock, 64 years old.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.440
 He's in a hotel room in Vegas,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.440
 and there is a music festival going on near his hotel.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.840
 And he busted out a window and opened fire

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.600
 on a crowd of 22,000 festival goers.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.000
 And he has the height,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.520
 and he has all these weapons in his room,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.480
 and he opens fire.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.760
 He fires more than 1,000 rounds.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.280
 He kills 60 people,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.280
 and 867 people are injured in the chaos.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.000
 Some of that's trampoline, right?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.280
 Some of that's like, oh, my feet hurt

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.620
 'cause I'm running so hard.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.360
 But over 400 of those injuries

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.320
 was from bullets or shrapnel.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.360
 So, insane, right?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.080
 Absolutely, the definition of insane.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.840
 There's been a ton of conspiracy theories

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.960
 about this mass shooting in particular

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.020
 because the FBI, they investigated this,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.160
 and they said, we don't know why he did it.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.200
 We don't know why he did it.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.760
 If you go to Wikipedia and you look at the shooting,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.640
 like the very beginning of the summary,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.520
 it says, quote, the motive for the mass shooting

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.380
 is officially undetermined, and that is true.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.440
 The FBI goes, we don't know why he did it.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.920
 And that's been a big question.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.900
 Now, there was a ton of conspiracy theories about it

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.400
 that it was a ISIS weapon deal gone bad,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.400
 and it was actually ISIS that opened fire on the crowd.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.900
 ISIS did claim that this guy was a member of ISIS.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.160
 They said, oh, we know that dude.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.640
 And the government, the feds, we said,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.080
 no, we don't believe that part.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.800
 ISIS, you're very untrustworthy.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.440
 We don't believe, ISIS did claim responsibility for this.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.280
 That was a conspiracy theory.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.900
 There's been a lot of conspiracy theories

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.820
 surrounding this, I think one of them,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.540
 'cause we covered it a bit earlier

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.420
 in the run of the show,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.380
 was that his target wasn't the music festival,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.180
 or there was some shootout between a feds and someone else,

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.140
 and these people were actually caught in the crossfire,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.860
 and the gunfire was actually aiming towards a fuel tank

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.700
 or something.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.380
 I remember hearing all this stuff, I looked into it.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.260
 But at the end of the day, the FBI who investigated it said,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.660
 we don't know why he did it.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.160
 That's a lie.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.580
 And it's not a lie 'cause I'm a conspiracy theorist.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.180
 It's not a lie 'cause I have a hunch.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.640
 This is absolutely insane.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.280
 I read true crime all the time.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.280
 There was an article on crimeonline.com,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.240
 and they were citing a newspaper that's based

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.360
 in Las Vegas called the Review Journal,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.840
 reviewjournal.com, this is all in the show notes.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.840
 It turns out that the FBI came into the possession

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.840
 of 10 letters written from a man named Jim Nixon.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.360
 Jim Nixon is a disabled Vietnam veteran

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.480
 and a convicted felon.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.880
 He did time for tax fraud,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.880
 and he was a close personal friend of Stephen Paddock.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.040
 They have in their possession 10 letters.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.600
 The reason why we know this is because the Review Journal

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.640
 heard about the letters filed a Freedom of Information Act

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.680
 to get these letters from the feds, and we now know,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.920
 I think some of them are pretty heavily redacted,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.240
 but the FBI, they weren't redacted when the FBI got them.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.840
 Jim Nixon, these letters were written

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.360
 over the course of four years.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.320
 It was 10 letters from 2013 to 2017

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.960
 when the shootings took place.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.720
 And the letters said things like,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.720
 "Remember, the FBI says we have no idea why he did this,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.320
 that he went through two great lengths

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.440
 to hide the fact that he was going to commit a mass shooting,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.960
 why he committed the mass shooting,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.400
 what his end goal was, everything."

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.640
 They had, they got these letters after the shooting,

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.200
 obviously, they weren't able to prevent it,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.120
 but here's a quote from a letter that was written

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.880
 in May, 2017 from Jim Nixon to his buddy, Steven Paddock,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.880
 "I can get someone for you who can help you.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.120
 Please don't go out shooting or hurting people

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.080
 who did nothing to you.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.200
 I'm concerned about the way you are talking

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.800
 and believe you are going to do something very bad.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 Steve, please, please don't do what I think

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.040
 you are going to do."

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.400
 So Jim Nixon knew that this guy was talking

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.800
 about doing crazy things.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.520
 One of the letter refers to Steven,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.680
 'cause you know, we just have the letters

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.840
 that Jim had written saying,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.680
 "Oh yeah, you were telling me you wanted

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.640
 a list of music festivals in the United States.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.560
 Sure, I can get you that list.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.520
 I don't know why Steven couldn't Google it,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.080
 but yeah, yeah, I'll hold you out with them."

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.000
 So they were contacting each other,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.840
 talking back and forth,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.240
 and one of the things was big music festivals.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.080
 At that point, Jim's like,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.520
 "You know, maybe he just really likes

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.400
 Grateful Dead or something like that."

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.800
 But in May, 2017, it says,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.920
 "Listen, I think you're gonna go hurt people.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.240
 Here's more of this letter.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.560
 Quote, "You are a good person

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.400
 and I want you to know that I'm concerned

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.240
 about you and your well-being.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.800
 I believe that you are lying to me

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.040
 and you are going to hurt someone or kill someone.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.560
 You sounded like a real madman on the phone tonight."

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.440
 The FBI had possession of these letters.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.360
 I'm just quoting one of them, right?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.120
 The FBI has possession of these letters.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.120
 The rest of them are kind of around the same thing.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.280
 One of the letters says, quote,

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.320
 "Look, buddy, I can get you some help.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.640
 You need to talk to someone who knows

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.480
 how to deal with dreams.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.520
 Don't listen to what the damn dreams tell you.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.680
 I will help you all I can."

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:53.200
 Okay, the FBI has possession of these letters.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.440
 They had possessions of these letters early on

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.320
 in the investigation because they were found.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.920
 Some people had bought a building in Mesquite, Texas.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.520
 That's where Stephen Paddock used to live.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.680
 And these 10 letters were found at this abandoned building

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.720
 that they were cleaning up.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.920
 Presumably, they're cleaning up after the shooting.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.200
 They find them addressed to Stephen Paddock

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.120
 or they had them.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.840
 They found them before and just kind of set them aside.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.480
 I'm not for sure, but these 10 letters

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.200
 were sent to the FBI.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.600
 Jim Nixon saying things like,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.200
 "Don't listen to the dreams."

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.000
 Quote, "Please don't go on any shooting rampage

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.920
 like a fool."

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.080
 Unquote.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.960
 They had possession of the 10 letters.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.940
 Jim Nixon was interviewed by the review journal.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.040
 He said, "The FBI never contacted me."

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.680
 This guy goes and opens fire on 22,000 people.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.280
 They know the name of someone who before the shooting

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.040
 knew him, had an idea what was going to happen,

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.240
 was trying to convince him not to.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.480
 He does it.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.720
 Stephen Paddock is killed in the shooting.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.040
 The FBI has these letters.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.760
 They never interviewed Jim Nixon to go,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.840
 "What are the dreams?

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.680
 Do you know any motive of why he would have done this?"

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.800
 They never talked to Jim Nixon.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.880
 And here's the thing.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.160
 So the reason why the letter stopped in May

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.440
 is because Jim was sent back to prison.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.580
 He violated his parole, he did something, right?

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.500
 So he stopped writing in May of 2017

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.040
 because he was in jail now.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.980
 The only reason why the FBI wouldn't go out

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.860
 to interview Jim Nixon is if they already knew the motive.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.580
 Why would they wanna go to this interview?

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.160
 They already know I did it, but they're not telling us.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.120
 It's infuriating, really.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.520
 It's so infuriating because, listen,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.920
 I get that an open investigation's not giving out

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.820
 the information, but in this case, it's closed.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.420
 They just said it's undetermined.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.060
 They know why, so why go through the extra step?

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.100
 And what makes it even weirder?

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.300
 Like, you know the government lies to you.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.860
 You know the feds are gonna lie to you.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.260
 Why they're covering this?

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.100
 This is a cover-up.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.620
 They know exactly why he shot those people.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.780
 They're not telling us.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.620
 Why?

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.980
 Why aren't they telling us?

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.340
 This guy knows.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.420
 And to make it even, you know the feds are gonna lie to you.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.380
 You would hope they don't lie to you about everything.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.560
 We know the feds are gonna lie to us, right?

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.160
 What I find super intriguing about this,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.460
 and we'll wrap it up with this,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.220
 feds say they don't know what caused it.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.840
 Jim Nixon wrote these letters.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.560
 He must have some inkling, even if it's something like,

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.360
 "Yeah, he always just wanted to shoot up a bunch of people."

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.600
 Like, his motive was he wanted to kill a bunch of people.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.260
 Like, he always talked about,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.360
 'cause they said maybe he had bad gambling debts,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.660
 he had to pay off, maybe, da da da da da da da da.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.700
 They've been throwing darts at a board as well.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.060
 But even if the motive was I wanted to feel like,

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.380
 I wanted to feel what it was like to kill a bunch of people,

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.880
 the FBI's not even saying that.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.700
 They're not just saying he was a man-man.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.200
 They're saying we don't know why he did it.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.780
 That's a lie.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.640
 And the man who definitely would at least give them some clues

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.680
 as to why he did it, the FBI never interviewed.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.840
 The FBI never interviewed.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.700
 Well, the Review Journal did this newspaper.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.480
 They interviewed Jim Nixon and he goes,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.340
 "Yeah, I wrote those letters and the FBI never talked to me."

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:32.240
 The Review Journal didn't say what Jim's theory was

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.680
 on why he did the mass shooting either.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.440
 You know what I mean?

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.620
 If I am a journalist, I would say,

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.780
 "Well, why do you think he did it?

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.160
 Why do you think he did it?

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.920
 Do you have his correspondence with him for years?

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.280
 Why do you think he did it?"

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.240
 And what Jim, what his friend, his confidant must have said

00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:03.520
 to the reporter was so dangerous, the newspaper wouldn't even

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.080
 publish it.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.320
 Or like many major newspapers in America,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.680
 the reporter asked the question, got the answer,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.060
 took it back to the newspaper, and the editor makes a call.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.820
 And that editor makes a call before the government calls the

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.500
 editor and says, "Don't run the story."

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.020
 The editor of some things, say,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.980
 "If something's too controversial,

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.900
 the editor will call up their contact in the federal government

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.860
 and say, 'Hey, should we run this?'"

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.180
 Why did he do it?

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.100
 We know.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.820
 As a government, we know.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.400
 But as a citizen, as a society, we don't know.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.840
 The motive is officially undetermined.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.480
 That's a lie.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.480
 And there's a guy out there who could at least shed light on it.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.880
 And even if it was, his motive was he

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.080
 wanted to shoot a bunch of people.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:56.640
 That's a motive.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.760
 And just to add a little bit of conspiracy sugar

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.240
 to this cake that we are forced to eat, this disgusting cake,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.940
 Stephen Paddock-- let's look at his career trajectory.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.500
 He worked for the post office.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.180
 I know there are jokes about going postal.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.780
 He worked for the post office.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.660
 Then he moved on to the IRS.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.020
 Then he worked for the Department of Defense.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.240
 And then he worked for a company that ended up

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.260
 merging with Lockheed Martin, which

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.940
 is a huge defense contractor.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.960
 And then in the end, the last chunk of his life,

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.000
 he worked in real estate.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.440
 If you want to look at someone, we talk about--

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.920
 I mentioned Project Monarch.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.200
 I mentioned government mind control.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:54.200
 This person was 10 toes deep in the government machine,

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.920
 almost his entire life.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.440
 And his motive is officially undetermined.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:05.080
 Space vomit.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.700
 That's kind of a weird segue, but space vomit.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.020
 Let's go ahead and toss you into the--

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.700
 we need a submarine.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.100
 But I can't come up with it off the top of my head.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.900
 Space vomit, let's go ahead and toss you

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.820
 into the dead rabbit dirgeable we're

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.300
 going to leave behind Las Vegas.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.300
 Fly us all the way out, too.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.700
 A house in the suburbs.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.180
 [BURPING]

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.140
 This episode is going to have a theme.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.540
 The theme isn't "Math Shooters."

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.620
 That's not the theme.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.780
 But let's see if you can pick up on what this theme is.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.100
 We're in this neighborhood.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.300
 We're in this typical suburban neighborhood.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.700
 We see a young woman walking into a house.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.820
 Now, we don't have a specific location

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.060
 or any of the real names.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.100
 We're going to go ahead and call this woman Shirley.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.540
 And her mom is in the hospital right now.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.140
 It's really, really tough times.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.820
 No one wants anyone in the hospital, especially

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.420
 mamas, right?

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.580
 And Shirley is staying with her sister's family.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.580
 They're going to be living together in this house

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.700
 while the mom's in the hospital.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.300
 It's probably just more convenient.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.940
 Maybe they live right across street.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.020
 That'd be convenient, right?

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.020
 It'd be hard to get to good night's sleep

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.700
 when the ambulance is flying in and out.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.700
 But when it sucks to live there unless your mom's

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.820
 in the hospital, then it's the best house in town.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.260
 So she walks into the house and her sister's like,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.340
 Shirley, thank you so much.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.100
 For being here, we'll all help mama out.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.220
 However, we only have one spare room available

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.220
 and it's in the basement.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.460
 Do you have a night light to make it a little less spooky?

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.300
 And Shirley is like, OK, I can do this.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.220
 I can live in this basement for just a while

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.220
 until mom gets better.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.300
 Well, she makes it till night three.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.020
 You've always been so long underground.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.900
 That's really what it is.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.260
 She makes it three nights.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.500
 She's laying there in bed.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.100
 And there's a closet.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.580
 So where?

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.340
 Why would you have a closet in the basement?

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.180
 I guess not every basement looks like Freddy Kruger's house.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.620
 But there's a closet in the basement.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.540
 And Shirley's there in bed and she's trying to sleep.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.300
 And then all of a sudden she hears--

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:36.260
 [GROANING]

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.700
 And what that sound is--

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.380
 I just have no idea what that sound is.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.420
 Is that heavy breathing?

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.500
 Is that a goat in labor?

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:49.580
 What she hears is the sound of something heavy being dragged

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.620
 across the floor.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.120
 Now listen.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.540
 [GROANING]

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.040
 You see?

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.900
 You can hear it now.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.140
 You can see it in your ears.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.700
 She hears this heavy--

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.420
 it's the sound of something heavy being

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.900
 dragged across the floor.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.980
 It's coming from the closet.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.660
 And in an odd detail and something

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.140
 that only the world of the paranormal can do,

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:19.220
 she said, not only was it the sound of something huge

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.540
 and heavy being dragged across the ground,

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.860
 she goes, the closet's the size of a normal closet.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.780
 But the sound-- it sounded like it was being

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.220
 dragged through a huge room.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:36.500
 Not that there was an echo.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.000
 Echo.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.980
 But that you would hear it--

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.700
 like again, it's hard to describe.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.380
 It's the way the world of the paranormal can work sometimes.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.020
 It sounds like it was being dragged across a bigger

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.260
 distance, but the sound was just emanating

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.380
 from the closet itself.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.700
 So that's really creeping her out.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.780
 You can go, well, that could just be a couple squirrels

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.660
 dragging themselves around.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.780
 But it doesn't make sense-- spatially,

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.820
 it didn't make sense.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.220
 Why is she hearing the noise like it's

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.820
 being dragged over this great distance,

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.660
 but the entire time the sound's coming from the closet?

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.940
 She does, though, go-- that is weird.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.020
 And it's fairly petrifying, however,

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.620
 must just be my imagination.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.020
 I am going through a lot of stuff right now.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.460
 My mom's in the hospital.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.620
 I'm in a basement.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.700
 Those are two pretty bad things, right?

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.820
 You don't need a third.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.900
 I think it's just my imagination.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.380
 And she goes, this noise?

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.620
 That night would start and stop.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.700
 Wasn't it continuous?

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.460
 She's like, oh, white noise.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.300
 I wish they had this on a white noise machine.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.820
 [GRUNTS]

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.820
 She said it would start and stop.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.740
 But she would also start to hear--

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.380
 there's a little basement window.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.660
 She would start to hear the sound of metal scraping

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.780
 against the-- she's like, come on, man.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.460
 I just want to go to sleep.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.380
 I'm here at all the spooky stuff.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.580
 But she hears the sound of metal scraping across the basement

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.060
 window.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.820
 Eventually, she's able to fall asleep.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.100
 The soothing sounds of goats and labor,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.340
 metal scraping on glass.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.300
 She's eventually able to fall asleep.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.660
 But it's not a restful sleep.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.580
 She eventually wakes up a couple hours later.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.660
 And the room is dark.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.620
 The night light that gave her just a little bit of comfort

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.380
 is off.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.700
 She wakes up.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.060
 She's in a completely black room.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.740
 It's basically pitch black at this point.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.140
 There's no light at all.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.260
 And she's scared.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.180
 Even adults need night lights from time to time.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.180
 She's scared.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.460
 She can't figure out what's going on.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.500
 She looks and she sees by the window.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.460
 But in the basement--

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.740
 in the basement standing by the window,

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.140
 she sees a tall man.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.500
 She said he was so tall his head was nearly

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.540
 touching the ceiling.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.300
 Technically, the floor, really, of the house.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.180
 She's really chasing away.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.100
 Now I'm confused with the stand on his head.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.140
 The ceiling of a basement is the floor of a house.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.860
 But anyways, he's so tall his head is almost touching the floor.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:31.740
 But not only was this man tall, he was wearing clothes.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.700
 He was wearing clothes.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.140
 He had torn up clothes, rags, basically,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.380
 like a big old hobo, a giant tall hobo,

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.740
 standing in the basement with long, dark hair

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.820
 and a long, dark, scraggly beard.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.700
 He just stood there in the darkness with his arms crossed,

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.100
 completely motionless.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:23:04.580
 But then he begins to turn his head and locks

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.900
 eyes with Shirley.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.780
 They stare at each other for just a moment.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.740
 Shirley's petrified.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.700
 She can't even move.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:21.260
 She has no idea what this specter's intent is going to be.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:26.140
 But just when she's thinking the worst, he vanishes.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.180
 And so does the darkness.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:40.940
 Slowly, the basement is illuminated once again, not fully.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:49.260
 But that soft glow of the night light is visible once more.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:54.380
 It hadn't burned out.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.980
 It hadn't been unplugged.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:02.420
 This presence, when it entered the basement, sucked all the light

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.820
 out of it.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:10.940
 So only it and Shirley existed in this dark realm.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.140
 That wasn't her imagination, right?

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.700
 Shirley was like, OK, I saw that.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.420
 It was not my imagination.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.900
 There's something completely wrong with this basement.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.380
 I do want to stay around because mom's in the hospital,

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.900
 but I can't do this.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.060
 The next morning, she tells her sister.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:31.780
 She goes, hey, listen, I'm just not going to sugarcoat it.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:32.860
 Your basement's haunted.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.180
 This is what happened last night.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.020
 The dragging and the metal scraping.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.460
 And sure, that could have been anything.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.500
 But then a giant guy showed up wearing these scraggly clothes.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.980
 And he looked at me.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.340
 Your basement's haunted.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.100
 And her sister had a very interesting reaction.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:58.100
 She said, don't, please don't tell my husband or my kid

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.700
 about what you saw.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.380
 Shirley's like, why not?

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.540
 I can understand the kid.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.340
 But why don't you want me to tell your husband?

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.460
 And the sister goes, if you tell them

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.820
 that the basement is haunted, they will never go down there

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.320
 again.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.700
 I need you to promise me you will not tell them what you saw

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.300
 because they will both be so scared it will actually disrupt

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.820
 the household.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.300
 I'm sure that's where the laundry machines were.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.580
 I mean, some people don't ever go into basements.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.180
 I've lived in a few houses with basements.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.780
 Very rarely went down there.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.660
 Other people, like the basement, is an extension of the house.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.500
 They have things down there they need.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.380
 Do not tell.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:46.180
 You've got to promise me you won't tell my husband or my kid

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.380
 any part of that story.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.300
 Say you had a great night's sleep.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.620
 Maybe you'll figure out something.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.620
 You can sleep on the couch.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.220
 But don't tell them.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:53.860
 And she didn't.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.740
 Shirley did not tell the husband or the daughter what

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.700
 she had seen.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.060
 But she knew.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.740
 And she knew-- her sister knew that there was something else

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.660
 in that house, something in the basement.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.580
 But they would never tell the other members of that family.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.220
 Shirley did want to add.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.740
 She posted this online.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.260
 Took place in December 2022.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.940
 She posted it online under the name Life Is Great 2.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.020
 She did add at the end.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.780
 And she goes, my mom's fine.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.820
 My mom's totally fine.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.100
 So if you're a fan of moms, which most people don't worry

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.340
 about it, the mom pulled through.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.300
 Very, very interesting ghost story.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.780
 I don't think it would be a shadow man.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.300
 Shadow men very rarely appear with clothing.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.380
 And usually it's just like a hat or a coat.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.620
 This guy was wearing red hacks unless the shadow man's

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.260
 fallen on tough times.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.580
 This was a mother sort of entity.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.500
 And this is one of those stories that Shirley posted this.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.260
 And I looked through the rest of the posting history stuff

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.060
 about something called warrior cats.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.700
 I don't know if that's a cartoon or a comic book

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.420
 or something like that.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.820
 Just about a bunch of cats kicking each other in the balls

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.300
 or something.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.500
 I don't know.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.100
 But that's always interesting when people live

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.460
 a totally normal life.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.380
 Well, I guess I don't know what warrior cats is.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.900
 There might be some creepy fetish thing.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.540
 You're like, Jason, that's the craziest thing

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.820
 you've ever brought up on this show.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.060
 I don't know what it is.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.820
 But it's interesting when people live relatively normal lives

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.900
 and then this paranormal story just happens.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.860
 It is an interesting little tidbit.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.420
 But she does.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.220
 She hasn't never told the husband or the daughter.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:40.180
 They still don't know what's in the basement.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.020
 Space vomit.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.780
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbon

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.340
 car copter.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.380
 We're up, up, and away out of this neighborhood.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.500
 Take us all the way out to the great outdoors.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.900
 [HUMMING]

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.740
 Another story.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.700
 We don't have a location of the real names for it.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.580
 We're going to go ahead and meet a young boy.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.020
 We're going to call him Cole.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.180
 Cole, him and his family did the same thing every summer.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.500
 They're like, kids, there's a lot of fun stuff we could do.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.900
 Disneyland, Knotsbury Farm.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.300
 But what's better than Knotsbury Farm?

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.060
 And the kids are like, Disneyland.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.300
 And they're like, no, no, no, forget I said Disneyland.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.140
 That doesn't work.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.100
 What's better than Knotsbury Farm, kids?

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.140
 And they're like, I have pretty much anything because Snoopy

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.740
 sucks.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.580
 And that's like, what I was getting at

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:36.860
 was the only thing better than Knotsbury Farm is a real farm.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.180
 What's better than riding on roller coasters

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.460
 or having fun in general or spinning your summer vacation

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.940
 working on a farm?

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.620
 So the family would load up every summer

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.500
 and they would go out.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.220
 They rented this farm land from a guy named George.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.300
 It was basically Airbnb.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.140
 But with wheat and stuff like that.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.180
 So anyways, there's this guy named George

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.500
 and he rents out his farm.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.460
 It actually sounds like a pretty good deal, right?

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.020
 Because you'd be like, I'm too old to farm.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.100
 He's 47.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:07.900
 He's just too real.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.620
 He's like, oh, the soil's been bad to me.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.860
 Maybe I'll rent out my farm and let

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.780
 other people plant tomatoes and squash.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.700
 And then the day before the harvest, they show up.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.860
 I'm the human rabbit.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.940
 Nom, nom, nom, nom.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.220
 And they're like, what happened to it?

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.700
 Flock a locus come through.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.900
 Every single vegetable is gone as he's

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.180
 driving away on a tractor.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.860
 George rents out his farm land.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.860
 So people, tunis out of towners,

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.740
 can come out and plant stuff in his fields

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.300
 and then harvest them.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.660
 Doesn't sound like--

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.340
 it sounds like the opposite of fun.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.500
 It is the opposite of fun.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.140
 It's work.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.900
 It's literally backbreaking labor during summer vacation.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:56.340
 But anyways, also, can you grow fruit that quickly?

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:56.900
 Not fruit.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.620
 Those are trees.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:04.220
 Can you grow vegetables in summer vacation?

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.300
 Like, is that a thing?

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.780
 I always thought like you had to plant in spring

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.940
 and then harvest in summer.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.340
 I don't know.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.580
 I don't know anything about vegetables.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.580
 I think they're disgusting.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.420
 So I don't particularly care.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.060
 But maybe something lame like broccoli pops up pretty quickly

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.340
 or carrots.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.660
 The lame stuff.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.780
 Not like potatoes.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:26.020
 So anyways, this family goes out every year.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.940
 And that's how they spend their vacation.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.180
 They grow veggies and enjoy the rural life

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.100
 before they head back to the big city.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.180
 The stomach full of broccoli and a brain full of memories

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.620
 of the great outdoors.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.060
 But anyone who's ever lived on a farm

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.980
 knows that pests are the number one problem.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.580
 I don't actually know if that's true.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.420
 You're like, no, Jason, there's far bigger problems than that.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.620
 Well, anyways, this farm had a particular problem

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.980
 with rabbits and deer coming in and eating the carrots.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.220
 Om nom nom nom.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.460
 And they'd have stalks of broccoli

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.420
 and the deer are eating them up.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.660
 And the rabbits are grabbing handfuls of corn

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.820
 and chewing them up.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.500
 So the family goes, you know what we need to do?

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.060
 Let's put up some scarecrow.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.820
 Let's put up some scarecrow to scare these rabbits away.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.180
 I always thought you just built a rabbit-proof fence,

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.860
 like a fence that was super deep.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.500
 It's all touching the magma that you're

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.140
 like trying to dig in through molten lava.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.420
 You jerk.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.460
 You have a-- but anyway, so these guys have scarecrow

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.340
 up in the field.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.740
 This family puts these scarecrow up.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.180
 I'm sure it would work against deer.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.700
 Maybe if he gave the scarecrow like a gun, like aiming.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.220
 Aiming.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.300
 It's like drone operated.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.260
 The dad's sitting in the house, do-do-controlling it.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.020
 Just to scare him away.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.060
 He's actually not shooting the deer yet.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.860
 But anyways, they put up these scarecrow.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.900
 They harvest whatever you can harvest in the summer.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.540
 And then they go back to the big city,

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:03.660
 to the daily grind of unending Starbucks and school and work.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.140
 But next summer's coming up.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.980
 Guess where we're going, guys?

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.660
 The farm.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.740
 Yeah, the farm.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.180
 Not Knott's Berry Farm.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.260
 Real farm.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.740
 So they go out to the farm the next year.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.780
 And George lives there when they're not there.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.860
 Also, he's not just like, well, time to be homeless.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.420
 He's all makes his little bendle and walks away.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.380
 Time to go hunt a basement.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.700
 George is there when they're not.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.820
 They show up and they're like, hey, George,

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.860
 we're here to rent the farm again.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.260
 George's like, sounds great.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.460
 But Cole and his family would realize,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.700
 they put the scarecrow's up the first year

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.500
 to keep away the deer and the rabbits and stuff.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.500
 When they came back to the farm the second year,

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.580
 the scarecrow's were in a different location.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.020
 So they do it another summer.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.260
 They're there farming, working the plow,

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.380
 putting hay seeds in their mouth, all the stuff,

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.900
 all the stuff you imagine on a farm,

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.700
 making their own manure.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.300
 They're like, oh, this is the best part

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.620
 of being on the outdoors.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.900
 Pooping on veggies, he's all eating a vegetable

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.180
 as he's pooping on it.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.260
 He's like, I should probably plant this first.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.460
 I should probably not do any of this, honestly.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.580
 I should probably go do a proper vacation.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.780
 But he's sitting there, the dad's sitting there

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.460
 reading a newspaper, making manure in the field.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.060
 That's year two.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.580
 Year three comes around.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.660
 Cole's like, oh, man, let's do a farm thing.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.860
 I have a girlfriend now.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.180
 Look at it, she's adorable.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.500
 I have a girlfriend.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.660
 We're gonna be hanging out this summer.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.580
 We're gonna be watching movies and things like that.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.740
 Dad's like, the only movie you need, son,

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:44.460
 is looking out of a farmhouse window at crops growing

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.980
 and me making manure.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.380
 Cole's like, no, we can buy manure.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.740
 Can we go to Home Depot before we get there now?

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.340
 Year three, pretty much the same thing.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.620
 Is they're driving up to the farm

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.980
 and they notice that the scarecrow's

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.900
 are in a different location, but whatever.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.100
 Go to George, say, hey, we wanna rent the farm out.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.020
 He's like, oh, yes, I knew you city slickers

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.860
 would be back.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.420
 No one escapes the farm life.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.800
 It's just too much fun.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.860
 And they do this for four years in total.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.060
 And it plays out pretty much the same time.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.820
 But after year four, Cole's family,

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.460
 like they worked that season.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.820
 They're standing on the porch,

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.460
 they're wiping their brows, fresh farm sweat

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.620
 dripping off their skin.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:31.100
 Delicious, delicious lemonade sitting on the table.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.660
 It's half sweat at this point.

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:33.820
 They're sweating into it.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.060
 Dad's drinking a big drink.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.620
 Quite salty lemonade you made here, honey.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.700
 Yum, yum, yum.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.980
 I kinda like it.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.920
 Tastes like me.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.980
 Well, everyone, let's look at this farm one last time

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.380
 because next year we're gonna take a real vacation.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.340
 We've worked our fingers to the bone,

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.780
 tilling this land.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.860
 Probably should have used,

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.860
 probably should have used that plow more.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.340
 But I wanted to be part of the soil.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.540
 Oh, myself, I'm a soyleaf.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.940
 That's my fetish now.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.700
 Look at it, family.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.540
 Look at it and wonder, this is the farm

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.520
 we've spent the last four summers at,

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.060
 but this will be the end.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.820
 So when George comes back this time,

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.780
 the dad goes, "Hey, we had a lot of fun.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.420
 "Made a lot of memories.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.740
 "Made even more manure."

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.060
 But George's like, "What, what?

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.420
 "You guys have been making your own manure?

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.460
 "The dad goes, "We're not gonna rent it next year.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.940
 "Just letting you know next year

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.200
 "we're not gonna rent the farm.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.940
 "We're gonna go on real vacations.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.980
 "We're gonna go and do things that normal humans do."

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.180
 And that is when George says,

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.020
 okay, yeah, you're not coming back next year.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.180
 And Dad's like, "Nope, we're not gonna be back next year."

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.020
 And George goes, "Well, you know,

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:55.340
 "I just gonna sound crazy, but you know,

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.860
 "I'm never gonna see you again.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.300
 "You're never gonna pay me money again.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.260
 "So I'm gonna tell you something."

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:06.980
 Those scarecrows you guys put up in the fields.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.460
 Dad's like, "Yeah, yeah, we've got this a couple years ago."

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:14.460
 And George goes, "Yeah, every night that I lived

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.940
 "on this farm, every night,

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.820
 "when I looked out into the field,

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:32.100
 "I'd watch the scarecrows move."

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:36.980
 Dad's like, "What are you talking about?"

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.940
 George is like, "At night when I look out my window here,

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.380
 "you can see them moving,

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.660
 "you can see them walking through the fields.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:52.580
 "Now Cole said, I still think about that.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.180
 "I still think about what George said.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.300
 "And he might have been pulling a prank.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.140
 "It might have been a joke that we didn't get."

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.820
 Like he goes rationally speaking,

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.580
 "George probably moved the scarecrows.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.340
 "And then when we weren't coming back told us

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.300
 "that the reason why we showed,

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.260
 "that each time we showed up there in a different location

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.900
 "wasn't 'cause he was moving them,

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.580
 "but because they were moving themselves,

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.100
 "they were walking around in the field."

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.260
 He goes, "It must have been a joke

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:28.420
 "because obviously stuff like that isn't real."

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.620
 Right?

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.900
 But it's interesting, like you're right,

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:40.060
 this 100% could have been a joke that he was pulling.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.540
 It's a fairly elaborate joke,

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.020
 not like it takes a lot of effort.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.940
 I imagine, let's say there's more than one,

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.220
 so let's say there's four scarecrows, right?

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.860
 It's not super hard to pick up a scarecrow,

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.660
 they're not, they're made of straw,

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.100
 after all they are fairly light

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.940
 in the grand scale of things.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:01.780
 But remember, he would have had to do this four years in a row

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.300
 and never mention it.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.620
 And not only never mention it,

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.380
 but assume that they would notice

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.820
 that the scarecrows were in different locations.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.420
 They would be gone for an entire year.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.460
 And then they come back and they go,

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.740
 "Oh, those scarecrows are in a different location."

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:20.300
 He never mentioned it until they stopped coming,

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.780
 until they said, "We're not coming back."

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.460
 And then he goes, "Well, this is gonna be kind of weird,

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.140
 "but I'm gonna tell you now the scarecrows move at night."

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.620
 And the family, Cole's family never saw them move.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.380
 They saw their new locations

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.980
 and assumed he had moved them for some purpose or another.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.940
 And now Cole goes, "Maybe it was this elaborate prank."

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:48.540
 But George, as far as we go off a George word,

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.620
 the scarecrows were walking through the fields at night.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.700
 And the reason why I combined these three stories

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:02.700
 is they all have the similar theme of deception, of lying.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.940
 Now the first one, it's government,

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.860
 it's either government incompetence,

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.620
 government conspiracy coverup.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.420
 And we're used to that every single day.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.060
 We're used to that,

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.620
 that's just part of being a citizen

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.140
 of any nation in the world.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.740
 The government is either incompetent or corrupt.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:29.100
 I think most people go in with the best intentions

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.940
 and then they just become part of the machine.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.940
 And we're so used to that, that when we encounter it,

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.220
 if someone goes, "I can't believe that."

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.780
 The government lied to it.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.740
 Anyone over the age of four,

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.940
 anyone over the age of being able to read a newspaper,

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.420
 goes, "Yeah, of course they lied to you.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.860
 "They'll always lie to you."

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.060
 And that's tragic and it's tragic that we accept it.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.100
 We shouldn't accept it yet, we do.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.860
 But these last two stories are deception on a different level.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.340
 Not just 'cause it's paranormal,

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.020
 but the question that I find interesting

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.860
 about these two stories is,

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:11.360
 do you have a right to know

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:16.060
 if you're in paranormal peril?

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.460
 Like was there,

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.660
 and I don't wanna go off too long about this,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:25.220
 but is there a, at the very least,

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.260
 a moral case to be made

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.940
 that if there's a demon in your basement

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.860
 who can break the laws of physics

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:37.860
 by dragging a giant whatever it was, a cage,

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.180
 who knows what it was?

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.580
 And he's just this tall dude hanging out in your bed.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.980
 Don't you think that if you were the kid or the husband,

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.100
 you would have a right to know?

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.300
 Because if you don't know, you're right.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.580
 Maybe the dad is me,

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.500
 maybe the dad's a big old scaredy cat.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.580
 And my sister-in-law says,

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:02.580
 "Hey Jason, my sister told me not to tell you,

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:07.460
 "but there's a giant tall man in the basement

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.540
 "who can suck all light out of a room."

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.660
 I'd be like, "I would."

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.780
 Listen, I probably would go back down there,

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.140
 but I would also use it as an excuse

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.380
 to never go down there.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.660
 "Hey honey, can you take out the garbage?"

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.020
 No, because the tall guy,

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.540
 "They're like the garbage is in the basement."

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.380
 I was like, "Yeah, but maybe he'll see me walking around

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.300
 "and come out of the basement.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.700
 "Can you take out the garbage?"

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.860
 But if I didn't know there was a giant tall man down there,

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.820
 dragon stuff, and then I get possessed

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:40.500
 and come out of the basement holding a sledgehammer,

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.980
 and I start pounding people's brains into paste,

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.140
 who's fault is that?

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.140
 Who's fault is that?

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.900
 Had you told me that there was a monster down there,

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.340
 I probably would have not probably wouldn't have waited

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.260
 until 3 AM, I was like, "Oh man,

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.620
 "I gotta start that project tomorrow.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.100
 "I better go down to the basement

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.300
 "at the smokiest time of day."

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.340
 You know, maybe I could have planned my day better.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.020
 I could have planned around not getting possessed

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.260
 'cause I'm not down there.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.900
 Who's fault would that be?

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.700
 I didn't know there was a monster down there.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.820
 The sister did.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.500
 Do you have a right to know

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.180
 that there's a demon in your house?

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.220
 And you go, "Obviously, obviously you do,

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.020
 "but I think this type of story happens more often than not."

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.740
 There was another story that, you know,

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.300
 sometimes I have to make decisions of what to cover.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.140
 There was another story,

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.820
 there was pretty much the exact same thing.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.340
 It was a family,

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.820
 and that was the one where the dad

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.820
 saw a shadowy figure darting in and out

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.580
 of the newborn baby's room

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.100
 and hearing weird voices.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.980
 And then the story ends, he posted this, he goes,

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.260
 "Yeah, I didn't tell anybody

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.060
 "because my wife already hates being at home with the kids

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.740
 "and this would just make things worse."

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:55.740
 If she knew there was a shadow demon attacking their baby.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.420
 So he, I'll put that in the show notes.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.620
 It's basically just kind of the same setup.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.060
 He's like, "I'm not gonna tell her

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.940
 "because she'll just freak out."

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.420
 And she already doesn't like being at home.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.500
 Which was what was interesting is he goes,

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.220
 she already doesn't like being at home alone with the kids.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.620
 And I'm wondering if she's experiencing stuff too

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.220
 and not telling him 'cause he's a skeptic.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.300
 'Cause he would just say you're being hysterical.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.380
 And so when you're not communicating, bad things can happen.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.700
 This Scarecrow story too was written,

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.500
 posted online by someone going by the name

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.860
 Asparagus New 5501.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:37.460
 So this guy may, this guy may be a veggie.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.260
 This guy may have a fetish for vegetables

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.220
 'cause he spent his childhood on a farm.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.940
 Now he thinks he is actually asparagus, new asparagus.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:51.300
 But anyway, the Scarecrow story too, like as a family,

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:56.300
 imagine he rented out a house and the George,

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.420
 the landlord, whatever it is, the renter,

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.060
 doesn't tell you that Scarecrow's

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.700
 are walking through the field at night.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.180
 You never notice somewhere.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.820
 He's all waiting for you to bring it up.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.580
 Every summer he's like, "Ah, I wonder if this is the summer.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.180
 "If this is the summer, they'll be like,

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.540
 "George, I really like this place."

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.660
 But the Scarecrow's move around and then he'd get up

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.340
 to say goodbye, take the keys.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.940
 And he's like, "They didn't bring up the Scarecrow thing."

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.100
 And then he turns and he looks and Scarecrow's

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.220
 are marching towards the house.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.660
 He's like, "Ah, maybe I'm just going insane."

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:29.420
 It is weird that no one else is seeing the Scarecrow's move.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.100
 Imagine you rented a house

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.100
 and you didn't know that Scarecrow's

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.660
 were walking around the yard.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:41.060
 Now imagine you rented a house.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.580
 You rented every summer and the guy who owns it

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:49.380
 knows there's a serious problem with black widows

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:50.980
 in the house.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.340
 And then on your last day of renting at the landlords,

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.620
 like, you notice anything weird and you're like,

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.420
 "Ah, not really."

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.060
 And the landlord goes,

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:02.900
 "You didn't notice the massive insect infestation?

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.420
 "You didn't hear the scuttling?"

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.820
 And you're like, "Nah, I do wonder where my infant baby went.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.460
 "I've been looking for him for two days."

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.780
 But other than that, like, do you have a right to know?

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.220
 And it's funny 'cause we have laws in some states

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.460
 that you have to know if the house is haunted

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.580
 when you're buying it.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.620
 This is past that.

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.580
 This is like you're running a farm

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.460
 and Scarecrow's are walking around

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.020
 or you're already living in the house

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.140
 and a loved one knows that there's something in the basement

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.300
 or something in the baby's room and you not telling them.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.260
 And again, this is super creepy

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.300
 because we don't know what we don't know.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.340
 In your house right now,

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.380
 if you're a fan of the paranormal,

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.500
 even if you don't believe,

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.820
 you're just like hearing these stories,

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.500
 someone else in that house may be experiencing

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.340
 something incredibly terrifying,

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.340
 but they don't wanna tell you

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.580
 because they know you'll get even more scared

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.060
 or you'll be like, "Dude, let's go buy a Ouija board.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.500
 "Let's talk to it."

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.540
 I wonder how often this happens

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:07.340
 and I would assume it's fairly common.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.180
 So we do hide stuff from each other

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.100
 for their safety or so we say, right?

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.860
 You don't want the family to be scared.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.660
 You don't want the husband or the kid to be scared,

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.460
 but at the end of the day, who's responsible?

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.420
 If those Scarecrow's marched into that house one night,

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.700
 you know, who would be responsible?

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.500
 I don't think homeowners insurance would cover

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.580
 a Scarecrow invasion.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.740
 I don't think, I'm pretty sure you're out of luck on that one

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.100
 or demonic possession

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.180
 or who knows what else could be going on in these locations.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.860
 So that's really the question I have for you today.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:45.980
 It's really a two-sided question.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.420
 Do you feel you would have the right

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.220
 to know if you were at risk of paranormal danger?

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:56.100
 And the flip side of that is, would you be willing,

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.620
 'cause you can see both sides, right?

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.380
 If you were with someone who would get hysterical,

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.260
 who would completely just be like,

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.340
 "Nope, I'm never going down there.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.460
 "You have to do everything down there in that basement.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.940
 "Would you be willing to tell..."

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.860
 It's just an interesting thought experiment.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.380
 Would you want to know the answer will always be yes,

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.580
 but would you be willing to tell somebody,

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.700
 something else that you know would terrify them

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.700
 to their core?

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.580
 Would you be willing to share that with someone,

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:27.820
 knowing full well what the consequences of that will be?

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.220
 But if you don't tell them,

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.640
 the consequences could even be worse.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.140
 There was a chance that George

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.940
 was going to come back to the farm one day

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.900
 and he goes, "Oh, look at the Scarecrow's

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:44.900
 "are exactly where they were when I left.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.340
 "Maybe they've stopped walking around."

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:51.220
 And then he walks into the house and he's like,

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.220
 "Hello, hello guys, I'm here.

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.460
 "How was summer?"

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.940
 "Summer."

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.540
 So boys, did I go through the house?

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.260
 He's like, "What?"

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.940
 And then he notices like a piece of straw on the ground

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:05.780
 and he's like, "Huh?"

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.260
 And he picks it up, puts it in his mouth.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.340
 He's like, "Oh yeah, I'm a farmer after all."

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.260
 Then he walks and he sees another piece of straw

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.140
 and he's like, "Oh, what?"

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.100
 He's walking around.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:14.940
 He's very dull.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.460
 He's very, he's a dullard.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.300
 Takes him forever.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.540
 Eventually he's walking around with this huge pile of straw.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:24.060
 He's like, "Maybe one more piece of straw

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.940
 "will unravel this puzzle.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.980
 "Maybe then the riddle will be solved."

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.380
 Eventually he's walking around.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.820
 He picks up all the straw and he goes,

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.940
 "The Scarecrow's must have made it into the house.

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.660
 "But I saw the Scarecrow's out in the field."

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.580
 (gasps)

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.580
 He drops all the straw and he runs out

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.260
 and he runs to the nearest Scarecrow.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:51.260
 And it's a dead boy all tied up.

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:55.460
 Like, "Wow, Jason.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.700
 "That's super intense."

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.160
 His eyes have been replaced with buttons.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.460
 He's tied to this.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:07.460
 And the Scarecrow's replaced the family with themselves.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.220
 So what?

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:16.700
 There's a car driving on the road with these people.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.620
 Their carcasses are full of straw.

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.460
 The Scarecrow's have taken over their bodies

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.260
 and they're like, "Ha ha ha, we finally escaped the farm."

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.660
 And then they basically just have to go to work

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:30.500
 and they have to pretend that Scarecrow's in school.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.060
 They're like, "Dude, you're so dumb.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.180
 "Don't you have any brains?"

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.700
 He's sitting there in class just like,

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.460
 "Ugh, there's probably one.

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.260
 "I'm sure we escaped the farm,

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.020
 "but now I'm in elementary school.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.340
 "My dad has a job in marketing."

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.620
 We didn't really think out the whole escape

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.460
 from the farm thing.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.580
 At least it was sunny out there

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:50.780
 and we just got to stand around.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.900
 Who would be at fault for that?

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.340
 Who would be at fault?

00:49:55.340 --> 00:50:01.220
