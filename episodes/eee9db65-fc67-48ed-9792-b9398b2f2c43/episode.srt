14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,400
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,440
 - A recent investigation into the Las Vegas mass shooting

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,160
 incident reveals that the government is actively lying

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,540
 to the American people.

18
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,400
 And then we meet a young woman who's gonna be spending

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,680
 a couple days with her sister and her sister's family.

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,240
 But when the only room available in the house

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,720
 is deep in the basement,

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,320
 she's beginning to have second thoughts.

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
 And then we travel to the great outdoors.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,240
 Beautiful farmland as far as the eye can see.

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,680
 When a vacationing family makes this journey

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,360
 once a year to grow vegetables

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,720
 and pretend that they're farmers,

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,240
 everything seems normal.

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,920
 But maybe that's because they're not playing close enough

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
 attention to the scarecrows in the field.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,780
 (upbeat music)

33
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,880
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,720
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,840
 I'm your host Jason Perpenter.

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,760
 I'm having a great day.

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,400
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,480
 in the world doing your thing.

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,720
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today.

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,120
 So first off, leaking into Dead Rabbit Command,

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,560
 crawling all over the floor.

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,840
 It's a big old puddle of one of our legacy patrons.

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,480
 Everyone give it up for Space Vomit.

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,120
 Woohoo, yeah, we're all standing on chairs.

46
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,320
 So it doesn't get on our shoes.

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,200
 Woohoo, Space Vomit is leaking into Dead Rabbit Command.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,680
 Space Vomit, you're gonna be our captain,

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,720
 our pilot this episode.

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,440

51
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,880
 if you guys can't support the show financially,

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,760
 a total understand they really do.

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
 Just helps rid the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,920
 That helps out so much.

55
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,080
 That's a way you can help the fluffle grow

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
 to your friends, to your family.

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,760

62
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,680
 in a big old fishbowl,

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,000
 and I'm gonna put you in the Jason Jet.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,160
 I'm trying to pour it all over the seat.

65
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,480
 Go ahead and fly us out of Dead Rabbit Command.

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,520
 We're headed to Vegas, baby.

67
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,180
 (air whooshing)

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:53,000
 We're headed out to Vegas, but not to Gamble.

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,580
 To take a look at, oddly enough, a very...

70
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,080
 We don't really talk about this mass shooting anymore.

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,360
 And you can go Jason, well, there's a lot of mass shootings,

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,800
 but it's not that.

73
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,920
 That's not the, well, that's part of the reason why,

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,360
 but we still talk about Columbine, right?

75
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,280
 Like as a society, a culture,

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,260
 we still talk about Columbine.

77
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,040
 We still talk about these other mass shooting events,

78
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,080
 but one that you don't hear much of anymore,

79
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,320
 and it's the most mysterious one of all

80
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,080
 is the Las Vegas Massacre.

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,520
 This happened back on October 1st, 2017,

82
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,160
 just a quick refresh for Jason.

83
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,040
 I don't wanna be reminded of this.

84
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,540
 Absolutely bizarre.

85
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,540
 It's really the biggest mass shooting event

86
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,280
 that we've seen as far as just full-on fatalities

87
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,120
 and injuries.

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,880
 It was Steven Paddock.

89
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,080
 Hold your questions till the end.

90
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,280
 I know there's conspiracy theories

91
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,320
 about whether or not he did that,

92
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,360
 but brief overview, Cliff Notes version.

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,640
 Steven Paddock, 64-year-old man, right?

94
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,520
 Super old for a mass shooter.

95
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,880
 They tend to be younger.

96
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,680
 Steven Paddock, 64 years old.

97
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,440
 He's in a hotel room in Vegas,

98
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,440
 and there is a music festival going on near his hotel.

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,840
 And he busted out a window and opened fire

100
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,600
 on a crowd of 22,000 festival goers.

101
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,000
 And he has the height,

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,520
 and he has all these weapons in his room,

103
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,480
 and he opens fire.

104
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,760
 He fires more than 1,000 rounds.

105
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,280
 He kills 60 people,

106
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,280
 and 867 people are injured in the chaos.

107
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,000
 Some of that's trampoline, right?

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,280
 Some of that's like, oh, my feet hurt

109
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,620
 'cause I'm running so hard.

110
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,360
 But over 400 of those injuries

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,320
 was from bullets or shrapnel.

112
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,360
 So, insane, right?

113
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,080
 Absolutely, the definition of insane.

114
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
 There's been a ton of conspiracy theories

115
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,960
 about this mass shooting in particular

116
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,020
 because the FBI, they investigated this,

117
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,160
 and they said, we don't know why he did it.

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,200
 We don't know why he did it.

119
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,760
 If you go to Wikipedia and you look at the shooting,

120
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,640
 like the very beginning of the summary,

121
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,520
 it says, quote, the motive for the mass shooting

122
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,380
 is officially undetermined, and that is true.

123
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,440
 The FBI goes, we don't know why he did it.

124
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,920
 And that's been a big question.

125
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,900
 Now, there was a ton of conspiracy theories about it

126
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,400
 that it was a ISIS weapon deal gone bad,

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
 and it was actually ISIS that opened fire on the crowd.

128
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,900
 ISIS did claim that this guy was a member of ISIS.

129
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,160
 They said, oh, we know that dude.

130
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,640
 And the government, the feds, we said,

131
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,080
 no, we don't believe that part.

132
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,800
 ISIS, you're very untrustworthy.

133
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,440
 We don't believe, ISIS did claim responsibility for this.

134
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,280
 That was a conspiracy theory.

135
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,900
 There's been a lot of conspiracy theories

136
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,820
 surrounding this, I think one of them,

137
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,540
 'cause we covered it a bit earlier

138
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,420
 in the run of the show,

139
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,380
 was that his target wasn't the music festival,

140
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,180
 or there was some shootout between a feds and someone else,

141
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,140
 and these people were actually caught in the crossfire,

142
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,860
 and the gunfire was actually aiming towards a fuel tank

143
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,700
 or something.

144
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,380
 I remember hearing all this stuff, I looked into it.

145
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,260
 But at the end of the day, the FBI who investigated it said,

146
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,660
 we don't know why he did it.

147
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,160
 That's a lie.

148
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,580
 And it's not a lie 'cause I'm a conspiracy theorist.

149
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,180
 It's not a lie 'cause I have a hunch.

150
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,640
 This is absolutely insane.

151
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,280
 I read true crime all the time.

152
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,280
 There was an article on crimeonline.com,

153
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,240
 and they were citing a newspaper that's based

154
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,360
 in Las Vegas called the Review Journal,

155
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,840
 reviewjournal.com, this is all in the show notes.

156
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,840
 It turns out that the FBI came into the possession

157
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,840
 of 10 letters written from a man named Jim Nixon.

158
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,360
 Jim Nixon is a disabled Vietnam veteran

159
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,480
 and a convicted felon.

160
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,880
 He did time for tax fraud,

161
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,880
 and he was a close personal friend of Stephen Paddock.

162
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,040
 They have in their possession 10 letters.

163
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,600
 The reason why we know this is because the Review Journal

164
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,640
 heard about the letters filed a Freedom of Information Act

165
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,680
 to get these letters from the feds, and we now know,

166
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,920
 I think some of them are pretty heavily redacted,

167
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,240
 but the FBI, they weren't redacted when the FBI got them.

168
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,840
 Jim Nixon, these letters were written

169
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,360
 over the course of four years.

170
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,320
 It was 10 letters from 2013 to 2017

171
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,960
 when the shootings took place.

172
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,720
 And the letters said things like,

173
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,720
 "Remember, the FBI says we have no idea why he did this,

174
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,320
 that he went through two great lengths

175
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,440
 to hide the fact that he was going to commit a mass shooting,

176
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,960
 why he committed the mass shooting,

177
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,400
 what his end goal was, everything."

178
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,640
 They had, they got these letters after the shooting,

179
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,200
 obviously, they weren't able to prevent it,

180
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,120
 but here's a quote from a letter that was written

181
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,880
 in May, 2017 from Jim Nixon to his buddy, Steven Paddock,

182
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,880
 "I can get someone for you who can help you.

183
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,120
 Please don't go out shooting or hurting people

184
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,080
 who did nothing to you.

185
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,200
 I'm concerned about the way you are talking

186
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,800
 and believe you are going to do something very bad.

187
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
 Steve, please, please don't do what I think

188
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,040
 you are going to do."

189
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,400
 So Jim Nixon knew that this guy was talking

190
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,800
 about doing crazy things.

191
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,520
 One of the letter refers to Steven,

192
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,680
 'cause you know, we just have the letters

193
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,840
 that Jim had written saying,

194
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,680
 "Oh yeah, you were telling me you wanted

195
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,640
 a list of music festivals in the United States.

196
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,560
 Sure, I can get you that list.

197
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,520
 I don't know why Steven couldn't Google it,

198
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,080
 but yeah, yeah, I'll hold you out with them."

199
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,000
 So they were contacting each other,

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
 talking back and forth,

201
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,240
 and one of the things was big music festivals.

202
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
 At that point, Jim's like,

203
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,520
 "You know, maybe he just really likes

204
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,400
 Grateful Dead or something like that."

205
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
 But in May, 2017, it says,

206
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,920
 "Listen, I think you're gonna go hurt people.

207
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,240
 Here's more of this letter.

208
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,560
 Quote, "You are a good person

209
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,400
 and I want you to know that I'm concerned

210
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,240
 about you and your well-being.

211
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,800
 I believe that you are lying to me

212
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,040
 and you are going to hurt someone or kill someone.

213
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,560
 You sounded like a real madman on the phone tonight."

214
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,440
 The FBI had possession of these letters.

215
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,360
 I'm just quoting one of them, right?

216
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,120
 The FBI has possession of these letters.

217
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,120
 The rest of them are kind of around the same thing.

218
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,280
 One of the letters says, quote,

219
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,320
 "Look, buddy, I can get you some help.

220
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,640
 You need to talk to someone who knows

221
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,480
 how to deal with dreams.

222
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,520
 Don't listen to what the damn dreams tell you.

223
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,680
 I will help you all I can."

224
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:53,200
 Okay, the FBI has possession of these letters.

225
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,440
 They had possessions of these letters early on

226
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,320
 in the investigation because they were found.

227
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,920
 Some people had bought a building in Mesquite, Texas.

228
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,520
 That's where Stephen Paddock used to live.

229
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,680
 And these 10 letters were found at this abandoned building

230
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,720
 that they were cleaning up.

231
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,920
 Presumably, they're cleaning up after the shooting.

232
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,200
 They find them addressed to Stephen Paddock

233
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,120
 or they had them.

234
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,840
 They found them before and just kind of set them aside.

235
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,480
 I'm not for sure, but these 10 letters

236
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
 were sent to the FBI.

237
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,600
 Jim Nixon saying things like,

238
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
 "Don't listen to the dreams."

239
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,000
 Quote, "Please don't go on any shooting rampage

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,920
 like a fool."

241
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,080
 Unquote.

242
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,960
 They had possession of the 10 letters.

243
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,940
 Jim Nixon was interviewed by the review journal.

244
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,040
 He said, "The FBI never contacted me."

245
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,680
 This guy goes and opens fire on 22,000 people.

246
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,280
 They know the name of someone who before the shooting

247
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,040
 knew him, had an idea what was going to happen,

248
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,240
 was trying to convince him not to.

249
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
 He does it.

250
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,720
 Stephen Paddock is killed in the shooting.

251
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,040
 The FBI has these letters.

252
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,760
 They never interviewed Jim Nixon to go,

253
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,840
 "What are the dreams?

254
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,680
 Do you know any motive of why he would have done this?"

255
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,800
 They never talked to Jim Nixon.

256
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,880
 And here's the thing.

257
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,160
 So the reason why the letter stopped in May

258
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,440
 is because Jim was sent back to prison.

259
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,580
 He violated his parole, he did something, right?

260
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,500
 So he stopped writing in May of 2017

261
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,040
 because he was in jail now.

262
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,980
 The only reason why the FBI wouldn't go out

263
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,860
 to interview Jim Nixon is if they already knew the motive.

264
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,580
 Why would they wanna go to this interview?

265
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,160
 They already know I did it, but they're not telling us.

266
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,120
 It's infuriating, really.

267
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,520
 It's so infuriating because, listen,

268
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,920
 I get that an open investigation's not giving out

269
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,820
 the information, but in this case, it's closed.

270
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,420
 They just said it's undetermined.

271
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,060
 They know why, so why go through the extra step?

272
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,100
 And what makes it even weirder?

273
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,300
 Like, you know the government lies to you.

274
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,860
 You know the feds are gonna lie to you.

275
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,260
 Why they're covering this?

276
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,100
 This is a cover-up.

277
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,620
 They know exactly why he shot those people.

278
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,780
 They're not telling us.

279
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,620
 Why?

280
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,980
 Why aren't they telling us?

281
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,340
 This guy knows.

282
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,420
 And to make it even, you know the feds are gonna lie to you.

283
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,380
 You would hope they don't lie to you about everything.

284
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,560
 We know the feds are gonna lie to us, right?

285
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,160
 What I find super intriguing about this,

286
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,460
 and we'll wrap it up with this,

287
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,220
 feds say they don't know what caused it.

288
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,840
 Jim Nixon wrote these letters.

289
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,560
 He must have some inkling, even if it's something like,

290
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,360
 "Yeah, he always just wanted to shoot up a bunch of people."

291
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,600
 Like, his motive was he wanted to kill a bunch of people.

292
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,260
 Like, he always talked about,

293
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,360
 'cause they said maybe he had bad gambling debts,

294
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,660
 he had to pay off, maybe, da da da da da da da da.

295
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,700
 They've been throwing darts at a board as well.

296
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,060
 But even if the motive was I wanted to feel like,

297
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,380
 I wanted to feel what it was like to kill a bunch of people,

298
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,880
 the FBI's not even saying that.

299
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,700
 They're not just saying he was a man-man.

300
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,200
 They're saying we don't know why he did it.

301
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,780
 That's a lie.

302
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,640
 And the man who definitely would at least give them some clues

303
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,680
 as to why he did it, the FBI never interviewed.

304
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,840
 The FBI never interviewed.

305
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,700
 Well, the Review Journal did this newspaper.

306
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,480
 They interviewed Jim Nixon and he goes,

307
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,340
 "Yeah, I wrote those letters and the FBI never talked to me."

308
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,240
 The Review Journal didn't say what Jim's theory was

309
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,680
 on why he did the mass shooting either.

310
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,440
 You know what I mean?

311
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,620
 If I am a journalist, I would say,

312
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,780
 "Well, why do you think he did it?

313
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,160
 Why do you think he did it?

314
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,920
 Do you have his correspondence with him for years?

315
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,280
 Why do you think he did it?"

316
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,240
 And what Jim, what his friend, his confidant must have said

317
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:03,520
 to the reporter was so dangerous, the newspaper wouldn't even

318
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,080
 publish it.

319
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,320
 Or like many major newspapers in America,

320
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,680
 the reporter asked the question, got the answer,

321
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,060
 took it back to the newspaper, and the editor makes a call.

322
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,820
 And that editor makes a call before the government calls the

323
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,500
 editor and says, "Don't run the story."

324
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,020
 The editor of some things, say,

325
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,980
 "If something's too controversial,

326
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,900
 the editor will call up their contact in the federal government

327
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,860
 and say, 'Hey, should we run this?'"

328
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,180
 Why did he do it?

329
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,100
 We know.

330
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,820
 As a government, we know.

331
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,400
 But as a citizen, as a society, we don't know.

332
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,840
 The motive is officially undetermined.

333
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,480
 That's a lie.

334
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,480
 And there's a guy out there who could at least shed light on it.

335
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,880
 And even if it was, his motive was he

336
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,080
 wanted to shoot a bunch of people.

337
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,640
 That's a motive.

338
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,760
 And just to add a little bit of conspiracy sugar

339
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,240
 to this cake that we are forced to eat, this disgusting cake,

340
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,940
 Stephen Paddock-- let's look at his career trajectory.

341
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,500
 He worked for the post office.

342
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,180
 I know there are jokes about going postal.

343
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,780
 He worked for the post office.

344
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,660
 Then he moved on to the IRS.

345
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,020
 Then he worked for the Department of Defense.

346
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,240
 And then he worked for a company that ended up

347
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,260
 merging with Lockheed Martin, which

348
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,940
 is a huge defense contractor.

349
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,960
 And then in the end, the last chunk of his life,

350
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,000
 he worked in real estate.

351
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,440
 If you want to look at someone, we talk about--

352
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,920
 I mentioned Project Monarch.

353
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,200
 I mentioned government mind control.

354
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,200
 This person was 10 toes deep in the government machine,

355
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,920
 almost his entire life.

356
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,440
 And his motive is officially undetermined.

357
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,080
 Space vomit.

358
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,700
 That's kind of a weird segue, but space vomit.

359
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,020
 Let's go ahead and toss you into the--

360
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,700
 we need a submarine.

361
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,100
 But I can't come up with it off the top of my head.

362
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
 Space vomit, let's go ahead and toss you

363
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,820
 into the dead rabbit dirgeable we're

364
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,300
 going to leave behind Las Vegas.

365
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,300
 Fly us all the way out, too.

366
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,700
 A house in the suburbs.

367
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,180
 [BURPING]

368
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,140
 This episode is going to have a theme.

369
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,540
 The theme isn't "Math Shooters."

370
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,620
 That's not the theme.

371
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,780
 But let's see if you can pick up on what this theme is.

372
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,100
 We're in this neighborhood.

373
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,300
 We're in this typical suburban neighborhood.

374
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,700
 We see a young woman walking into a house.

375
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,820
 Now, we don't have a specific location

376
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,060
 or any of the real names.

377
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,100
 We're going to go ahead and call this woman Shirley.

378
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,540
 And her mom is in the hospital right now.

379
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,140
 It's really, really tough times.

380
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,820
 No one wants anyone in the hospital, especially

381
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,420
 mamas, right?

382
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,580
 And Shirley is staying with her sister's family.

383
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,580
 They're going to be living together in this house

384
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,700
 while the mom's in the hospital.

385
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,300
 It's probably just more convenient.

386
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,940
 Maybe they live right across street.

387
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,020
 That'd be convenient, right?

388
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,020
 It'd be hard to get to good night's sleep

389
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,700
 when the ambulance is flying in and out.

390
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,700
 But when it sucks to live there unless your mom's

391
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,820
 in the hospital, then it's the best house in town.

392
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,260
 So she walks into the house and her sister's like,

393
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,340
 Shirley, thank you so much.

394
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,100
 For being here, we'll all help mama out.

395
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,220
 However, we only have one spare room available

396
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
 and it's in the basement.

397
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,460
 Do you have a night light to make it a little less spooky?

398
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,300
 And Shirley is like, OK, I can do this.

399
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,220
 I can live in this basement for just a while

400
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,220
 until mom gets better.

401
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,300
 Well, she makes it till night three.

402
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,020
 You've always been so long underground.

403
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,900
 That's really what it is.

404
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,260
 She makes it three nights.

405
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,500
 She's laying there in bed.

406
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,100
 And there's a closet.

407
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,580
 So where?

408
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,340
 Why would you have a closet in the basement?

409
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,180
 I guess not every basement looks like Freddy Kruger's house.

410
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,620
 But there's a closet in the basement.

411
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,540
 And Shirley's there in bed and she's trying to sleep.

412
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,300
 And then all of a sudden she hears--

413
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:36,260
 [GROANING]

414
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,700
 And what that sound is--

415
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,380
 I just have no idea what that sound is.

416
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,420
 Is that heavy breathing?

417
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,500
 Is that a goat in labor?

418
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:49,580
 What she hears is the sound of something heavy being dragged

419
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,620
 across the floor.

420
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,120
 Now listen.

421
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,540
 [GROANING]

422
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,040
 You see?

423
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,900
 You can hear it now.

424
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,140
 You can see it in your ears.

425
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,700
 She hears this heavy--

426
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,420
 it's the sound of something heavy being

427
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,900
 dragged across the floor.

428
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,980
 It's coming from the closet.

429
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,660
 And in an odd detail and something

430
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,140
 that only the world of the paranormal can do,

431
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,220
 she said, not only was it the sound of something huge

432
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,540
 and heavy being dragged across the ground,

433
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,860
 she goes, the closet's the size of a normal closet.

434
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,780
 But the sound-- it sounded like it was being

435
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,220
 dragged through a huge room.

436
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,500
 Not that there was an echo.

437
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,000
 Echo.

438
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,980
 But that you would hear it--

439
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,700
 like again, it's hard to describe.

440
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,380
 It's the way the world of the paranormal can work sometimes.

441
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,020
 It sounds like it was being dragged across a bigger

442
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,260
 distance, but the sound was just emanating

443
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,380
 from the closet itself.

444
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,700
 So that's really creeping her out.

445
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,780
 You can go, well, that could just be a couple squirrels

446
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,660
 dragging themselves around.

447
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,780
 But it doesn't make sense-- spatially,

448
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,820
 it didn't make sense.

449
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,220
 Why is she hearing the noise like it's

450
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,820
 being dragged over this great distance,

451
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,660
 but the entire time the sound's coming from the closet?

452
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,940
 She does, though, go-- that is weird.

453
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,020
 And it's fairly petrifying, however,

454
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,620
 must just be my imagination.

455
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,020
 I am going through a lot of stuff right now.

456
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,460
 My mom's in the hospital.

457
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,620
 I'm in a basement.

458
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,700
 Those are two pretty bad things, right?

459
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,820
 You don't need a third.

460
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,900
 I think it's just my imagination.

461
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,380
 And she goes, this noise?

462
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,620
 That night would start and stop.

463
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,700
 Wasn't it continuous?

464
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,460
 She's like, oh, white noise.

465
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,300
 I wish they had this on a white noise machine.

466
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,820
 [GRUNTS]

467
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
 She said it would start and stop.

468
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,740
 But she would also start to hear--

469
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,380
 there's a little basement window.

470
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,660
 She would start to hear the sound of metal scraping

471
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,780
 against the-- she's like, come on, man.

472
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,460
 I just want to go to sleep.

473
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,380
 I'm here at all the spooky stuff.

474
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,580
 But she hears the sound of metal scraping across the basement

475
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,060
 window.

476
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,820
 Eventually, she's able to fall asleep.

477
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,100
 The soothing sounds of goats and labor,

478
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,340
 metal scraping on glass.

479
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,300
 She's eventually able to fall asleep.

480
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,660
 But it's not a restful sleep.

481
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,580
 She eventually wakes up a couple hours later.

482
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,660
 And the room is dark.

483
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,620
 The night light that gave her just a little bit of comfort

484
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,380
 is off.

485
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,700
 She wakes up.

486
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,060
 She's in a completely black room.

487
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,740
 It's basically pitch black at this point.

488
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,140
 There's no light at all.

489
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,260
 And she's scared.

490
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,180
 Even adults need night lights from time to time.

491
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
 She's scared.

492
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,460
 She can't figure out what's going on.

493
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,500
 She looks and she sees by the window.

494
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,460
 But in the basement--

495
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,740
 in the basement standing by the window,

496
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,140
 she sees a tall man.

497
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,500
 She said he was so tall his head was nearly

498
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,540
 touching the ceiling.

499
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,300
 Technically, the floor, really, of the house.

500
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,180
 She's really chasing away.

501
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,100
 Now I'm confused with the stand on his head.

502
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,140
 The ceiling of a basement is the floor of a house.

503
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,860
 But anyways, he's so tall his head is almost touching the floor.

504
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,740
 But not only was this man tall, he was wearing clothes.

505
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,700
 He was wearing clothes.

506
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,140
 He had torn up clothes, rags, basically,

507
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,380
 like a big old hobo, a giant tall hobo,

508
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,740
 standing in the basement with long, dark hair

509
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,820
 and a long, dark, scraggly beard.

510
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,700
 He just stood there in the darkness with his arms crossed,

511
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,100
 completely motionless.

512
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:04,580
 But then he begins to turn his head and locks

513
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,900
 eyes with Shirley.

514
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,780
 They stare at each other for just a moment.

515
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,740
 Shirley's petrified.

516
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,700
 She can't even move.

517
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,260
 She has no idea what this specter's intent is going to be.

518
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:26,140
 But just when she's thinking the worst, he vanishes.

519
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,180
 And so does the darkness.

520
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:40,940
 Slowly, the basement is illuminated once again, not fully.

521
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:49,260
 But that soft glow of the night light is visible once more.

522
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,380
 It hadn't burned out.

523
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,980
 It hadn't been unplugged.

524
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,420
 This presence, when it entered the basement, sucked all the light

525
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,820
 out of it.

526
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:10,940
 So only it and Shirley existed in this dark realm.

527
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,140
 That wasn't her imagination, right?

528
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,700
 Shirley was like, OK, I saw that.

529
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,420
 It was not my imagination.

530
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,900
 There's something completely wrong with this basement.

531
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,380
 I do want to stay around because mom's in the hospital,

532
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,900
 but I can't do this.

533
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,060
 The next morning, she tells her sister.

534
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:31,780
 She goes, hey, listen, I'm just not going to sugarcoat it.

535
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,860
 Your basement's haunted.

536
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,180
 This is what happened last night.

537
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,020
 The dragging and the metal scraping.

538
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,460
 And sure, that could have been anything.

539
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,500
 But then a giant guy showed up wearing these scraggly clothes.

540
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,980
 And he looked at me.

541
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,340
 Your basement's haunted.

542
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,100
 And her sister had a very interesting reaction.

543
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:58,100
 She said, don't, please don't tell my husband or my kid

544
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,700
 about what you saw.

545
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,380
 Shirley's like, why not?

546
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,540
 I can understand the kid.

547
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,340
 But why don't you want me to tell your husband?

548
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,460
 And the sister goes, if you tell them

549
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,820
 that the basement is haunted, they will never go down there

550
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,320
 again.

551
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,700
 I need you to promise me you will not tell them what you saw

552
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,300
 because they will both be so scared it will actually disrupt

553
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,820
 the household.

554
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,300
 I'm sure that's where the laundry machines were.

555
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,580
 I mean, some people don't ever go into basements.

556
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,180
 I've lived in a few houses with basements.

557
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,780
 Very rarely went down there.

558
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,660
 Other people, like the basement, is an extension of the house.

559
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,500
 They have things down there they need.

560
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,380
 Do not tell.

561
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,180
 You've got to promise me you won't tell my husband or my kid

562
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,380
 any part of that story.

563
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,300
 Say you had a great night's sleep.

564
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,620
 Maybe you'll figure out something.

565
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,620
 You can sleep on the couch.

566
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,220
 But don't tell them.

567
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:53,860
 And she didn't.

568
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,740
 Shirley did not tell the husband or the daughter what

569
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,700
 she had seen.

570
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,060
 But she knew.

571
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,740
 And she knew-- her sister knew that there was something else

572
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,660
 in that house, something in the basement.

573
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,580
 But they would never tell the other members of that family.

574
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,220
 Shirley did want to add.

575
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,740
 She posted this online.

576
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,260
 Took place in December 2022.

577
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,940
 She posted it online under the name Life Is Great 2.

578
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,020
 She did add at the end.

579
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,780
 And she goes, my mom's fine.

580
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,820
 My mom's totally fine.

581
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,100
 So if you're a fan of moms, which most people don't worry

582
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,340
 about it, the mom pulled through.

583
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,300
 Very, very interesting ghost story.

584
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,780
 I don't think it would be a shadow man.

585
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,300
 Shadow men very rarely appear with clothing.

586
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,380
 And usually it's just like a hat or a coat.

587
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,620
 This guy was wearing red hacks unless the shadow man's

588
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,260
 fallen on tough times.

589
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,580
 This was a mother sort of entity.

590
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,500
 And this is one of those stories that Shirley posted this.

591
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,260
 And I looked through the rest of the posting history stuff

592
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,060
 about something called warrior cats.

593
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,700
 I don't know if that's a cartoon or a comic book

594
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,420
 or something like that.

595
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,820
 Just about a bunch of cats kicking each other in the balls

596
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,300
 or something.

597
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,500
 I don't know.

598
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,100
 But that's always interesting when people live

599
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,460
 a totally normal life.

600
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,380
 Well, I guess I don't know what warrior cats is.

601
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,900
 There might be some creepy fetish thing.

602
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,540
 You're like, Jason, that's the craziest thing

603
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,820
 you've ever brought up on this show.

604
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,060
 I don't know what it is.

605
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,820
 But it's interesting when people live relatively normal lives

606
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,900
 and then this paranormal story just happens.

607
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,860
 It is an interesting little tidbit.

608
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,420
 But she does.

609
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,220
 She hasn't never told the husband or the daughter.

610
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,180
 They still don't know what's in the basement.

611
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,020
 Space vomit.

612
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,780
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbon

613
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,340
 car copter.

614
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,380
 We're up, up, and away out of this neighborhood.

615
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,500
 Take us all the way out to the great outdoors.

616
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,900
 [HUMMING]

617
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,740
 Another story.

618
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,700
 We don't have a location of the real names for it.

619
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,580
 We're going to go ahead and meet a young boy.

620
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,020
 We're going to call him Cole.

621
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,180
 Cole, him and his family did the same thing every summer.

622
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,500
 They're like, kids, there's a lot of fun stuff we could do.

623
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,900
 Disneyland, Knotsbury Farm.

624
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,300
 But what's better than Knotsbury Farm?

625
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,060
 And the kids are like, Disneyland.

626
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,300
 And they're like, no, no, no, forget I said Disneyland.

627
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,140
 That doesn't work.

628
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,100
 What's better than Knotsbury Farm, kids?

629
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,140
 And they're like, I have pretty much anything because Snoopy

630
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,740
 sucks.

631
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,580
 And that's like, what I was getting at

632
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,860
 was the only thing better than Knotsbury Farm is a real farm.

633
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,180
 What's better than riding on roller coasters

634
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,460
 or having fun in general or spinning your summer vacation

635
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,940
 working on a farm?

636
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,620
 So the family would load up every summer

637
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,500
 and they would go out.

638
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,220
 They rented this farm land from a guy named George.

639
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,300
 It was basically Airbnb.

640
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,140
 But with wheat and stuff like that.

641
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,180
 So anyways, there's this guy named George

642
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,500
 and he rents out his farm.

643
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,460
 It actually sounds like a pretty good deal, right?

644
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,020
 Because you'd be like, I'm too old to farm.

645
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,100
 He's 47.

646
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,900
 He's just too real.

647
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,620
 He's like, oh, the soil's been bad to me.

648
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,860
 Maybe I'll rent out my farm and let

649
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,780
 other people plant tomatoes and squash.

650
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,700
 And then the day before the harvest, they show up.

651
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,860
 I'm the human rabbit.

652
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,940
 Nom, nom, nom, nom.

653
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,220
 And they're like, what happened to it?

654
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,700
 Flock a locus come through.

655
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,900
 Every single vegetable is gone as he's

656
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,180
 driving away on a tractor.

657
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,860
 George rents out his farm land.

658
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,860
 So people, tunis out of towners,

659
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,740
 can come out and plant stuff in his fields

660
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,300
 and then harvest them.

661
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,660
 Doesn't sound like--

662
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,340
 it sounds like the opposite of fun.

663
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,500
 It is the opposite of fun.

664
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,140
 It's work.

665
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,900
 It's literally backbreaking labor during summer vacation.

666
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,340
 But anyways, also, can you grow fruit that quickly?

667
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,900
 Not fruit.

668
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,620
 Those are trees.

669
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:04,220
 Can you grow vegetables in summer vacation?

670
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,300
 Like, is that a thing?

671
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,780
 I always thought like you had to plant in spring

672
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,940
 and then harvest in summer.

673
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,340
 I don't know.

674
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,580
 I don't know anything about vegetables.

675
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,580
 I think they're disgusting.

676
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,420
 So I don't particularly care.

677
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,060
 But maybe something lame like broccoli pops up pretty quickly

678
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,340
 or carrots.

679
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,660
 The lame stuff.

680
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,780
 Not like potatoes.

681
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,020
 So anyways, this family goes out every year.

682
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,940
 And that's how they spend their vacation.

683
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,180
 They grow veggies and enjoy the rural life

684
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,100
 before they head back to the big city.

685
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,180
 The stomach full of broccoli and a brain full of memories

686
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,620
 of the great outdoors.

687
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,060
 But anyone who's ever lived on a farm

688
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,980
 knows that pests are the number one problem.

689
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,580
 I don't actually know if that's true.

690
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,420
 You're like, no, Jason, there's far bigger problems than that.

691
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,620
 Well, anyways, this farm had a particular problem

692
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,980
 with rabbits and deer coming in and eating the carrots.

693
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,220
 Om nom nom nom.

694
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,460
 And they'd have stalks of broccoli

695
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,420
 and the deer are eating them up.

696
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,660
 And the rabbits are grabbing handfuls of corn

697
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,820
 and chewing them up.

698
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,500
 So the family goes, you know what we need to do?

699
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,060
 Let's put up some scarecrow.

700
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,820
 Let's put up some scarecrow to scare these rabbits away.

701
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,180
 I always thought you just built a rabbit-proof fence,

702
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,860
 like a fence that was super deep.

703
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,500
 It's all touching the magma that you're

704
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,140
 like trying to dig in through molten lava.

705
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,420
 You jerk.

706
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,460
 You have a-- but anyway, so these guys have scarecrow

707
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,340
 up in the field.

708
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,740
 This family puts these scarecrow up.

709
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,180
 I'm sure it would work against deer.

710
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,700
 Maybe if he gave the scarecrow like a gun, like aiming.

711
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,220
 Aiming.

712
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,300
 It's like drone operated.

713
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,260
 The dad's sitting in the house, do-do-controlling it.

714
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,020
 Just to scare him away.

715
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,060
 He's actually not shooting the deer yet.

716
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,860
 But anyways, they put up these scarecrow.

717
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,900
 They harvest whatever you can harvest in the summer.

718
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,540
 And then they go back to the big city,

719
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:03,660
 to the daily grind of unending Starbucks and school and work.

720
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,140
 But next summer's coming up.

721
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,980
 Guess where we're going, guys?

722
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,660
 The farm.

723
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,740
 Yeah, the farm.

724
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,180
 Not Knott's Berry Farm.

725
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,260
 Real farm.

726
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,740
 So they go out to the farm the next year.

727
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,780
 And George lives there when they're not there.

728
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,860
 Also, he's not just like, well, time to be homeless.

729
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,420
 He's all makes his little bendle and walks away.

730
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,380
 Time to go hunt a basement.

731
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,700
 George is there when they're not.

732
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,820
 They show up and they're like, hey, George,

733
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,860
 we're here to rent the farm again.

734
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,260
 George's like, sounds great.

735
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,460
 But Cole and his family would realize,

736
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,700
 they put the scarecrow's up the first year

737
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,500
 to keep away the deer and the rabbits and stuff.

738
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
 When they came back to the farm the second year,

739
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,580
 the scarecrow's were in a different location.

740
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,020
 So they do it another summer.

741
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,260
 They're there farming, working the plow,

742
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,380
 putting hay seeds in their mouth, all the stuff,

743
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,900
 all the stuff you imagine on a farm,

744
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,700
 making their own manure.

745
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,300
 They're like, oh, this is the best part

746
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,620
 of being on the outdoors.

747
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,900
 Pooping on veggies, he's all eating a vegetable

748
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,180
 as he's pooping on it.

749
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,260
 He's like, I should probably plant this first.

750
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,460
 I should probably not do any of this, honestly.

751
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,580
 I should probably go do a proper vacation.

752
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,780
 But he's sitting there, the dad's sitting there

753
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,460
 reading a newspaper, making manure in the field.

754
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,060
 That's year two.

755
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,580
 Year three comes around.

756
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,660
 Cole's like, oh, man, let's do a farm thing.

757
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,860
 I have a girlfriend now.

758
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,180
 Look at it, she's adorable.

759
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,500
 I have a girlfriend.

760
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,660
 We're gonna be hanging out this summer.

761
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,580
 We're gonna be watching movies and things like that.

762
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,740
 Dad's like, the only movie you need, son,

763
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,460
 is looking out of a farmhouse window at crops growing

764
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,980
 and me making manure.

765
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,380
 Cole's like, no, we can buy manure.

766
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,740
 Can we go to Home Depot before we get there now?

767
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,340
 Year three, pretty much the same thing.

768
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,620
 Is they're driving up to the farm

769
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,980
 and they notice that the scarecrow's

770
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,900
 are in a different location, but whatever.

771
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,100
 Go to George, say, hey, we wanna rent the farm out.

772
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,020
 He's like, oh, yes, I knew you city slickers

773
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,860
 would be back.

774
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,420
 No one escapes the farm life.

775
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,800
 It's just too much fun.

776
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,860
 And they do this for four years in total.

777
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,060
 And it plays out pretty much the same time.

778
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,820
 But after year four, Cole's family,

779
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,460
 like they worked that season.

780
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,820
 They're standing on the porch,

781
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,460
 they're wiping their brows, fresh farm sweat

782
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,620
 dripping off their skin.

783
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,100
 Delicious, delicious lemonade sitting on the table.

784
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,660
 It's half sweat at this point.

785
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,820
 They're sweating into it.

786
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,060
 Dad's drinking a big drink.

787
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,620
 Quite salty lemonade you made here, honey.

788
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,700
 Yum, yum, yum.

789
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,980
 I kinda like it.

790
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,920
 Tastes like me.

791
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,980
 Well, everyone, let's look at this farm one last time

792
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,380
 because next year we're gonna take a real vacation.

793
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,340
 We've worked our fingers to the bone,

794
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,780
 tilling this land.

795
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,860
 Probably should have used,

796
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,860
 probably should have used that plow more.

797
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,340
 But I wanted to be part of the soil.

798
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,540
 Oh, myself, I'm a soyleaf.

799
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,940
 That's my fetish now.

800
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,700
 Look at it, family.

801
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,540
 Look at it and wonder, this is the farm

802
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,520
 we've spent the last four summers at,

803
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,060
 but this will be the end.

804
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,820
 So when George comes back this time,

805
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,780
 the dad goes, "Hey, we had a lot of fun.

806
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,420
 "Made a lot of memories.

807
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,740
 "Made even more manure."

808
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,060
 But George's like, "What, what?

809
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,420
 "You guys have been making your own manure?

810
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,460
 "The dad goes, "We're not gonna rent it next year.

811
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,940
 "Just letting you know next year

812
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,200
 "we're not gonna rent the farm.

813
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,940
 "We're gonna go on real vacations.

814
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,980
 "We're gonna go and do things that normal humans do."

815
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,180
 And that is when George says,

816
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,020
 okay, yeah, you're not coming back next year.

817
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,180
 And Dad's like, "Nope, we're not gonna be back next year."

818
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,020
 And George goes, "Well, you know,

819
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,340
 "I just gonna sound crazy, but you know,

820
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,860
 "I'm never gonna see you again.

821
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,300
 "You're never gonna pay me money again.

822
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,260
 "So I'm gonna tell you something."

823
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,980
 Those scarecrows you guys put up in the fields.

824
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,460
 Dad's like, "Yeah, yeah, we've got this a couple years ago."

825
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,460
 And George goes, "Yeah, every night that I lived

826
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,940
 "on this farm, every night,

827
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,820
 "when I looked out into the field,

828
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:32,100
 "I'd watch the scarecrows move."

829
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,980
 Dad's like, "What are you talking about?"

830
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,940
 George is like, "At night when I look out my window here,

831
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,380
 "you can see them moving,

832
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,660
 "you can see them walking through the fields.

833
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,580
 "Now Cole said, I still think about that.

834
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,180
 "I still think about what George said.

835
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,300
 "And he might have been pulling a prank.

836
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,140
 "It might have been a joke that we didn't get."

837
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,820
 Like he goes rationally speaking,

838
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,580
 "George probably moved the scarecrows.

839
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,340
 "And then when we weren't coming back told us

840
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,300
 "that the reason why we showed,

841
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,260
 "that each time we showed up there in a different location

842
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,900
 "wasn't 'cause he was moving them,

843
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,580
 "but because they were moving themselves,

844
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,100
 "they were walking around in the field."

845
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,260
 He goes, "It must have been a joke

846
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,420
 "because obviously stuff like that isn't real."

847
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,620
 Right?

848
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:35,900
 But it's interesting, like you're right,

849
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,060
 this 100% could have been a joke that he was pulling.

850
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,540
 It's a fairly elaborate joke,

851
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,020
 not like it takes a lot of effort.

852
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,940
 I imagine, let's say there's more than one,

853
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,220
 so let's say there's four scarecrows, right?

854
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,860
 It's not super hard to pick up a scarecrow,

855
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,660
 they're not, they're made of straw,

856
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,100
 after all they are fairly light

857
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,940
 in the grand scale of things.

858
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,780
 But remember, he would have had to do this four years in a row

859
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,300
 and never mention it.

860
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,620
 And not only never mention it,

861
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,380
 but assume that they would notice

862
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,820
 that the scarecrows were in different locations.

863
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,420
 They would be gone for an entire year.

864
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,460
 And then they come back and they go,

865
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,740
 "Oh, those scarecrows are in a different location."

866
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,300
 He never mentioned it until they stopped coming,

867
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,780
 until they said, "We're not coming back."

868
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,460
 And then he goes, "Well, this is gonna be kind of weird,

869
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,140
 "but I'm gonna tell you now the scarecrows move at night."

870
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,620
 And the family, Cole's family never saw them move.

871
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:35,380
 They saw their new locations

872
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,980
 and assumed he had moved them for some purpose or another.

873
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,940
 And now Cole goes, "Maybe it was this elaborate prank."

874
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,540
 But George, as far as we go off a George word,

875
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,620
 the scarecrows were walking through the fields at night.

876
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:57,700
 And the reason why I combined these three stories

877
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,700
 is they all have the similar theme of deception, of lying.

878
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,940
 Now the first one, it's government,

879
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,860
 it's either government incompetence,

880
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,620
 government conspiracy coverup.

881
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,420
 And we're used to that every single day.

882
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,060
 We're used to that,

883
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,620
 that's just part of being a citizen

884
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,140
 of any nation in the world.

885
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,740
 The government is either incompetent or corrupt.

886
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,100
 I think most people go in with the best intentions

887
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,940
 and then they just become part of the machine.

888
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,940
 And we're so used to that, that when we encounter it,

889
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,220
 if someone goes, "I can't believe that."

890
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,780
 The government lied to it.

891
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,740
 Anyone over the age of four,

892
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,940
 anyone over the age of being able to read a newspaper,

893
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,420
 goes, "Yeah, of course they lied to you.

894
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,860
 "They'll always lie to you."

895
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,060
 And that's tragic and it's tragic that we accept it.

896
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,100
 We shouldn't accept it yet, we do.

897
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:59,860
 But these last two stories are deception on a different level.

898
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,340
 Not just 'cause it's paranormal,

899
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,020
 but the question that I find interesting

900
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,860
 about these two stories is,

901
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,360
 do you have a right to know

902
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,060
 if you're in paranormal peril?

903
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,460
 Like was there,

904
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,660
 and I don't wanna go off too long about this,

905
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,220
 but is there a, at the very least,

906
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,260
 a moral case to be made

907
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,940
 that if there's a demon in your basement

908
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,860
 who can break the laws of physics

909
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:37,860
 by dragging a giant whatever it was, a cage,

910
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,180
 who knows what it was?

911
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,580
 And he's just this tall dude hanging out in your bed.

912
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,980
 Don't you think that if you were the kid or the husband,

913
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,100
 you would have a right to know?

914
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,300
 Because if you don't know, you're right.

915
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,580
 Maybe the dad is me,

916
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,500
 maybe the dad's a big old scaredy cat.

917
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,580
 And my sister-in-law says,

918
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,580
 "Hey Jason, my sister told me not to tell you,

919
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,460
 "but there's a giant tall man in the basement

920
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,540
 "who can suck all light out of a room."

921
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,660
 I'd be like, "I would."

922
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,780
 Listen, I probably would go back down there,

923
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,140
 but I would also use it as an excuse

924
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,380
 to never go down there.

925
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,660
 "Hey honey, can you take out the garbage?"

926
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,020
 No, because the tall guy,

927
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,540
 "They're like the garbage is in the basement."

928
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,380
 I was like, "Yeah, but maybe he'll see me walking around

929
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,300
 "and come out of the basement.

930
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,700
 "Can you take out the garbage?"

931
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,860
 But if I didn't know there was a giant tall man down there,

932
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,820
 dragon stuff, and then I get possessed

933
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:40,500
 and come out of the basement holding a sledgehammer,

934
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,980
 and I start pounding people's brains into paste,

935
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,140
 who's fault is that?

936
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
 Who's fault is that?

937
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,900
 Had you told me that there was a monster down there,

938
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,340
 I probably would have not probably wouldn't have waited

939
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,260
 until 3 AM, I was like, "Oh man,

940
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,620
 "I gotta start that project tomorrow.

941
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,100
 "I better go down to the basement

942
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,300
 "at the smokiest time of day."

943
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,340
 You know, maybe I could have planned my day better.

944
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,020
 I could have planned around not getting possessed

945
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,260
 'cause I'm not down there.

946
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,900
 Who's fault would that be?

947
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,700
 I didn't know there was a monster down there.

948
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,820
 The sister did.

949
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,500
 Do you have a right to know

950
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,180
 that there's a demon in your house?

951
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,220
 And you go, "Obviously, obviously you do,

952
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,020
 "but I think this type of story happens more often than not."

953
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,740
 There was another story that, you know,

954
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,300
 sometimes I have to make decisions of what to cover.

955
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,140
 There was another story,

956
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,820
 there was pretty much the exact same thing.

957
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,340
 It was a family,

958
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,820
 and that was the one where the dad

959
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,820
 saw a shadowy figure darting in and out

960
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,580
 of the newborn baby's room

961
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,100
 and hearing weird voices.

962
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,980
 And then the story ends, he posted this, he goes,

963
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,260
 "Yeah, I didn't tell anybody

964
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,060
 "because my wife already hates being at home with the kids

965
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,740
 "and this would just make things worse."

966
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,740
 If she knew there was a shadow demon attacking their baby.

967
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,420
 So he, I'll put that in the show notes.

968
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,620
 It's basically just kind of the same setup.

969
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,060
 He's like, "I'm not gonna tell her

970
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,940
 "because she'll just freak out."

971
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,420
 And she already doesn't like being at home.

972
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,500
 Which was what was interesting is he goes,

973
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,220
 she already doesn't like being at home alone with the kids.

974
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,620
 And I'm wondering if she's experiencing stuff too

975
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,220
 and not telling him 'cause he's a skeptic.

976
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,300
 'Cause he would just say you're being hysterical.

977
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,380
 And so when you're not communicating, bad things can happen.

978
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,700
 This Scarecrow story too was written,

979
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,500
 posted online by someone going by the name

980
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,860
 Asparagus New 5501.

981
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,460
 So this guy may, this guy may be a veggie.

982
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,260
 This guy may have a fetish for vegetables

983
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,220
 'cause he spent his childhood on a farm.

984
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,940
 Now he thinks he is actually asparagus, new asparagus.

985
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,300
 But anyway, the Scarecrow story too, like as a family,

986
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,300
 imagine he rented out a house and the George,

987
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,420
 the landlord, whatever it is, the renter,

988
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,060
 doesn't tell you that Scarecrow's

989
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,700
 are walking through the field at night.

990
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,180
 You never notice somewhere.

991
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,820
 He's all waiting for you to bring it up.

992
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:08,580
 Every summer he's like, "Ah, I wonder if this is the summer.

993
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,180
 "If this is the summer, they'll be like,

994
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,540
 "George, I really like this place."

995
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,660
 But the Scarecrow's move around and then he'd get up

996
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,340
 to say goodbye, take the keys.

997
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,940
 And he's like, "They didn't bring up the Scarecrow thing."

998
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,100
 And then he turns and he looks and Scarecrow's

999
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,220
 are marching towards the house.

1000
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,660
 He's like, "Ah, maybe I'm just going insane."

1001
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,420
 It is weird that no one else is seeing the Scarecrow's move.

1002
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,100
 Imagine you rented a house

1003
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,100
 and you didn't know that Scarecrow's

1004
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,660
 were walking around the yard.

1005
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:41,060
 Now imagine you rented a house.

1006
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,580
 You rented every summer and the guy who owns it

1007
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,380
 knows there's a serious problem with black widows

1008
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,980
 in the house.

1009
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,340
 And then on your last day of renting at the landlords,

1010
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,620
 like, you notice anything weird and you're like,

1011
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,420
 "Ah, not really."

1012
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,060
 And the landlord goes,

1013
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,900
 "You didn't notice the massive insect infestation?

1014
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,420
 "You didn't hear the scuttling?"

1015
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,820
 And you're like, "Nah, I do wonder where my infant baby went.

1016
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,460
 "I've been looking for him for two days."

1017
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,780
 But other than that, like, do you have a right to know?

1018
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,220
 And it's funny 'cause we have laws in some states

1019
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,460
 that you have to know if the house is haunted

1020
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,580
 when you're buying it.

1021
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,620
 This is past that.

1022
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,580
 This is like you're running a farm

1023
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,460
 and Scarecrow's are walking around

1024
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,020
 or you're already living in the house

1025
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,140
 and a loved one knows that there's something in the basement

1026
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,300
 or something in the baby's room and you not telling them.

1027
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,260
 And again, this is super creepy

1028
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,300
 because we don't know what we don't know.

1029
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,340
 In your house right now,

1030
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,380
 if you're a fan of the paranormal,

1031
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,500
 even if you don't believe,

1032
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,820
 you're just like hearing these stories,

1033
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,500
 someone else in that house may be experiencing

1034
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,340
 something incredibly terrifying,

1035
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,340
 but they don't wanna tell you

1036
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,580
 because they know you'll get even more scared

1037
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,060
 or you'll be like, "Dude, let's go buy a Ouija board.

1038
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,500
 "Let's talk to it."

1039
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,540
 I wonder how often this happens

1040
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,340
 and I would assume it's fairly common.

1041
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,180
 So we do hide stuff from each other

1042
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,100
 for their safety or so we say, right?

1043
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,860
 You don't want the family to be scared.

1044
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,660
 You don't want the husband or the kid to be scared,

1045
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,460
 but at the end of the day, who's responsible?

1046
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,420
 If those Scarecrow's marched into that house one night,

1047
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,700
 you know, who would be responsible?

1048
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,500
 I don't think homeowners insurance would cover

1049
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,580
 a Scarecrow invasion.

1050
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,740
 I don't think, I'm pretty sure you're out of luck on that one

1051
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,100
 or demonic possession

1052
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,180
 or who knows what else could be going on in these locations.

1053
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,860
 So that's really the question I have for you today.

1054
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,980
 It's really a two-sided question.

1055
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,420
 Do you feel you would have the right

1056
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,220
 to know if you were at risk of paranormal danger?

1057
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,100
 And the flip side of that is, would you be willing,

1058
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,620
 'cause you can see both sides, right?

1059
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,380
 If you were with someone who would get hysterical,

1060
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,260
 who would completely just be like,

1061
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,340
 "Nope, I'm never going down there.

1062
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,460
 "You have to do everything down there in that basement.

1063
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,940
 "Would you be willing to tell..."

1064
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,860
 It's just an interesting thought experiment.

1065
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,380
 Would you want to know the answer will always be yes,

1066
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,580
 but would you be willing to tell somebody,

1067
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,700
 something else that you know would terrify them

1068
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,700
 to their core?

1069
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,580
 Would you be willing to share that with someone,

1070
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:27,820
 knowing full well what the consequences of that will be?

1071
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,220
 But if you don't tell them,

1072
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,640
 the consequences could even be worse.

1073
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,140
 There was a chance that George

1074
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,940
 was going to come back to the farm one day

1075
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,900
 and he goes, "Oh, look at the Scarecrow's

1076
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,900
 "are exactly where they were when I left.

1077
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,340
 "Maybe they've stopped walking around."

1078
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,220
 And then he walks into the house and he's like,

1079
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,220
 "Hello, hello guys, I'm here.

1080
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,460
 "How was summer?"

1081
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,940
 "Summer."

1082
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,540
 So boys, did I go through the house?

1083
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,260
 He's like, "What?"

1084
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,940
 And then he notices like a piece of straw on the ground

1085
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,780
 and he's like, "Huh?"

1086
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,260
 And he picks it up, puts it in his mouth.

1087
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,340
 He's like, "Oh yeah, I'm a farmer after all."

1088
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,260
 Then he walks and he sees another piece of straw

1089
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,140
 and he's like, "Oh, what?"

1090
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,100
 He's walking around.

1091
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,940
 He's very dull.

1092
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,460
 He's very, he's a dullard.

1093
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,300
 Takes him forever.

1094
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,540
 Eventually he's walking around with this huge pile of straw.

1095
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:24,060
 He's like, "Maybe one more piece of straw

1096
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,940
 "will unravel this puzzle.

1097
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,980
 "Maybe then the riddle will be solved."

1098
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,380
 Eventually he's walking around.

1099
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,820
 He picks up all the straw and he goes,

1100
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,940
 "The Scarecrow's must have made it into the house.

1101
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,660
 "But I saw the Scarecrow's out in the field."

1102
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,580
 (gasps)

1103
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,580
 He drops all the straw and he runs out

1104
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,260
 and he runs to the nearest Scarecrow.

1105
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:51,260
 And it's a dead boy all tied up.

1106
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,460
 Like, "Wow, Jason.

1107
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,700
 "That's super intense."

1108
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,160
 His eyes have been replaced with buttons.

1109
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,460
 He's tied to this.

1110
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,460
 And the Scarecrow's replaced the family with themselves.

1111
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,220
 So what?

1112
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:16,700
 There's a car driving on the road with these people.

1113
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,620
 Their carcasses are full of straw.

1114
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,460
 The Scarecrow's have taken over their bodies

1115
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,260
 and they're like, "Ha ha ha, we finally escaped the farm."

1116
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,660
 And then they basically just have to go to work

1117
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,500
 and they have to pretend that Scarecrow's in school.

1118
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,060
 They're like, "Dude, you're so dumb.

1119
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,180
 "Don't you have any brains?"

1120
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,700
 He's sitting there in class just like,

1121
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,460
 "Ugh, there's probably one.

1122
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,260
 "I'm sure we escaped the farm,

1123
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,020
 "but now I'm in elementary school.

1124
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,340
 "My dad has a job in marketing."

1125
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,620
 We didn't really think out the whole escape

1126
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,460
 from the farm thing.

1127
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,580
 At least it was sunny out there

1128
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,780
 and we just got to stand around.

1129
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,900
 Who would be at fault for that?

1130
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,340
 Who would be at fault?

1131
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:01,220
