00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
 - Charlotte, main of God here.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.240
 I can't wait to see you

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.880
 at the Black Effect Podcast Festival

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.280
 coming to you live on Saturday, April 22nd

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.000
 at the Pullman Yards in Atlanta,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.160
 hosted by myself and Jess Halaak.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.400
 If you haven't gotten your tickets,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.560
 what are you waiting for?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.760
 The Black Effect is bringing some

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.120
 of the hottest podcasts live,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.640
 like the '85 South Show,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.320
 "Horrible Decisions," and "Big Facts" for one day only, okay?

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.920
 For inspiring podcasters, we've got you covered.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.320
 You don't wanna miss the Black Effect Podcast Festival?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 Make sure to get your tickets today at blackeffect.com.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.760
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.640
 Is it possible that a miracle cure

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 is hiding inside of a deer's stomach?

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.800
 And then we travel to the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.520
 where two hikers are out exploring nature,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.960
 but only one hiker would come back home

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.040
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.620
 (upbeat music)

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.400
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.440
 I'm your host, Jason Carvener.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.280
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.880
 I hope you guys are having lots of fun,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.680
 and I hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.800
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.400
 So first off, let's go ahead and invite in one of our

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.280
 live stream show supporters.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.620
 This is someone who donated money

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.960
 during the Thanksgiving live stream of 2020.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.520
 It's Ira O'Knock.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.320
 Everyone give a round of applause to Ira.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.240
 Ira's dancing into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.160
 Ira, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.280
 You guys can't support the Patreon

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.760
 or the live stream or anything like that.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.080
 That's fine too.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.800
 Just help spread the word about the show.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.640
 Really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.480
 And as I have Ira polishing up the Jason Jalopy,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.960
 they're like, "Ding it, I didn't know this was part

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.440
 of the job, it is today."

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.400
 As Ira's polishing up the Jason Jalopy

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.080
 for our first journey, I wanna give a little update.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.800
 Last week I mentioned that I may soon be in the possession

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.680
 of a piece of the balloon boy balloon.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.320
 I always have to keep adding that last part.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.760
 I always think this is a long pause.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.240
 It makes it sound like I'm actually gonna have

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.320
 a piece of Falcon Hini.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.600
 I got in touch with SqueezeGod,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.440
 a long time listener of the show.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.560
 They now have my PO box, which is also in the show notes

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
 if you do wanna send me stuff,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.280
 but soon, in a couple weeks, no rush.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.880
 But soon I will have a piece of the balloon boy.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.480
 I see her always, there's always this long pause there.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 I'm afraid now someone's gonna send me a finger

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.880
 and it'll be like, "I have the rest of Falcon in my garage."

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.960
 But thank you, SqueezeGod.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.080
 Thank you for everyone who can support the show financially

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.920
 or with gifts.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.080
 And if you can't do that, just spread the word

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.680
 about the show, it really, really helps out a lot.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.560
 And, Van Art Friday, we have this piece of art

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.520
 from Church Going Mule.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.320
 It is a reference to my episode, "The Not-Dear,"

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.240
 where I said, "Dear Wars, Harmless as Jerbils."

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.520
 And this is this amazing watercolor painting

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.640
 of a deer, the gerbil of the woods.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.160
 So thank you so much, Church Going Mule.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.400
 Really, really appreciate that.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.000
 Ira, we got the car detailed perfect.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.680
 It looks better than it ever has.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.080
 Ira, I'm gonna go and attach the keys.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.280
 That's too nice to drive.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.560
 I'm gonna go and attach the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.160
 We are now leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.640
 We are headed on out to Louisiana.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.760
 Ira's perfectly piloting this Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.960
 Specifically, we're going to South Vicherry, Louisiana.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.880
 It's the early 1800s.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.040
 (singing)

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920
 That's like Bayou music playing.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.240
 (singing)

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.160
 Little dude with the banjo.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.440
 And we're coming down to the Dead Rabbit Durgible

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440
 and we see this swamp.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.440
 Imagine Louisiana, mostly swamp.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.880
 And there's this family there, the Gravoi family.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.280
 Very early settlers to the South Vicherry area of Louisiana.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.840
 And there's a woman in the family and she's walking along.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.000
 She's carrying, I don't know, berries and twigs

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.960
 and stuff like that.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.840
 And then you're like, this is like the late 1800s.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.960
 They're not cave people.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.000
 Anyways, I don't know.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.440
 Maybe she's carrying a book and a ball of yarn.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.640
 It doesn't matter what she's carrying.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.680
 That's not the point of the story.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.240
 What's the point of the story is what's following her.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.360
 There's this little snake on the ground.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.800
 Then it goes, "Achia!"

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.520
 And it bites her.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.320
 And she's like, "Oh no."

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.880
 And she drops, she drops whatever she was holding.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.520
 I'm assuming.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.640
 And she's like, "Oh, now I got bit by this snake."

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.320
 Nowadays, that's a pretty rough afternoon.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.560
 Like, if you live in most parts of the world,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.640
 if you live in the middle of nowhere, you're probably doomed.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.640
 But if I got bit by a snake right now,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.120
 I'd wonder how it would got into my house,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.960
 but then I would just go to the doctor.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.880
 And I'd be like, "Hey, I got bit by a snake."

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.120
 And I'd show him and then I'd take pictures of it

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.520
 and post it on TikTok and stuff like that.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.200
 And I'd probably just get some antibiotics

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.560
 or some anti-venom.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.160
 You're like, "Jason, you're really underestimating

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.280
 what a snake bite does."

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.040
 Okay, maybe I'd like seize up a bit.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.520
 But I'd still like, you know,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.640
 be able to dial 911 with my nose and stuff like that.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.120
 You live nowadays is what I'm saying.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.360
 In most parts of the world, you got bit by a snake.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.000
 As everyone can still shake in their heads.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.520
 And they're like, "Jason, please,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.120
 do not test your theory.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.040
 Do don't go anywhere near a snake.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.120
 If you think you're just gonna have a quote,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.480
 unquote, bad day."

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.160
 Anyways, back then, it's definitely a death sentence.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.120
 You get bit by a snake.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.440
 Like, diarrhea was a death sentence back then.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.040
 You were toast if you just couldn't hold in your poop.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.720
 So she's like, "Oh, man, she's like riding her wheel."

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.200
 She's like, "To my kids, I give my book

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.800
 and my ball of yarn."

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.840
 Signed Lucy.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.760
 But before she can die, this indigenous dude shows up.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.280
 And he's like in the bushes and he's like, "Uh-oh.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.520
 You just got bit by a snake.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.160
 But don't worry, that's not the death sentence

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.040
 you may think it is."

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.560
 And he pulled out this stone.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.600
 And he put it on her wound.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.840
 And it stuck to it.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.280
 And he's like, "Just wait.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.640
 Don't touch it.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.760
 Just wait, wait a bit."

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.720
 And then the stone eventually falls off.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.120
 And he put it in his pouch.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.920
 He walked away.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.760
 And she's like, "I hope that was a cure.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.640
 I would like steal my soul through the snake wound."

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.360
 And it was a cure.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.960
 She actually lived.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.240
 And then about a year later, this same indigenous dude

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.440
 is walking through the bushes.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.120
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm super sick.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.800
 I have really bad case of diarrhea.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.000
 It's a death sentence."

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.680
 And they said, "Well, maybe we can

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.560
 like help you not have diarrhea anymore.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.840
 Do we have this cork?

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.120
 We're going to stick in your butthole.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.080
 You'll be just fine."

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.560
 So they didn't actually say he had diarrhea.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.280
 I don't know what he had.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.680
 But the point is they nursed him back to health.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.920
 And he said, "Thank you for bringing me back to life."

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.280
 And they're like, "Well, you saved the life

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.240
 of one of our family."

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.160
 He goes, "Well, yeah.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.120
 I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.480
 In return for saving my life,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.840
 I'm going to give you this stone."

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.840
 This little stone, if you put it on a wound,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.880
 it will heal it.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.640
 But only your family can use it.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.080
 If anyone else, you loan it to someone,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.680
 the stone will not work.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.000
 And that is the origin story of the mad stone of a cherry.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.880
 Now, I found out about this from an internet user named BayouBlue.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.680
 So thank you, Bayou, for bringing this to my attention.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.280
 I've never heard of this story before.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.280
 And what's interesting is that's a legend.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.160
 We have that story.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.680
 And I'm sure parts of it are true.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.000
 Actually, I'm sure a lot of it's true, honestly.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.800
 In 1999, there was an article in a newspaper

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.800
 written by Leonard Gray.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.840
 The newspaper is called the Observateur.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.280
 It was like a Louisiana newspaper.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.040
 And he documented this.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.160
 And he said, "Yeah, the mad stone was talked about a lot

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.960
 in the area.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.200
 There was actually old newspaper articles

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.920
 back in the 1800s about the stone.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.400
 And the stone is still in the possession of the family,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.040
 although now it's just like a couple little pieces."

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.960
 But is it real?

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.160
 Like, we know the stone's real.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.360
 We know the family's real.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.400
 We, the story probably happened in some sort of fashion.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.720
 But all of that stuff is just, yeah.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.200
 The question is, can it actually cure people?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.280
 Well, this is the weird thing.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.280
 It works, apparently.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.200
 Don't go out again by snake.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.080
 I know you were starting to run off into the thick weeds

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.720
 on a summer day, but let me finish this story.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.680
 So the mad stone is a real thing.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.760
 And the mad stone of a cherry is a real thing.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.280
 But you don't have to be a member of the Gravoy family

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.000
 to have one and have one that actually works.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.920
 There are a lot of these out there.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.640
 And there's a website called AppalachianHistory.net.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.760
 And they really go into detail about what the mechanics are

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.640
 of a mad stone.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.920
 It's the calculus from a deer.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.000
 So when deer, it happens, I guess, in animals that eat a lot of grass.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.640
 They can get this mineral created in their stomach.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.600
 So they're inside the stomachs of deers

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.040
 from when they're eating the grass.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.720
 And they say this Appalachian.net goes into this whole legend.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.640
 If you can get one from an albino deer,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.240
 those are actually the most powerful.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.280
 Those work the best.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.080
 But any deer that has one of these, it will do on a pinch.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.680
 You want the most powerful one.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.000
 And that's probably where the mad stone of a cherry came from.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.400
 But if you happen to shoot a deer and you cut a stomach open,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.240
 and you find one of these rocks, save it.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.720
 And the recipe goes like this.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.120
 This is interesting because it's left out of the legend.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.280
 But this is how you would use one of these today.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.120
 And the weirdest thing is, apparently, these actually work.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.280
 You take this mad stone and you boil it in sweet milk.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.320
 And then while it's still hot, you apply it to the wound.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.520
 So a snake bite, any sort of toxin, actually, this will work.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.760
 But they keep talking about snake bites.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.080
 And it apparently works if you have rabies.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.160
 You take, like, you're like, this is where the dog bit me.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
 It's all this festering wound.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.360
 You're missing half your calf.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.760
 And they're like, we're going to need a bigger stone, guys.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.480
 But you take the stone, you boil it in the sweet milk,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.400
 while it's still hot, you put it on the wound.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.640
 And it'll actually stick to the wound.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.280
 And then eventually it'll fall off.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.080
 Then you take the mad stone, you put it back in the boiling sweet milk.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.760
 And the sweet milk will turn green.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.960
 You take the stone out of the green milk,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.440
 attach it back to the wound, and you let it sit there until it falls off.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.960
 And you continue this over and over and over again,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.720
 until it can no longer stick to you.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.640
 So eventually you'll just put it on and it won't stick at all.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.080
 And you're like, Jason, how could this possibly be real?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.320
 How could this have to just be some local legend?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.000
 You can also do this with any porous stone.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.640
 You can get a rock from the river.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.400
 It basically, any rock that's worn smooth and is porous,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.640
 you can do the same trick.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.440
 And basically, when it gets hot, it's sucking out the toxin

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.880
 into the rock.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.760
 And then you boil it again, and it gets the toxin out,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.800
 and then you put it back on.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.560
 And it sucks back out.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.520
 I know what you're thinking.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.000
 I know what you're thinking, Jason.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.880
 This is not real.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.560
 I don't know why you keep saying that this is real.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.840
 Well, let me tell you this.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.640
 A do-- Okay, here's the thing.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.200
 Okay?

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.720
 I researched this story.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.760
 I did.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.360
 But apparently, I keep using the word apparently,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.080
 apparently it's real, because a doctor, not a medical doctor,

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.000
 but a man with a doctor in front of his name,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.120
 said in 1917 that it works.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.200
 So it might.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.560
 That's why I keep saying apparently.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.320
 It would be interesting to see if you could replicate it today,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.360
 but the problem is that you'd have to go.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.720
 You're in a laboratory, and they're like,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.720
 "Okay, these people have a placebo.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.680
 They're going to get bit by a snake that has no venom,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.000
 and you're going to be bit by a snake that has venom."

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.640
 You're like, "Wait, I didn't thought I was supposed to know."

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.240
 And they were going to put these stones on you.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.880
 But yeah, so you would have to test it.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.680
 But apparently, that isn't the magic word of this episode.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.040
 Apparently, it does work.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.600
 They-- I don't know if it would work for rabies.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.280
 There was a story in the newspaper about this guy

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.720
 who had already gotten lockjaw,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.000
 and they put the mad stones on him,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.680
 and the rabies went away.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.120
 Generally speaking, once you start to exhibit signs of rabies,

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.760
 you're dead.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.280
 Because you can have rabies in a confessor for a long time.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.600
 But according to a newspaper printed in the year 1898,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.400
 it's possible.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.640
 So I would like to test this madstone theory.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.400
 I wonder if they still use them today.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:19.960
 I'm sure they do.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.880
 Nowadays though, you would just go to the doctor.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.800
 Nowadays, you get bit by a rattler, you're like,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.320
 "Better call up my girlfriend and cancel lunch,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.440
 but dinner's still on."

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.880
 Because Jason just said,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.720
 "This is going to be a bad afternoon.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.480
 Everything will be fine."

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.000
 But it might be.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.080
 Maybe on the way to the doctor's office,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.360
 you're sitting in your car,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.360
 you just take a little stone out of your pocket.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.800
 You're like, "Good thing I boiled--

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.560
 Good thing I was already boiling the sweet milk.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.200
 I don't know why.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.400
 I was going to drink it."

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.440
 But then you drop your madstone in the boiling sweet milk

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.480
 and you just hum a jaunty tune as you head to the emergency room.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.080
 And the toxin is slowly shutting down your respiratory system.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.480
 Interesting, interesting story.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.040
 Ira, let's go ahead and tashi the keys to the carboner copter.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.160
 We are leaving behind Louisiana.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.040
 We are headed on out to Bitterroot Mountains in Montana.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:15.160
 I want to do a real quick Dead Rabbit Recommend,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.440
 but it's not something I would ever recommend.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.320
 It might be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.600
 And I've seen the movies begotten the holy mountain

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.280
 and when blackbirds fly.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.960
 So I have a pretty eye level of bizarre movies.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.920
 And this one might take the cake,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.920
 but in a way you would never expect.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.040
 I just-- I've had this in my notes for like six months.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.320
 I just have to talk about it.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.960
 It's a lost media?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.440
 Kind of?

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.320
 It's a movie called--

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.760
 Let me make sure I get the title right,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.400
 because I don't ever really want to think about this movie again.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.000
 I figure once I tell you guys about it,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.360
 the curse will be lifted.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.320
 There's this-- I watch this--

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.120
 I watch the whole thing.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.960
 It's available on Amazon.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.280
 It's called Pity.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.600
 I don't have Perfect Pitch 2.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.000
 And it's a parody of the Pitch Perfect movies,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.240
 which I absolutely can't stand.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.480
 I can't stand those movies.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.360
 Sorry if I just lost nine loyal listeners.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.680
 I'm sorry the nymphettes or whatever the name were.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.560
 Well, what were they called?

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.160
 Like the silhouettes or something like that?

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.720
 I don't know.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.360
 I don't think--

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.120
 I don't think they were called the nymphettes,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.560
 but Pity I Don't Have Perfect Pitch 2

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.440
 is a parody.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.600
 It's like an airplane-type movie.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.160
 It's a parody of those movies.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.520
 And it's about the singing cats versus the harmodogs.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.520
 And it's one of the most puzzling movies

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.720
 I've ever seen in my life.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.280
 And here's why.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.920
 It's not that the jokes didn't work, and they didn't.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.560
 It's not that the plot was awful, and it was.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.400
 It's a musical.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.320
 You have to see it to believe it.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.240
 I'm going to tell you what it is.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.520
 I'm going to waste two more minutes,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.200
 and then I'm never going to speak of it again.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.160
 It is a musical with no music.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.080
 And it catches you completely off guard,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.320
 because I put it in because I like watching bad movies.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.560
 And I hate Pitch Perfect, so it could be worse

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.160
 than a Pitch Perfect parody.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.800
 And they get to the first song, and there's no sound.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.600
 Well, I should be more specific.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.480
 There's no singing.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.640
 You hear a doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.040
 And they're moving their lips, and they're doing this whole dance routine,

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.560
 and text appears on the screen, and it goes, "There is no music."

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.560
 "There's no music in this movie."

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.680
 And you're just watching them dance,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.320
 and then the movie starts back up, and the audio's back,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.440
 and you're like, "What?"

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.760
 And then they get to the next musical number.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.920
 There's several of these musical numbers.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.200
 It's a musical.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.840
 There has to be-- this has to happen like 15 times.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.000
 It gets to the next song, and they go,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.280
 "Hit it, girls!"

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.200
 And the sound drops, and you hear doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.600
 And more text appears on the screen, and it goes,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.560
 "Here's what happened.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.280
 We originally filmed all of these really, really funny songs for this movie."

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.120
 And then doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.120
 And just-- and then it goes to the next song.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.240
 It's the most compelling movie ever, because you--

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.960
 they tell you, "Peace by Pete."

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.040
 You don't even pay attention to the plot.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.880
 You can't wait until the next musical number,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.160
 quote unquote musical number, for the sound to cut out.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.840
 You know what they say.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.120
 "We always sit--"

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.000
 Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.280
 And it explains this story.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.960
 What happened was they had recorded

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.440
 all these parody songs for this musical,

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.760
 and when they went to release it,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.760
 the lawyers for the film company said,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.520
 "Did you get the rights for these parodies?"

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.240
 And they said, "No."

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.200
 And the lawyers go, "You can't use these songs."

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.320
 And they go, "Well, it's musical.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.240
 Like, don't we have, like, fair use?

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.840
 Because it's parody and the lawyers are, like,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.640
 absolutely not.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.920
 You have to go get all of this licensing stuff done.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.520
 It's going to cost, like, millions of dollars."

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.080
 So then they go, "Well, can we rewrite original songs

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.640
 and put them in there and try to make the words match

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.840
 what they're lip-syncing?"

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.720
 And then they said, "You know what?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.320
 That's just way too much trouble.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.800
 We'll release a musical with no songs."

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.960
 It's so bizarre.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.320
 It's one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.920
 It's a treat.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.240
 Like, I watched the whole thing,

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.440
 and I can guarantee you,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.840
 had it been a normal, pitch-perfect parody movie,

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.240
 and the songs were probably mediocre at best, funny,

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.080
 I probably would have shut it off 30 minutes in.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.560
 The fact-- I was sitting on the edge of my seat,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.400
 because they lay it out,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.720
 so they just give you a little bit of information,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.080
 each musical number,

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.800
 why there's no music is fascinating.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.720
 So if you want to add a movie to your collection,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.680
 if you want one-of-a-kind movie going experience,

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.680
 watch "Pitty I Don't Have Perfect Pitch 2."

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.920
 I have to own a physical copy of this,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.800
 because what's going to happen--

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.160
 it's on Amazon right now.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.600
 It won't be on Amazon forever,

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.080
 because the trailer is geared towards young girls

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.680
 who love the pitch-perfect series,

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.200
 who love the music and the singing,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.800
 and they're going to be like,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.960
 "They're going to get their slumber party all together."

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.560
 They're like, "Oh, this will be so funny."

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.640
 And then they're just, "What? I need to own a copy of this."

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.960
 My P.O. box is in the show notes.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.480
 If someone wants to buy me a copy of "Pitty I Don't Have Perfect Pitch 2"

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.680
 and send it to me, so weird,

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.000
 one of the weirdest movie going experiences I've ever had.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.440
 I'm not joking.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:42.520
 It ranks up there with the time that I got super-stoned

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.680
 and watched "Tommy" for the first time.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.960
 I had no idea what it was about.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.080
 I'm like, "What? This whole movie's about a blind dude?

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.000
 Blind dude getting raped while playing pinball?"

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.440
 And I'm super-stoned? What is going on?

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.760
 "Pitty"-- it ranks up there with that type of movie going experience.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.400
 Dead Rabbit reluctantly recommends--

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.000
 just because it's so bizarre--

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 "Pitty I Don't Have Perfect Pitch 2,"

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.920
 now available on Amazon,

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.760
 but it will be gone soon.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.040
 Ira Onak is flying the Carbentercopter.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.960
 We're listening to the soundtrack of that movie.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.920
 It's just like, "Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo."

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.240
 Ira, bring this Carbentercopter nice and low here.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.560
 We're flying over the Bitterroot Mountains in Corvallis, Montana.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.880
 It's July 18th, 2007.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.640
 It's 12 p.m.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.280
 I just found out about the story, I don't know, maybe a day ago,

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.960
 and I was like, "This is a story I'm gonna end the week on."

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.160
 Barbara Bullock, 55-year-old woman,

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.880
 is happily married to her husband, Carl Bullock.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:49.240
 They're hanging out in the Corvallis, Montana area, just enjoying life.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:54.840
 Carl's cousin and her friend Jim Ramaker have come to visit.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:01.880
 Spend some time together, enjoy the outdoors, just relaxing.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.320
 July 18th was the day of a scheduled hike,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.120
 and that was supposed to be Barbara leading the way she'd done this hike dozens of times

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.480
 up through the Bitterroot Mountains.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.880
 And she was gonna take Jim and Carl's cousin,

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.560
 but Carl's cousin, she had a hangover.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.600
 It was kind of a rough night, kicking back some drinks.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.040
 So Barbara goes, "You know what, Jim?

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.400
 Let's just do the hike ourselves."

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.520
 And Jim's totally fine with it.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.560
 They loaded up their packs, and Barbara was so experienced in this area,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.480
 she knew that she had to watch out for bears.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:34.360
 So she packed her a 357 magnum, which she always brought with her,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.200
 and they headed off down the trail.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.800
 As they're headed off to the entrance of the trailhead,

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.240
 there's a construction crew there, and they're doing their jobs,

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.760
 banging stuff into the ground, and hoisting up girders,

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.080
 nailing each other's pants to the ground.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.200
 It's hilarious.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.800
 But they walk past the construction crew,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.000
 not really thinking anything of it,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.640
 and they are making their way down this trail.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:00.040
 Where they're headed is the Bear Creek Overlook area,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.360
 which is gonna provide a scenic view.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.600
 And they're gonna hit that at the end,

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.200
 and then they're gonna come back home.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.360
 And as they're making their way across the trail,

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.480
 they run into two other hikers, two dudes,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.400
 and they have this black dog with a little white,

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.760
 little bit of white fur on him,

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.040
 and they just kind of pass each other.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.240
 Barbara talks to him briefly,

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.560
 and Jim kind of looks back, sees Barbara talking to him.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.920
 They continue down the trail.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.600
 Barbara and Jim continue walking down the trail,

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.680
 talking and enjoying the solitude of nature,

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.280
 and Jim gets to Bear Creek Overlook.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:36.040
 And he looks out, and he sees this gorgeous view of the valley.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.440
 And he looks back, and he sees Barbara coming up behind him.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.320
 He's maybe 20, 30 feet away.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.400
 And then he looks back out to the field.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:58.280
 One minute later, he looks back, and the trail is empty.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:05.160
 One minute passes, and he looks back down the trail.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.720
 Barbara is gone.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.240
 Now Jim's all alone here.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.560
 This is unfamiliar territory for him, but it's a trail.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.160
 It's listed, when you look at the hiking trail guide for the area,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.840
 it's listed as a moderately hard trail to walk.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.960
 So a normal human could do this trail,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.920
 and he's kind of looking around.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.880
 He doesn't see Barbara.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.040
 He knows this is the end of the path,

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.400
 and he thinks maybe she must have gone back.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.960
 I mean, she was 30 feet behind me 60 seconds ago.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.440
 Maybe she must have just turned around.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.400
 But he takes a second, and he looks,

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.040
 and there's no sign of her in his immediate vicinity.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.280
 He begins walking back down the trail, and he notices something.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.720
 The path is made of loose shale,

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.720
 so every footstep makes a lot of noise,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.280
 as the rocks clickety-clack against each other.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.200
 And he realizes something.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.160
 In that minute-long period,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.200
 he just stopped hearing the noise of Barbara walking.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.160
 If she must have turned around and started going the opposite direction,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.920
 she must be right around this bend.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.480
 He continues down the trail,

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.200
 and he keeps expecting to see her every time he makes a turn.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.480
 He has a whistle, like a safety whistle.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.880
 He begins blowing it, shouting her name, no response.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:38.040
 He walks all the way down the trail without a sign of her.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.080
 But he's thinking she must be just a little bit ahead of me.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.200
 She must be a little bit ahead of me.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.800
 She might be at the car.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.920
 She must be at the car.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.840
 He gets all the way down the trail.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.600
 He gets to where the construction workers are,

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.440
 and he goes, "Hey, this is going to sound super weird, but

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.640
 did you see a woman come out of the forest?"

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.320
 The construction workers kind of talk amongst each other,

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.640
 because they can tell this guy's agitated at this point.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.080
 He's walked this whole trail, and he has not found Barbara.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:11.560
 And they say, "The only people we've seen come out of that trail in a while were two dudes and

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.120
 their dog."

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.640
 And they walked over, and they got in this white van,

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.720
 it's kind of like this white truck vehicle, he drove away.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.240
 And he's like, "You did not see a woman walk out."

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.000
 They're like, "No, absolutely not."

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.280
 Now at this point, panic is completely set in,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.320
 and I'm sure that we've all had that experience,

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.480
 where we've been lost or we've lost somebody.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.360
 You're walking around the store, and one of your siblings that you're supposed to be taking care of

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.920
 wanders off while you're playing Street Fighter II of the arcade,

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.240
 and then you start to get that panicky feeling.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.080
 But you keep thinking, they're right around the corner,

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.440
 they're right around the Dig Dug Machine,

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.000
 they're hiding behind Dragon's Lair, they're somewhere.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.760
 He got sucked into the Tron world, but and you find them.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:57.560
 But now he's gotten to this point where she's nowhere.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.320
 They're at the parking lot, she's not in the car,

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:04.200
 so he uses one of the construction workers' cell phones to call authorities.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.320
 And the authorities come out and they ask him,

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:07.720
 "What happened?"

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.560
 He goes, "You guys are not going to believe this, I can guarantee you,

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.000
 you will not believe this."

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.640
 She was 30 feet behind me, she disappeared.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.240
 They go, "How long were you looking ahead?

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.480
 How long were you really not aware what was going on?"

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.600
 And the estimates range anywhere from 45 seconds to two minutes at most.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.920
 Most accounts say about a minute,

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.920
 but I've seen some people say it was shorter,

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.600
 and some people say it was a minute longer.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.800
 But still not enough for somebody to simply slink out of existence.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.920
 The authorities call up her husband, they call up Carl.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.800
 And the authorities seem to just be like,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.240
 "Because it's the park rangers involved,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.640
 they're the ones actually investigating this at this time."

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.480
 The park rangers are like, "Listen, we're going to find her,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.280
 don't worry, but maybe you might want to come down here,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.000
 so you know she might be shaken up and stuff like that."

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.840
 He goes down there and he tells them,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.000
 "She knows this trail, she might have,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.200
 I don't know what happened,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.600
 but she's been on this trail dozens of times.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.240
 She's such an experienced hiker."

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.680
 If she did happen to get lost somehow, she has supplies,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.200
 she has a gun to protect herself,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.520
 because they started asking, do you think a bear could have gotten her?

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.240
 And Jim's like, "Well, I don't know how quiet bears are around here,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.040
 but it didn't make any noise if it did."

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.720
 I didn't hear anything.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.920
 And the other theory they had was that maybe she fell off,

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.600
 maybe she was too close to the edge of a cliff,

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.440
 because they're walking around the Bitterroot Mountains,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.160
 they're headed to this overlook that overlooks the valley.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.160
 And Carl says, "I'm going to tell you something,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.320
 my wife hates heights,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.280
 she has never ever gone near the edge of a cliff."

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.520
 Like I used to go hiking with her,

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.320
 I had a heart attack,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.920
 that's why I don't go hiking with her anymore,

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:52.600
 but she wouldn't get close enough to fall off of a cliff.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.320
 To this day, she has never been found.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:03.640
 Not a scrap of clothing, not a drop of blood, nothing.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.840
 When the park rangers investigated the area,

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.480
 they said there was no sign of disturbance or struggle at all.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:15.720
 And the obvious answer is Jim did something to take her life.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.520
 But the authorities,

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.760
 because eventually the police do get involved in things like that,

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.240
 and he's like, "Listen, I 100% know that I look like

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.960
 the biggest suspect in the world.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.880
 It was just me and her in the middle of nowhere,

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.080
 and she disappeared.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.840
 I will do a polygraph right now,

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.520
 I will cooperate whatever.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.360
 I did not do it."

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.960
 And the kind of the consensus is,

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.920
 that would be the worst alibi ever.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.560
 To murder someone,

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.000
 and then your alibi is,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.160
 well I guess she just vanished.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.800
 I guess she just disappeared behind me.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:56.360
 I think another interesting part of the mystery is the two men.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.160
 Because some people are thinking that the two men snatch her.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.480
 That the two men have anything to do with her disappearance.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.600
 The police want to talk to these guys.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.760
 They said, "We don't think they're suspects,

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.880
 we just want to talk to them."

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.600
 Because really they would be the only two other people

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.400
 who could say what Jim and Barbara's mood was.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.520
 Because even though they've ruled out Jim as a suspect,

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.000
 that doesn't mean that he's not.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.400
 And if they can get hold of these two guys,

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.280
 and they're like, "Yeah Jim was acting really weird around Barbara."

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.440
 And when she stopped to talk to us,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.200
 she goes, "Hey, what are you guys up to?"

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.800
 And she's like, "Hey, this guy's acting kind of weird."

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.600
 We don't know if any of that was said,

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.160
 because we can't find the other two people.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.000
 There was a $10,000 reward.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Not for their arrest.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.240
 Most of the time when you see an award,

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.280
 it's for their arrest and conviction.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.160
 Which takes years and years and years.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.080
 And if they get arrested and they don't get convicted,

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:53.800
 you don't get an award.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.960
 Whenever they're like $50,000 for the arrest and conviction,

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.920
 that's all and so on.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.200
 They were willing to pay $10,000 just to know these people's names.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.000
 They said they are not suspects, we just want to talk to them.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.520
 These two people, their dog and their car,

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.520
 have never been identified, ever.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:16.200
 And the construction workers and Jim gave detailed description.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.360
 They have detailed description of both people,

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.880
 a drawing of one of them.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.680
 They have a photo of a dog that looks like the dog.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.400
 And it says their dog had a little bit of white fur on it

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.320
 and a photo of the type of car they had.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.840
 The $10,000 has never been claimed.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.240
 These two people have also disappeared off the face of the earth.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:40.040
 Because if someone was offering $10,000 for my identity,

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.080
 I would be like, "It's me, it's me, Jason Carpenter,

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.880
 give me my money."

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.000
 They, these people just disappeared off the face of the earth.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.360
 You go, "Jason, maybe they were murderers,

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.240
 maybe a little murderers, they're not going to go and talk to the police maybe."

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.400
 But again, no sign of a struggle.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:59.240
 Where did Barbara Bolik go?

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:05.800
 It's been 14 years since she disappeared.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.200
 Where did she go?

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.920
 Now, I know a lot of people are probably listening to this

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.040
 and thinking, "Missing 411, that's a conspiracy theory

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.640
 that there is some sort of unknown force in the national parks of America

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:27.400
 that's kidnapping people and either depositing their bodies in remote parts of the forest,

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.080
 or the body's never being seen again."

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.960
 I think the phenomenon behind Missing 411,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.560
 I don't know if it's a national thing,

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.360
 I do, we do know people go missing in forests.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:44.280
 I have my own questions about Missing 411 as a cohesive conspiracy theory,

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.960
 as people, some people would just go missing 411.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.440
 When someone goes missing in the woods, they'll go missing 411.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.880
 But what they don't understand is Missing 411 never answers the what.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.040
 There's been theories, some of it is the government's training,

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.800
 there are people in camouflage suits,

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.960
 I've heard that theory bandied around and that doesn't explain why they're depositing toddlers

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.680
 on the tops of cliffs where some like kids been found.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.360
 Sometimes it's Bigfoot, David Paul Lades,

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.360
 his original theory was that it was Bigfoot,

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.800
 and as Missing 411 got more popular, he kind of pushed that to the side.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.720
 Now it's just some sort of force,

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.040
 but I don't know if I buy it as a whole,

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.920
 like every missing person in the woods is missing 411.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.440
 That's just such a, that's like saying every possible alien story,

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.920
 it's graze, it's graze, it's graze, all the way down it's graze,

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.520
 and I think you lose a bit of the nuance to it.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:40.440
 But a Missing 411 type phenomenon falling into another dimension,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.080
 walking through some sort of unseen portal,

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.480
 that wouldn't cause a disturbance, it would be silent,

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.200
 some sort of unknown cryptid in the area.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:53.400
 There were calls to the police when the police were asking for help from the community.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.200
 People were talking about a Phantom Mountain Man,

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.480
 they believe that a Phantom Mountain Man in the area got her.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.440
 I couldn't find any other reference to this,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.480
 that was kind of an aside in a true crime article,

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.280
 they weren't really talking about any sort of paranormal angle,

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.280
 and I don't know if that meant a literal Phantom,

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.640
 like a Ghost Mountain Man,

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.360
 or just a Mountain Man in, that's a human,

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.040
 that's been hunting the Bitterroot Mountains all this time and can move silently.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.880
 Couldn't find it, that's an interesting theory,

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.400
 but I couldn't find anything else on that,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.000
 there were some locals saying that was true.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.960
 But I wanted to end this story with this.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.000
 A lot of times when we end these episodes,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.800
 a lot of times when we just think about these stories in general,

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.160
 outside of the podcast, we think,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.680
 "Man, what happened to that woman?"

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.600
 She dead, is her bones somewhere in the woods,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.960
 just completely undiscovered.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.040
 Was she taken to some Mountain Man's hobo shack,

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.440
 and was kept alive for as long as he pleased,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.640
 and then eventually gutted?

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.680
 Did she pass into another dimension?

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.840
 Has she spent the last 14 years in some sort of world,

00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:00.440
 some other place in time that would be unrecognizable to us?

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.680
 And we can imagine that, and we can fear that,

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.800
 and we can pull out all sorts of scenarios,

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.120
 about what could have happened paranormal or otherwise.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.640
 But you know what really stuck out to me about this story?

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.920
 Is imagine not if you were Barbara, imagine if you were Jim.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:25.320
 Would you ever feel safe again?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.920
 Would you ever be able to find any sort of comfort in your life,

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:40.520
 knowing that someone disappeared off the face of the Earth within one minute?

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.000
 She'd been accidentally shot by a hunter,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.680
 or tumbled off a cliff, or fell into a sinkhole.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.920
 That would also be terrible,

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.240
 but you could rationalize that in some sort of way.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.080
 You may wonder, "Why not me?"

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.600
 You may have survivor guilt.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:04.600
 But that's all realistic, that's all just bad luck.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:13.800
 But to know that you were 30 feet away from another human who ceased to exist,

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:21.160
 and 14 years later it is unknown where that person is or what happened to them,

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.520
 how could you possibly sleep at night?

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:30.840
 Every time someone you loved was out of your field of vision,

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.000
 you would have to think they're not coming back.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.840
 Now see, we don't have that.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.200
 We don't have that mindset.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.440
 I think the worst we can have is if we live in bad areas,

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.600
 we could think, "My dad's going to work today, I hope he makes it back home."

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.120
 And that's bad enough.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.360
 That's a terrible enough feeling to go through.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.400
 But imagine if your dad's like,

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.160
 "Hey, I'm going to go into the kitchen and get some milk,"

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.520
 and you're like, "Lord, please protect him, please protect him,

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.000
 because once he leaves your field of vision, he may cease to exist.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.720
 He may never be seen again."

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:19.240
 Barbara Bolik disappeared, but Jim's story is never ending.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.920
 I don't see how he can get a moment of comfort for the rest of his life.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:38.760
 Knowing at any moment reality can snap, and someone 30 feet behind him could disappear.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:46.040
 And Jim also has to realize that at any moment, he may be the one who vanishes.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.520
 If it happened once, it can happen again.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:57.000
 And whether he's deep on a trail in the Bitterroot Mountains,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.360
 or just laying in bed another sleepless night trying to forget what happened,

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.720
 at any moment he could also vanish.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:17.240
 He'll become a mystery, but at least then he'll know what happened to Barbara.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:23.400

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.880
 What if you could add a bunch more smiles to your day, or add a bunch more text from friends just

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.200
 saying hi, or add a bunch more time to your week to get more done?

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.760
 Good things should always come in bunches.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.000

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.280
