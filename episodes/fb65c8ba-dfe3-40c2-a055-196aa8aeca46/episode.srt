00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
 - Charlotte, main of God here.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,240
 I can't wait to see you

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,880
 at the Black Effect Podcast Festival

4
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,280
 coming to you live on Saturday, April 22nd

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,000
 at the Pullman Yards in Atlanta,

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,160
 hosted by myself and Jess Halaak.

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,400
 If you haven't gotten your tickets,

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,560
 what are you waiting for?

9
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,760
 The Black Effect is bringing some

00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,120
 of the hottest podcasts live,

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,640
 like the '85 South Show,

12
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,320
 "Horrible Decisions," and "Big Facts" for one day only, okay?

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,920

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,760
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

17
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,640
 Is it possible that a miracle cure

18
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,440
 is hiding inside of a deer's stomach?

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,800
 And then we travel to the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,520
 where two hikers are out exploring nature,

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,960
 but only one hiker would come back home

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,040
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,620
 (upbeat music)

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,400
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,440
 I'm your host, Jason Carvener.

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,280
 I'm having a great day.

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,880
 I hope you guys are having lots of fun,

30
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,680
 and I hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,800
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

32
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,400
 So first off, let's go ahead and invite in one of our

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,280
 live stream show supporters.

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,620
 This is someone who donated money

35
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,960
 during the Thanksgiving live stream of 2020.

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,520
 It's Ira O'Knock.

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,320
 Everyone give a round of applause to Ira.

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
 Ira's dancing into Dead Rabbit Command.

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,160
 Ira, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

40
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,280
 You guys can't support the Patreon

41
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,760
 or the live stream or anything like that.

42
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,080
 That's fine too.

43
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,800
 Just help spread the word about the show.

44
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,640
 Really, really helps out a lot.

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,480
 And as I have Ira polishing up the Jason Jalopy,

46
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
 they're like, "Ding it, I didn't know this was part

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,440
 of the job, it is today."

48
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,400
 As Ira's polishing up the Jason Jalopy

49
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,080
 for our first journey, I wanna give a little update.

50
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,800
 Last week I mentioned that I may soon be in the possession

51
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,680
 of a piece of the balloon boy balloon.

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,320
 I always have to keep adding that last part.

53
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,760
 I always think this is a long pause.

54
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,240
 It makes it sound like I'm actually gonna have

55
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,320
 a piece of Falcon Hini.

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,600
 I got in touch with SqueezeGod,

57
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,440
 a long time listener of the show.

58
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,560
 They now have my PO box, which is also in the show notes

59
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
 if you do wanna send me stuff,

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,280
 but soon, in a couple weeks, no rush.

61
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,880
 But soon I will have a piece of the balloon boy.

62
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,480
 I see her always, there's always this long pause there.

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
 I'm afraid now someone's gonna send me a finger

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,880
 and it'll be like, "I have the rest of Falcon in my garage."

65
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,960
 But thank you, SqueezeGod.

66
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,080
 Thank you for everyone who can support the show financially

67
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,920
 or with gifts.

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,080
 And if you can't do that, just spread the word

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,680
 about the show, it really, really helps out a lot.

70
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,560
 And, Van Art Friday, we have this piece of art

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,520
 from Church Going Mule.

72
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,320
 It is a reference to my episode, "The Not-Dear,"

73
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,240
 where I said, "Dear Wars, Harmless as Jerbils."

74
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,520
 And this is this amazing watercolor painting

75
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,640
 of a deer, the gerbil of the woods.

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,160
 So thank you so much, Church Going Mule.

77
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,400
 Really, really appreciate that.

78
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,000
 Ira, we got the car detailed perfect.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
 It looks better than it ever has.

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,080
 Ira, I'm gonna go and attach the keys.

81
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,280
 That's too nice to drive.

82
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,560
 I'm gonna go and attach the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,160
 We are now leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

84
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,640
 We are headed on out to Louisiana.

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,760
 Ira's perfectly piloting this Dead Rabbit Durgible.

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,960
 Specifically, we're going to South Vicherry, Louisiana.

87
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,880
 It's the early 1800s.

88
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,040
 (singing)

89
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,920
 That's like Bayou music playing.

90
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,240
 (singing)

91
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,160
 Little dude with the banjo.

92
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,440
 And we're coming down to the Dead Rabbit Durgible

93
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,440
 and we see this swamp.

94
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 Imagine Louisiana, mostly swamp.

95
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,880
 And there's this family there, the Gravoi family.

96
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,280
 Very early settlers to the South Vicherry area of Louisiana.

97
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,840
 And there's a woman in the family and she's walking along.

98
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,000
 She's carrying, I don't know, berries and twigs

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,960
 and stuff like that.

100
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,840
 And then you're like, this is like the late 1800s.

101
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,960
 They're not cave people.

102
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
 Anyways, I don't know.

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,440
 Maybe she's carrying a book and a ball of yarn.

104
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,640
 It doesn't matter what she's carrying.

105
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,680
 That's not the point of the story.

106
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,240
 What's the point of the story is what's following her.

107
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,360
 There's this little snake on the ground.

108
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,800
 Then it goes, "Achia!"

109
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,520
 And it bites her.

110
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,320
 And she's like, "Oh no."

111
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,880
 And she drops, she drops whatever she was holding.

112
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,520
 I'm assuming.

113
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,640
 And she's like, "Oh, now I got bit by this snake."

114
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,320
 Nowadays, that's a pretty rough afternoon.

115
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,560
 Like, if you live in most parts of the world,

116
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,640
 if you live in the middle of nowhere, you're probably doomed.

117
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,640
 But if I got bit by a snake right now,

118
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,120
 I'd wonder how it would got into my house,

119
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,960
 but then I would just go to the doctor.

120
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,880
 And I'd be like, "Hey, I got bit by a snake."

121
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,120
 And I'd show him and then I'd take pictures of it

122
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,520
 and post it on TikTok and stuff like that.

123
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,200
 And I'd probably just get some antibiotics

124
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,560
 or some anti-venom.

125
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,160
 You're like, "Jason, you're really underestimating

126
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,280
 what a snake bite does."

127
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,040
 Okay, maybe I'd like seize up a bit.

128
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,520
 But I'd still like, you know,

129
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,640
 be able to dial 911 with my nose and stuff like that.

130
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,120
 You live nowadays is what I'm saying.

131
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,360
 In most parts of the world, you got bit by a snake.

132
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,000
 As everyone can still shake in their heads.

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,520
 And they're like, "Jason, please,

134
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,120
 do not test your theory.

135
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,040
 Do don't go anywhere near a snake.

136
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,120
 If you think you're just gonna have a quote,

137
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
 unquote, bad day."

138
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,160
 Anyways, back then, it's definitely a death sentence.

139
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,120
 You get bit by a snake.

140
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,440
 Like, diarrhea was a death sentence back then.

141
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,040
 You were toast if you just couldn't hold in your poop.

142
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,720
 So she's like, "Oh, man, she's like riding her wheel."

143
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,200
 She's like, "To my kids, I give my book

144
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,800
 and my ball of yarn."

145
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,840
 Signed Lucy.

146
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,760
 But before she can die, this indigenous dude shows up.

147
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,280
 And he's like in the bushes and he's like, "Uh-oh.

148
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,520
 You just got bit by a snake.

149
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,160
 But don't worry, that's not the death sentence

150
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,040
 you may think it is."

151
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,560
 And he pulled out this stone.

152
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,600
 And he put it on her wound.

153
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,840
 And it stuck to it.

154
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,280
 And he's like, "Just wait.

155
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,640
 Don't touch it.

156
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,760
 Just wait, wait a bit."

157
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,720
 And then the stone eventually falls off.

158
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,120
 And he put it in his pouch.

159
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,920
 He walked away.

160
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,760
 And she's like, "I hope that was a cure.

161
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,640
 I would like steal my soul through the snake wound."

162
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,360
 And it was a cure.

163
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,960
 She actually lived.

164
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,240
 And then about a year later, this same indigenous dude

165
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
 is walking through the bushes.

166
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,120
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm super sick.

167
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
 I have really bad case of diarrhea.

168
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
 It's a death sentence."

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,680
 And they said, "Well, maybe we can

170
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,560
 like help you not have diarrhea anymore.

171
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,840
 Do we have this cork?

172
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,120
 We're going to stick in your butthole.

173
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,080
 You'll be just fine."

174
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,560
 So they didn't actually say he had diarrhea.

175
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,280
 I don't know what he had.

176
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,680
 But the point is they nursed him back to health.

177
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,920
 And he said, "Thank you for bringing me back to life."

178
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,280
 And they're like, "Well, you saved the life

179
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,240
 of one of our family."

180
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,160
 He goes, "Well, yeah.

181
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,120
 I'm glad you mentioned that.

182
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
 In return for saving my life,

183
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,840
 I'm going to give you this stone."

184
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,840
 This little stone, if you put it on a wound,

185
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,880
 it will heal it.

186
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,640
 But only your family can use it.

187
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,080
 If anyone else, you loan it to someone,

188
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,680
 the stone will not work.

189
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,000
 And that is the origin story of the mad stone of a cherry.

190
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,880
 Now, I found out about this from an internet user named BayouBlue.

191
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,680
 So thank you, Bayou, for bringing this to my attention.

192
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,280
 I've never heard of this story before.

193
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,280
 And what's interesting is that's a legend.

194
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,160
 We have that story.

195
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,680
 And I'm sure parts of it are true.

196
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,000
 Actually, I'm sure a lot of it's true, honestly.

197
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,800
 In 1999, there was an article in a newspaper

198
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
 written by Leonard Gray.

199
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,840
 The newspaper is called the Observateur.

200
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,280
 It was like a Louisiana newspaper.

201
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,040
 And he documented this.

202
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,160
 And he said, "Yeah, the mad stone was talked about a lot

203
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,960
 in the area.

204
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,200
 There was actually old newspaper articles

205
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,920
 back in the 1800s about the stone.

206
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,400
 And the stone is still in the possession of the family,

207
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,040
 although now it's just like a couple little pieces."

208
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,960
 But is it real?

209
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,160
 Like, we know the stone's real.

210
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,360
 We know the family's real.

211
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,400
 We, the story probably happened in some sort of fashion.

212
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,720
 But all of that stuff is just, yeah.

213
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,200
 The question is, can it actually cure people?

214
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,280
 Well, this is the weird thing.

215
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,280
 It works, apparently.

216
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,200
 Don't go out again by snake.

217
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,080
 I know you were starting to run off into the thick weeds

218
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,720
 on a summer day, but let me finish this story.

219
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,680
 So the mad stone is a real thing.

220
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,760
 And the mad stone of a cherry is a real thing.

221
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,280
 But you don't have to be a member of the Gravoy family

222
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,000
 to have one and have one that actually works.

223
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,920
 There are a lot of these out there.

224
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,640
 And there's a website called AppalachianHistory.net.

225
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,760
 And they really go into detail about what the mechanics are

226
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,640
 of a mad stone.

227
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,920
 It's the calculus from a deer.

228
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,000
 So when deer, it happens, I guess, in animals that eat a lot of grass.

229
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,640
 They can get this mineral created in their stomach.

230
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,600
 So they're inside the stomachs of deers

231
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,040
 from when they're eating the grass.

232
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,720
 And they say this Appalachian.net goes into this whole legend.

233
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,640
 If you can get one from an albino deer,

234
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,240
 those are actually the most powerful.

235
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,280
 Those work the best.

236
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,080
 But any deer that has one of these, it will do on a pinch.

237
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,680
 You want the most powerful one.

238
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,000
 And that's probably where the mad stone of a cherry came from.

239
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,400
 But if you happen to shoot a deer and you cut a stomach open,

240
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,240
 and you find one of these rocks, save it.

241
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,720
 And the recipe goes like this.

242
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,120
 This is interesting because it's left out of the legend.

243
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,280
 But this is how you would use one of these today.

244
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,120
 And the weirdest thing is, apparently, these actually work.

245
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,280
 You take this mad stone and you boil it in sweet milk.

246
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,320
 And then while it's still hot, you apply it to the wound.

247
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,520
 So a snake bite, any sort of toxin, actually, this will work.

248
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,760
 But they keep talking about snake bites.

249
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,080
 And it apparently works if you have rabies.

250
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,160
 You take, like, you're like, this is where the dog bit me.

251
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
 It's all this festering wound.

252
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,360
 You're missing half your calf.

253
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,760
 And they're like, we're going to need a bigger stone, guys.

254
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,480
 But you take the stone, you boil it in the sweet milk,

255
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,400
 while it's still hot, you put it on the wound.

256
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,640
 And it'll actually stick to the wound.

257
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,280
 And then eventually it'll fall off.

258
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,080
 Then you take the mad stone, you put it back in the boiling sweet milk.

259
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,760
 And the sweet milk will turn green.

260
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,960
 You take the stone out of the green milk,

261
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,440
 attach it back to the wound, and you let it sit there until it falls off.

262
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,960
 And you continue this over and over and over again,

263
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,720
 until it can no longer stick to you.

264
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,640
 So eventually you'll just put it on and it won't stick at all.

265
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,080
 And you're like, Jason, how could this possibly be real?

266
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,320
 How could this have to just be some local legend?

267
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,000
 You can also do this with any porous stone.

268
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,640
 You can get a rock from the river.

269
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,400
 It basically, any rock that's worn smooth and is porous,

270
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,640
 you can do the same trick.

271
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,440
 And basically, when it gets hot, it's sucking out the toxin

272
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,880
 into the rock.

273
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,760
 And then you boil it again, and it gets the toxin out,

274
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,800
 and then you put it back on.

275
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,560
 And it sucks back out.

276
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,520
 I know what you're thinking.

277
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,000
 I know what you're thinking, Jason.

278
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,880
 This is not real.

279
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,560
 I don't know why you keep saying that this is real.

280
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,840
 Well, let me tell you this.

281
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,640
 A do-- Okay, here's the thing.

282
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,200
 Okay?

283
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,720
 I researched this story.

284
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,760
 I did.

285
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,360
 But apparently, I keep using the word apparently,

286
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,080
 apparently it's real, because a doctor, not a medical doctor,

287
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,000
 but a man with a doctor in front of his name,

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,120
 said in 1917 that it works.

289
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,200
 So it might.

290
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,560
 That's why I keep saying apparently.

291
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,320
 It would be interesting to see if you could replicate it today,

292
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,360
 but the problem is that you'd have to go.

293
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,720
 You're in a laboratory, and they're like,

294
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
 "Okay, these people have a placebo.

295
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,680
 They're going to get bit by a snake that has no venom,

296
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,000
 and you're going to be bit by a snake that has venom."

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,640
 You're like, "Wait, I didn't thought I was supposed to know."

298
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,240
 And they were going to put these stones on you.

299
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,880
 But yeah, so you would have to test it.

300
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,680
 But apparently, that isn't the magic word of this episode.

301
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,040
 Apparently, it does work.

302
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,600
 They-- I don't know if it would work for rabies.

303
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,280
 There was a story in the newspaper about this guy

304
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,720
 who had already gotten lockjaw,

305
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,000
 and they put the mad stones on him,

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,680
 and the rabies went away.

307
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,120
 Generally speaking, once you start to exhibit signs of rabies,

308
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,760
 you're dead.

309
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,280
 Because you can have rabies in a confessor for a long time.

310
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,600
 But according to a newspaper printed in the year 1898,

311
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,400
 it's possible.

312
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,640
 So I would like to test this madstone theory.

313
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
 I wonder if they still use them today.

314
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,960
 I'm sure they do.

315
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,880
 Nowadays though, you would just go to the doctor.

316
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,800
 Nowadays, you get bit by a rattler, you're like,

317
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,320
 "Better call up my girlfriend and cancel lunch,

318
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,440
 but dinner's still on."

319
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,880
 Because Jason just said,

320
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,720
 "This is going to be a bad afternoon.

321
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,480
 Everything will be fine."

322
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,000
 But it might be.

323
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,080
 Maybe on the way to the doctor's office,

324
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,360
 you're sitting in your car,

325
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 you just take a little stone out of your pocket.

326
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,800
 You're like, "Good thing I boiled--

327
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,560
 Good thing I was already boiling the sweet milk.

328
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,200
 I don't know why.

329
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,400
 I was going to drink it."

330
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,440
 But then you drop your madstone in the boiling sweet milk

331
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,480
 and you just hum a jaunty tune as you head to the emergency room.

332
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,080
 And the toxin is slowly shutting down your respiratory system.

333
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,480
 Interesting, interesting story.

334
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,040
 Ira, let's go ahead and tashi the keys to the carboner copter.

335
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,160
 We are leaving behind Louisiana.

336
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,040
 We are headed on out to Bitterroot Mountains in Montana.

337
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,160
 I want to do a real quick Dead Rabbit Recommend,

338
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,440
 but it's not something I would ever recommend.

339
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,320
 It might be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen.

340
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,600
 And I've seen the movies begotten the holy mountain

341
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,280
 and when blackbirds fly.

342
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,960
 So I have a pretty eye level of bizarre movies.

343
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,920
 And this one might take the cake,

344
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
 but in a way you would never expect.

345
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,040
 I just-- I've had this in my notes for like six months.

346
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,320
 I just have to talk about it.

347
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,960
 It's a lost media?

348
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,440
 Kind of?

349
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,320
 It's a movie called--

350
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,760
 Let me make sure I get the title right,

351
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,400
 because I don't ever really want to think about this movie again.

352
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,000
 I figure once I tell you guys about it,

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,360
 the curse will be lifted.

354
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,320
 There's this-- I watch this--

355
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,120
 I watch the whole thing.

356
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,960
 It's available on Amazon.

357
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,280
 It's called Pity.

358
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,600
 I don't have Perfect Pitch 2.

359
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,000
 And it's a parody of the Pitch Perfect movies,

360
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,240
 which I absolutely can't stand.

361
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,480
 I can't stand those movies.

362
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,360
 Sorry if I just lost nine loyal listeners.

363
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,680
 I'm sorry the nymphettes or whatever the name were.

364
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,560
 Well, what were they called?

365
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,160
 Like the silhouettes or something like that?

366
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,720
 I don't know.

367
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,360
 I don't think--

368
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,120
 I don't think they were called the nymphettes,

369
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,560
 but Pity I Don't Have Perfect Pitch 2

370
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,440
 is a parody.

371
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,600
 It's like an airplane-type movie.

372
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,160
 It's a parody of those movies.

373
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,520
 And it's about the singing cats versus the harmodogs.

374
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,520
 And it's one of the most puzzling movies

375
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,720
 I've ever seen in my life.

376
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,280
 And here's why.

377
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,920
 It's not that the jokes didn't work, and they didn't.

378
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,560
 It's not that the plot was awful, and it was.

379
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,400
 It's a musical.

380
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,320
 You have to see it to believe it.

381
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,240
 I'm going to tell you what it is.

382
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,520
 I'm going to waste two more minutes,

383
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,200
 and then I'm never going to speak of it again.

384
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,160
 It is a musical with no music.

385
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,080
 And it catches you completely off guard,

386
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,320
 because I put it in because I like watching bad movies.

387
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,560
 And I hate Pitch Perfect, so it could be worse

388
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,160
 than a Pitch Perfect parody.

389
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,800
 And they get to the first song, and there's no sound.

390
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,600
 Well, I should be more specific.

391
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,480
 There's no singing.

392
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,640
 You hear a doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot.

393
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,040
 And they're moving their lips, and they're doing this whole dance routine,

394
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,560
 and text appears on the screen, and it goes, "There is no music."

395
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,560
 "There's no music in this movie."

396
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,680
 And you're just watching them dance,

397
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,320
 and then the movie starts back up, and the audio's back,

398
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,440
 and you're like, "What?"

399
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,760
 And then they get to the next musical number.

400
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,920
 There's several of these musical numbers.

401
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,200
 It's a musical.

402
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,840
 There has to be-- this has to happen like 15 times.

403
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,000
 It gets to the next song, and they go,

404
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,280
 "Hit it, girls!"

405
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,200
 And the sound drops, and you hear doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot.

406
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,600
 And more text appears on the screen, and it goes,

407
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,560
 "Here's what happened.

408
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,280
 We originally filmed all of these really, really funny songs for this movie."

409
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,120
 And then doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot.

410
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
 And just-- and then it goes to the next song.

411
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,240
 It's the most compelling movie ever, because you--

412
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,960
 they tell you, "Peace by Pete."

413
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,040
 You don't even pay attention to the plot.

414
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,880
 You can't wait until the next musical number,

415
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,160
 quote unquote musical number, for the sound to cut out.

416
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,840
 You know what they say.

417
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,120
 "We always sit--"

418
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,000
 Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot.

419
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,280
 And it explains this story.

420
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,960
 What happened was they had recorded

421
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,440
 all these parody songs for this musical,

422
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,760
 and when they went to release it,

423
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
 the lawyers for the film company said,

424
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,520
 "Did you get the rights for these parodies?"

425
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,240
 And they said, "No."

426
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,200
 And the lawyers go, "You can't use these songs."

427
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,320
 And they go, "Well, it's musical.

428
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,240
 Like, don't we have, like, fair use?

429
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,840
 Because it's parody and the lawyers are, like,

430
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,640
 absolutely not.

431
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,920
 You have to go get all of this licensing stuff done.

432
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,520
 It's going to cost, like, millions of dollars."

433
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,080
 So then they go, "Well, can we rewrite original songs

434
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,640
 and put them in there and try to make the words match

435
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,840
 what they're lip-syncing?"

436
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,720
 And then they said, "You know what?

437
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,320
 That's just way too much trouble.

438
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,800
 We'll release a musical with no songs."

439
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,960
 It's so bizarre.

440
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,320
 It's one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen.

441
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,920
 It's a treat.

442
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,240
 Like, I watched the whole thing,

443
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,440
 and I can guarantee you,

444
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,840
 had it been a normal, pitch-perfect parody movie,

445
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,240
 and the songs were probably mediocre at best, funny,

446
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,080
 I probably would have shut it off 30 minutes in.

447
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,560
 The fact-- I was sitting on the edge of my seat,

448
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,400
 because they lay it out,

449
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,720
 so they just give you a little bit of information,

450
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,080
 each musical number,

451
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,800
 why there's no music is fascinating.

452
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,720
 So if you want to add a movie to your collection,

453
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,680
 if you want one-of-a-kind movie going experience,

454
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,680
 watch "Pitty I Don't Have Perfect Pitch 2."

455
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,920
 I have to own a physical copy of this,

456
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,800
 because what's going to happen--

457
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,160
 it's on Amazon right now.

458
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,600
 It won't be on Amazon forever,

459
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,080
 because the trailer is geared towards young girls

460
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,680
 who love the pitch-perfect series,

461
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,200
 who love the music and the singing,

462
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
 and they're going to be like,

463
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,960
 "They're going to get their slumber party all together."

464
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,560
 They're like, "Oh, this will be so funny."

465
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,640
 And then they're just, "What? I need to own a copy of this."

466
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,960
 My P.O. box is in the show notes.

467
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,480
 If someone wants to buy me a copy of "Pitty I Don't Have Perfect Pitch 2"

468
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,680
 and send it to me, so weird,

469
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,000
 one of the weirdest movie going experiences I've ever had.

470
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,440
 I'm not joking.

471
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,520
 It ranks up there with the time that I got super-stoned

472
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,680
 and watched "Tommy" for the first time.

473
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,960
 I had no idea what it was about.

474
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,080
 I'm like, "What? This whole movie's about a blind dude?

475
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,000
 Blind dude getting raped while playing pinball?"

476
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,440
 And I'm super-stoned? What is going on?

477
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,760
 "Pitty"-- it ranks up there with that type of movie going experience.

478
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,400
 Dead Rabbit reluctantly recommends--

479
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
 just because it's so bizarre--

480
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 "Pitty I Don't Have Perfect Pitch 2,"

481
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,920
 now available on Amazon,

482
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,760
 but it will be gone soon.

483
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,040
 Ira Onak is flying the Carbentercopter.

484
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,960
 We're listening to the soundtrack of that movie.

485
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,920
 It's just like, "Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo."

486
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,240
 Ira, bring this Carbentercopter nice and low here.

487
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,560
 We're flying over the Bitterroot Mountains in Corvallis, Montana.

488
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,880
 It's July 18th, 2007.

489
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,640
 It's 12 p.m.

490
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,280
 I just found out about the story, I don't know, maybe a day ago,

491
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,960
 and I was like, "This is a story I'm gonna end the week on."

492
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,160
 Barbara Bullock, 55-year-old woman,

493
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,880
 is happily married to her husband, Carl Bullock.

494
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,240
 They're hanging out in the Corvallis, Montana area, just enjoying life.

495
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,840
 Carl's cousin and her friend Jim Ramaker have come to visit.

496
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:01,880
 Spend some time together, enjoy the outdoors, just relaxing.

497
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,320
 July 18th was the day of a scheduled hike,

498
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,120
 and that was supposed to be Barbara leading the way she'd done this hike dozens of times

499
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,480
 up through the Bitterroot Mountains.

500
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,880
 And she was gonna take Jim and Carl's cousin,

501
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,560
 but Carl's cousin, she had a hangover.

502
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,600
 It was kind of a rough night, kicking back some drinks.

503
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,040
 So Barbara goes, "You know what, Jim?

504
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,400
 Let's just do the hike ourselves."

505
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,520
 And Jim's totally fine with it.

506
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,560
 They loaded up their packs, and Barbara was so experienced in this area,

507
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,480
 she knew that she had to watch out for bears.

508
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,360
 So she packed her a 357 magnum, which she always brought with her,

509
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,200
 and they headed off down the trail.

510
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,800
 As they're headed off to the entrance of the trailhead,

511
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,240
 there's a construction crew there, and they're doing their jobs,

512
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,760
 banging stuff into the ground, and hoisting up girders,

513
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,080
 nailing each other's pants to the ground.

514
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,200
 It's hilarious.

515
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,800
 But they walk past the construction crew,

516
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,000
 not really thinking anything of it,

517
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,640
 and they are making their way down this trail.

518
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,040
 Where they're headed is the Bear Creek Overlook area,

519
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,360
 which is gonna provide a scenic view.

520
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,600
 And they're gonna hit that at the end,

521
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
 and then they're gonna come back home.

522
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,360
 And as they're making their way across the trail,

523
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,480
 they run into two other hikers, two dudes,

524
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,400
 and they have this black dog with a little white,

525
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,760
 little bit of white fur on him,

526
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,040
 and they just kind of pass each other.

527
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,240
 Barbara talks to him briefly,

528
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,560
 and Jim kind of looks back, sees Barbara talking to him.

529
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,920
 They continue down the trail.

530
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,600
 Barbara and Jim continue walking down the trail,

531
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,680
 talking and enjoying the solitude of nature,

532
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,280
 and Jim gets to Bear Creek Overlook.

533
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:36,040
 And he looks out, and he sees this gorgeous view of the valley.

534
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,440
 And he looks back, and he sees Barbara coming up behind him.

535
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,320
 He's maybe 20, 30 feet away.

536
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,400
 And then he looks back out to the field.

537
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:58,280
 One minute later, he looks back, and the trail is empty.

538
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:05,160
 One minute passes, and he looks back down the trail.

539
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,720
 Barbara is gone.

540
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,240
 Now Jim's all alone here.

541
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,560
 This is unfamiliar territory for him, but it's a trail.

542
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,160
 It's listed, when you look at the hiking trail guide for the area,

543
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,840
 it's listed as a moderately hard trail to walk.

544
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,960
 So a normal human could do this trail,

545
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,920
 and he's kind of looking around.

546
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,880
 He doesn't see Barbara.

547
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,040
 He knows this is the end of the path,

548
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,400
 and he thinks maybe she must have gone back.

549
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,960
 I mean, she was 30 feet behind me 60 seconds ago.

550
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,440
 Maybe she must have just turned around.

551
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,400
 But he takes a second, and he looks,

552
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,040
 and there's no sign of her in his immediate vicinity.

553
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,280
 He begins walking back down the trail, and he notices something.

554
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,720
 The path is made of loose shale,

555
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,720
 so every footstep makes a lot of noise,

556
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,280
 as the rocks clickety-clack against each other.

557
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,200
 And he realizes something.

558
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,160
 In that minute-long period,

559
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,200
 he just stopped hearing the noise of Barbara walking.

560
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,160
 If she must have turned around and started going the opposite direction,

561
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,920
 she must be right around this bend.

562
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,480
 He continues down the trail,

563
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,200
 and he keeps expecting to see her every time he makes a turn.

564
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,480
 He has a whistle, like a safety whistle.

565
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,880
 He begins blowing it, shouting her name, no response.

566
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,040
 He walks all the way down the trail without a sign of her.

567
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,080
 But he's thinking she must be just a little bit ahead of me.

568
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,200
 She must be a little bit ahead of me.

569
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,800
 She might be at the car.

570
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,920
 She must be at the car.

571
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,840
 He gets all the way down the trail.

572
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,600
 He gets to where the construction workers are,

573
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,440
 and he goes, "Hey, this is going to sound super weird, but

574
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,640
 did you see a woman come out of the forest?"

575
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,320
 The construction workers kind of talk amongst each other,

576
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,640
 because they can tell this guy's agitated at this point.

577
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,080
 He's walked this whole trail, and he has not found Barbara.

578
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,560
 And they say, "The only people we've seen come out of that trail in a while were two dudes and

579
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,120
 their dog."

580
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,640
 And they walked over, and they got in this white van,

581
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,720
 it's kind of like this white truck vehicle, he drove away.

582
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,240
 And he's like, "You did not see a woman walk out."

583
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,000
 They're like, "No, absolutely not."

584
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,280
 Now at this point, panic is completely set in,

585
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,320
 and I'm sure that we've all had that experience,

586
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,480
 where we've been lost or we've lost somebody.

587
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,360
 You're walking around the store, and one of your siblings that you're supposed to be taking care of

588
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,920
 wanders off while you're playing Street Fighter II of the arcade,

589
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,240
 and then you start to get that panicky feeling.

590
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,080
 But you keep thinking, they're right around the corner,

591
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,440
 they're right around the Dig Dug Machine,

592
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,000
 they're hiding behind Dragon's Lair, they're somewhere.

593
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,760
 He got sucked into the Tron world, but and you find them.

594
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,560
 But now he's gotten to this point where she's nowhere.

595
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,320
 They're at the parking lot, she's not in the car,

596
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,200
 so he uses one of the construction workers' cell phones to call authorities.

597
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,320
 And the authorities come out and they ask him,

598
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,720
 "What happened?"

599
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,560
 He goes, "You guys are not going to believe this, I can guarantee you,

600
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,000
 you will not believe this."

601
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,640
 She was 30 feet behind me, she disappeared.

602
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,240
 They go, "How long were you looking ahead?

603
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,480
 How long were you really not aware what was going on?"

604
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,600
 And the estimates range anywhere from 45 seconds to two minutes at most.

605
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,920
 Most accounts say about a minute,

606
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
 but I've seen some people say it was shorter,

607
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,600
 and some people say it was a minute longer.

608
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,800
 But still not enough for somebody to simply slink out of existence.

609
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,920
 The authorities call up her husband, they call up Carl.

610
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,800
 And the authorities seem to just be like,

611
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,240
 "Because it's the park rangers involved,

612
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,640
 they're the ones actually investigating this at this time."

613
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,480
 The park rangers are like, "Listen, we're going to find her,

614
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,280
 don't worry, but maybe you might want to come down here,

615
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,000
 so you know she might be shaken up and stuff like that."

616
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,840
 He goes down there and he tells them,

617
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,000
 "She knows this trail, she might have,

618
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,200
 I don't know what happened,

619
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,600
 but she's been on this trail dozens of times.

620
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,240
 She's such an experienced hiker."

621
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,680
 If she did happen to get lost somehow, she has supplies,

622
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,200
 she has a gun to protect herself,

623
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,520
 because they started asking, do you think a bear could have gotten her?

624
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,240
 And Jim's like, "Well, I don't know how quiet bears are around here,

625
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,040
 but it didn't make any noise if it did."

626
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,720
 I didn't hear anything.

627
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,920
 And the other theory they had was that maybe she fell off,

628
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,600
 maybe she was too close to the edge of a cliff,

629
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,440
 because they're walking around the Bitterroot Mountains,

630
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,160
 they're headed to this overlook that overlooks the valley.

631
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
 And Carl says, "I'm going to tell you something,

632
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,320
 my wife hates heights,

633
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,280
 she has never ever gone near the edge of a cliff."

634
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,520
 Like I used to go hiking with her,

635
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,320
 I had a heart attack,

636
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,920
 that's why I don't go hiking with her anymore,

637
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:52,600
 but she wouldn't get close enough to fall off of a cliff.

638
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,320
 To this day, she has never been found.

639
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,640
 Not a scrap of clothing, not a drop of blood, nothing.

640
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,840
 When the park rangers investigated the area,

641
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,480
 they said there was no sign of disturbance or struggle at all.

642
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,720
 And the obvious answer is Jim did something to take her life.

643
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,520
 But the authorities,

644
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,760
 because eventually the police do get involved in things like that,

645
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,240
 and he's like, "Listen, I 100% know that I look like

646
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,960
 the biggest suspect in the world.

647
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,880
 It was just me and her in the middle of nowhere,

648
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,080
 and she disappeared.

649
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,840
 I will do a polygraph right now,

650
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,520
 I will cooperate whatever.

651
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,360
 I did not do it."

652
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,960
 And the kind of the consensus is,

653
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,920
 that would be the worst alibi ever.

654
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,560
 To murder someone,

655
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,000
 and then your alibi is,

656
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,160
 well I guess she just vanished.

657
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,800
 I guess she just disappeared behind me.

658
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,360
 I think another interesting part of the mystery is the two men.

659
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,160
 Because some people are thinking that the two men snatch her.

660
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,480
 That the two men have anything to do with her disappearance.

661
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,600
 The police want to talk to these guys.

662
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,760
 They said, "We don't think they're suspects,

663
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,880
 we just want to talk to them."

664
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,600
 Because really they would be the only two other people

665
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,400
 who could say what Jim and Barbara's mood was.

666
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,520
 Because even though they've ruled out Jim as a suspect,

667
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,000
 that doesn't mean that he's not.

668
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,400
 And if they can get hold of these two guys,

669
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,280
 and they're like, "Yeah Jim was acting really weird around Barbara."

670
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,440
 And when she stopped to talk to us,

671
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,200
 she goes, "Hey, what are you guys up to?"

672
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,800
 And she's like, "Hey, this guy's acting kind of weird."

673
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,600
 We don't know if any of that was said,

674
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,160
 because we can't find the other two people.

675
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,000
 There was a $10,000 reward.

676
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Not for their arrest.

677
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,240
 Most of the time when you see an award,

678
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,280
 it's for their arrest and conviction.

679
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,160
 Which takes years and years and years.

680
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,080
 And if they get arrested and they don't get convicted,

681
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,800
 you don't get an award.

682
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,960
 Whenever they're like $50,000 for the arrest and conviction,

683
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,920
 that's all and so on.

684
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:02,200
 They were willing to pay $10,000 just to know these people's names.

685
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,000
 They said they are not suspects, we just want to talk to them.

686
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,520
 These two people, their dog and their car,

687
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
 have never been identified, ever.

688
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,200
 And the construction workers and Jim gave detailed description.

689
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,360
 They have detailed description of both people,

690
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,880
 a drawing of one of them.

691
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,680
 They have a photo of a dog that looks like the dog.

692
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,400
 And it says their dog had a little bit of white fur on it

693
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,320
 and a photo of the type of car they had.

694
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,840
 The $10,000 has never been claimed.

695
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,240
 These two people have also disappeared off the face of the earth.

696
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,040
 Because if someone was offering $10,000 for my identity,

697
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,080
 I would be like, "It's me, it's me, Jason Carpenter,

698
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,880
 give me my money."

699
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,000
 They, these people just disappeared off the face of the earth.

700
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,360
 You go, "Jason, maybe they were murderers,

701
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,240
 maybe a little murderers, they're not going to go and talk to the police maybe."

702
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,400
 But again, no sign of a struggle.

703
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:59,240
 Where did Barbara Bolik go?

704
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,800
 It's been 14 years since she disappeared.

705
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,200
 Where did she go?

706
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,920
 Now, I know a lot of people are probably listening to this

707
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,040
 and thinking, "Missing 411, that's a conspiracy theory

708
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,640
 that there is some sort of unknown force in the national parks of America

709
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:27,400
 that's kidnapping people and either depositing their bodies in remote parts of the forest,

710
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,080
 or the body's never being seen again."

711
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,960
 I think the phenomenon behind Missing 411,

712
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,560
 I don't know if it's a national thing,

713
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,360
 I do, we do know people go missing in forests.

714
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,280
 I have my own questions about Missing 411 as a cohesive conspiracy theory,

715
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,960
 as people, some people would just go missing 411.

716
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,440
 When someone goes missing in the woods, they'll go missing 411.

717
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,880
 But what they don't understand is Missing 411 never answers the what.

718
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,040
 There's been theories, some of it is the government's training,

719
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,800
 there are people in camouflage suits,

720
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,960
 I've heard that theory bandied around and that doesn't explain why they're depositing toddlers

721
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,680
 on the tops of cliffs where some like kids been found.

722
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,360
 Sometimes it's Bigfoot, David Paul Lades,

723
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
 his original theory was that it was Bigfoot,

724
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,800
 and as Missing 411 got more popular, he kind of pushed that to the side.

725
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,720
 Now it's just some sort of force,

726
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,040
 but I don't know if I buy it as a whole,

727
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,920
 like every missing person in the woods is missing 411.

728
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:28,440
 That's just such a, that's like saying every possible alien story,

729
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,920
 it's graze, it's graze, it's graze, all the way down it's graze,

730
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,520
 and I think you lose a bit of the nuance to it.

731
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:40,440
 But a Missing 411 type phenomenon falling into another dimension,

732
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,080
 walking through some sort of unseen portal,

733
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,480
 that wouldn't cause a disturbance, it would be silent,

734
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,200
 some sort of unknown cryptid in the area.

735
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,400
 There were calls to the police when the police were asking for help from the community.

736
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,200
 People were talking about a Phantom Mountain Man,

737
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,480
 they believe that a Phantom Mountain Man in the area got her.

738
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,440
 I couldn't find any other reference to this,

739
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,480
 that was kind of an aside in a true crime article,

740
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,280
 they weren't really talking about any sort of paranormal angle,

741
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
 and I don't know if that meant a literal Phantom,

742
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,640
 like a Ghost Mountain Man,

743
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,360
 or just a Mountain Man in, that's a human,

744
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,040
 that's been hunting the Bitterroot Mountains all this time and can move silently.

745
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,880
 Couldn't find it, that's an interesting theory,

746
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,400
 but I couldn't find anything else on that,

747
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,000
 there were some locals saying that was true.

748
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,960
 But I wanted to end this story with this.

749
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,000
 A lot of times when we end these episodes,

750
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,800
 a lot of times when we just think about these stories in general,

751
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,160
 outside of the podcast, we think,

752
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,680
 "Man, what happened to that woman?"

753
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,600
 She dead, is her bones somewhere in the woods,

754
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,960
 just completely undiscovered.

755
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,040
 Was she taken to some Mountain Man's hobo shack,

756
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,440
 and was kept alive for as long as he pleased,

757
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
 and then eventually gutted?

758
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,680
 Did she pass into another dimension?

759
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,840
 Has she spent the last 14 years in some sort of world,

760
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,440
 some other place in time that would be unrecognizable to us?

761
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,680
 And we can imagine that, and we can fear that,

762
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,800
 and we can pull out all sorts of scenarios,

763
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,120
 about what could have happened paranormal or otherwise.

764
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,640
 But you know what really stuck out to me about this story?

765
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,920
 Is imagine not if you were Barbara, imagine if you were Jim.

766
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:25,320
 Would you ever feel safe again?

767
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,920
 Would you ever be able to find any sort of comfort in your life,

768
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:40,520
 knowing that someone disappeared off the face of the Earth within one minute?

769
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,000
 She'd been accidentally shot by a hunter,

770
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,680
 or tumbled off a cliff, or fell into a sinkhole.

771
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,920
 That would also be terrible,

772
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,240
 but you could rationalize that in some sort of way.

773
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,080
 You may wonder, "Why not me?"

774
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,600
 You may have survivor guilt.

775
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:04,600
 But that's all realistic, that's all just bad luck.

776
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:13,800
 But to know that you were 30 feet away from another human who ceased to exist,

777
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:21,160
 and 14 years later it is unknown where that person is or what happened to them,

778
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,520
 how could you possibly sleep at night?

779
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,840
 Every time someone you loved was out of your field of vision,

780
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,000
 you would have to think they're not coming back.

781
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,840
 Now see, we don't have that.

782
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,200
 We don't have that mindset.

783
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,440
 I think the worst we can have is if we live in bad areas,

784
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,600
 we could think, "My dad's going to work today, I hope he makes it back home."

785
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,120
 And that's bad enough.

786
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,360
 That's a terrible enough feeling to go through.

787
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,400
 But imagine if your dad's like,

788
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,160
 "Hey, I'm going to go into the kitchen and get some milk,"

789
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,520
 and you're like, "Lord, please protect him, please protect him,

790
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,000
 because once he leaves your field of vision, he may cease to exist.

791
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,720
 He may never be seen again."

792
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:19,240
 Barbara Bolik disappeared, but Jim's story is never ending.

793
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,920
 I don't see how he can get a moment of comfort for the rest of his life.

794
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:38,760
 Knowing at any moment reality can snap, and someone 30 feet behind him could disappear.

795
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:46,040
 And Jim also has to realize that at any moment, he may be the one who vanishes.

796
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,520
 If it happened once, it can happen again.

797
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,000
 And whether he's deep on a trail in the Bitterroot Mountains,

798
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,360
 or just laying in bed another sleepless night trying to forget what happened,

799
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,720
 at any moment he could also vanish.

800
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:17,240
 He'll become a mystery, but at least then he'll know what happened to Barbara.
