00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
 When a young bicyclist is hit by a car, he fears the worst.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.920
 I mean, he can't get much worse than that, right?

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.160
 But he fears the worst.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.360
 He's afraid that he's dead.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.440
 And he does die.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.440
 Or does he?

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.520
 I mean, obviously he's still alive if there's some sort of story attached to it, but where

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.240
 did he go when he died?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.560
 It's a pretty crazy, pretty crazy near-death experience.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.800
 And then we travel to Florida to take a look at a murder mystery that has

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.200
 many moving pieces.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.040
 When the police get a phone call that a man has been sitting in a lawn chair for the past

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.560
 two days, not even moving when a thunderstorm rolled in, they have no idea they're about

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:51.760
 to uncover a grisly web of murder and madness today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:02.840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.000
 I'm your host Jason Garpin, and I'm having a great day.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.120
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the week, and I can't believe I haven't mentioned

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.120
 this yet.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.920
 I am so stoked about the movie Smile.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.680
 I'm gonna go see it opening night.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 I cannot wait.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.480
 How did I forget to just talk about it every single episode this week?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.480
 That movie looks dope.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.440
 I'm gonna put the trailer in the show notes.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.440
 I cannot wait.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.640
 I also couldn't wait to see Barbarian, and now that turned out to be a good one.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.280
 I'm still thinking about doing a movie review.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.760
 Barbarian was so ridiculous.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.040
 Great directing, great writing, amazing acting, like everything worked, and then the monster

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040
 showed up.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 It was so dumb.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.400
 Do you guys know anything about Barbarian?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.840
 I'll pause and wait for you all to answer or wait for you to email.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.400
 Yes, oh man.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 So what?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.400
 At the end I was like, huh, that's it?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.160
 Anyways, we'll talk about that some other time.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.280
 Maybe I'll just include something at the end of this episode.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.320
 I almost have to get it off my chest.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 My feelings about Barbarian.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 But I can't wait for Smile.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.200
 I cannot wait for that movie.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.880
 Someone else who I can't wait for, if I made him wait that long to get his name mentioned,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.800
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.400
 Time supporter of the show, Give It Up for Jonathan Vaca.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.360
 Yeah, come on in Jonathan.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.680
 He's walking in with a big smile on his face.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.760
 Have you guys seen that?

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.840
 The reviews I've seen for Smile, I'm all pushing Jonathan out of the way.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.200
 I was like, I want to talk more about Smile.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200
 I love you dude.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.600
 But the thing, I've read the reviews for Smile and the reviews that I've seen are,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.280
 the trailer lives up to the movie.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.040
 Because the trailer is so good.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.400
 It's almost like it's own little short horror movie.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400
 Like the trailer alone works.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.200
 Like the music works and the mystery works and the creepiness works.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200
 Can't wait to see it.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 Okay come back over here Jonathan.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.280
 Sorry I'm going to piss you out of the way the guy who pays me money.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.560
 Jonathan you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.760
 Just help spread the word about the show.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.400
 That really, really helps out a lot.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 Jonathan, he's not smiling.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.200
 He's still up so that I've pushed him out of the way.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.600
 Jonathan, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the hair hydrofoil.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 That might be a vehicle.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.800
 I might have just made it up and I don't remember.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.080
 Let's zoom on out of Dead Rabbit Command.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.600
 We're headed all the way out to Chile.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.800
 I'm pretty sure we haven't used the hair hydrofoil before.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840
 It's like what sound does a hydrofoil make?

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.040
 I didn't even know hydrofoils existed until a toy, a G.I. Joe toy came out of one.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.600
 We're driving on out there.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.320
 Jonathan is the best captain in the world.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.720
 We're headed out to Santiago, Chile.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.440
 It's May 1st, 1982.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.600
 A sunny spring afternoon.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.880
 JF is the name that this guy goes by.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.880
 Probably like an anonymous report, right?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.360
 We're going to go ahead and call him Jacob.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.200
 So Jacob and one of his friends, they're riding their bikes through town.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.560
 When a car comes out of nowhere and smashes into both of these kids.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.440
 Whoa!

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.600
 They're flying in the air.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.320
 According to this report, you know generally what we're going to report about near-death

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.200
 experiences.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 I don't know.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.600
 I don't know much about physics, but when you start off with something that sounds like

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.400
 an exaggeration, it does make you go, "Ah."

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.240
 According to Jacob, when the car hit his bike, he flew 150 feet in the air.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.040
 Not straight up, which would be pretty fun, but like, "Latitudally."

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.000
 If that's a word I'm not for sure.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 He flies away.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 You know what you mean?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 He flew.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 You can't figure out the word.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 What would be the word?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.680
 If when you hit a baseball and it flies in a straight line, that's the word I was looking

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.560
 for, he flew in a straight line 150 feet.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.800
 That sounds like an exaggeration.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.520
 I don't know how fast this car was going, but apparently he's like, "Whoa!"

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.400
 And he's like flying 150 feet.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.040
 And he actually, this is a very, an occurrence at Al Creek Bridge type moment.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.640
 So as he's flying through the air, Jacob has a thought in his head.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.960
 Jacob realizes he's in no pain.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.960
 He's feeling absolutely no pain as he is moving at such a high velocity towards, who knows

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960
 what, right?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.600
 Three stumps, another car, another car driving the opposite direction.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.800
 He starts getting ping-ponged back and forth.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.160
 What he realizes is he's not feeling any pain as he's flying through the air.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.540
 He also realizes that he's no longer in his body.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:59.360
 It's now Jacob's soul flying through the air.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.720
 Whoa.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.760
 And while his soul is removed from his body, all of a sudden this light seems to shine

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.760
 from somewhere.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.560
 And these two figures appear.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.480
 The next thing he knows, he's standing in an illuminated room.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.480
 What?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480
 Where am I?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.360
 I thought I was just about to get smashed into all of this stuff.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.120
 I thought I was going to play pinball with my own body.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.840
 He's standing in this room, this illuminated room.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.880
 When he looks down at the floor, he sees Earth.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.960
 Now not like he looks down, I said that wrong.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.760
 I'm really striking out on the story, like, "Jayson, I can do that."

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.760
 When I look down, I see Earth.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760
 No.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.640
 He looks down at the floor and he sees the planet Earth.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.160
 Like he's in a UFO.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.560
 You're like, "Whoa, that's not what I expected."

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560
 Yeah.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.240
 He's in a UFO.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.600
 And he realizes that he can look down and he can see Earth.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.920
 His body, his physical form is somewhere still on the planet.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.520
 He's simply a bean made out of nothing but light.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.080
 And the two beans, the two figures that he saw earlier, put him on a stretcher.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.040
 And he immediately begins to feel heat all over his body.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.520
 They then begin to do something.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.480
 He doesn't really have a description for what they did, but he said they begin to do

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.680
 something to my head.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.000
 And he realized, they didn't say this, but he realized that what they were doing was

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.560
 necessary for him to stay alive.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.160
 So this is really interesting.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.560
 He's not in his physical form anymore.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.760
 He knows he's not in his physical form, but he has some sort of humanoid form in this

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.000
 being of light.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.880
 He's nothing but pure light.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.160
 And he still has arms and legs and a head, and he can still identify them.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.960
 And even though his body is somewhere on Earth, as they're manipulating things in his soul,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.200
 right, as they're working on his soul, it is healing his physical form.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.680
 That's kind of what he's seen.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.920
 That's kind of what he's sensing that they have to do this for him to stay alive.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.800
 He is then taken from this illuminated room to a city.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.880
 Not a city on Earth, but some sort of alien landscape.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.920
 And he's wearing pajamas now.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920
 He's walking around.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.920
 He's walking around.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.320
 He's like, "Oh man, I thought the afterlife was going to be way cooler.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.680
 Now I'm just a little prince."

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.920
 He's walking around in pajamas.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.240
 I'm assuming he's still made of nothing but light at this point, but he has like Denver

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.320
 the dinosaur pajamas.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.560
 He's walking around in these pajamas, and he's walking through the city, and he's taken

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.480
 to this thing he describes as a large object.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.440
 And this almost seems to be different from the rest of the city.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.960
 Like he can identify it as something different.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.240
 So this might be another vessel, another UFO type craft.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:05.360
 He's brought aboard this object, this vessel, and there he sees other people, other humans.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:13.080
 And he describes them as they're all in various states of dying.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.200
 Some are near death.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.280
 Some are just starting the process of dying.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.640
 I don't know if there's any like decayed people laying there, but various states of

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.120
 dying.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.760
 And then he's taken out of there, out of this vessel.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.320
 That's great for your tour, right?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.800
 They're like, "Hey, would you like to see the dying human exhibit?"

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.440
 You're like, "No, I don't want to go see that at all."

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:42.880
 He's then taken out of that object, out of that place, to another city full of dinosaurs.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.920
 Let me explain that a little better.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.640
 I love that visual.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.720
 They weren't actual dinosaurs.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.240
 You're all excited.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.240
 You're like, "Woohoo!

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.520
 In the afterlife, I get a ride of prontosaurus and slide down its neck."

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.360
 I paused at just the right part.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.600
 He saw dinosaur-like animals.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.080
 They're like, "Knock off dollar store dinosaurs."

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.440
 It's like the triceratops, but the horns are in the wrong place.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.480
 He has four of them, which would still be pretty dope, right?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.680
 You went somewhere and you saw like a derpy T-Rex.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.680
 It's still a T-Rex.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.240
 You're like, "Well, those arms are too long.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.240
 That's not a T-Rex."

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240
 And its eyes look wobbly.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.160
 It's still a dinosaur.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.040
 Who cares if it's dinosaur-adjacent?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.920
 It's still super dope.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.480
 I also left off another key word.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.600
 What did you fix?

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600
 This show is falling apart.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.960
 Man, we just have to admit it at a certain point.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.440
 This show has become a circus side show.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440
 This podcast, I love it.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.440
 It's hilarious.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.080
 But anyways, I'm like pausing at certain moments to get your hopes up on why.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.960
 He goes to this place with dinosaur knockoffs.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.640
 They're dinosaur-like animals and they're tiny.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.880
 They're like the size of domesticated animals.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.480
 So you would see like a T-Rex, but it would be say the size of a horse.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.360
 And it tries seratops to be the size of a cat.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.160
 He doesn't give the exact specifications.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.320
 Which sure, that's not as cool as like a giant brontosaurus, but I would be digging a brontosaurus

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.280
 like the size of a camel.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.280
 That'd be pretty cool.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.760
 I mean, don't try sliding down its neck.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.880
 It probably can't support your weight there.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.400
 She can still ride it around.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.640
 You can still, you know, wrestle with a T-Rex.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.840
 Dude, that stuff, he can't.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.240
 They don't let him have any fun.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.280
 It's off to the next exhibit.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.080
 He sees all these domesticated dinosaur-like creatures walking around this town.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:43.240
 And the beans, these beans who I think at this point would be fair to say they're alien,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.200
 this is so fascinating to me.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.520
 They tell him it's not his time to die.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:57.800
 He actually has, like thousands of other earthlings, a mission to complete.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.360
 You have to go back to Earth and you have to complete this mission.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.880
 But they don't really tell him what the mission is.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.520
 They just say he has a purpose on Earth.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.840
 They put an implant in his brain.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.280
 They begin to tell him things like, "We have bases all over Earth."

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.240
 Yeah, so it's clearly alien at this point, right?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.680
 They have bases all over Earth.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.840
 Like the alien presence on Earth is real and they're pretty well established on the planet.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.120
 And then another really interesting thing happens.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.840
 So, because we've covered a lot of near-death experiences on this and I always try to find

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.160
 the weirdest of the weird.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.880
 They put an implant in his head and he begins to bilocate.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.240
 He begins to appear in two places at once.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.360
 Now not like he's on one side of the room and he's waving at himself on the other side

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.720
 of the room.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.560
 He specifically says, "So when they put that implant in my brain and they are still talking

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.800
 to me, all of a sudden I'm in different places all at the same time."

00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:02.360
 He goes, "I was standing in the middle of Africa and at the same time I was in the Pleiades

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.280
 star system."

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.160
 The next thing Jacob knows, he's back in his body on Earth, his physical form, and

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:19.000
 both him and his friend fully recovered from the accident.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 It's an interesting story.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.600
 I got it from one of my favorite resources on this show, think about it, docs.com.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:31.800
 They got it from a group known as the Federation of UFO Logical Research of Chile.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:38.040
 And the head researcher of this particular story was Juan Gilmero Aguilera Rodriguez.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.040
 It's a fascinating look at near-death experience, right?

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.000
 It's not just him dying and his soul even his body.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.200
 We have alien involvement.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200
 We have dinosaurs.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.520
 The dinosaurs are really dope.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:57.160
 And this idea, this by-location thing, which is, I mean, like really, this is where you

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.840
 get into a lot of mysticism.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.480
 This is where you even move past paranormal into a lot of mystical thinking.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.800
 How big is the universe really?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.160
 We can look at these huge distances and go, "Well, that's 50 light years away.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.240
 We would have to travel at the speed of light for 50 years to get there.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.720
 And we can't travel at the speed of light.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.960
 Nothing can travel at the speed of light.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.480
 So we can only travel near the speed of light, which is a huge difference.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.720
 Speed of light, near speed of light.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.840
 There's a huge gulf there.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.440
 So this is so far away.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.980
 But when you look at the metaphysics, when you look at this, they've done experiments

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.980
 on this.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.420
 And science, some people say the science is real dodgy on this, but you can take an atom

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.000
 and you can have it in two locations at the same time.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.080
 And when you manipulate it here, it will register that it's being lit up over here.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.800
 Like they'll both light up at the same time because it's the same atom in two different

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.960
 places.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.440
 And if you grabbed one atom, you're actually, it's not two atoms.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.000
 It's one.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.260
 It's one thing, but you can actually see it in two different places.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.420
 How is that even possible?

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.340
 And if you, let's say that one appeared to be on the left side of the room and one appeared

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.940
 to be on the right side of the room.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:18.700
 If you grab the one on the right side of the room, it's the same one.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.700
 You could pick it up and you'd pick up quote unquote both of them.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.980
 So we've looked at stuff like this just as a metaphysical community.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.660
 I don't know if we really talked about it on the show so much.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:35.120
 So the question is, if all of matter came out of a singular point, i.e. the Big Bang

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.960
 type of event, then everything is connected.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.000
 There's no difference between me and an asteroid flying through deep space right now.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.840
 Like technically there's a bunch of people shaking their heads right now.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.920
 They're like, okay, that's not what the metaphysical theory is saying bro.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.800
 Like you need to re, we're all from the same.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.240
 There is no distance.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.420
 There's zero distance whatsoever.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.180
 And that would explain a lot of stuff like with aliens flying around the universe.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:10.620
 Like I honestly think when we discovered the secret of alien technology, when we, I don't

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.660
 think the universe is, I think it's as big as we register it as.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:18.820
 I do think it's X many miles, millions of miles wide or billions or whatever.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.860
 But it's not that far.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.520
 I don't, I think it's that big, but it's not that far.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.240
 If that makes sense, like you have to think two things are kind of true at the same time.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.920
 Once we realize the aliens aren't getting in a ship and being like it's 50 light years

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.160
 away guys, we're say goodbye to our families.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.480
 We'll never see them again.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.360
 They get here incredibly fast.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.640
 Once we realize whether they're creating their own wormholes or they're bending time space

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.120
 or they're staying in one location and moving the universe around them, whatever theory you

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:55.900
 want to have, when we figure it out, we're going to be like, I can't, but that's so simple.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.900
 It's the simplest thing.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.620
 I think the same way when we have air flight now, when we figured out planes, we're going,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.020
 oh yeah, no, we can mass produce planes.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:11.100
 It took humanity thousands of years to get to a workable airplane.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.020
 And now you can build one with the right tools in your backyard because it's so simple.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.100
 When you think of the science behind it, it's so simple.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.100
 You know what I mean?

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.440
 Once we figure out the science, it will be wrote.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.520
 It'll just be something that's done.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:32.440
 And I am a fan of the idea that the universe is folded up in such a way that I can look

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.320
 and see something really far away, but really I can be in both places at the same time.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.000
 I may be in both places at the same time right now.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.400
 I don't know.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400
 It's trippy.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400
 It's trippy.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.400
 What is time?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.600
 What is space?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.080
 What are all of these things?

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.060
 And this guy dies, really, his soul leaves his body, and the aliens fix them.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.060
 And it's interesting.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.900
 It's a good parallel to yesterday's story, right, where I said that aliens were a bunch

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:03.020
 of jerks who were walking into the mentally disabled households and walking into elderly

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.740
 care centers and stuff like that and abducting people who wouldn't remember it anyways.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.980
 And kind of being to them as this horrible jerk race, which they very well could be.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.220
 They do do a lot of bad stuff, but I thought this was an interesting story in contrast

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.220
 to that.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.220
 Aliens did heal him, right?

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.920
 And that was kind of what I was saying yesterday.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.120
 How come the aliens, if they're abducting these people who have physical disabilities,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.280
 how come they aren't healing those disabilities?

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.280
 It's interesting.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.160
 It's a whole interesting phenomenon on why they do what they do and how they do it and

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.280
 do they exist, right?

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.280
 Is it alien?

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.440
 Is it interdimensional?

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.600
 Is it angelic or demonic or something that we can't even put a word to?

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.320
 Are there dinosaurs?

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.880
 Are there dinosaurs?

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:47.940
 All of this stuff, fascinating story, blending the near death experience with the alien reality.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.940
 Absolutely fascinating.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.540
 I'm glad I could share it with you.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.060
 Jonathan, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.940
 We're leaving behind Santiago Chili.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.380
 We're gonna hit a couple of bicyclists.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.740
 We're like, don't worry, you guys will have a fun experiment in space as we're bumping

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.020
 into them and taking off.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.940
 We're leaving behind Santiago Chili.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.540
 Take us all the way out to South Dade County, Florida.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:20.320
 It's July 21st, 1973, and we're in South Dade County, Florida.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:27.040
 And there's a man known as Albert Burst, 44 year old building inspector, sitting outside

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.040
 in his backyard.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.640
 Got his little lawn chair propt up.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:43.900
 Getting down, comfortably enjoying another hot, swampy Florida summer day.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.860
 But his next door neighbor, she's taking the laundry off the line.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:56.140
 And she looks over and she sees Albert just sitting in the chair, you know, just relaxing.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:04.560
 But when a thunderstorm starts to roll in, begins to rain, she notices that Albert's

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:13.960
 still just sitting in that chair, not moving, not even flinching as the rain splatters against

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:19.120
 his face.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.560
 She mentions it to her son.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.880
 She's like, Albert, next door, he's just sitting there.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.880
 It's raining.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.700
 That's weird.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.380
 And her son goes, yeah, it is weird.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.940
 He actually has been sitting back there for two days straight now.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.940
 What?

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.940
 Yeah, yeah, he's been back there for two days.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.660
 I probably should have told you something at least a day ago.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.680
 He's been sitting out there for two days straight.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.180
 Look back over the fence.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.300
 And there's Albert just sitting there.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.460
 Rain pouring down on him.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.680
 The neighbor calls the police and says, I think there's a dead man in the garden next

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680
 door.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.880
 I think you need to come take a look.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.520
 Let's go back a week earlier.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:11.400
 And we're going to meet a young woman named Mary Ellen Jones.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.520
 She's 15 years old.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.560
 She's hitchhiking through Florida with her boyfriend, Mark Mattson.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.960
 And I use the word boyfriend.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.920
 I mean, it's technically true, but they had just met the day before.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.260
 This was a whirlwind romance if there ever has been one.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.420
 They met each other on a beach.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:36.080
 And now they're hitchhiking together through Florida, ready to start life together, or

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.260
 maybe just have a good time.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.020
 And as they're hitchhiking down the road, a car pulls up.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.600
 There's a middle-aged man driving it.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.940
 His name is Eric.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.600
 He's more than willing to pick up this young couple and take them to where they want to

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.000
 go.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.480
 He ended up taking the young couple back to his house.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.440
 And it does seem like this was all consensual.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440
 This was part of the plan.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.480
 It would be a nice place to stay the night, and then they would continue the journey the

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.120
 next day.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:12.000
 But when Eric gets this young couple to his home, he pulls a gun out.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 At gunpoint.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.820
 He's pointing it at Mark, pointing it at Mary, back to Mark, threatening these two young

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.020
 people.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:30.620
 He forces them to take their clothes off, and then forces them to have sex with each other.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:36.180
 And as he's sitting there watching this young couple have sex, he has another part of his

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.260
 plan.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:44.980
 He goes and gets a camera, and while holding the gun, he tries to steady the camera and

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:51.620
 begins to snap photos of these young people having sex.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.980
 But he just can't get it right.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.580
 It would be very difficult to try to hold the gun and use one of those old 1970s cameras

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.060
 at the same time.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.960
 So he puts the gun down.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.280
 He's so caught up in the fantasy of what's going on, the fantasy that he's made of reality.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.060
 He puts the gun down, and with both hands begins snapping these photos that he's going

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.260
 to save for later.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:21.380
 Mark sees the gun has been placed down and makes a move for it.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.700
 But Eric is faster.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:33.940
 He grabs the gun and shoots Mark three times, killing him right in front of Mary.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:41.640
 Eric then grabs Mary and forces her down the hallway towards his bedroom.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:53.120
 Inside Eric's bedroom, there's a hidden door that when opened reveals a soundproof room

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.880
 with arm shackles on the wall.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:06.460
 Eric takes Mary into this room, shackles her to the wall, and for the next 24 hours keeps

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:17.660
 her as a sex slave in his soundproof room in this seemingly normal looking suburban home.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:27.860
 But after 24 hours pass, Eric undoes the shackles and tells Mary, "I'm going to let

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:34.760
 you go on the condition that you don't tell anybody about what happened here.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.280
 Can you do that for me?"

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:43.960
 Mary of course says yes and is let go.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.680
 She's shocked, right?

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.320
 She'd watched this man already kill Mark.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.680
 She feared the worst.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.960
 She endured the worst.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:01.060
 She goes straight to the police.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.580
 She tells them the story and the police are like, "Wait, what?

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.980
 I guess that's possible.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.980
 We are police.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:08.980
 We do see horrible things."

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.820
 But they don't know whether or not to believe her.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.020
 Really they just have this 15 year old girl running into their police office telling this

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.260
 outlandish story.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:24.020
 A guy makes you two have sex and he's taking photos of it.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.260
 So they call up her mom.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.640
 Her mom in Kentucky.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.240
 They call up her mom and they go, "Hey, we have your daughter here.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.720
 We think she ran away and she's telling us this story."

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.400
 And the mom goes, "Stop, just stop right there.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.840
 Listen, my daughter's a pathological liar.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.360
 Whatever story she's telling you isn't true.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.160
 Glad you got my daughter.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.900
 I'll send down money for a bus ticket and send her back up."

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:53.840
 So the police send Mary off to her mom.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.400
 And they figure, it's just all made up, it's just pathological liar making up this insane

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.540
 story.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:06.200
 On July 21st, the police are called to the home of Albert Burst.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:13.180
 And sure enough, he's been sitting in his backyard dead for two days.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.240
 So they call in a meat wagon.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.280
 I don't think that's the technical term for him.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.780
 They're going to take him down to have an autopsy done to figure out what it could be.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.600
 44 is really too young for a heart attack, right?

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.200
 He looks relatively healthy.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.240
 Someone down to figure out what it could have been.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.280
 And as he's headed down to the corner, the police go into his house.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.440
 See if they can uncover anything there that could have led to his death.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.960
 And once they enter the house, the first thing they smell is the overwhelming stench of rotten

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.680
 meat.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.560
 They follow the smell to the bathroom.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.840
 When they walk into the bathroom, they notice that one of the bathroom walls appears to

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.840
 be bleeding.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.520
 So they're not spooky, they're not scared of ghosts, right?

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.440
 They don't think they're spooky, spooky ghosts, maybe one or two of them did.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.360
 They go, let's cut into this wall because we can smell rotten meat.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.400
 We got a dead man out there.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.300
 There's probably a dead man behind this wall.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:19.680
 So they actually have to piece by piece break down this cement slab that has been placed

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.480
 in this bathroom wall.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:26.040
 And as they're breaking it, the smell becomes even more overpowering.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.520
 And they're finally able to get a good grip and tear a chunk of it away.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:41.240
 And inside the wall is the headless, handless, footless corpse of Mark Mattson.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.920
 And although they don't immediately recognize this as Mark Mattson, because they don't know

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.440
 what he looks like, they start to think about that story that young girl told him, just

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:58.680
 a week ago, about a man who took them to a house in the suburbs of Miami and shot somebody

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.600
 and then raped her.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:08.680
 They decide to go check out the bedroom of Eric, who they are very quickly putting together,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.200
 was not a real name.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:16.440
 Eric actually was Albert Burst.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:25.200
 And when they go into Albert's bedroom, they do find the soundproof sex room.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.480
 They now know that the girl's story was true.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.920
 They now know that Albert was Eric and Albert is a murderer.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:39.360
 The question is, who killed Albert?

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.680
 Albert Burst didn't have many friends, but the people that he didn't know regarded him

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.480
 as an extremely smart individual.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.040
 He just was very intolerant of other people, of pretty much everything.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.760
 He hated his way through life.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.200
 He had a criminal record from when he was much younger.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.520
 He spent some time in jail.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.400
 And he just kind of floated through life, right?

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.000
 But he was angry at it.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.240
 And he kept a journal.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:16.000
 He wrote down his thoughts, his fears, his desires.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 This is so fascinating.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Let's take a look at some of these quotes from this journal.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.120
 He wrote, quote, "Rape, murder, suicide.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.080
 These thoughts are constantly with me.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.620
 Of course, this is not mentally healthy.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:45.180
 There is no doubt that by present standards, I am mentally ill, a hopeless sociopath."

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.460
 He craved the companionship of a woman.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:54.500
 But he couldn't see himself on equal footing with a woman.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.520
 He didn't want someone around where they could sit and talk, someone they could go on walks

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.140
 with, someone that he could argue with, "Where are we going to go to dinner?

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.620
 What are we going to watch tonight?"

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.940
 That wasn't his goal.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.660
 He didn't want a woman.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.660
 He wanted a woman.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.780
 She had to be controlled by him.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.860
 She had to be willing to be a slave to him.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:27.540
 But he couldn't find any woman willing in taking up that offer.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:33.460
 He states that at the age of 44, he was still a virgin.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:42.840
 He had lived his entire life not being able to have what he wanted more than anything.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:48.540
 He wrote in his journal, quote, "After work, I always get home as soon as possible to enjoy

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:54.700
 my solitary sanctuary and its music and books and TV.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.660
 No sex yet, but I'm working on it.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.580
 Slowly, with determined resolve.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.620
 I know what I want.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.180
 I need someone for sex.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.340
 Yes."

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:12.660
 But not an idiot I have to cater to.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.980
 Enter the Bruce-Dian solution.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:22.260
 The Bruce-Dian solution named after Albert "Bruce" -- if I've mispronounced it a couple

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.100
 times, I apologize, you're Googling Albert...

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.100
 You're Googling Albert Birst.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.900
 You're like, "What a fantastic story.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:30.900
 Who is this guy?"

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.100
 But this guy doesn't exist.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.180
 Albert "Brust" -- I'll try to go in and edit those up.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.180
 I'll clean it up a bit.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.180
 Albert "Brust" -- Albert "Burst"?

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:45.980
 I'm glad I can have such a good belly laugh during this otherwise terrifying story.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:52.420
 Albert "Brust" is the author of the "Brustian" solution, and the "Brustian" solution was

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:59.700
 to "Knappa Woman" and to lock her in his sex slave torture room.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:05.180
 What is so fascinating about this story is this is something he longed for years.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:10.140
 He was obsessed with murder, he was obsessed with kidnapping a woman and making her his

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.860
 slave.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.860
 This was what he wanted.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.660
 He didn't want someone he had to cater to, he didn't want a woman he would have to talk

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.900
 to or do anything else with.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:28.260
 He just wanted a slave, and when he finally got it, he snatched that woman off the street,

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:33.140
 dragged her to the bedroom and owned her as a slave.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:45.180
 He wrote in his journal, "I have miscalculated."

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:50.180
 He was disappointed.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:33:01.740
 After all that time, after finally getting what he wanted, who he wanted, where he wanted,

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.620
 he was disappointed.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:13.500
 It just didn't live up to his fantasies.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:22.500
 After decades of loneliness, after decades of dreaming of this moment, it still didn't

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:27.660
 fill that hole inside of him.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:34.260
 That's why he let her go.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:40.260
 I have miscalculated, he wrote.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:45.220
 And then he begins writing about, "I could probably take Mark's body out of the bathroom

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.220
 wall."

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.460
 This is not a proper place to dispose of a body.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.460
 It's super stinky.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.580
 I have to go into the bathroom."

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:54.620
 He starts talking about, "Maybe if I move Mark's body out of the concrete and bury it

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.020
 in the backyard, it'll be more disguised and I don't have to smell it."

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:04.380
 But then he writes, "But I see no good reason for going on.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.180
 What would come next?

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.780
 The whole business is not worth it.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:19.060
 Life is not worth the trouble after all."

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:25.900
 After finally achieving his fantasy and it didn't live up to what he thought it would

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:35.540
 be, life is not worth the trouble after all.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:48.060
 So Albert, brust, poured himself a big glass of chocolate milk, added a little bit of cyanide,

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:55.260
 walked out to the yard, sat down in his lawn chair.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:04.980
 Underneath the warm summer sky, he drank that glass of chocolate milk and sat motionless

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:34.500
 in that chair for two days until the thunderstorm rolled in.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.080
 (upbeat music)

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.660
 (upbeat music)

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.240
 (upbeat music)

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.820
 (upbeat music)

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.400
 (upbeat music)

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.980
 (upbeat music)

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.560
 (upbeat music)

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.140
 (upbeat music)

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.720
 (upbeat music)

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.300
 (upbeat music)

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.880
 (upbeat music)

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.460
 (upbeat music)

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.040
 (upbeat music)

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.620
 (upbeat music)

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.200
 (upbeat music)

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.780
 (upbeat music)

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:25.780
