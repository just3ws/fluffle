1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 When a young bicyclist is hit by a car, he fears the worst.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,920
 I mean, he can't get much worse than that, right?

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,160
 But he fears the worst.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,360
 He's afraid that he's dead.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,440
 And he does die.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,440
 Or does he?

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,520
 I mean, obviously he's still alive if there's some sort of story attached to it, but where

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,240
 did he go when he died?

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,560
 It's a pretty crazy, pretty crazy near-death experience.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,800
 And then we travel to Florida to take a look at a murder mystery that has

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,200
 many moving pieces.

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,040
 When the police get a phone call that a man has been sitting in a lawn chair for the past

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,560
 two days, not even moving when a thunderstorm rolled in, they have no idea they're about

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:51,760
 to uncover a grisly web of murder and madness today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:02,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,000
 I'm your host Jason Garpin, and I'm having a great day.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,120
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the week, and I can't believe I haven't mentioned

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
 this yet.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,920
 I am so stoked about the movie Smile.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,680
 I'm gonna go see it opening night.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
 I cannot wait.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,480
 How did I forget to just talk about it every single episode this week?

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
 That movie looks dope.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,440
 I'm gonna put the trailer in the show notes.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
 I cannot wait.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,640
 I also couldn't wait to see Barbarian, and now that turned out to be a good one.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,280
 I'm still thinking about doing a movie review.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,760
 Barbarian was so ridiculous.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,040
 Great directing, great writing, amazing acting, like everything worked, and then the monster

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
 showed up.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
 It was so dumb.

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,400
 Do you guys know anything about Barbarian?

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,840
 I'll pause and wait for you all to answer or wait for you to email.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,400
 Yes, oh man.

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
 So what?

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,400
 At the end I was like, huh, that's it?

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,160
 Anyways, we'll talk about that some other time.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,280
 Maybe I'll just include something at the end of this episode.

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,320
 I almost have to get it off my chest.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
 My feelings about Barbarian.

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
 But I can't wait for Smile.

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,200
 I cannot wait for that movie.

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,880
 Someone else who I can't wait for, if I made him wait that long to get his name mentioned,

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,800
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,400
 Time supporter of the show, Give It Up for Jonathan Vaca.

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,360
 Yeah, come on in Jonathan.

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,680
 He's walking in with a big smile on his face.

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,760
 Have you guys seen that?

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,840
 The reviews I've seen for Smile, I'm all pushing Jonathan out of the way.

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,200
 I was like, I want to talk more about Smile.

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
 I love you dude.

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,600
 But the thing, I've read the reviews for Smile and the reviews that I've seen are,

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,280
 the trailer lives up to the movie.

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,040
 Because the trailer is so good.

56
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,400
 It's almost like it's own little short horror movie.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
 Like the trailer alone works.

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,200
 Like the music works and the mystery works and the creepiness works.

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
 Can't wait to see it.

60
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
 Okay come back over here Jonathan.

61
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,280
 Sorry I'm going to piss you out of the way the guy who pays me money.

62
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,560
 Jonathan you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

63
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

64
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,760
 Just help spread the word about the show.

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
 That really, really helps out a lot.

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
 Jonathan, he's not smiling.

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,200
 He's still up so that I've pushed him out of the way.

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,600
 Jonathan, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the hair hydrofoil.

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
 That might be a vehicle.

70
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,800
 I might have just made it up and I don't remember.

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,080
 Let's zoom on out of Dead Rabbit Command.

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,600
 We're headed all the way out to Chile.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:27,800
 I'm pretty sure we haven't used the hair hydrofoil before.

74
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,840
 It's like what sound does a hydrofoil make?

75
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,040
 I didn't even know hydrofoils existed until a toy, a G.I. Joe toy came out of one.

76
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,600
 We're driving on out there.

77
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,320
 Jonathan is the best captain in the world.

78
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,720
 We're headed out to Santiago, Chile.

79
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,440
 It's May 1st, 1982.

80
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,600
 A sunny spring afternoon.

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,880
 JF is the name that this guy goes by.

82
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
 Probably like an anonymous report, right?

83
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,360
 We're going to go ahead and call him Jacob.

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,200
 So Jacob and one of his friends, they're riding their bikes through town.

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,560
 When a car comes out of nowhere and smashes into both of these kids.

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,440
 Whoa!

87
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,600
 They're flying in the air.

88
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,320
 According to this report, you know generally what we're going to report about near-death

89
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,200
 experiences.

90
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 I don't know.

91
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,600
 I don't know much about physics, but when you start off with something that sounds like

92
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,400
 an exaggeration, it does make you go, "Ah."

93
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,240
 According to Jacob, when the car hit his bike, he flew 150 feet in the air.

94
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,040
 Not straight up, which would be pretty fun, but like, "Latitudally."

95
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
 If that's a word I'm not for sure.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 He flies away.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 You know what you mean?

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 He flew.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 You can't figure out the word.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 What would be the word?

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,680
 If when you hit a baseball and it flies in a straight line, that's the word I was looking

102
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,560
 for, he flew in a straight line 150 feet.

103
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,800
 That sounds like an exaggeration.

104
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,520
 I don't know how fast this car was going, but apparently he's like, "Whoa!"

105
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,400
 And he's like flying 150 feet.

106
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,040
 And he actually, this is a very, an occurrence at Al Creek Bridge type moment.

107
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,640
 So as he's flying through the air, Jacob has a thought in his head.

108
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,960
 Jacob realizes he's in no pain.

109
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:33,960
 He's feeling absolutely no pain as he is moving at such a high velocity towards, who knows

110
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
 what, right?

111
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,600
 Three stumps, another car, another car driving the opposite direction.

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
 He starts getting ping-ponged back and forth.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
 What he realizes is he's not feeling any pain as he's flying through the air.

114
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,540
 He also realizes that he's no longer in his body.

115
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:59,360
 It's now Jacob's soul flying through the air.

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,720
 Whoa.

117
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,760
 And while his soul is removed from his body, all of a sudden this light seems to shine

118
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
 from somewhere.

119
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,560
 And these two figures appear.

120
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,480
 The next thing he knows, he's standing in an illuminated room.

121
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
 What?

122
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 Where am I?

123
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,360
 I thought I was just about to get smashed into all of this stuff.

124
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,120
 I thought I was going to play pinball with my own body.

125
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,840
 He's standing in this room, this illuminated room.

126
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,880
 When he looks down at the floor, he sees Earth.

127
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,960
 Now not like he looks down, I said that wrong.

128
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,760
 I'm really striking out on the story, like, "Jayson, I can do that."

129
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
 When I look down, I see Earth.

130
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
 No.

131
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,640
 He looks down at the floor and he sees the planet Earth.

132
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,160
 Like he's in a UFO.

133
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,560
 You're like, "Whoa, that's not what I expected."

134
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
 Yeah.

135
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
 He's in a UFO.

136
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,600
 And he realizes that he can look down and he can see Earth.

137
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,920
 His body, his physical form is somewhere still on the planet.

138
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,520
 He's simply a bean made out of nothing but light.

139
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,080
 And the two beans, the two figures that he saw earlier, put him on a stretcher.

140
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,040
 And he immediately begins to feel heat all over his body.

141
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,520
 They then begin to do something.

142
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,480
 He doesn't really have a description for what they did, but he said they begin to do

143
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,680
 something to my head.

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,000
 And he realized, they didn't say this, but he realized that what they were doing was

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,560
 necessary for him to stay alive.

146
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,160
 So this is really interesting.

147
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,560
 He's not in his physical form anymore.

148
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,760
 He knows he's not in his physical form, but he has some sort of humanoid form in this

149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,000
 being of light.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,880
 He's nothing but pure light.

151
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,160
 And he still has arms and legs and a head, and he can still identify them.

152
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,960
 And even though his body is somewhere on Earth, as they're manipulating things in his soul,

153
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,200
 right, as they're working on his soul, it is healing his physical form.

154
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,680
 That's kind of what he's seen.

155
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,920
 That's kind of what he's sensing that they have to do this for him to stay alive.

156
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,800
 He is then taken from this illuminated room to a city.

157
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,880
 Not a city on Earth, but some sort of alien landscape.

158
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,920
 And he's wearing pajamas now.

159
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
 He's walking around.

160
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
 He's walking around.

161
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,320
 He's like, "Oh man, I thought the afterlife was going to be way cooler.

162
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,680
 Now I'm just a little prince."

163
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,920
 He's walking around in pajamas.

164
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,240
 I'm assuming he's still made of nothing but light at this point, but he has like Denver

165
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,320
 the dinosaur pajamas.

166
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,560
 He's walking around in these pajamas, and he's walking through the city, and he's taken

167
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,480
 to this thing he describes as a large object.

168
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,440
 And this almost seems to be different from the rest of the city.

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,960
 Like he can identify it as something different.

170
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,240
 So this might be another vessel, another UFO type craft.

171
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:05,360
 He's brought aboard this object, this vessel, and there he sees other people, other humans.

172
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:13,080
 And he describes them as they're all in various states of dying.

173
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,200
 Some are near death.

174
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,280
 Some are just starting the process of dying.

175
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,640
 I don't know if there's any like decayed people laying there, but various states of

176
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
 dying.

177
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,760
 And then he's taken out of there, out of this vessel.

178
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
 That's great for your tour, right?

179
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
 They're like, "Hey, would you like to see the dying human exhibit?"

180
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,440
 You're like, "No, I don't want to go see that at all."

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:42,880
 He's then taken out of that object, out of that place, to another city full of dinosaurs.

182
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,920
 Let me explain that a little better.

183
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,640
 I love that visual.

184
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
 They weren't actual dinosaurs.

185
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
 You're all excited.

186
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
 You're like, "Woohoo!

187
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,520
 In the afterlife, I get a ride of prontosaurus and slide down its neck."

188
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,360
 I paused at just the right part.

189
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
 He saw dinosaur-like animals.

190
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,080
 They're like, "Knock off dollar store dinosaurs."

191
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,440
 It's like the triceratops, but the horns are in the wrong place.

192
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,480
 He has four of them, which would still be pretty dope, right?

193
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,680
 You went somewhere and you saw like a derpy T-Rex.

194
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
 It's still a T-Rex.

195
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,240
 You're like, "Well, those arms are too long.

196
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
 That's not a T-Rex."

197
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
 And its eyes look wobbly.

198
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
 It's still a dinosaur.

199
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,040
 Who cares if it's dinosaur-adjacent?

200
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,920
 It's still super dope.

201
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,480
 I also left off another key word.

202
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,600
 What did you fix?

203
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
 This show is falling apart.

204
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,960
 Man, we just have to admit it at a certain point.

205
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,440
 This show has become a circus side show.

206
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
 This podcast, I love it.

207
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
 It's hilarious.

208
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,080
 But anyways, I'm like pausing at certain moments to get your hopes up on why.

209
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,960
 He goes to this place with dinosaur knockoffs.

210
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,640
 They're dinosaur-like animals and they're tiny.

211
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,880
 They're like the size of domesticated animals.

212
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,480
 So you would see like a T-Rex, but it would be say the size of a horse.

213
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,360
 And it tries seratops to be the size of a cat.

214
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,160
 He doesn't give the exact specifications.

215
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,320
 Which sure, that's not as cool as like a giant brontosaurus, but I would be digging a brontosaurus

216
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,280
 like the size of a camel.

217
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
 That'd be pretty cool.

218
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,760
 I mean, don't try sliding down its neck.

219
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,880
 It probably can't support your weight there.

220
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,400
 She can still ride it around.

221
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,640
 You can still, you know, wrestle with a T-Rex.

222
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,840
 Dude, that stuff, he can't.

223
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,240
 They don't let him have any fun.

224
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,280
 It's off to the next exhibit.

225
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,080
 He sees all these domesticated dinosaur-like creatures walking around this town.

226
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,240
 And the beans, these beans who I think at this point would be fair to say they're alien,

227
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,200
 this is so fascinating to me.

228
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,520
 They tell him it's not his time to die.

229
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:57,800
 He actually has, like thousands of other earthlings, a mission to complete.

230
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,360
 You have to go back to Earth and you have to complete this mission.

231
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,880
 But they don't really tell him what the mission is.

232
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,520
 They just say he has a purpose on Earth.

233
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,840
 They put an implant in his brain.

234
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,280
 They begin to tell him things like, "We have bases all over Earth."

235
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,240
 Yeah, so it's clearly alien at this point, right?

236
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,680
 They have bases all over Earth.

237
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,840
 Like the alien presence on Earth is real and they're pretty well established on the planet.

238
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,120
 And then another really interesting thing happens.

239
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,840
 So, because we've covered a lot of near-death experiences on this and I always try to find

240
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,160
 the weirdest of the weird.

241
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,880
 They put an implant in his head and he begins to bilocate.

242
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,240
 He begins to appear in two places at once.

243
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
 Now not like he's on one side of the room and he's waving at himself on the other side

244
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,720
 of the room.

245
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
 He specifically says, "So when they put that implant in my brain and they are still talking

246
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,800
 to me, all of a sudden I'm in different places all at the same time."

247
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,360
 He goes, "I was standing in the middle of Africa and at the same time I was in the Pleiades

248
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,280
 star system."

249
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:11,160
 The next thing Jacob knows, he's back in his body on Earth, his physical form, and

250
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:19,000
 both him and his friend fully recovered from the accident.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 It's an interesting story.

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
 I got it from one of my favorite resources on this show, think about it, docs.com.

253
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:31,800
 They got it from a group known as the Federation of UFO Logical Research of Chile.

254
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,040
 And the head researcher of this particular story was Juan Gilmero Aguilera Rodriguez.

255
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
 It's a fascinating look at near-death experience, right?

256
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,000
 It's not just him dying and his soul even his body.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,200
 We have alien involvement.

258
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
 We have dinosaurs.

259
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,520
 The dinosaurs are really dope.

260
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:57,160
 And this idea, this by-location thing, which is, I mean, like really, this is where you

261
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,840
 get into a lot of mysticism.

262
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,480
 This is where you even move past paranormal into a lot of mystical thinking.

263
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,800
 How big is the universe really?

264
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,160
 We can look at these huge distances and go, "Well, that's 50 light years away.

265
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,240
 We would have to travel at the speed of light for 50 years to get there.

266
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,720
 And we can't travel at the speed of light.

267
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,960
 Nothing can travel at the speed of light.

268
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,480
 So we can only travel near the speed of light, which is a huge difference.

269
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,720
 Speed of light, near speed of light.

270
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,840
 There's a huge gulf there.

271
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,440
 So this is so far away.

272
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,980
 But when you look at the metaphysics, when you look at this, they've done experiments

273
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
 on this.

274
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,420
 And science, some people say the science is real dodgy on this, but you can take an atom

275
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,000
 and you can have it in two locations at the same time.

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,080
 And when you manipulate it here, it will register that it's being lit up over here.

277
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,800
 Like they'll both light up at the same time because it's the same atom in two different

278
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,960
 places.

279
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,440
 And if you grabbed one atom, you're actually, it's not two atoms.

280
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,000
 It's one.

281
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,260
 It's one thing, but you can actually see it in two different places.

282
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,420
 How is that even possible?

283
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,340
 And if you, let's say that one appeared to be on the left side of the room and one appeared

284
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,940
 to be on the right side of the room.

285
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,700
 If you grab the one on the right side of the room, it's the same one.

286
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,700
 You could pick it up and you'd pick up quote unquote both of them.

287
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,980
 So we've looked at stuff like this just as a metaphysical community.

288
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,660
 I don't know if we really talked about it on the show so much.

289
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,120
 So the question is, if all of matter came out of a singular point, i.e. the Big Bang

290
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,960
 type of event, then everything is connected.

291
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,000
 There's no difference between me and an asteroid flying through deep space right now.

292
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,840
 Like technically there's a bunch of people shaking their heads right now.

293
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,920
 They're like, okay, that's not what the metaphysical theory is saying bro.

294
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,800
 Like you need to re, we're all from the same.

295
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,240
 There is no distance.

296
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,420
 There's zero distance whatsoever.

297
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,180
 And that would explain a lot of stuff like with aliens flying around the universe.

298
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,620
 Like I honestly think when we discovered the secret of alien technology, when we, I don't

299
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,660
 think the universe is, I think it's as big as we register it as.

300
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,820
 I do think it's X many miles, millions of miles wide or billions or whatever.

301
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,860
 But it's not that far.

302
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,520
 I don't, I think it's that big, but it's not that far.

303
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,240
 If that makes sense, like you have to think two things are kind of true at the same time.

304
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,920
 Once we realize the aliens aren't getting in a ship and being like it's 50 light years

305
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,160
 away guys, we're say goodbye to our families.

306
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,480
 We'll never see them again.

307
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,360
 They get here incredibly fast.

308
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,640
 Once we realize whether they're creating their own wormholes or they're bending time space

309
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,120
 or they're staying in one location and moving the universe around them, whatever theory you

310
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,900
 want to have, when we figure it out, we're going to be like, I can't, but that's so simple.

311
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,900
 It's the simplest thing.

312
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,620
 I think the same way when we have air flight now, when we figured out planes, we're going,

313
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,020
 oh yeah, no, we can mass produce planes.

314
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,100
 It took humanity thousands of years to get to a workable airplane.

315
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,020
 And now you can build one with the right tools in your backyard because it's so simple.

316
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,100
 When you think of the science behind it, it's so simple.

317
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
 You know what I mean?

318
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,440
 Once we figure out the science, it will be wrote.

319
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,520
 It'll just be something that's done.

320
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,440
 And I am a fan of the idea that the universe is folded up in such a way that I can look

321
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,320
 and see something really far away, but really I can be in both places at the same time.

322
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,000
 I may be in both places at the same time right now.

323
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
 I don't know.

324
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
 It's trippy.

325
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
 It's trippy.

326
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
 What is time?

327
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
 What is space?

328
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,080
 What are all of these things?

329
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,060
 And this guy dies, really, his soul leaves his body, and the aliens fix them.

330
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
 And it's interesting.

331
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,900
 It's a good parallel to yesterday's story, right, where I said that aliens were a bunch

332
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:03,020
 of jerks who were walking into the mentally disabled households and walking into elderly

333
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,740
 care centers and stuff like that and abducting people who wouldn't remember it anyways.

334
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,980
 And kind of being to them as this horrible jerk race, which they very well could be.

335
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,220
 They do do a lot of bad stuff, but I thought this was an interesting story in contrast

336
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
 to that.

337
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,220
 Aliens did heal him, right?

338
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,920
 And that was kind of what I was saying yesterday.

339
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,120
 How come the aliens, if they're abducting these people who have physical disabilities,

340
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,280
 how come they aren't healing those disabilities?

341
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
 It's interesting.

342
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,160
 It's a whole interesting phenomenon on why they do what they do and how they do it and

343
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,280
 do they exist, right?

344
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
 Is it alien?

345
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,440
 Is it interdimensional?

346
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,600
 Is it angelic or demonic or something that we can't even put a word to?

347
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,320
 Are there dinosaurs?

348
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,880
 Are there dinosaurs?

349
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,940
 All of this stuff, fascinating story, blending the near death experience with the alien reality.

350
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
 Absolutely fascinating.

351
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,540
 I'm glad I could share it with you.

352
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,060
 Jonathan, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

353
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,940
 We're leaving behind Santiago Chili.

354
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,380
 We're gonna hit a couple of bicyclists.

355
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,740
 We're like, don't worry, you guys will have a fun experiment in space as we're bumping

356
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,020
 into them and taking off.

357
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,940
 We're leaving behind Santiago Chili.

358
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,540
 Take us all the way out to South Dade County, Florida.

359
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:20,320
 It's July 21st, 1973, and we're in South Dade County, Florida.

360
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:27,040
 And there's a man known as Albert Burst, 44 year old building inspector, sitting outside

361
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
 in his backyard.

362
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,640
 Got his little lawn chair propt up.

363
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:43,900
 Getting down, comfortably enjoying another hot, swampy Florida summer day.

364
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,860
 But his next door neighbor, she's taking the laundry off the line.

365
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:56,140
 And she looks over and she sees Albert just sitting in the chair, you know, just relaxing.

366
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:04,560
 But when a thunderstorm starts to roll in, begins to rain, she notices that Albert's

367
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:13,960
 still just sitting in that chair, not moving, not even flinching as the rain splatters against

368
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,120
 his face.

369
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,560
 She mentions it to her son.

370
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,880
 She's like, Albert, next door, he's just sitting there.

371
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
 It's raining.

372
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,700
 That's weird.

373
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,380
 And her son goes, yeah, it is weird.

374
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,940
 He actually has been sitting back there for two days straight now.

375
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
 What?

376
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,940
 Yeah, yeah, he's been back there for two days.

377
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,660
 I probably should have told you something at least a day ago.

378
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,680
 He's been sitting out there for two days straight.

379
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,180
 Look back over the fence.

380
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,300
 And there's Albert just sitting there.

381
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,460
 Rain pouring down on him.

382
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,680
 The neighbor calls the police and says, I think there's a dead man in the garden next

383
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
 door.

384
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,880
 I think you need to come take a look.

385
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,520
 Let's go back a week earlier.

386
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,400
 And we're going to meet a young woman named Mary Ellen Jones.

387
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,520
 She's 15 years old.

388
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,560
 She's hitchhiking through Florida with her boyfriend, Mark Mattson.

389
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,960
 And I use the word boyfriend.

390
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,920
 I mean, it's technically true, but they had just met the day before.

391
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,260
 This was a whirlwind romance if there ever has been one.

392
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,420
 They met each other on a beach.

393
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:36,080
 And now they're hitchhiking together through Florida, ready to start life together, or

394
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,260
 maybe just have a good time.

395
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,020
 And as they're hitchhiking down the road, a car pulls up.

396
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,600
 There's a middle-aged man driving it.

397
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,940
 His name is Eric.

398
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,600
 He's more than willing to pick up this young couple and take them to where they want to

399
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,000
 go.

400
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,480
 He ended up taking the young couple back to his house.

401
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,440
 And it does seem like this was all consensual.

402
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
 This was part of the plan.

403
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,480
 It would be a nice place to stay the night, and then they would continue the journey the

404
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,120
 next day.

405
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,000
 But when Eric gets this young couple to his home, he pulls a gun out.

406
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 At gunpoint.

407
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,820
 He's pointing it at Mark, pointing it at Mary, back to Mark, threatening these two young

408
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,020
 people.

409
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:30,620
 He forces them to take their clothes off, and then forces them to have sex with each other.

410
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,180
 And as he's sitting there watching this young couple have sex, he has another part of his

411
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,260
 plan.

412
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,980
 He goes and gets a camera, and while holding the gun, he tries to steady the camera and

413
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:51,620
 begins to snap photos of these young people having sex.

414
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,980
 But he just can't get it right.

415
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,580
 It would be very difficult to try to hold the gun and use one of those old 1970s cameras

416
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,060
 at the same time.

417
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,960
 So he puts the gun down.

418
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,280
 He's so caught up in the fantasy of what's going on, the fantasy that he's made of reality.

419
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,060
 He puts the gun down, and with both hands begins snapping these photos that he's going

420
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,260
 to save for later.

421
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:21,380
 Mark sees the gun has been placed down and makes a move for it.

422
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,700
 But Eric is faster.

423
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:33,940
 He grabs the gun and shoots Mark three times, killing him right in front of Mary.

424
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:41,640
 Eric then grabs Mary and forces her down the hallway towards his bedroom.

425
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:53,120
 Inside Eric's bedroom, there's a hidden door that when opened reveals a soundproof room

426
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,880
 with arm shackles on the wall.

427
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:06,460
 Eric takes Mary into this room, shackles her to the wall, and for the next 24 hours keeps

428
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:17,660
 her as a sex slave in his soundproof room in this seemingly normal looking suburban home.

429
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:27,860
 But after 24 hours pass, Eric undoes the shackles and tells Mary, "I'm going to let

430
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:34,760
 you go on the condition that you don't tell anybody about what happened here.

431
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,280
 Can you do that for me?"

432
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,960
 Mary of course says yes and is let go.

433
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,680
 She's shocked, right?

434
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,320
 She'd watched this man already kill Mark.

435
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,680
 She feared the worst.

436
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,960
 She endured the worst.

437
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,060
 She goes straight to the police.

438
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,580
 She tells them the story and the police are like, "Wait, what?

439
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,980
 I guess that's possible.

440
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,980
 We are police.

441
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
 We do see horrible things."

442
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,820
 But they don't know whether or not to believe her.

443
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,020
 Really they just have this 15 year old girl running into their police office telling this

444
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,260
 outlandish story.

445
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:24,020
 A guy makes you two have sex and he's taking photos of it.

446
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,260
 So they call up her mom.

447
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,640
 Her mom in Kentucky.

448
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,240
 They call up her mom and they go, "Hey, we have your daughter here.

449
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,720
 We think she ran away and she's telling us this story."

450
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,400
 And the mom goes, "Stop, just stop right there.

451
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,840
 Listen, my daughter's a pathological liar.

452
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,360
 Whatever story she's telling you isn't true.

453
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,160
 Glad you got my daughter.

454
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,900
 I'll send down money for a bus ticket and send her back up."

455
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,840
 So the police send Mary off to her mom.

456
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,400
 And they figure, it's just all made up, it's just pathological liar making up this insane

457
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,540
 story.

458
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:06,200
 On July 21st, the police are called to the home of Albert Burst.

459
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:13,180
 And sure enough, he's been sitting in his backyard dead for two days.

460
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,240
 So they call in a meat wagon.

461
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,280
 I don't think that's the technical term for him.

462
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,780
 They're going to take him down to have an autopsy done to figure out what it could be.

463
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,600
 44 is really too young for a heart attack, right?

464
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,200
 He looks relatively healthy.

465
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,240
 Someone down to figure out what it could have been.

466
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,280
 And as he's headed down to the corner, the police go into his house.

467
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,440
 See if they can uncover anything there that could have led to his death.

468
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,960
 And once they enter the house, the first thing they smell is the overwhelming stench of rotten

469
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,680
 meat.

470
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,560
 They follow the smell to the bathroom.

471
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,840
 When they walk into the bathroom, they notice that one of the bathroom walls appears to

472
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
 be bleeding.

473
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,520
 So they're not spooky, they're not scared of ghosts, right?

474
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,440
 They don't think they're spooky, spooky ghosts, maybe one or two of them did.

475
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,360
 They go, let's cut into this wall because we can smell rotten meat.

476
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,400
 We got a dead man out there.

477
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,300
 There's probably a dead man behind this wall.

478
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:19,680
 So they actually have to piece by piece break down this cement slab that has been placed

479
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,480
 in this bathroom wall.

480
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,040
 And as they're breaking it, the smell becomes even more overpowering.

481
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,520
 And they're finally able to get a good grip and tear a chunk of it away.

482
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:41,240
 And inside the wall is the headless, handless, footless corpse of Mark Mattson.

483
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,920
 And although they don't immediately recognize this as Mark Mattson, because they don't know

484
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,440
 what he looks like, they start to think about that story that young girl told him, just

485
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:58,680
 a week ago, about a man who took them to a house in the suburbs of Miami and shot somebody

486
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,600
 and then raped her.

487
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,680
 They decide to go check out the bedroom of Eric, who they are very quickly putting together,

488
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,200
 was not a real name.

489
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,440
 Eric actually was Albert Burst.

490
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:25,200
 And when they go into Albert's bedroom, they do find the soundproof sex room.

491
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,480
 They now know that the girl's story was true.

492
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,920
 They now know that Albert was Eric and Albert is a murderer.

493
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:39,360
 The question is, who killed Albert?

494
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,680
 Albert Burst didn't have many friends, but the people that he didn't know regarded him

495
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,480
 as an extremely smart individual.

496
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,040
 He just was very intolerant of other people, of pretty much everything.

497
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,760
 He hated his way through life.

498
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,200
 He had a criminal record from when he was much younger.

499
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,520
 He spent some time in jail.

500
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,400
 And he just kind of floated through life, right?

501
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,000
 But he was angry at it.

502
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,240
 And he kept a journal.

503
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,000
 He wrote down his thoughts, his fears, his desires.

504
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 This is so fascinating.

505
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Let's take a look at some of these quotes from this journal.

506
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,120
 He wrote, quote, "Rape, murder, suicide.

507
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,080
 These thoughts are constantly with me.

508
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,620
 Of course, this is not mentally healthy.

509
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:45,180
 There is no doubt that by present standards, I am mentally ill, a hopeless sociopath."

510
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,460
 He craved the companionship of a woman.

511
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,500
 But he couldn't see himself on equal footing with a woman.

512
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,520
 He didn't want someone around where they could sit and talk, someone they could go on walks

513
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,140
 with, someone that he could argue with, "Where are we going to go to dinner?

514
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,620
 What are we going to watch tonight?"

515
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,940
 That wasn't his goal.

516
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,660
 He didn't want a woman.

517
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,660
 He wanted a woman.

518
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,780
 She had to be controlled by him.

519
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,860
 She had to be willing to be a slave to him.

520
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:27,540
 But he couldn't find any woman willing in taking up that offer.

521
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:33,460
 He states that at the age of 44, he was still a virgin.

522
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:42,840
 He had lived his entire life not being able to have what he wanted more than anything.

523
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,540
 He wrote in his journal, quote, "After work, I always get home as soon as possible to enjoy

524
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:54,700
 my solitary sanctuary and its music and books and TV.

525
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,660
 No sex yet, but I'm working on it.

526
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,580
 Slowly, with determined resolve.

527
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,620
 I know what I want.

528
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,180
 I need someone for sex.

529
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,340
 Yes."

530
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,660
 But not an idiot I have to cater to.

531
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,980
 Enter the Bruce-Dian solution.

532
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:22,260
 The Bruce-Dian solution named after Albert "Bruce" -- if I've mispronounced it a couple

533
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:27,100
 times, I apologize, you're Googling Albert...

534
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,100
 You're Googling Albert Birst.

535
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,900
 You're like, "What a fantastic story.

536
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,900
 Who is this guy?"

537
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,100
 But this guy doesn't exist.

538
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,180
 Albert "Brust" -- I'll try to go in and edit those up.

539
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,180
 I'll clean it up a bit.

540
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,180
 Albert "Brust" -- Albert "Burst"?

541
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:45,980
 I'm glad I can have such a good belly laugh during this otherwise terrifying story.

542
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,420
 Albert "Brust" is the author of the "Brustian" solution, and the "Brustian" solution was

543
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:59,700
 to "Knappa Woman" and to lock her in his sex slave torture room.

544
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,180
 What is so fascinating about this story is this is something he longed for years.

545
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,140
 He was obsessed with murder, he was obsessed with kidnapping a woman and making her his

546
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,860
 slave.

547
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,860
 This was what he wanted.

548
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,660
 He didn't want someone he had to cater to, he didn't want a woman he would have to talk

549
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,900
 to or do anything else with.

550
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:28,260
 He just wanted a slave, and when he finally got it, he snatched that woman off the street,

551
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:33,140
 dragged her to the bedroom and owned her as a slave.

552
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:45,180
 He wrote in his journal, "I have miscalculated."

553
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:50,180
 He was disappointed.

554
00:32:50,180 --> 00:33:01,740
 After all that time, after finally getting what he wanted, who he wanted, where he wanted,

555
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,620
 he was disappointed.

556
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:13,500
 It just didn't live up to his fantasies.

557
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 After decades of loneliness, after decades of dreaming of this moment, it still didn't

558
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,660
 fill that hole inside of him.

559
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:34,260
 That's why he let her go.

560
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:40,260
 I have miscalculated, he wrote.

561
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,220
 And then he begins writing about, "I could probably take Mark's body out of the bathroom

562
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
 wall."

563
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,460
 This is not a proper place to dispose of a body.

564
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
 It's super stinky.

565
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,580
 I have to go into the bathroom."

566
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,620
 He starts talking about, "Maybe if I move Mark's body out of the concrete and bury it

567
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,020
 in the backyard, it'll be more disguised and I don't have to smell it."

568
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:04,380
 But then he writes, "But I see no good reason for going on.

569
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,180
 What would come next?

570
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,780
 The whole business is not worth it.

571
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:19,060
 Life is not worth the trouble after all."

572
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:25,900
 After finally achieving his fantasy and it didn't live up to what he thought it would

573
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:35,540
 be, life is not worth the trouble after all.

574
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:48,060
 So Albert, brust, poured himself a big glass of chocolate milk, added a little bit of cyanide,

575
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:55,260
 walked out to the yard, sat down in his lawn chair.

576
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:04,980
 Underneath the warm summer sky, he drank that glass of chocolate milk and sat motionless

577
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:34,500
 in that chair for two days until the thunderstorm rolled in.

578
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,080
 (upbeat music)

579
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,660
 (upbeat music)

580
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,240
 (upbeat music)

581
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,820
 (upbeat music)

582
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,400
 (upbeat music)

583
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,980
 (upbeat music)

584
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,560
 (upbeat music)

585
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,140
 (upbeat music)

586
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,720
 (upbeat music)

587
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,300
