WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.560
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.760
 When a fast food worker is fired from an Arby's restaurant,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.720
 he discovers the perfect revenge.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.200
 And then we travel to Mexico to take a look at a minute-by-minute

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.880
 account of what happens after a UFO crashes.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.360
 While the Mexican government and the CIA are both rushing

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.040
 to the scene of this fallen alien ship,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.280
 little do they know they're both about to become participants

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.400
 in a mass casualty event today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.360
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.720
 Hey, everyone.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.440
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.600
 I'm your host, Jason Garvin, and I'm having a great day.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.160
 Hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.240
 Hope you guys had a fun weekend.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.880
 We've got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240
 going to go ahead and get started right away walking

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.480
 into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.360
 It's one of our newest Patreon supporters.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.440
 Everyone on your feet.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.000
 And give it up for Hammer.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.960
 Woo, yeah.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.160
 Come on in, Hammer.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.760
 Come on in, Hammer.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 Thank you so much for joining the Patreon.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.520
 Hammer, you're going to be our captain, our pilot

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.080
 this episode.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.720
 If you guys can't support the Patreon,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.880
 I totally understand.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 Just helps with the word about the show that really,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.880
 really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.880
 Now, Hammer, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.560
 to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.400
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.160
 We are going to fly all the way out to Missouri.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.880
 [ROARING]

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.680
 And I hope you guys brought a lunch.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.080
 But I hope you guys have not eaten it yet,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.520
 because this story is disgusting, not just because we're

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.600
 going to an Arby's, the worst of all fast food restaurants.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.160
 I would rather live in a Long John Silvers

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.360
 than eat at an Arby's.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.120
 Long John Silvers isn't that bad, but imagine

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.480
 if you're trying to sleep.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.080
 People don't live in Long John Silvers,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.120
 but they ring that bell whenever the service is good.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.840
 Have you guys ever been a Long John Silvers?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.920
 It's a fast food.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.840
 We didn't have a soda on it before,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.680
 because there is a conspiracy theory

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.400
 that Long John Silvers is connected to the marijuana.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.520
 Allegedly, it's connected to the marijuana industry.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.440
 There was this drug dealer who was

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.280
 trying to launder a bunch of drug money,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.520
 and he knew the guy who started Long John Silvers.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.280
 So he said, I'll give you this money.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.280
 You can somehow convince people to eat fast food that is fish,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.480
 and I'm going to launder this money.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.840
 I'll see if I actually did that, or if I just had a dream.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.280
 It is a real conspiracy theory.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.360
 I'm pretty sure I did that episode.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.000
 Long John Silvers, though.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.680
 Why are we talking about Long John Silvers?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.120
 Okay, let's get to the Arby's thing.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.480
 I'm not living in Long John Silvers.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.360
 I don't need to go into their bell ringing technique.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.840
 It's if the service is good during the bell.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.880
 Anyways, has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.240
 Apparently, I'm just very hungry.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.120
 In Missouri, in the city of Lee's Summit,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.200
 they actually, we actually have the exact address

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.040
 for this place.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.320
 If you want to go to this Arby's

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.200
 and take photographs and send them back to me,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.800
 if you want to relive this event, you can.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.080
 I don't recommend it.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.480
 On Highway 291 and Northeast Tudor Road,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.120
 this story begins.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.600
 This fable of a young man begins in June of 2019.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.040
 There's a Arby's worker named Tanner Maggard.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.520
 And Tanner, he's 19 years old, and he's like,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.840
 "Oh, my first job."

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.320
 And he walks into the Arby's and he's making

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.640
 roast beef sandwiches and he's preparing french fries

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.720
 or whatever other food they have.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.040
 I need rings, I don't remember.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.400
 'Cause I haven't eaten there in like 20 years.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.800
 He's making all this food and he's like,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.480
 "You know what? I really love working here.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.760
 I don't just love the disgusting food.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.440
 I like the disgusting atmosphere."

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.640
 He looks over at all the customers.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.480
 They're all sloth people.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.560
 He's like, "Yeah, this is the place I've always wanted to be.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.640
 I've always wanted to work at an Arby's."

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.520
 He's this poor guy.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.120
 "Trust me, trust me, you're not gonna feel sorry

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.440
 for this guy in a little bit."

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.080
 The fact that he's working at Arby's

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.120
 is really the high point of his life.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.800
 Tanner is working at Arby's,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.040
 but he doesn't work there very long

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.400
 because management has an issue with Tanner.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.440
 Sure, he might show up on time.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.520
 Sure, he might prepare the food correctly.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.800
 Sure, he might have service with a smile.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 He also has a bad habit of setting fires in the kitchen.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.000
 Not where it's supposed to be.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.920
 He's not like lighting pilot lights or cooking food.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.640
 Apparently, I don't know if he did this on his breaks.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.840
 They're like, "If you're gonna do this,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.600
 at least wait till your lunch hour, Tanner."

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.920
 Or if he was doing it on the clock,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.960
 but he kept setting fire to the kitchen.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.040
 And for whatever reason, there's a question.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.880
 How many fires would one of your employees

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.160
 have to start a year-place-of-business before you fired him?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
 I think the answer would be one.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.360
 He set several fires during his time at Arby's.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.680
 He kept setting stuff on fire.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.320
 And after, I don't know, the eighth one,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.360
 they're like, "Oh, we've talked about this seven times before.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.960
 You can't set stuff on fire in the store.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.120
 You're fired."

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.160
 They didn't even mean the pun.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.000
 They didn't mean the pun.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.960
 He's like, "Oh, no!"

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.660
 So he's fired and he leaves.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.580
 But then, on October 19th, 2019,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.760
 it's been four months since he's been unjustly fired

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.880
 for trying to burn down in Arby's.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.380
 He comes back into the Arby's.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.980
 Now, I'm sure he stopped by several times

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.680
 between June and October.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.940
 They didn't seem super alarmed when we walked back in,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.840
 but they knew he was a weirdo.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.520
 They knew this guy was a weirdo.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.440
 One, he worked at Arby's right,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.460
 and they all know there's something wrong

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.580
 with you if you worked there.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.320
 But two, he was set up on fire.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.520
 But, you know, sometimes you gotta eat where you gotta eat.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.340
 So he comes into the Arby's on October 19th,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.260
 and he places an order, and then he goes to the bathroom,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.980
 which is usually the opposite order.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.820
 Right?

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.860
 Normally, you eat Arby's and then have explosive diarrhea.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.500
 But before he even gets the food,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.860
 he places the order and he goes into the bathroom.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.100
 Then, a short time later, he comes out

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.580
 and he tells the manager,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.500
 "Oh, I see you remodeled the bathroom."

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.340
 Huh.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.020
 And then he gets his food and he sits down.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.340
 The manager's like, "Oh, man, this guy's so weird.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.980
 "We didn't remodel the bathroom.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.280
 "Why would he say something like that?

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.340
 "I'm too busy."

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.260
 Shortly after this exchange,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.840
 Tanner goes back into the bathroom.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.200
 And the manager has to go into the bathroom to clean it.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.920
 It's time for their monthly cleaning

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.320
 at the Arby's restaurant.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.780
 He goes into the bathroom and he's cleaning up the bathroom.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.280
 But Tanner is in a stall.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.880
 And when the manager's in there,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.000
 and he's like, "Dum-dum-dum-dum."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.680
 He's like picking up toilet paper

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.160
 or like wiping down the urinal, whatever.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.440
 He hears Tanner in the bathroom stall going,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.280
 "Ugh."

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.220
 "Ugh."

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.140
 He hears some gagging and retching.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.260
 And then he's just like, "Oh, man,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.060
 "this place is hard enough to work.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.140
 "It's hard enough to work here.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.640
 "And now I got this dude, this ex-employee,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.540
 "gagging in the stall."

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.180
 "Ugh."

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.220
 So the manager just trying to,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.620
 I feel so bad for this manager.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.980
 He's just trying to do his job, man.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.980
 He's just trying to clean this up.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.820
 So he leaves.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.660
 Obviously he needs to clean the whole bathroom.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.460
 Tanner's in part of it, he's in the stall.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.320
 You don't necessarily wanna ask,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.700
 "Are you okay in there, buddy?"

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.540
 "Ugh."

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.620
 The manager leaves the bathroom

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.260
 and then waits for Tanner to leave

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.740
 so he can finish cleaning up.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.540
 Tanner ends up leaving the bathroom

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.480
 and the manager's like, "Oh, finally."

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.880
 And he goes in and he opens the stall

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.720
 where Tanner had been previously.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.420
 And what he finds is,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.900
 so in a lot of restrooms,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.700
 they have the baby changing stations.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.420
 I actually think it might be required by law.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.900
 I'm not for sure, but they have those plastic things

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.100
 that come down so you can put,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.340
 'cause there's nothing you wanna put your baby on

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.340
 than a piece of plastic that who knows

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.700
 if it'll hold the weight of your baby

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.260
 in an Arby's bathroom.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.740
 You have the baby changing station

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.580
 on the baby changing station in the stall

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.460
 is a headless cat.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.940
 And that would be troubling enough, right?

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.180
 If you walked into a bathroom

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.060
 and there was a cat with no head,

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.340
 not only did the cat have no,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.180
 (laughs)

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.460
 I'll call the girl pause to give you guys time

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.060
 to skip ahead,

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.380
 not only did the cat have no head,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.100
 it was disemboweled.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.780
 It was completely mutilated.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.500
 And all over the walls of the bathroom stall

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.580
 and all over the toilet and all over the door

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.380
 was cat blood and cat intestines.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.700
 And it didn't have a head.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.020
 The head was there, apparently.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.980
 They didn't say where it was.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.020
 I don't know if it was like propped up somewhere

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.740
 if it was just rolling around on the ground.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.500
 The manager's all playing hacky sack with the cat head

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.700
 until the police show up

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.140
 because that's what he did, obviously,

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.940
 this guy called the cops.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.900
 Disgusting.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.220
 And when the manager came out of the bathroom,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.020
 he saw Tanner sitting in his truck in the parking lot

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.300
 watching the manager.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.100
 Like he wanted to see what the manager's reaction was.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.860
 And then when Tanner saw him playing hacky sack

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.700
 with the cat head, he's like,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.140
 "Oh, why didn't I think of that?"

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.860
 Tanner drove away, right when he saw the manager,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.300
 right when they locked eyes, he drove away.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.940
 Now, obviously, you guys might not know this.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.580
 You guys might have never hired anybody.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.380
 But generally when you get a job,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.940
 you have to list your home address,

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.640
 your phone number, your social security number,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.780
 all that stuff.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.420
 So the manager just called the cops and said,

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.380
 "Hey, I'm a little alarmed here.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.580
 "A man just eviscerated a cat in our bathroom.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.100
 "And he's a known pyromaniac."

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.000
 And the police said the cat didn't smell.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.140
 I didn't know this was a thing.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.060
 I thought like if you cut something open

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.420
 to my remaining zero listeners for this segment,

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.940
 I thought if you cut something open,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.100
 it would be stinky, right?

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.620
 But apparently not.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.820
 Apparently if you kill, okay, I should just stop now.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.700
 But apparently if it's a fresh kill,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.500
 it's less stinky, it's not super stinky.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.100
 The reason why this is important,

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.460
 because if he had found a dead cat

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.700
 that had been like roadkill for a while,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.380
 they would have smelled it and they would have been like,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.820
 "Oh, he just picked a cat up off the road."

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.660
 Like he found a previously dead cat and did this.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.660
 What, the police go,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.500
 "There's no rotten smell to this cat."

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.240
 That means he just killed it.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.100
 He probably brought a live cat into the Arby's restaurant

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.100
 and killed it there.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.900
 Tanner was charged with second degree animal abuse,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.860
 which really makes me think, what's first degree?

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.300
 Like if killing a cat,

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.580
 bringing a cat into an Arby's

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.460
 in and of itself is an animal abuse,

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.220
 killing a cat in a bathroom stall,

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.620
 that's second degree, what's first degree?

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.260
 Like what could you possibly do that's worse than this?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.300
 Don't tell me, don't send me images or anything or links.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.420
 I'm just wondering.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.380
 And he also got charged with property damage

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.880
 because he messed up their bathroom stall.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.980
 They had to repaint it and everything.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.660
 Now you can go, like I said, I gave you the address.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.500
 You can go check this out.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.740
 I want some of my intrepid listeners to road trip out there

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.860
 and see if they can detect the blood, bring some luminol.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.940
 I find it so fascinating though,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.540
 that how does a person like this,

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.360
 even have a job in the first place?

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.700
 Like how does a person like this

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.340
 have the wherewithal to fill out forms

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.660
 and put down their social security number?

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.600
 'Cause obviously he's setting stuff on fire

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.180
 and he's killing cats.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.980
 Like this wasn't his first rodeo, right?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.300
 It couldn't have been.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.620
 I can't imagine someone sitting there one day

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.920
 and be like, oh man, I really hate

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.740
 that I got fired four months ago.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.520
 I know what I'm gonna do.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.020
 Dada, I'm gonna kill a cat and da da da da da.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.460
 He had to have been doing this before.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.460
 Doesn't it seem like there would be a ramp up to this?

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.860
 Or am I wrong?

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.660
 Are people just that easy to just push?

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.620
 That easy to just kind of push to the edge?

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.660
 It's funny because just maybe 10 minutes

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.880
 before recording the segment,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.580
 I was on the Patreon Discord.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.900
 They get to listen to these episodes live

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.160
 and me and a long time listener of the show, Rudy Jazz,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.560
 we're just talking about the story of Ian Watkins,

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.080
 lead singer of the Lost Prophets.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.680
 This is gonna get real dark real quick.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.520
 I didn't plan on this.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.080
 This literally happened 10 minutes ago,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.320
 but me and Rudy Jazz were talking about Ian Watkins.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.840
 He was a singer of the Lost Prophets.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.720
 It was like this new metal band or emo metal band,

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.440
 whatever, they're really big.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.800
 They're really big.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.280
 And apparently he started having sex with babies

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.520
 at some point during his career.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.540
 And the question is, was he always attracted to babies?

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.540
 Or did he become attracted to babies

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.700
 while he was on tour with the Lost Prophets?

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.420
 The rest of the band had no idea this was going on.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.660
 They had no idea at all.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.460
 They were totally flabbergasted

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.540
 when the cops pulled out their lead singer

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.900
 and they're like, "Oh, what's he being charged for?

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.740
 "Doing meth?"

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.180
 'Cause he also did a bunch of meth.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.700
 He was also a meth head.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.540
 "What's he being charged for?

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.380
 "Are you pig?

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.600
 "Why are you arresting the lead singer of our band?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.360
 "What is this, some sort of police state?"

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.780
 And then the cops turned around and they're like,

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.320
 "Dude, we don't even want to see what he's doing out loud.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.080
 "It's so disgusting, just trust us.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.200
 "Here's the arrest warrant."

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.040
 And the rest of the band was like,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.440
 "Oh my God, that guy's disgusting.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.600
 "Can we go to the police station

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.600
 "and beat him up for you?"

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.480
 Like what happened?

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.000
 Was he always attracted to babies?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.060
 Or did he become attracted to babies?

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.480
 Now the meth didn't help.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.220
 He might have been a totally normal person.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.500
 Meth is satanic.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.140
 Like the stuff that you go through

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.460
 when you're on meth is just so insane.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.780
 Who knows?

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.260
 So maybe Tanner Maggard was just a normal dude

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.220
 who one day started setting stuff on fire.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.260
 See, that doesn't track at all.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.460
 Most normal people just don't start setting stuff on fire

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.740
 and killing cats.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.460
 At what point did he become a psycho?

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.660
 That's so fascinating.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.020
 Maybe it was something inside of him.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.520
 Maybe making one too many cheddar roast beef sandwiches

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.000
 drove him insane.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.120
 Who knows?

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.920
 But I don't think this is the first cat he killed.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.400
 There's no other information on him.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.560
 I found this article and then he was charged

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.760
 with second degree animal abuse,

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.960
 second degree property damage.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.160
 I couldn't find the results of the trial.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.720
 A lot of stuff that's happened,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.640
 like if you were arrested in October of 2019,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.840
 what was it five months later,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.400
 the entire country shut down due to the pandemic?

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.580
 So he's probably still facing these charges.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.740
 Maybe they've dropped him by now.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.700
 Maybe he's still wandering the streets of Lee's Summit

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.620
 looking for cats.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.140
 I should also say allegedly 'cause he hasn't been found guilty.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.020
 He actually denied that he did all this stuff

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.140
 and then I compared him to Ian Watkins,

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.340
 one of the grossest people.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.340
 So Tanner, if you didn't do this, I apologize.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.020
 But if he did do this, you're sick, allegedly.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.260
 Hammer, let's go ahead and toss you

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.980
 the keys of the carboner copter.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.800
 We are leaving behind this Arby's.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.460
 We are headed all the way out to Mexico.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.800
 (imitates car engine)

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.840
 The cats are running the helicopter.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.080
 They're like, "Save us, save us."

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.800
 We're catching all the kittens that we can.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.280
 It's Tanner's chasing them down the street.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.920
 Allegedly, we're flying out to Mexico.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.000
 I found this story the other day.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.980
 This is awesome.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.860
 This story's really cool because we hear a lot of stories

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.040
 about UFO crashes.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.320
 They're actually not super common,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.500
 but obviously they're the big ones like Roswell.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.700
 We hear these stories about UFO crashes.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.260
 We hear these stories about retrievals,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.300
 like they went and they got the UFO

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.780
 and then they put it on a flatbed truck.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.340
 But I've never come across a story that is so detailed.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.060
 Like this is almost a blow-by-blow account

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.540
 of what would happen if a UFO fell from the sky.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.620
 I got most of my information from a website

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.620
 called Mexico Unexplained.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.840
 It's what it sounds like.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.360
 It's a paranormal UFO website that specializes

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.480
 in stuff that happens in Mexico

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.960
 and there's a ton of it going on down there.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.080
 And this article was written by Robert Bitto.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.400
 So I wanna give him a shout out.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.080
 Great, great story.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.400
 He got it.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.600
 So the setup for this story was,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.360
 there was a UFO investigator.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.400
 I believe she's still alive.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.160
 There's a UFO investigator named Elaine Douglas.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.760
 And she got an anonymous letter.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.880
 Well, there's initials to it.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.680
 JS claiming to be part of something called Deneb Team,

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.360
 which is a retrieval unit.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.700
 And so that's the setup for the story.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.940
 There's been like a very famous book written

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.520
 about this incident,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.780
 but it's flowing under the radar, no pun intended.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.460
 I thank for people in America.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.740
 I had never heard this before.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.400
 I don't know how famous it is overall,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.220
 but it seems to be pretty rare.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.380
 It's not like a well-known story.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.980
 However, there is actually a cover story for this as well.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.280
 Like it's popular enough

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.720
 that the government kind of had to issue a statement about it,

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.420
 but very, very fascinating.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.940
 Let's get into this.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:23.640
 It's August 25th, 1974, 10 p.m.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.060
 And at a U.S. air defense base,

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.640
 all of a sudden something pops up on their monitors.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.800
 (humming)

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.960
 Sir, sir, come over here, look at this monitor.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.280
 Look at this, he's pointing at it.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.460
 He's like, "Get your finger out of the way.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.920
 I wanna see what you're pointing at."

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.720
 An object is flying over the Gulf of Mexico.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.660
 It's going to enter U.S. airspace in about an hour.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.080
 It's moving at 2,500 miles per hour

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.280
 and it's 75,000 feet up.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.800
 Well, it's probably a meteor, right?

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.640
 It's probably something that high up traveling that fast.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.960
 It's probably something, it's a shooting star.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.920
 Make a wish, make a wish, young man.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.180
 Make a wish, person who should be watching this machine.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.340
 Maybe it'll come true.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.500
 But what happens is this object begins to slow down

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.740
 and then turn.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.460
 It's still headed towards the U.S.,

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.020
 but now it's coming at a different angle.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.340
 And apparently multiple people were tracking this

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.780
 in the United States and at first,

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.260
 they both thought it could be a meteor,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.900
 but meteors tend not to,

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.940
 meteors tend not to slow down and turn.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.360
 It ends up dropping as low as 25,000 feet.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.560
 (humming)

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.240
 We lost it, sir.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.780
 It dropped off radar and the commander goes,

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.560
 "Hmm, hmm, very, very interesting."

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.680
 And he walks away.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.320
 He's like, "Oh man, my wish isn't going to come true now."

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.080
 Single-tier drop.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.600
 About an hour later,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.680
 about an hour later,

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.720
 the radio chatter starts to pop up over the airwaves.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.540
 A Cessna, a private plane leaving El Paso, Texas,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.500
 headed towards Mexico City, crashed in the desert.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.160
 Somewhere in the state of Chihuahua,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.860
 near a town known as Koyami,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.100
 the Cessna went down.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.100
 That was the last place they picked it up.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.140
 August 26th, it's early morning now.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.500
 It's like between midnight and 1 a.m.,

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.300
 Mexican authorities start to try to find this Cessna

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.700
 that crashed.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.660
 Now, here's the thing.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.320
 Where it was at is where it should not have been.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.460
 They have very strict airlines in Mexico,

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.320
 and I'm sure they have them all over the world.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.960
 And if you deviate from that,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.000
 this plane was like 40 miles off

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.940
 of one of these air traffic lanes,

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.480
 it seems like you're smuggling drugs.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.580
 But even if it's not a drug smuggling plane,

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.840
 you wanna see if there's any survivors.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.440
 So the Mexican authorities send out rescue teams,

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.920
 air rescue teams, first to spot the wreckage,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.600
 see if they can find this plane.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.420
 The Mexican government has no idea

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:05.220
 that the US government was tracking an incoming object

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.900
 flying incredibly fast through the night sky.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.780
 They do not have access to that information.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.220
 So they send up their air rescue teams,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.860
 and as these planes are flying around

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.300
 looking for this fallen Cessna, they do spot it.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.460
 At 10 30 in the morning,

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.860
 it takes them a long time to catch this,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.140
 but it 'cause it's in the middle of the desert,

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.900
 they see the smoldering wreckage

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.820
 of this small private plane,

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.720
 and they call it in, the rescue team says,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.680
 "Hey, we found the plane, send in ground units,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.320
 "maybe there's still some people alive."

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.840
 But as this air recovery vehicle

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.840
 is still flying overhead, checking out the area,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.960
 it spots something else.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:47.480
 What they see is a silver disc

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.320
 that has crashed into the ground.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.560
 And from what they can tell,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.920
 it doesn't seem to be damaged.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.240
 I mean, they are kind of up in the air,

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.900
 but it's not in pieces, not like the Cessna was.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.780
 They see this disc, it was about 16 feet in diameter,

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.100
 all in one piece that it clearly crashed

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.340
 into the Mexican soil.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.900
 So they call that in too.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.820
 They say, "Hey, we don't know what this is,

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.020
 "but it looks like something else crashed out here."

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.480
 Maybe it collided into the Cessna.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.980
 Now, like every good conspiracy theorist know,

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.060
 the CIA has big ears.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.640
 They're constantly listening in, and they hear this.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.640
 At Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.660
 the word comes in that while the Mexican authorities

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.440
 were looking for a plane that crashed,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.400
 most likely a drug running plane, right?

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.000
 The CIA is like, "Oh no, our drugs, I mean, they're drugs.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.680
 "We have nothing to do with it."

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.560
 As the CIA are now wondering about

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.240
 how they're going to get more cocaine

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.240
 into the United States, they hear this call come over.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.520
 They hear this call come over saying,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.500
 "Hey, we saw this disc in the desert.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.800
 "We don't know what it is,

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.780
 "but when the rescue teams come out to check on the Cessna,

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.180
 "maybe we should send some people to the disc as well."

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.900
 And the government of Mexico agreed to that.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.660
 They said, "Yeah, we'll send out military."

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.740
 Because obviously this story is taking place in 1974.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.540
 People knew what a UFO was.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.900
 So they sent a military detachment to look at this disc,

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.180
 but even if it's not a UFO,

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.940
 could be some sort of government spy craft, right?

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.300
 So they do send the military out there.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.220
 They send rescue crews to the Cessna.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.800
 The CIA is intercepting all these transmissions.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.440
 They know for sure that the previous night,

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.920
 something was coming in through the night sky

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.520
 over the Gulf of Mexico,

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.400
 traveling extremely fast at an extremely high altitude.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.960
 Mexican government still has no access to that information.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.840
 So they go, that's obviously UFO.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.400
 First off, we know it's not ours.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.600
 We didn't have any spy planes there.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.440
 It's possible that it is like a Russian spy plane.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.000
 And if that's the case, we should go check it out.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.020
 But it could also be a UFO.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.620
 So they have all the information they need to go,

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.940
 except they don't have permission.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.880
 The CIA apparently at Fort Bliss

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.180
 was getting everything ready to go.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.940
 And the author, Robert Biddo says,

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.620
 "It seems like the CIA had done this so many times

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.500
 "that they knew exactly how many men they needed.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.540
 "They had all their equipment.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.900
 "They had four helicopters,

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.780
 "including a heavy lift super stallion copter

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.900
 "that's used for retrieval."

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.320
 That's a real helicopter.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.760
 It's always picking up UFOs.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.360
 Sometimes it's just moving more mundane things.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.220
 The CIA gets their recovery team together

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.520
 and they're loading up their helicopters,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.940
 but they technically need permission.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.780
 So the US government starts to coordinate

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.040
 with the Mexican government and saying,

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.360
 "Hey, we heard about that Cessna, that crash.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.520
 "We're so sorry.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.320
 "If you do have to find any drugs on that,

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.160
 "that wasn't ours.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.200
 "That wasn't the CIA moving drugs into the United States.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.100
 "Would you like any help with a recovery effort?"

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.400
 And the Mexican authorities were like,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.760
 "No, we're good.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.600
 "We're good.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.020
 "Is this just possibly a UFO out there, right?"

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.100
 Or the very least, some unknown spy crack.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.680
 So they say, "No, we don't need your help.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.380
 "It's just a Cessna.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.520
 "We can do it ourselves."

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.360
 And the US government's like,

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.200
 "Yeah, but the Cessna might have stuff on it

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.280
 "that you really aren't prepared for, right?"

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.280
 And the Mexican government's like,

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.520
 "We can take care of the Cessna

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.140
 "because really they just both want the UFO."

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.140
 Mexican government says,

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.440
 "You can't come over here.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.580
 "We've got to take care of it."

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.900
 Now the CIA is known for a lot of things,

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.140
 but most known for sticking their nose in business

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.900
 that they don't belong in.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.060
 They're being told, "Stay away."

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.900
 So the CIA goes,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.680
 "You know what, we're just gonna go over there anyways."

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.700
 Like we were just being nice, asking for permission.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.220
 They take those helicopters

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.380
 and they leave behind Fort Bliss.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.820
 They cross the US-Mexican border.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.080
 They are headed out to the desert.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.380
 As they're flying out there, they're getting this info.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.860
 They put a spy plane,

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.740
 'cause this isn't just the CIA at this point.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.140
 Apparently, according to the story from JS,

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.300
 presidents involved in this,

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.780
 US militaries involved in this,

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.180
 they have a spy plane and they're monitoring

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.700
 everything that's happening in the area of this disk crash.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.660
 'Cause the CIA knows exactly where it's at

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.820
 'cause they overheard all of the coordinates,

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.220
 locations, stuff like that.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.300
 And the spy plane says,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.820
 "Okay, we've seen there's a bunch of military trucks

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.740
 "have pulled up outside of this disk.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.780
 "They're actually loading it onto a flatbed."

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.540
 So they have, the Mexican authorities

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.020
 now have possession of this disk.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.780
 They've loaded it onto a flatbed

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.900
 and it's driving through the back roads.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.580
 They're not taking it in through the middle of Mexico City.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.100
 They're not having a parade or anything like that.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.140
 They're taking it along the back roads,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.540
 way on the outskirts.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.820
 And the CIA is these helicopters are flying overhead.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.540
 They keep intercepting this chatter.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.340
 They're getting radio communiques from the convoy,

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.140
 from the Mexican truck convoy

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.340
 to the Mexican government saying,

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.180
 "Yeah, we have it.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.220
 "We're headed down these roads."

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.380
 The spy plane's overhead.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.340
 And then the helicopters get word

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.400
 that the convoy has stopped.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.780
 It stopped in the middle of the desert

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.220
 on this dusty back road.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.580
 The convoy is no longer moving.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.360
 And all the radio chatter has stopped as well.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.020
 So these four helicopters are flying over the desert

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.500
 and they have no idea what happened.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.460
 But they're about to find out.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.380
 When the helicopters get there,

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.180
 sure enough, the convoy's completely stopped.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.940
 And they notice the helicopter's land

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.860
 and they, again, were very prepared.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.380
 This is why people think that

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.940
 they may have done this a few times before.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.260
 When they get out of their helicopters,

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.220
 they're wearing biohazard suits.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.460
 And they start walking up to the convoy

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.500
 and every single person in that convoy is dead.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.540
 Now, it doesn't say how many people there were in total.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.700
 It does state, the article did state

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.040
 that some of them were dead in their cars,

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.500
 which would imply that some of them

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.700
 were not in their vehicles when they died.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.860
 But what the CIA are now standing among

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.620
 is a mass casualty event.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.680
 All of these soldiers are dead

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.740
 and that UFO was still lashed down

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.060
 to the back of this flatbed truck.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:18.060
 So the CIA just take the UFO, they won't render any aid.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.460
 They don't have time to investigate any of this stuff.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.700
 They're not supposed to be here.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.860
 They were explicitly told to stay away.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.140
 We don't need your help.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.460
 They bring in that Super Stallion

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.460
 and they actually take the UFO off of the flatbed.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.700
 And then all four of these helicopters

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.780
 fly back over the US Mexican border.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.580
 And they take it to this remote location

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.340
 and at this point the CIA attach it

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.700
 to another flatbed truck.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.660
 And then no one knows where it ended.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.540
 That's pretty much the end of JS's story.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.380
 He says it either went back to Fort Bliss.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.340
 It was taken to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.500
 which is considered to be the true home

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.980
 of a lot of reverse engineered UFO craft.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.460
 Area 51, this is the conspiracy theory.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.420
 Area 51 is the decoy.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.220
 So it's an interesting thing.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.140
 So according to this story,

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.460
 it either ended up at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.960
 for Bliss or the Center for Disease Control.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.900
 Because here's the story.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.180
 We don't know if this story is true, right?

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.500
 And we'll get to what we do know is true.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.940
 We don't know what killed all of these soldiers.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.500
 One of the ideas is it was radiation leaking

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.500
 from the ship that killed them all.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.660
 It's possible, right?

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.260
 You can die pretty quickly

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.180
 if there's enough energy being released.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.220
 I don't know if they'd be able to even load it

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.460
 onto the flatbed.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.020
 They're like, oh, why do I feel so weak?

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.540
 Why do my bones feel like they're made of paper

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.260
 as they're loading it up?

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.380
 Some people believe that an alien could have gotten loose

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.700
 or the occupants of the ship,

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.540
 maybe not just one,

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.780
 could have gotten loose and torn them to pieces.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:00.340
 Kind of the thing that's accepted the most from the story

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.780
 that it might be some sort of disease leaking from it.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.140
 Some sort of, 'cause we know that we do that

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.940
 when we come to other places, other countries even,

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.940
 or other planets are trying to prevent us

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:12.780
 from bringing diseases,

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.660
 that maybe these people got some sort of fast-acting disease

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.980
 that wiped them out.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.300
 Which in that case, you would want to take it

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.460
 to the CDC where they could properly contain it.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.180
 You wouldn't want to take it back to Fort Bliss.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.340
 That's where all these CIA agents are.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.260
 And you're like, oh, let's just put it in this warehouse.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.740
 And then we'll go eat a hoagie outside

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.580
 and then they're all dying.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.660
 You would want to take it to somewhere

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.780
 where they could contain this.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.860
 And then the question goes, what happened to the convoy?

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.300
 So one theory is that the convoy was cleaned up.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.260
 Basically the Mexican authorities came out there,

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.340
 they saw everyone was dead,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.260
 that their UFO was missing.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.540
 And they either just covered the whole thing up,

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.460
 disposed of the bodies,

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.100
 or they actually destroyed the convoy.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.700
 They blew up the entire area

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.540
 because they didn't know what had caused it

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.380
 in the first place.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.460
 At this point, they would have figured,

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.860
 they would have been like, oh, the UFO must have flowed away.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.300
 At this point, they would have picked up

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.060
 that four helicopters went through their airspace.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.940
 All their stuff on radar would have picked all this stuff up.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.900
 They would have realized the CIA was part of it.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.740
 But they have to take care of these bodies.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.020
 And since they don't know what killed them

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.940
 and the CIA wouldn't be giving them that information,

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.180
 they destroyed everything that was out there,

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.300
 completely obliterated it from the face of the earth.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.380
 They just don't know.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:24.700
 What we do know is in 1974 on that date,

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.980
 August 25th, 1974,

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.380
 a Cessna did crash in Mexico in that area.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.220
 That's 100% true.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.340
 There's debate about whether or not it was a drug plane

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.820
 or just a plane that was 40 miles off course.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.920
 It was joyriding through Mexico.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.260
 It's interesting because that's a fact.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.900
 That's a fact.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.740
 And you can look it up,

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.020
 like when I was doing research on this on Wikipedia,

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.380
 they're like, yeah, a lot of people say

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.140
 that a UFO crashed in 1974,

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.420
 but it was really just this drug plane that went down.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.940
 So, you know, it was just that.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.780
 We don't know.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.620
 It was pretty brief.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.180
 It was on the Wikipedia page.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.380
 It was like UFO, what was it?

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:08.380
 It was in the Wikipedia page UFO sightings in Mexico.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.380
 And it was a fairly incomplete listing.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.740
 We've covered more on this show

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.880
 than are in that Wikipedia entry.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.660
 But they said, yeah, a lot of people think a UFO crashed,

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.260
 but it was really just a Cessna.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.500
 That's a weird debunking

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.160
 'cause no one's denying that a Cessna went down.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.380
 They're just saying that it crashed into this UFO.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.900
 Something was going on in these two vehicles collided.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.260
 But then Robert Biddo was actually looking deeper into this

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.020
 and he goes, what's weird is that it's agreed upon

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.780
 by the skeptics and the UFO community

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.060
 that a Cessna crashed in the desert.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.300
 He goes, that's not what's to debate.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.300
 However, he goes, I cannot find any name

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.340
 of someone who was piloting that plane.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.660
 He goes, listen, when planes go down,

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.960
 he goes, yeah, I was back in the 1970s and stuff like that.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.200
 But they would have the records when that plane left.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.640
 That plane had to issue a flight plan

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.200
 'cause we know it was going from El Paso to Mexico City.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.360
 He goes, there is no record of that plane ever

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.400
 issuing a flight plan.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.840
 There's no name of that pilot.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.400
 So he goes, it's weird because even the skeptics agree

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.840
 that a Cessna crashed in the desert,

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.660
 but I can't find anyone who ever flew this plane.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.820
 I can't get any actual concrete evidence

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.680
 that a plane did crash in the desert.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.940
 It's very, very weird.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.780
 It almost seemed like the better thing for skeptics to do

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.700
 is just say the whole thing's made up.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.380
 It's all made up, it never happened.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.180
 The skeptics say, yeah, a plane crashed,

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.580
 but it wasn't a UFO and the UFO community goes,

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.420
 well, the plane crashed and it was a UFO.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.700
 And Robert Biddo goes, what plane?

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.340
 Like, I can't find any proof that this plane existed now.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.360
 Even if it was a drug runner plane,

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.060
 you do have to issue a flight plan 2.8

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.560
 and then just fly to point B.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.800
 Fascinating story.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800
 Fascinating story.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.280
 It is most likely that the Cessna did crash out

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.120
 in the desert.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.700
 What caused it to crash?

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.540
 Who knows?

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.120
 It would seem weird that a plane crashing,

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.440
 which it's not super common,

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.900
 but it's also not terribly rare,

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.660
 would spark such a UFO flap.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.100
 But the reason why I really love the story

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.540
 is we get that moment by moment interaction

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.780
 between these governments over

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:23.240
 what would happen if a UFO actually crashed?

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.520
 If it crashed within your borders,

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.120
 you could completely cover it up,

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.440
 especially if it was in the middle of nowhere.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.800
 But when you have to cross international lines

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.480
 to get this disk, because what is the disk?

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.880
 Again, 1974, UFOs were considered a joke among the populace,

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.800
 but the US government made a concentrated effort

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.440
 to make people who reported UFOs a joke.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.240
 Like, that's what they did.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.720
 They got their fingers in the media,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.700
 which the government's always controlled the media.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.500
 And they said, "Just call 'em little green men

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.580
 and make these people look like kooks."

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.620
 But this is the type of stuff

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.120
 that would go on behind the scenes,

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.200
 people fighting for these artifacts.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.100
 And then where did it end up?

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.660
 Did it release some sort of biological weapon?

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.140
 And it's in the CDC and they're trying to figure it out,

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.980
 trying to create a cure for it, or trying to weaponize it?

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.420
 Was it reverse engineered?

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.860
 Did they take it apart?

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.720
 Did it was some sort of Russian spy craft?

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.480
 Who knows?

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.760
 And that's kind of the whole thing, who knows?

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.120
 We will never know whether or not

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.120
 we have disclosure tomorrow and alien life is revealed.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.280
 I still don't think we'll know

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.080
 about all these little operations over the years.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.920
 I don't think they'll be like,

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.320
 oh yeah, and then we invaded Mexico to take this disk

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.420
 and this is what they found.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.200
 I think when, if disclosure ever does happen,

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.600
 it will be played forward.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.900
 They'll never admit they lied to us all these years.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.300
 They'll never admit to that.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.700
 It's a fascinating story because it shows really

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.220
 what lengths the US government will go to control

00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:00.100
 access to this information, access to this technology.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.620
 They invaded this country.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.060
 I mean, it was just four helicopters,

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.380
 but let's call it what it is.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.700
 They invaded this country to steal this disk.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.780
 What would have happened if the Mexican soldier,

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.260
 actually, I just thought about this,

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.500
 who's this thing, they didn't kill all the Mexican soldiers.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.340
 And they just go, oh, when we got there,

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.700
 their bodies were already riddled with bullets.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.700
 I mean, riddled with disease.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.560
 And then we blew up the convoy

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.400
 to keep the disease from getting out.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.200
 I didn't think about that being a suggestion

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.900
 because what would happen if the CIA

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.060
 of those helicopters came out

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:34.040
 and the troops were still alive moving this convoy through?

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.620
 They would have taken it.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.340
 They 100% would have taken that disk.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.040
 And it goes to show the lengths

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.840
 that the US government, I really figure any superpower

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.380
 would go to to contain this technology.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:53.340
 Like if you knew that a vehicle of extraterrestrial origin

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.220
 crashed in another country,

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.100
 you would send people in to retrieve it.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.040
 And if those few people couldn't get it,

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.060
 you may actually invade that country in full,

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.240
 whip up some bizarre reason to go into that country,

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.840
 to restore democracy and get what you need.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.880
 And while you're there, you can install a dictator

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.000
 and see how that works out.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.880
 It doesn't work out well,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:21.040
 but at what point would you say, no, we'll let them have it?

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.920
 You could not let another country on earth

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.980
 have access to this type of technology.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.960
 That is how it would work out.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.400
 You can have all this talk about disclosure

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.160
 and Congress hearings and people giving

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.000
 these highfalutin speeches

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.200
 about how we need to know the truth.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.320
 But the truth comes with bullets in blood.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.680
 The truth comes from agencies

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.740
 like the Central Intelligence Agency

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.800
 taking these things from people.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.280
 We may believe that in the end,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.440
 having access to this high technology

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.560
 will bring humanity closer together,

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.120
 will unite us as one people as we explore the stars.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.600
 We may believe in the Star Trek future

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.440
 of exploring the cosmos as one people.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:12.320
 But the journey to get there is covered in gore.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:18.880
 It's crafted by countries invading each other

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.880
 to steal this technology by taking possible survivors

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.920
 from these crafts and interrogating them

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.800
 the only way we know how.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:36.520
 We may all want a future where we journey together

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.900
 as one species and explore the universe.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:47.200
 But that journey starts with dozens of dead bodies

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.640
 in a Mexican desert.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:57.200
