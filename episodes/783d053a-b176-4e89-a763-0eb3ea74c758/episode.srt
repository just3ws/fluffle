1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,560
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,760
 When a fast food worker is fired from an Arby's restaurant,

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,720
 he discovers the perfect revenge.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,200
 And then we travel to Mexico to take a look at a minute-by-minute

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,880
 account of what happens after a UFO crashes.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,360
 While the Mexican government and the CIA are both rushing

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,040
 to the scene of this fallen alien ship,

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,280
 little do they know they're both about to become participants

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,400
 in a mass casualty event today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,360
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,720
 Hey, everyone.

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,440
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,600
 I'm your host, Jason Garvin, and I'm having a great day.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,160
 Hope you guys are having a great day, too.

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,240
 Hope you guys had a fun weekend.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,880
 We've got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,240
 going to go ahead and get started right away walking

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,480
 into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,360
 It's one of our newest Patreon supporters.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,440
 Everyone on your feet.

33
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,000
 And give it up for Hammer.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,960
 Woo, yeah.

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,160
 Come on in, Hammer.

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,760
 Come on in, Hammer.

37
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,760
 Thank you so much for joining the Patreon.

38
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,520
 Hammer, you're going to be our captain, our pilot

39
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,080
 this episode.

40
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,720
 If you guys can't support the Patreon,

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,880
 I totally understand.

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,920
 Just helps with the word about the show that really,

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,880
 really, really helps out a lot.

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,880
 Now, Hammer, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

45
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,560
 to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

46
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,400
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

47
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,160
 We are going to fly all the way out to Missouri.

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,880
 [ROARING]

49
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,680
 And I hope you guys brought a lunch.

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,080
 But I hope you guys have not eaten it yet,

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,520
 because this story is disgusting, not just because we're

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,600
 going to an Arby's, the worst of all fast food restaurants.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,160
 I would rather live in a Long John Silvers

54
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,360
 than eat at an Arby's.

55
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,120
 Long John Silvers isn't that bad, but imagine

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,480
 if you're trying to sleep.

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
 People don't live in Long John Silvers,

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,120
 but they ring that bell whenever the service is good.

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,840
 Have you guys ever been a Long John Silvers?

60
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,920
 It's a fast food.

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
 We didn't have a soda on it before,

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
 because there is a conspiracy theory

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,400
 that Long John Silvers is connected to the marijuana.

64
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,520
 Allegedly, it's connected to the marijuana industry.

65
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,440
 There was this drug dealer who was

66
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,280
 trying to launder a bunch of drug money,

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,520
 and he knew the guy who started Long John Silvers.

68
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,280
 So he said, I'll give you this money.

69
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,280
 You can somehow convince people to eat fast food that is fish,

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,480
 and I'm going to launder this money.

71
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,840
 I'll see if I actually did that, or if I just had a dream.

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,280
 It is a real conspiracy theory.

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,360
 I'm pretty sure I did that episode.

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,000
 Long John Silvers, though.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,680
 Why are we talking about Long John Silvers?

76
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
 Okay, let's get to the Arby's thing.

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
 I'm not living in Long John Silvers.

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,360
 I don't need to go into their bell ringing technique.

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
 It's if the service is good during the bell.

80
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,880
 Anyways, has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

81
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,240
 Apparently, I'm just very hungry.

82
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,120
 In Missouri, in the city of Lee's Summit,

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,200
 they actually, we actually have the exact address

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,040
 for this place.

85
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,320
 If you want to go to this Arby's

86
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,200
 and take photographs and send them back to me,

87
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,800
 if you want to relive this event, you can.

88
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,080
 I don't recommend it.

89
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,480
 On Highway 291 and Northeast Tudor Road,

90
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,120
 this story begins.

91
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,600
 This fable of a young man begins in June of 2019.

92
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,040
 There's a Arby's worker named Tanner Maggard.

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,520
 And Tanner, he's 19 years old, and he's like,

94
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,840
 "Oh, my first job."

95
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,320
 And he walks into the Arby's and he's making

96
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,640
 roast beef sandwiches and he's preparing french fries

97
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,720
 or whatever other food they have.

98
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,040
 I need rings, I don't remember.

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,400
 'Cause I haven't eaten there in like 20 years.

100
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
 He's making all this food and he's like,

101
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,480
 "You know what? I really love working here.

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,760
 I don't just love the disgusting food.

103
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,440
 I like the disgusting atmosphere."

104
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,640
 He looks over at all the customers.

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
 They're all sloth people.

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,560
 He's like, "Yeah, this is the place I've always wanted to be.

107
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,640
 I've always wanted to work at an Arby's."

108
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,520
 He's this poor guy.

109
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,120
 "Trust me, trust me, you're not gonna feel sorry

110
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,440
 for this guy in a little bit."

111
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,080
 The fact that he's working at Arby's

112
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,120
 is really the high point of his life.

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
 Tanner is working at Arby's,

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
 but he doesn't work there very long

115
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,400
 because management has an issue with Tanner.

116
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,440
 Sure, he might show up on time.

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,520
 Sure, he might prepare the food correctly.

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,800
 Sure, he might have service with a smile.

119
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,800
 He also has a bad habit of setting fires in the kitchen.

120
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,000
 Not where it's supposed to be.

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,920
 He's not like lighting pilot lights or cooking food.

122
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,640
 Apparently, I don't know if he did this on his breaks.

123
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,840
 They're like, "If you're gonna do this,

124
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
 at least wait till your lunch hour, Tanner."

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,920
 Or if he was doing it on the clock,

126
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,960
 but he kept setting fire to the kitchen.

127
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,040
 And for whatever reason, there's a question.

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,880
 How many fires would one of your employees

129
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,160
 have to start a year-place-of-business before you fired him?

130
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
 I think the answer would be one.

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,360
 He set several fires during his time at Arby's.

132
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
 He kept setting stuff on fire.

133
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,320
 And after, I don't know, the eighth one,

134
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,360
 they're like, "Oh, we've talked about this seven times before.

135
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,960
 You can't set stuff on fire in the store.

136
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,120
 You're fired."

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,160
 They didn't even mean the pun.

138
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
 They didn't mean the pun.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,960
 He's like, "Oh, no!"

140
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,660
 So he's fired and he leaves.

141
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,580
 But then, on October 19th, 2019,

142
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,760
 it's been four months since he's been unjustly fired

143
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,880
 for trying to burn down in Arby's.

144
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,380
 He comes back into the Arby's.

145
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,980
 Now, I'm sure he stopped by several times

146
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,680
 between June and October.

147
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,940
 They didn't seem super alarmed when we walked back in,

148
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,840
 but they knew he was a weirdo.

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
 They knew this guy was a weirdo.

150
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,440
 One, he worked at Arby's right,

151
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,460
 and they all know there's something wrong

152
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,580
 with you if you worked there.

153
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,320
 But two, he was set up on fire.

154
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,520
 But, you know, sometimes you gotta eat where you gotta eat.

155
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,340
 So he comes into the Arby's on October 19th,

156
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,260
 and he places an order, and then he goes to the bathroom,

157
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,980
 which is usually the opposite order.

158
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,820
 Right?

159
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,860
 Normally, you eat Arby's and then have explosive diarrhea.

160
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,500
 But before he even gets the food,

161
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,860
 he places the order and he goes into the bathroom.

162
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,100
 Then, a short time later, he comes out

163
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,580
 and he tells the manager,

164
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,500
 "Oh, I see you remodeled the bathroom."

165
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,340
 Huh.

166
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,020
 And then he gets his food and he sits down.

167
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,340
 The manager's like, "Oh, man, this guy's so weird.

168
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,980
 "We didn't remodel the bathroom.

169
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,280
 "Why would he say something like that?

170
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,340
 "I'm too busy."

171
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,260
 Shortly after this exchange,

172
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,840
 Tanner goes back into the bathroom.

173
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,200
 And the manager has to go into the bathroom to clean it.

174
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,920
 It's time for their monthly cleaning

175
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,320
 at the Arby's restaurant.

176
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,780
 He goes into the bathroom and he's cleaning up the bathroom.

177
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,280
 But Tanner is in a stall.

178
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,880
 And when the manager's in there,

179
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,000
 and he's like, "Dum-dum-dum-dum."

180
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,680
 He's like picking up toilet paper

181
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,160
 or like wiping down the urinal, whatever.

182
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,440
 He hears Tanner in the bathroom stall going,

183
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,280
 "Ugh."

184
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,220
 "Ugh."

185
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,140
 He hears some gagging and retching.

186
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,260
 And then he's just like, "Oh, man,

187
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,060
 "this place is hard enough to work.

188
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,140
 "It's hard enough to work here.

189
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,640
 "And now I got this dude, this ex-employee,

190
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,540
 "gagging in the stall."

191
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,180
 "Ugh."

192
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,220
 So the manager just trying to,

193
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,620
 I feel so bad for this manager.

194
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,980
 He's just trying to do his job, man.

195
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,980
 He's just trying to clean this up.

196
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,820
 So he leaves.

197
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,660
 Obviously he needs to clean the whole bathroom.

198
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,460
 Tanner's in part of it, he's in the stall.

199
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,320
 You don't necessarily wanna ask,

200
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,700
 "Are you okay in there, buddy?"

201
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,540
 "Ugh."

202
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,620
 The manager leaves the bathroom

203
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,260
 and then waits for Tanner to leave

204
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,740
 so he can finish cleaning up.

205
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,540
 Tanner ends up leaving the bathroom

206
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,480
 and the manager's like, "Oh, finally."

207
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,880
 And he goes in and he opens the stall

208
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,720
 where Tanner had been previously.

209
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,420
 And what he finds is,

210
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,900
 so in a lot of restrooms,

211
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,700
 they have the baby changing stations.

212
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,420
 I actually think it might be required by law.

213
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,900
 I'm not for sure, but they have those plastic things

214
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,100
 that come down so you can put,

215
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,340
 'cause there's nothing you wanna put your baby on

216
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,340
 than a piece of plastic that who knows

217
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,700
 if it'll hold the weight of your baby

218
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,260
 in an Arby's bathroom.

219
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,740
 You have the baby changing station

220
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,580
 on the baby changing station in the stall

221
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,460
 is a headless cat.

222
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,940
 And that would be troubling enough, right?

223
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,180
 If you walked into a bathroom

224
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,060
 and there was a cat with no head,

225
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,340
 not only did the cat have no,

226
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,180
 (laughs)

227
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,460
 I'll call the girl pause to give you guys time

228
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,060
 to skip ahead,

229
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,380
 not only did the cat have no head,

230
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,100
 it was disemboweled.

231
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,780
 It was completely mutilated.

232
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,500
 And all over the walls of the bathroom stall

233
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,580
 and all over the toilet and all over the door

234
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,380
 was cat blood and cat intestines.

235
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,700
 And it didn't have a head.

236
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,020
 The head was there, apparently.

237
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,980
 They didn't say where it was.

238
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,020
 I don't know if it was like propped up somewhere

239
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,740
 if it was just rolling around on the ground.

240
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,500
 The manager's all playing hacky sack with the cat head

241
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,700
 until the police show up

242
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,140
 because that's what he did, obviously,

243
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,940
 this guy called the cops.

244
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,900
 Disgusting.

245
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,220
 And when the manager came out of the bathroom,

246
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,020
 he saw Tanner sitting in his truck in the parking lot

247
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,300
 watching the manager.

248
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,100
 Like he wanted to see what the manager's reaction was.

249
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,860
 And then when Tanner saw him playing hacky sack

250
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,700
 with the cat head, he's like,

251
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,140
 "Oh, why didn't I think of that?"

252
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,860
 Tanner drove away, right when he saw the manager,

253
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,300
 right when they locked eyes, he drove away.

254
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,940
 Now, obviously, you guys might not know this.

255
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,580
 You guys might have never hired anybody.

256
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,380
 But generally when you get a job,

257
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,940
 you have to list your home address,

258
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,640
 your phone number, your social security number,

259
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,780
 all that stuff.

260
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,420
 So the manager just called the cops and said,

261
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,380
 "Hey, I'm a little alarmed here.

262
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,580
 "A man just eviscerated a cat in our bathroom.

263
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,100
 "And he's a known pyromaniac."

264
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,000
 And the police said the cat didn't smell.

265
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,140
 I didn't know this was a thing.

266
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,060
 I thought like if you cut something open

267
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,420
 to my remaining zero listeners for this segment,

268
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,940
 I thought if you cut something open,

269
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,100
 it would be stinky, right?

270
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,620
 But apparently not.

271
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,820
 Apparently if you kill, okay, I should just stop now.

272
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,700
 But apparently if it's a fresh kill,

273
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,500
 it's less stinky, it's not super stinky.

274
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,100
 The reason why this is important,

275
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,460
 because if he had found a dead cat

276
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,700
 that had been like roadkill for a while,

277
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,380
 they would have smelled it and they would have been like,

278
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,820
 "Oh, he just picked a cat up off the road."

279
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,660
 Like he found a previously dead cat and did this.

280
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
 What, the police go,

281
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,500
 "There's no rotten smell to this cat."

282
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,240
 That means he just killed it.

283
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,100
 He probably brought a live cat into the Arby's restaurant

284
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,100
 and killed it there.

285
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,900
 Tanner was charged with second degree animal abuse,

286
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,860
 which really makes me think, what's first degree?

287
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,300
 Like if killing a cat,

288
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,580
 bringing a cat into an Arby's

289
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,460
 in and of itself is an animal abuse,

290
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,220
 killing a cat in a bathroom stall,

291
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,620
 that's second degree, what's first degree?

292
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,260
 Like what could you possibly do that's worse than this?

293
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,300
 Don't tell me, don't send me images or anything or links.

294
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,420
 I'm just wondering.

295
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,380
 And he also got charged with property damage

296
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,880
 because he messed up their bathroom stall.

297
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,980
 They had to repaint it and everything.

298
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,660
 Now you can go, like I said, I gave you the address.

299
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,500
 You can go check this out.

300
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,740
 I want some of my intrepid listeners to road trip out there

301
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,860
 and see if they can detect the blood, bring some luminol.

302
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,940
 I find it so fascinating though,

303
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,540
 that how does a person like this,

304
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,360
 even have a job in the first place?

305
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,700
 Like how does a person like this

306
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,340
 have the wherewithal to fill out forms

307
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,660
 and put down their social security number?

308
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,600
 'Cause obviously he's setting stuff on fire

309
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,180
 and he's killing cats.

310
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,980
 Like this wasn't his first rodeo, right?

311
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,300
 It couldn't have been.

312
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,620
 I can't imagine someone sitting there one day

313
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,920
 and be like, oh man, I really hate

314
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,740
 that I got fired four months ago.

315
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,520
 I know what I'm gonna do.

316
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,020
 Dada, I'm gonna kill a cat and da da da da da.

317
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,460
 He had to have been doing this before.

318
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,460
 Doesn't it seem like there would be a ramp up to this?

319
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,860
 Or am I wrong?

320
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,660
 Are people just that easy to just push?

321
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,620
 That easy to just kind of push to the edge?

322
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,660
 It's funny because just maybe 10 minutes

323
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,880
 before recording the segment,

324
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,580
 I was on the Patreon Discord.

325
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,900
 They get to listen to these episodes live

326
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,160
 and me and a long time listener of the show, Rudy Jazz,

327
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,560
 we're just talking about the story of Ian Watkins,

328
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,080
 lead singer of the Lost Prophets.

329
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,680
 This is gonna get real dark real quick.

330
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,520
 I didn't plan on this.

331
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,080
 This literally happened 10 minutes ago,

332
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,320
 but me and Rudy Jazz were talking about Ian Watkins.

333
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,840
 He was a singer of the Lost Prophets.

334
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,720
 It was like this new metal band or emo metal band,

335
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,440
 whatever, they're really big.

336
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
 They're really big.

337
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,280
 And apparently he started having sex with babies

338
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,520
 at some point during his career.

339
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,540
 And the question is, was he always attracted to babies?

340
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,540
 Or did he become attracted to babies

341
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,700
 while he was on tour with the Lost Prophets?

342
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,420
 The rest of the band had no idea this was going on.

343
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,660
 They had no idea at all.

344
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,460
 They were totally flabbergasted

345
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,540
 when the cops pulled out their lead singer

346
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,900
 and they're like, "Oh, what's he being charged for?

347
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,740
 "Doing meth?"

348
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,180
 'Cause he also did a bunch of meth.

349
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,700
 He was also a meth head.

350
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,540
 "What's he being charged for?

351
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,380
 "Are you pig?

352
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,600
 "Why are you arresting the lead singer of our band?

353
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,360
 "What is this, some sort of police state?"

354
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,780
 And then the cops turned around and they're like,

355
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,320
 "Dude, we don't even want to see what he's doing out loud.

356
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,080
 "It's so disgusting, just trust us.

357
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,200
 "Here's the arrest warrant."

358
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,040
 And the rest of the band was like,

359
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,440
 "Oh my God, that guy's disgusting.

360
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,600
 "Can we go to the police station

361
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 "and beat him up for you?"

362
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,480
 Like what happened?

363
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
 Was he always attracted to babies?

364
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,060
 Or did he become attracted to babies?

365
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,480
 Now the meth didn't help.

366
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,220
 He might have been a totally normal person.

367
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,500
 Meth is satanic.

368
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,140
 Like the stuff that you go through

369
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,460
 when you're on meth is just so insane.

370
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,780
 Who knows?

371
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,260
 So maybe Tanner Maggard was just a normal dude

372
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,220
 who one day started setting stuff on fire.

373
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,260
 See, that doesn't track at all.

374
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,460
 Most normal people just don't start setting stuff on fire

375
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,740
 and killing cats.

376
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,460
 At what point did he become a psycho?

377
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,660
 That's so fascinating.

378
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,020
 Maybe it was something inside of him.

379
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,520
 Maybe making one too many cheddar roast beef sandwiches

380
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,000
 drove him insane.

381
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,120
 Who knows?

382
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,920
 But I don't think this is the first cat he killed.

383
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,400
 There's no other information on him.

384
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,560
 I found this article and then he was charged

385
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,760
 with second degree animal abuse,

386
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,960
 second degree property damage.

387
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,160
 I couldn't find the results of the trial.

388
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,720
 A lot of stuff that's happened,

389
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,640
 like if you were arrested in October of 2019,

390
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,840
 what was it five months later,

391
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,400
 the entire country shut down due to the pandemic?

392
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,580
 So he's probably still facing these charges.

393
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,740
 Maybe they've dropped him by now.

394
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,700
 Maybe he's still wandering the streets of Lee's Summit

395
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,620
 looking for cats.

396
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,140
 I should also say allegedly 'cause he hasn't been found guilty.

397
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,020
 He actually denied that he did all this stuff

398
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,140
 and then I compared him to Ian Watkins,

399
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,340
 one of the grossest people.

400
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,340
 So Tanner, if you didn't do this, I apologize.

401
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,020
 But if he did do this, you're sick, allegedly.

402
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,260
 Hammer, let's go ahead and toss you

403
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,980
 the keys of the carboner copter.

404
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,800
 We are leaving behind this Arby's.

405
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,460
 We are headed all the way out to Mexico.

406
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,800
 (imitates car engine)

407
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,840
 The cats are running the helicopter.

408
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,080
 They're like, "Save us, save us."

409
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,800
 We're catching all the kittens that we can.

410
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,280
 It's Tanner's chasing them down the street.

411
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,920
 Allegedly, we're flying out to Mexico.

412
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,000
 I found this story the other day.

413
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,980
 This is awesome.

414
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,860
 This story's really cool because we hear a lot of stories

415
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,040
 about UFO crashes.

416
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,320
 They're actually not super common,

417
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,500
 but obviously they're the big ones like Roswell.

418
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,700
 We hear these stories about UFO crashes.

419
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,260
 We hear these stories about retrievals,

420
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,300
 like they went and they got the UFO

421
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,780
 and then they put it on a flatbed truck.

422
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,340
 But I've never come across a story that is so detailed.

423
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,060
 Like this is almost a blow-by-blow account

424
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,540
 of what would happen if a UFO fell from the sky.

425
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,620
 I got most of my information from a website

426
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
 called Mexico Unexplained.

427
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,840
 It's what it sounds like.

428
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,360
 It's a paranormal UFO website that specializes

429
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,480
 in stuff that happens in Mexico

430
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,960
 and there's a ton of it going on down there.

431
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,080
 And this article was written by Robert Bitto.

432
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,400
 So I wanna give him a shout out.

433
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,080
 Great, great story.

434
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,400
 He got it.

435
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,600
 So the setup for this story was,

436
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
 there was a UFO investigator.

437
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,400
 I believe she's still alive.

438
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,160
 There's a UFO investigator named Elaine Douglas.

439
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,760
 And she got an anonymous letter.

440
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,880
 Well, there's initials to it.

441
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,680
 JS claiming to be part of something called Deneb Team,

442
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,360
 which is a retrieval unit.

443
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,700
 And so that's the setup for the story.

444
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,940
 There's been like a very famous book written

445
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,520
 about this incident,

446
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,780
 but it's flowing under the radar, no pun intended.

447
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,460
 I thank for people in America.

448
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,740
 I had never heard this before.

449
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,400
 I don't know how famous it is overall,

450
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,220
 but it seems to be pretty rare.

451
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,380
 It's not like a well-known story.

452
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,980
 However, there is actually a cover story for this as well.

453
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,280
 Like it's popular enough

454
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,720
 that the government kind of had to issue a statement about it,

455
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,420
 but very, very fascinating.

456
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,940
 Let's get into this.

457
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:23,640
 It's August 25th, 1974, 10 p.m.

458
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,060
 And at a U.S. air defense base,

459
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,640
 all of a sudden something pops up on their monitors.

460
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,800
 (humming)

461
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,960
 Sir, sir, come over here, look at this monitor.

462
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,280
 Look at this, he's pointing at it.

463
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,460
 He's like, "Get your finger out of the way.

464
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,920
 I wanna see what you're pointing at."

465
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,720
 An object is flying over the Gulf of Mexico.

466
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,660
 It's going to enter U.S. airspace in about an hour.

467
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,080
 It's moving at 2,500 miles per hour

468
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,280
 and it's 75,000 feet up.

469
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,800
 Well, it's probably a meteor, right?

470
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,640
 It's probably something that high up traveling that fast.

471
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,960
 It's probably something, it's a shooting star.

472
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,920
 Make a wish, make a wish, young man.

473
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,180
 Make a wish, person who should be watching this machine.

474
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,340
 Maybe it'll come true.

475
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,500
 But what happens is this object begins to slow down

476
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,740
 and then turn.

477
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,460
 It's still headed towards the U.S.,

478
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,020
 but now it's coming at a different angle.

479
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,340
 And apparently multiple people were tracking this

480
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,780
 in the United States and at first,

481
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,260
 they both thought it could be a meteor,

482
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,900
 but meteors tend not to,

483
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,940
 meteors tend not to slow down and turn.

484
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,360
 It ends up dropping as low as 25,000 feet.

485
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,560
 (humming)

486
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,240
 We lost it, sir.

487
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,780
 It dropped off radar and the commander goes,

488
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,560
 "Hmm, hmm, very, very interesting."

489
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,680
 And he walks away.

490
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,320
 He's like, "Oh man, my wish isn't going to come true now."

491
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,080
 Single-tier drop.

492
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,600
 About an hour later,

493
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,680
 about an hour later,

494
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,720
 the radio chatter starts to pop up over the airwaves.

495
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,540
 A Cessna, a private plane leaving El Paso, Texas,

496
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,500
 headed towards Mexico City, crashed in the desert.

497
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,160
 Somewhere in the state of Chihuahua,

498
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,860
 near a town known as Koyami,

499
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,100
 the Cessna went down.

500
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,100
 That was the last place they picked it up.

501
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,140
 August 26th, it's early morning now.

502
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,500
 It's like between midnight and 1 a.m.,

503
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,300
 Mexican authorities start to try to find this Cessna

504
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,700
 that crashed.

505
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,660
 Now, here's the thing.

506
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,320
 Where it was at is where it should not have been.

507
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,460
 They have very strict airlines in Mexico,

508
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,320
 and I'm sure they have them all over the world.

509
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,960
 And if you deviate from that,

510
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,000
 this plane was like 40 miles off

511
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,940
 of one of these air traffic lanes,

512
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,480
 it seems like you're smuggling drugs.

513
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,580
 But even if it's not a drug smuggling plane,

514
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,840
 you wanna see if there's any survivors.

515
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,440
 So the Mexican authorities send out rescue teams,

516
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,920
 air rescue teams, first to spot the wreckage,

517
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,600
 see if they can find this plane.

518
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,420
 The Mexican government has no idea

519
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,220
 that the US government was tracking an incoming object

520
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,900
 flying incredibly fast through the night sky.

521
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,780
 They do not have access to that information.

522
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,220
 So they send up their air rescue teams,

523
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,860
 and as these planes are flying around

524
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,300
 looking for this fallen Cessna, they do spot it.

525
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,460
 At 10 30 in the morning,

526
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,860
 it takes them a long time to catch this,

527
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,140
 but it 'cause it's in the middle of the desert,

528
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,900
 they see the smoldering wreckage

529
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,820
 of this small private plane,

530
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,720
 and they call it in, the rescue team says,

531
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,680
 "Hey, we found the plane, send in ground units,

532
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,320
 "maybe there's still some people alive."

533
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,840
 But as this air recovery vehicle

534
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,840
 is still flying overhead, checking out the area,

535
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,960
 it spots something else.

536
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,480
 What they see is a silver disc

537
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,320
 that has crashed into the ground.

538
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,560
 And from what they can tell,

539
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,920
 it doesn't seem to be damaged.

540
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,240
 I mean, they are kind of up in the air,

541
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,900
 but it's not in pieces, not like the Cessna was.

542
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,780
 They see this disc, it was about 16 feet in diameter,

543
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,100
 all in one piece that it clearly crashed

544
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,340
 into the Mexican soil.

545
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,900
 So they call that in too.

546
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,820
 They say, "Hey, we don't know what this is,

547
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,020
 "but it looks like something else crashed out here."

548
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,480
 Maybe it collided into the Cessna.

549
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,980
 Now, like every good conspiracy theorist know,

550
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,060
 the CIA has big ears.

551
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,640
 They're constantly listening in, and they hear this.

552
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,640
 At Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas,

553
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,660
 the word comes in that while the Mexican authorities

554
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,440
 were looking for a plane that crashed,

555
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,400
 most likely a drug running plane, right?

556
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,000
 The CIA is like, "Oh no, our drugs, I mean, they're drugs.

557
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,680
 "We have nothing to do with it."

558
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,560
 As the CIA are now wondering about

559
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,240
 how they're going to get more cocaine

560
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,240
 into the United States, they hear this call come over.

561
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,520
 They hear this call come over saying,

562
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,500
 "Hey, we saw this disc in the desert.

563
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,800
 "We don't know what it is,

564
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,780
 "but when the rescue teams come out to check on the Cessna,

565
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,180
 "maybe we should send some people to the disc as well."

566
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,900
 And the government of Mexico agreed to that.

567
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,660
 They said, "Yeah, we'll send out military."

568
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,740
 Because obviously this story is taking place in 1974.

569
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,540
 People knew what a UFO was.

570
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,900
 So they sent a military detachment to look at this disc,

571
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,180
 but even if it's not a UFO,

572
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,940
 could be some sort of government spy craft, right?

573
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,300
 So they do send the military out there.

574
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,220
 They send rescue crews to the Cessna.

575
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,800
 The CIA is intercepting all these transmissions.

576
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,440
 They know for sure that the previous night,

577
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,920
 something was coming in through the night sky

578
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,520
 over the Gulf of Mexico,

579
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,400
 traveling extremely fast at an extremely high altitude.

580
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,960
 Mexican government still has no access to that information.

581
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,840
 So they go, that's obviously UFO.

582
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,400
 First off, we know it's not ours.

583
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,600
 We didn't have any spy planes there.

584
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,440
 It's possible that it is like a Russian spy plane.

585
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,000
 And if that's the case, we should go check it out.

586
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,020
 But it could also be a UFO.

587
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,620
 So they have all the information they need to go,

588
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,940
 except they don't have permission.

589
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,880
 The CIA apparently at Fort Bliss

590
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,180
 was getting everything ready to go.

591
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,940
 And the author, Robert Biddo says,

592
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,620
 "It seems like the CIA had done this so many times

593
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,500
 "that they knew exactly how many men they needed.

594
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,540
 "They had all their equipment.

595
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,900
 "They had four helicopters,

596
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,780
 "including a heavy lift super stallion copter

597
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,900
 "that's used for retrieval."

598
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,320
 That's a real helicopter.

599
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,760
 It's always picking up UFOs.

600
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,360
 Sometimes it's just moving more mundane things.

601
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,220
 The CIA gets their recovery team together

602
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,520
 and they're loading up their helicopters,

603
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,940
 but they technically need permission.

604
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,780
 So the US government starts to coordinate

605
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,040
 with the Mexican government and saying,

606
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,360
 "Hey, we heard about that Cessna, that crash.

607
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,520
 "We're so sorry.

608
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,320
 "If you do have to find any drugs on that,

609
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,160
 "that wasn't ours.

610
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,200
 "That wasn't the CIA moving drugs into the United States.

611
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,100
 "Would you like any help with a recovery effort?"

612
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,400
 And the Mexican authorities were like,

613
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,760
 "No, we're good.

614
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,600
 "We're good.

615
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,020
 "Is this just possibly a UFO out there, right?"

616
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,100
 Or the very least, some unknown spy crack.

617
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,680
 So they say, "No, we don't need your help.

618
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,380
 "It's just a Cessna.

619
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,520
 "We can do it ourselves."

620
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,360
 And the US government's like,

621
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,200
 "Yeah, but the Cessna might have stuff on it

622
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,280
 "that you really aren't prepared for, right?"

623
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
 And the Mexican government's like,

624
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,520
 "We can take care of the Cessna

625
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,140
 "because really they just both want the UFO."

626
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,140
 Mexican government says,

627
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,440
 "You can't come over here.

628
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,580
 "We've got to take care of it."

629
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,900
 Now the CIA is known for a lot of things,

630
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,140
 but most known for sticking their nose in business

631
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,900
 that they don't belong in.

632
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,060
 They're being told, "Stay away."

633
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,900
 So the CIA goes,

634
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,680
 "You know what, we're just gonna go over there anyways."

635
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,700
 Like we were just being nice, asking for permission.

636
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,220
 They take those helicopters

637
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,380
 and they leave behind Fort Bliss.

638
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,820
 They cross the US-Mexican border.

639
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,080
 They are headed out to the desert.

640
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,380
 As they're flying out there, they're getting this info.

641
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,860
 They put a spy plane,

642
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,740
 'cause this isn't just the CIA at this point.

643
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,140
 Apparently, according to the story from JS,

644
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,300
 presidents involved in this,

645
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,780
 US militaries involved in this,

646
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,180
 they have a spy plane and they're monitoring

647
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,700
 everything that's happening in the area of this disk crash.

648
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,660
 'Cause the CIA knows exactly where it's at

649
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,820
 'cause they overheard all of the coordinates,

650
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,220
 locations, stuff like that.

651
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,300
 And the spy plane says,

652
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,820
 "Okay, we've seen there's a bunch of military trucks

653
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,740
 "have pulled up outside of this disk.

654
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,780
 "They're actually loading it onto a flatbed."

655
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,540
 So they have, the Mexican authorities

656
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,020
 now have possession of this disk.

657
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,780
 They've loaded it onto a flatbed

658
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,900
 and it's driving through the back roads.

659
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,580
 They're not taking it in through the middle of Mexico City.

660
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,100
 They're not having a parade or anything like that.

661
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,140
 They're taking it along the back roads,

662
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,540
 way on the outskirts.

663
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,820
 And the CIA is these helicopters are flying overhead.

664
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,540
 They keep intercepting this chatter.

665
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,340
 They're getting radio communiques from the convoy,

666
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,140
 from the Mexican truck convoy

667
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,340
 to the Mexican government saying,

668
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,180
 "Yeah, we have it.

669
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,220
 "We're headed down these roads."

670
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,380
 The spy plane's overhead.

671
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,340
 And then the helicopters get word

672
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,400
 that the convoy has stopped.

673
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,780
 It stopped in the middle of the desert

674
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,220
 on this dusty back road.

675
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,580
 The convoy is no longer moving.

676
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,360
 And all the radio chatter has stopped as well.

677
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,020
 So these four helicopters are flying over the desert

678
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,500
 and they have no idea what happened.

679
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,460
 But they're about to find out.

680
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,380
 When the helicopters get there,

681
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,180
 sure enough, the convoy's completely stopped.

682
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,940
 And they notice the helicopter's land

683
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,860
 and they, again, were very prepared.

684
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,380
 This is why people think that

685
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,940
 they may have done this a few times before.

686
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,260
 When they get out of their helicopters,

687
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,220
 they're wearing biohazard suits.

688
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,460
 And they start walking up to the convoy

689
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,500
 and every single person in that convoy is dead.

690
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,540
 Now, it doesn't say how many people there were in total.

691
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,700
 It does state, the article did state

692
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,040
 that some of them were dead in their cars,

693
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,500
 which would imply that some of them

694
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,700
 were not in their vehicles when they died.

695
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,860
 But what the CIA are now standing among

696
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,620
 is a mass casualty event.

697
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,680
 All of these soldiers are dead

698
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,740
 and that UFO was still lashed down

699
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,060
 to the back of this flatbed truck.

700
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,060
 So the CIA just take the UFO, they won't render any aid.

701
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,460
 They don't have time to investigate any of this stuff.

702
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,700
 They're not supposed to be here.

703
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,860
 They were explicitly told to stay away.

704
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,140
 We don't need your help.

705
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,460
 They bring in that Super Stallion

706
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,460
 and they actually take the UFO off of the flatbed.

707
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,700
 And then all four of these helicopters

708
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,780
 fly back over the US Mexican border.

709
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,580
 And they take it to this remote location

710
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,340
 and at this point the CIA attach it

711
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,700
 to another flatbed truck.

712
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,660
 And then no one knows where it ended.

713
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,540
 That's pretty much the end of JS's story.

714
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,380
 He says it either went back to Fort Bliss.

715
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,340
 It was taken to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio,

716
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,500
 which is considered to be the true home

717
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,980
 of a lot of reverse engineered UFO craft.

718
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,460
 Area 51, this is the conspiracy theory.

719
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,420
 Area 51 is the decoy.

720
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,220
 So it's an interesting thing.

721
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,140
 So according to this story,

722
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,460
 it either ended up at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

723
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,960
 for Bliss or the Center for Disease Control.

724
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,900
 Because here's the story.

725
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,180
 We don't know if this story is true, right?

726
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,500
 And we'll get to what we do know is true.

727
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,940
 We don't know what killed all of these soldiers.

728
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,500
 One of the ideas is it was radiation leaking

729
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 from the ship that killed them all.

730
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,660
 It's possible, right?

731
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,260
 You can die pretty quickly

732
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,180
 if there's enough energy being released.

733
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,220
 I don't know if they'd be able to even load it

734
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,460
 onto the flatbed.

735
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,020
 They're like, oh, why do I feel so weak?

736
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,540
 Why do my bones feel like they're made of paper

737
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,260
 as they're loading it up?

738
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,380
 Some people believe that an alien could have gotten loose

739
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,700
 or the occupants of the ship,

740
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,540
 maybe not just one,

741
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,780
 could have gotten loose and torn them to pieces.

742
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,340
 Kind of the thing that's accepted the most from the story

743
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,780
 that it might be some sort of disease leaking from it.

744
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,140
 Some sort of, 'cause we know that we do that

745
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,940
 when we come to other places, other countries even,

746
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,940
 or other planets are trying to prevent us

747
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,780
 from bringing diseases,

748
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,660
 that maybe these people got some sort of fast-acting disease

749
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,980
 that wiped them out.

750
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,300
 Which in that case, you would want to take it

751
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,460
 to the CDC where they could properly contain it.

752
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,180
 You wouldn't want to take it back to Fort Bliss.

753
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,340
 That's where all these CIA agents are.

754
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,260
 And you're like, oh, let's just put it in this warehouse.

755
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,740
 And then we'll go eat a hoagie outside

756
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,580
 and then they're all dying.

757
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,660
 You would want to take it to somewhere

758
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,780
 where they could contain this.

759
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,860
 And then the question goes, what happened to the convoy?

760
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,300
 So one theory is that the convoy was cleaned up.

761
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,260
 Basically the Mexican authorities came out there,

762
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,340
 they saw everyone was dead,

763
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,260
 that their UFO was missing.

764
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,540
 And they either just covered the whole thing up,

765
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,460
 disposed of the bodies,

766
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,100
 or they actually destroyed the convoy.

767
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,700
 They blew up the entire area

768
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,540
 because they didn't know what had caused it

769
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,380
 in the first place.

770
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,460
 At this point, they would have figured,

771
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,860
 they would have been like, oh, the UFO must have flowed away.

772
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,300
 At this point, they would have picked up

773
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,060
 that four helicopters went through their airspace.

774
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,940
 All their stuff on radar would have picked all this stuff up.

775
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,900
 They would have realized the CIA was part of it.

776
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,740
 But they have to take care of these bodies.

777
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,020
 And since they don't know what killed them

778
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,940
 and the CIA wouldn't be giving them that information,

779
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,180
 they destroyed everything that was out there,

780
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,300
 completely obliterated it from the face of the earth.

781
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,380
 They just don't know.

782
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,700
 What we do know is in 1974 on that date,

783
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,980
 August 25th, 1974,

784
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,380
 a Cessna did crash in Mexico in that area.

785
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,220
 That's 100% true.

786
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,340
 There's debate about whether or not it was a drug plane

787
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,820
 or just a plane that was 40 miles off course.

788
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,920
 It was joyriding through Mexico.

789
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,260
 It's interesting because that's a fact.

790
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,900
 That's a fact.

791
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,740
 And you can look it up,

792
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,020
 like when I was doing research on this on Wikipedia,

793
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,380
 they're like, yeah, a lot of people say

794
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,140
 that a UFO crashed in 1974,

795
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,420
 but it was really just this drug plane that went down.

796
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,940
 So, you know, it was just that.

797
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,780
 We don't know.

798
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,620
 It was pretty brief.

799
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,180
 It was on the Wikipedia page.

800
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,380
 It was like UFO, what was it?

801
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,380
 It was in the Wikipedia page UFO sightings in Mexico.

802
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,380
 And it was a fairly incomplete listing.

803
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,740
 We've covered more on this show

804
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,880
 than are in that Wikipedia entry.

805
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,660
 But they said, yeah, a lot of people think a UFO crashed,

806
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,260
 but it was really just a Cessna.

807
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,500
 That's a weird debunking

808
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,160
 'cause no one's denying that a Cessna went down.

809
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,380
 They're just saying that it crashed into this UFO.

810
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,900
 Something was going on in these two vehicles collided.

811
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,260
 But then Robert Biddo was actually looking deeper into this

812
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,020
 and he goes, what's weird is that it's agreed upon

813
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,780
 by the skeptics and the UFO community

814
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,060
 that a Cessna crashed in the desert.

815
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,300
 He goes, that's not what's to debate.

816
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:51,300
 However, he goes, I cannot find any name

817
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,340
 of someone who was piloting that plane.

818
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,660
 He goes, listen, when planes go down,

819
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,960
 he goes, yeah, I was back in the 1970s and stuff like that.

820
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,200
 But they would have the records when that plane left.

821
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,640
 That plane had to issue a flight plan

822
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,200
 'cause we know it was going from El Paso to Mexico City.

823
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,360
 He goes, there is no record of that plane ever

824
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,400
 issuing a flight plan.

825
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,840
 There's no name of that pilot.

826
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,400
 So he goes, it's weird because even the skeptics agree

827
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,840
 that a Cessna crashed in the desert,

828
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,660
 but I can't find anyone who ever flew this plane.

829
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,820
 I can't get any actual concrete evidence

830
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,680
 that a plane did crash in the desert.

831
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,940
 It's very, very weird.

832
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,780
 It almost seemed like the better thing for skeptics to do

833
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,700
 is just say the whole thing's made up.

834
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,380
 It's all made up, it never happened.

835
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,180
 The skeptics say, yeah, a plane crashed,

836
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,580
 but it wasn't a UFO and the UFO community goes,

837
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,420
 well, the plane crashed and it was a UFO.

838
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,700
 And Robert Biddo goes, what plane?

839
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,340
 Like, I can't find any proof that this plane existed now.

840
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,360
 Even if it was a drug runner plane,

841
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,060
 you do have to issue a flight plan 2.8

842
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,560
 and then just fly to point B.

843
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,800
 Fascinating story.

844
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
 Fascinating story.

845
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,280
 It is most likely that the Cessna did crash out

846
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,120
 in the desert.

847
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,700
 What caused it to crash?

848
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,540
 Who knows?

849
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,120
 It would seem weird that a plane crashing,

850
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,440
 which it's not super common,

851
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,900
 but it's also not terribly rare,

852
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,660
 would spark such a UFO flap.

853
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,100
 But the reason why I really love the story

854
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,540
 is we get that moment by moment interaction

855
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,780
 between these governments over

856
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,240
 what would happen if a UFO actually crashed?

857
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,520
 If it crashed within your borders,

858
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,120
 you could completely cover it up,

859
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,440
 especially if it was in the middle of nowhere.

860
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,800
 But when you have to cross international lines

861
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,480
 to get this disk, because what is the disk?

862
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,880
 Again, 1974, UFOs were considered a joke among the populace,

863
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,800
 but the US government made a concentrated effort

864
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,440
 to make people who reported UFOs a joke.

865
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,240
 Like, that's what they did.

866
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,720
 They got their fingers in the media,

867
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,700
 which the government's always controlled the media.

868
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,500
 And they said, "Just call 'em little green men

869
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,580
 and make these people look like kooks."

870
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,620
 But this is the type of stuff

871
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,120
 that would go on behind the scenes,

872
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,200
 people fighting for these artifacts.

873
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,100
 And then where did it end up?

874
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,660
 Did it release some sort of biological weapon?

875
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,140
 And it's in the CDC and they're trying to figure it out,

876
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,980
 trying to create a cure for it, or trying to weaponize it?

877
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,420
 Was it reverse engineered?

878
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,860
 Did they take it apart?

879
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,720
 Did it was some sort of Russian spy craft?

880
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,480
 Who knows?

881
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,760
 And that's kind of the whole thing, who knows?

882
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,120
 We will never know whether or not

883
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,120
 we have disclosure tomorrow and alien life is revealed.

884
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,280
 I still don't think we'll know

885
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,080
 about all these little operations over the years.

886
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,920
 I don't think they'll be like,

887
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,320
 oh yeah, and then we invaded Mexico to take this disk

888
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,420
 and this is what they found.

889
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,200
 I think when, if disclosure ever does happen,

890
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
 it will be played forward.

891
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,900
 They'll never admit they lied to us all these years.

892
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,300
 They'll never admit to that.

893
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,700
 It's a fascinating story because it shows really

894
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,220
 what lengths the US government will go to control

895
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,100
 access to this information, access to this technology.

896
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,620
 They invaded this country.

897
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,060
 I mean, it was just four helicopters,

898
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,380
 but let's call it what it is.

899
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,700
 They invaded this country to steal this disk.

900
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,780
 What would have happened if the Mexican soldier,

901
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,260
 actually, I just thought about this,

902
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,500
 who's this thing, they didn't kill all the Mexican soldiers.

903
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,340
 And they just go, oh, when we got there,

904
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,700
 their bodies were already riddled with bullets.

905
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
 I mean, riddled with disease.

906
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,560
 And then we blew up the convoy

907
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,400
 to keep the disease from getting out.

908
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,200
 I didn't think about that being a suggestion

909
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,900
 because what would happen if the CIA

910
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,060
 of those helicopters came out

911
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,040
 and the troops were still alive moving this convoy through?

912
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,620
 They would have taken it.

913
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,340
 They 100% would have taken that disk.

914
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,040
 And it goes to show the lengths

915
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,840
 that the US government, I really figure any superpower

916
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,380
 would go to to contain this technology.

917
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,340
 Like if you knew that a vehicle of extraterrestrial origin

918
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,220
 crashed in another country,

919
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,100
 you would send people in to retrieve it.

920
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,040
 And if those few people couldn't get it,

921
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,060
 you may actually invade that country in full,

922
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,240
 whip up some bizarre reason to go into that country,

923
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,840
 to restore democracy and get what you need.

924
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,880
 And while you're there, you can install a dictator

925
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,000
 and see how that works out.

926
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,880
 It doesn't work out well,

927
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,040
 but at what point would you say, no, we'll let them have it?

928
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,920
 You could not let another country on earth

929
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,980
 have access to this type of technology.

930
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,960
 That is how it would work out.

931
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
 You can have all this talk about disclosure

932
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
 and Congress hearings and people giving

933
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,000
 these highfalutin speeches

934
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,200
 about how we need to know the truth.

935
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,320
 But the truth comes with bullets in blood.

936
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,680
 The truth comes from agencies

937
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,740
 like the Central Intelligence Agency

938
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,800
 taking these things from people.

939
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,280
 We may believe that in the end,

940
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,440
 having access to this high technology

941
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,560
 will bring humanity closer together,

942
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,120
 will unite us as one people as we explore the stars.

943
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,600
 We may believe in the Star Trek future

944
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,440
 of exploring the cosmos as one people.

945
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,320
 But the journey to get there is covered in gore.

946
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,880
 It's crafted by countries invading each other

947
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,880
 to steal this technology by taking possible survivors

948
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,920
 from these crafts and interrogating them

949
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,800
 the only way we know how.

950
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,520
 We may all want a future where we journey together

951
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,900
 as one species and explore the universe.

952
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:47,200
 But that journey starts with dozens of dead bodies

953
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,640
 in a Mexican desert.

954
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,200
