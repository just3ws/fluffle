1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,800
 A shocking attack in a small town has people wondering,

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,320
 "Are vampires real?"

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,000
 And then we meet a man who says he knows the best way

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,520
 to avoid getting sick from COVID-19.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,520
 Having sex with women who have been abducted by aliens.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,720
 That's a cure.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,160
 I don't think you can get it right, Aide,

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,920
 but apparently it works.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,040
 Then we take a look at a new conspiracy theory

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,960
 that popped up and was almost immediately shut down.

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,240
 However, it's quite intriguing.

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,600
 I think this one might have some legs and might come back.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,640
 Is it possible that modern-day celebrities

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
 are actually the reincarnated forms of the old gods?

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,600
 [music]

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,880
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,960
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
 I'm having a great day.

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,560
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,680
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,280
 Sure, we're gonna get started right away.

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,800
 First off, racing into Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,800
 Everyone give it up for Garrett Hopkins.

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,000
 Woo, yeah, come on in, doing Jumbo Jacks and stuff like that.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,640
 He's like, "I didn't know I was gonna work out, man.

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,600
 You're always working out in Dead Rabbit Command."

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
 Garrett's our newest Patreon supporter,

43
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,040
 and you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,440
 or can't do Jumbo Jacks, Lord knows I can.

46
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,480
 That's fine, too.

47
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,080
 Just helps read the word about the show

48
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,720
 that really, really, really helps out a lot.

49
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,160
 What's the purpose of a jumping jack?

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
 Does it make you more agile?

51
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,360
 Like, does it have any sort of--

52
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,880
 I mean, I literally can't do a jumping jack.

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,160
 I imagine it's like a full-body workout,

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,760
 but it just must kill your ankles, right?

55
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,840
 Jumping up and down, sticking your arms out

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
 and stuff like that.

57
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,400
 Anyways, Garrett, let's go ahead

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,120
 and actually give this episode started.

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,040
 We do have a lot of stuff to cover.

60
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,120
 I'm going to toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Roadboat.

61
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,040
 We're gonna go on a nice, leisurely rowing journey.

62
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,480
 All the way out to Pennsylvania.

63
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,600
 [imitates engine revving]

64
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,760
 We're headed to Pennsylvania.

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,080
 Specifically, we're in Silver Spring Township in Pennsylvania

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,400
 on a little road known as Ashburg Drive.

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,160
 So if you are from this area, watch out.

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,640
 On August 27th, 2022, at 7.15 in the morning,

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,400
 in this little driveway, this parking lot

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,920
 for this residential care home,

71
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,560
 a very ghoulish sight is seen.

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,400
 It's blood.

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,080
 Now, blood, you know, that's not super gross, right?

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,600
 I mean, I don't want it on me.

75
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,320
 I prefer to have it in me and prefer it to be my own.

76
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,000
 But, you know, if I was walking on the street

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,120
 and saw some blood on the ground,

78
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,760
 it wouldn't totally freak me out, right?

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,040
 I wouldn't make a, I probably would step on it.

80
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,120
 I was about to say I wouldn't make an effort to step on it.

81
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,480
 I'm not jumping in it like a puddle.

82
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
 Wee!

83
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,480
 You just keep on going, right?

84
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,040
 Blood on the ground, whatever.

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,280
 But I've never, ever come across anything of this magnitude.

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,780
 I've never had the police force of Silver Spring Township.

87
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,000
 This pool of blood that was discovered at 7.15 in the morning

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,240
 outside of a residential care home

89
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,000
 is Silver Springs Courtyard's Retirement Center.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,380
 I'm sure they love this publicity.

91
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,380
 There was a puddle of blood, which was four feet by seven feet.

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,720
 So, basically, if you laid down on the ground,

93
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,880
 it would be bigger than you.

94
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,560
 I don't care who, I don't care who's listening

95
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,120
 to this podcast right now,

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,980
 unless you're a professional basketball player or Bigfoot.

97
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,960
 Nobody is seven feet tall and then, or four feet wide.

98
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,600
 I don't know, that might be possible.

99
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,560
 Maybe you're like a Roblox person, but that, it's not.

100
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,840
 It's not, you can't be bigger than this pool of blood.

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,200
 It's four feet by seven feet big.

102
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,000
 And the police have no idea how it got there.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,560
 The police come out, they look at this blood.

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,320
 There's actually a, what they call a smaller patch of blood

105
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,080
 nearby on the grass, 'cause this is like a dry wind.

106
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
 There's a green area.

107
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,820
 That pool of blood, as although it's smaller

108
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,920
 than four by seven feet, it's still pretty big.

109
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,520
 I don't think I've ever seen that much blood in one location.

110
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,160
 And so the police immediately go,

111
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,840
 there must have been some sort of crime that's happened here.

112
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,120
 How does this much blood just appear?

113
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,920
 So they go into the residence home

114
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,400
 and they start going, are all of your residents,

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,440
 you know, accounted for?

116
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,560
 Is everyone at this place accounted for?

117
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,640
 And they count them and stuff like that.

118
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,960
 They're all the residents are there.

119
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,920
 So it's not one of the old people that wandered out

120
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,480
 and then it goes, it's time to be bloody

121
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,180
 and just kind of turned into a puddle of blood.

122
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,020
 So they're fine.

123
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,360
 So then the police start contacting all the local hospitals

124
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,320
 and be like, hey, did you happen to have a patient

125
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,120
 who came in last night with no blood in them?

126
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,280
 They just showed up and they're like,

127
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,720
 I'm missing about seven feet of blood.

128
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,520
 And none of the hospitals have reported any injury

129
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,120
 of this magnitude as well.

130
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,320
 So the police at this point are completely flummoxed.

131
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,600
 They have no idea what could happen.

132
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,320
 And now they're saying, well, this is when you know,

133
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,840
 this is when you know you have a bunch of lazy cops.

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,760
 The police are saying, well, you know,

135
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,880
 there's actually no proof of a crime having to complain.

136
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,400
 They're actually saying that

137
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,480
 'cause it's their job to investigate crimes, not mysteries.

138
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,320
 They don't want to investigate this anymore.

139
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,640
 They go, there's no proof that a crime

140
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,960
 is actually taking place.

141
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,480
 That is a lot of blood though.

142
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,120
 We agree, we're professional bloodlookers.

143
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
 We see it all the time.

144
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
 That is a lot of blood.

145
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
 And then people ask like, you know,

146
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,800
 journalists are curious about this.

147
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,760
 It's a talk of the town apparently.

148
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
 And they go, is it pot?

149
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,280
 Like if you all of a sudden seven feet of blood

150
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,760
 out of your body, would you be fine?

151
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,040
 And the police go, you would be able to get up.

152
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,480
 They say you'd be able to live for a couple of years.

153
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,160
 They said it is possible that you could lose seven feet

154
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,240
 of blood and then get up and walk around.

155
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,360
 But it's not a crime.

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,480
 So basically they're done investigating it.

157
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,960
 And that would be that, right?

158
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,360
 I mean, that's an interesting story in and of itself.

159
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,520
 Just seven feet of blood appearing

160
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,160
 outside of a residential home,

161
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,200
 or any home or factory or in the middle of the woods.

162
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,920
 The location isn't weird,

163
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,160
 but having this mass amount of blood and no body

164
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,680
 and the police are basically giving up,

165
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,560
 they can't answer this.

166
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,560
 But there is another detail in this article

167
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,360
 that makes me think this isn't just,

168
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,120
 this just isn't any old blood.

169
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,520
 Oh, and I should say they have tested it

170
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,360
 'cause you're probably thinking,

171
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
 oh, maybe it was a pig or a bunch of ducks

172
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,960
 or something like that.

173
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,160
 No, it is human blood.

174
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,320
 But this is what they found.

175
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,440
 Tell me this is not awesome, right?

176
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,040
 They found a seven foot wide puddle of blood.

177
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,900
 And next to the blood, I'm not making this up.

178
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,020
 When I immediately read this,

179
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,800
 all of a sudden a techno song started playing in my head.

180
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,400
 They found a seven foot wide pool of blood.

181
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,720
 And right next to it,

182
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,120
 there was a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses.

183
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,120
 Blade, dude.

184
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
 Blade, you know, from the movies,

185
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,520
 Wesley Snipes shot people up.

186
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,680
 He always wore sunglasses.

187
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,840
 And he was always around blood, right?

188
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,960
 There was always blood where he was around.

189
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,320
 Blood and sunglasses equals blade.

190
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,120
 And then you go, maybe Jason, maybe you're jumping the gun.

191
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,840
 Maybe it does not equal a fictional character.

192
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,000
 Think about it, you're right.

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,040
 Blade might be hoping for too much.

194
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,440
 But when you think of sunglasses and blood,

195
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,840
 you immediately think of vampires

196
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,080
 who are wearing sunglasses.

197
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
 They're walking out of sunglasses

198
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,960
 'cause the sun's too bright.

199
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,160
 And I guess they would have brought us

200
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,800
 a vampire sunglasses.

201
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,520
 The rest of them burst into flames.

202
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,240
 But he still has his baby blues

203
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,480
 just sitting there on the ground.

204
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,760
 Vampire, though.

205
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,400
 Vampire, there's no way,

206
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,920
 despite what the police are saying,

207
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,960
 you kid, if you lost seven feet of blood,

208
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,840
 you're not walking away.

209
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,920
 And if you did walk away,

210
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,960
 you'd probably like stand up,

211
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,720
 take a couple of steps and then fall back down.

212
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,760
 You're like, I'm too tired.

213
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
 I need a lot of blood to do this walking thing.

214
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
 And the police are like, it's not a crime.

215
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,920
 No, there's no proof of a crime being committed.

216
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,520
 So they're done investigating it.

217
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,160
 I think once they saw those Ray Bands,

218
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,120
 they figured Blade's got it taken care of, right?

219
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,520
 The fictional character is apparently alive and well

220
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,200
 in our small township.

221
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,160
 Let's let him take care of it.

222
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,600
 But yeah, vampire attack,

223
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,840
 the Blade theory nonwithstanding.

224
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,800
 This does seem like a vampire, right?

225
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,920
 It seems like a very sloppy vampire

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,520
 who doesn't maybe he does it backwards.

227
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,640
 Maybe he drains all the blood and only eats the body.

228
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
 I don't know.

229
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,960
 But I definitely think this story

230
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,080
 has some sort of paranormal answer

231
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,360
 because what else could it be?

232
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,600
 How, or I guess it could be like a drug deal gone bad.

233
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,280
 A guy's like, got shot and all this blood comes out.

234
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,640
 But why would you take the body and leave the blood?

235
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,540
 And they have no idea when this happened either.

236
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,600
 It happened sometime between 11 p.m. and 7 15 a.m.

237
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,000
 That's prime vampire hunting.

238
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,800
 Actually, no, that's during the days of the best time to hunt.

239
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,200
 What if it's Blade's blood?

240
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,040
 Or what if it doesn't involve a fictional character?

241
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,560
 Weird though, right?

242
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,720
 Four foot by seven foot puddle of blood

243
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,560
 just appearing in the middle of the town.

244
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,000
 Very least, true crime, right?

245
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,800
 Very most fictional character is alive and well.

246
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,000
 The dimensional merge has begun.

247
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,880
 Chris Chan's predictions were right.

248
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,920
 And if you don't get that reference,

249
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,400
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

250
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,080
 But let's go ahead and move on.

251
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,440
 Let's go ahead and toss Garrett Hopkins,

252
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,920
 the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

253
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
 We're leaving me, I'm doing donuts in the blood.

254
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,520
 They're like, that's evidence.

255
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,320
 Quit spinning around in it.

256
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,160
 We're leaving behind Pennsylvania.

257
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,360
 We're gonna head all the way out to some dude's house.

258
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
 (imitates gunshot)

259
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
 And inside this house lives a man.

260
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,600
 He goes by the online name Howling Abandoned.

261
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,400
 But we're gonna go in and call him Harold.

262
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,280
 And Harold, he's a dude just kinda hanging out,

263
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,920
 doing his thing.

264
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,440
 But life wasn't always that great for Harold.

265
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,080
 When he was a young man, he had some close encounters

266
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,960
 that got a little too close for comfort.

267
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,160
 He says that when he was a kid,

268
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,200
 he saw the book cover of Whitley Strybers Communion.

269
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,080
 You know, there's a picture of a little gray alien dude

270
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,560
 and it scared him.

271
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,480
 He saw that and it totally freaked him out.

272
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,920
 And then, (laughs)

273
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
 we were the whole time, we were like,

274
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,560
 Jason, this guy's either insane or making it up.

275
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,000
 Yeah, maybe, maybe, right?

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,700
 But first off, let's not think about how ludicrous

277
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,640
 any of this stuff is, but it is quite hilarious.

278
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,480
 He sees a book cover and it scared him.

279
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,240
 So then later on, he says when I was like a teenager,

280
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,040
 he started to have these visitations.

281
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,120
 He began to have these memories

282
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,880
 of being abducted by gray aliens.

283
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,440
 He remembers waking up in the middle of the night

284
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
 and these figures would be standing around his bed

285
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,840
 in the darkness.

286
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,380
 He'd have fleeting memories of walking through the woods.

287
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,600
 And then he has this quote here, it goes,

288
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,600
 quote, "And even being introduced to other abductees

289
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,480
 "for mating sessions."

290
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,800
 And then it puts in parentheses,

291
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
 when I was older, of course.

292
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,920
 So I don't know if he started having the visions.

293
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,880
 I don't know if he's, the way he wrote this

294
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,640
 and his account has been suspended.

295
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,080
 He's posting crazy stuff all over the place.

296
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,400
 But from what I understand, or actually I don't understand,

297
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,280
 I don't know if he remembers being abducted

298
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,720
 as a kid and those memories came flooding back

299
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,240
 when he turned 16, or if he began to get abducted

300
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
 around the age of 16.

301
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
 It's kind of hard for just the way grammatically

302
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,760
 he's telling the story.

303
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,320
 But first off, I wanna take this piece apart.

304
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,520
 I find this so fascinating.

305
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,880
 I think we've talked about this on another episode briefly,

306
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,600
 but he says that he was being forced to have sex

307
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,400
 with other human abductees.

308
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,880
 And then he adds, when I was older, of course.

309
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,640
 And I thought,

310
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,200
 (laughing)

311
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,960
 Please do not continue.

312
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,080
 I know exactly what you're about to say.

313
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,000
 Please stop.

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Why would aliens care about like,

315
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,240
 yo, no, if we're gonna abduct you

316
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,360
 for our breeding programs, you have to be 18.

317
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,320
 'Cause that's the law in most parts of America.

318
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,640
 They wouldn't, right?

319
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,280
 When we're having ducks, when we're breeding ducks

320
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,080
 for our failing duck breeding business,

321
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,200
 how come no one wants to buy our ducks?

322
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,960
 You don't go, well, you know,

323
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,800
 (laughing)

324
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,720
 all your ducks are,

325
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,960
 they're all 18-year-old ducks.

326
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,200
 They're like, I don't even think ducks live that long.

327
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,800
 When you're breeding animals,

328
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,400
 you don't wait until the cow gets to the point

329
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,200
 where it can rationally decide for itself

330
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,040
 whether or not to take a mate.

331
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,480
 You're like, this cow has just started milking itself,

332
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
 whatever, whatever, how you ever tell

333
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,360
 when a cow sexually mature, let's do it.

334
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,280
 Let's get them cows together.

335
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,360
 I don't think you're like, no,

336
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,360
 let's let it wait until it's older

337
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,800
 and can make the decision for itself.

338
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,960
 And that's how aliens view us.

339
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,400
 If an alien abducted a 16-year-old

340
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,440
 and a 24-year-old, (laughing)

341
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,800
 just stop, just stop.

342
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,920
 We know what you're saying.

343
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,020
 Okay, I'm not, you know what I'm saying though, right?

344
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,640
 Why would aliens follow human laws?

345
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,140
 They're already kidnapping people.

346
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,240
 They've already crossed that Rubicon.

347
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,080
 Why would they care about anything else?

348
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,900
 Why would they worry about that?

349
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,840
 I just thought it was such a weird addition.

350
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,800
 And not only are they kidnapping people,

351
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,860
 they're raping them.

352
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,880
 And if you ever met a rapist who was like, I do rape,

353
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,600
 I do rape a lot, but I wait 'til they're 18-years-old,

354
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,840
 you'd be like, you're still like, absolutely disgusting.

355
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,740
 So aliens are already kidnapping and raping people

356
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,300
 and forcing them to have sex with each other.

357
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,460
 Why would they care if he was 16

358
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,420
 or he was over the age of 18?

359
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,020
 I don't understand that.

360
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
 That makes no sense.

361
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,580
 Now, if this was happening when he was before the age of 16,

362
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,420
 sure, right?

363
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,700
 Like, I don't even want to think about that,

364
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,420
 but I can't imagine an alien abducting someone

365
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,260
 and they're just 17 and the aliens like,

366
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,860
 oh, you can just walk around the UFO for a while.

367
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,700
 We thought you were older.

368
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,700
 Doesn't make sense.

369
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,460
 And to me, it's little details like that

370
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,980
 that really make me question

371
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,500
 like the whole alien abduction phenomenon to begin with.

372
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,080
 Because if you're all, which I do believe it exists,

373
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,520
 but stuff like this really makes me think,

374
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,600
 yeah, why are they only doing these breeding programs

375
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,360
 with adults?

376
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,720
 Like women in their 20s and stuff like that.

377
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,680
 Like, do they have a moral code like we do?

378
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,520
 And see, there's a flat-out thing going,

379
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,600
 no, that's too gross, they're too young.

380
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,820
 I don't get that part.

381
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,660
 When I was older,

382
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,680
 I get that part being a human, obviously,

383
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,780
 and having a human moral code,

384
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,820
 but I'm not kidnapping and raping people to begin with.

385
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,660
 And they are.

386
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,620
 So, so weird.

387
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,020
 And the fact that he added that in makes you go,

388
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,940
 what, yeah, that's true.

389
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,780
 Aliens do only abduct consenting adults

390
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,780
 to have non-consensual sex with other aliens

391
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,840
 or with other humans.

392
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,940
 I can't think of a time,

393
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,000
 and I'm not gonna go looking for one,

394
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,980
 but I can't think of a time

395
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,380
 where the abductee was much younger

396
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,340
 and you had these type of experiments being run.

397
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,360
 Just doesn't make any sense.

398
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,360
 We don't do that for the species that we experiment on.

399
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,280
 So anyways, back to this story.

400
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,120
 (laughs)

401
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,280
 Jason, thankfully, Harold said

402
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
 that these visitations continued.

403
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,880
 He kept waking up and finding these aliens

404
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,400
 at the edge of his bed until he started fighting back.

405
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,840
 He said, sometimes he'd wake up,

406
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,560
 and which is man after my own heart, right?

407
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,020
 I love beating up aliens.

408
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,980
 He said he would start to grab them, grapple them.

409
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,940
 And they finally was just like,

410
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,980
 dude, this is too much.

411
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,900
 Like we're just down here on this routine,

412
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,020
 kidnapping mission.

413
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,260
 And all of a sudden they're fighting back, this sucks.

414
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,300
 He says, I ended up rough housing with him so much

415
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,100
 they left me alone.

416
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,580
 And that was back when he was 16.

417
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,340
 Now we're gonna fast forward.

418
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,540
 He says everything was kind of normal

419
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,300
 until COVID-19 came around.

420
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,340
 And he said, listen, I've been vaccinated three times

421
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,760
 and I've never gotten COVID.

422
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,760
 So, let's set that statement aside for a second, okay?

423
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,920
 He's been vaccinated three times,

424
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,300
 he's never gotten COVID.

425
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,160
 He can't figure out why he hasn't gotten COVID.

426
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,800
 He goes, I've been vaccinated three times

427
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,960
 and I haven't gotten COVID, it doesn't make any sense.

428
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,480
 He goes, my girlfriend's had COVID.

429
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,120
 My parents have had COVID.

430
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,520
 And he goes, I was constantly like kissing my girlfriend

431
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,320
 when she had COVID too.

432
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,400
 He did state that.

433
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,080
 That's my joke that I'm making.

434
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,200
 He did state that.

435
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,380
 He goes, how is it possible that I did not get COVID

436
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,060
 even though I was vaccinated three times?

437
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,300
 People go in the comments to this post,

438
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,220
 they go, well, it's possible

439
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,140
 that maybe because you were vaccinated and got the booster,

440
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,580
 that's the reason why you didn't get COVID.

441
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,180
 But Harold says, no, that's ridiculous.

442
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,180
 We all know that the vaccine doesn't work.

443
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,340
 He says that, he goes, the vaccine didn't work.

444
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,900
 I don't know why he got it three times then,

445
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,060
 maybe for his job or whatever.

446
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,700
 Everybody goes, we all know the vaccine doesn't work.

447
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,800
 So that doesn't give me that answer right away.

448
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,720
 The only reason why I didn't get COVID

449
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,100
 isn't because most people who get it are asymptomatic.

450
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,920
 It's not because that the vaccine was effective.

451
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,440
 It was because of aliens.

452
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,960
 You see, the aliens must have been protecting me

453
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,500
 from COVID-19 because that is the only thing

454
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,340
 I can think of.

455
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,320
 There's no rational answer

456
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,380
 of why I didn't get COVID-19 other than the aliens.

457
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,520
 And he goes, and not only did the aliens protect me

458
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,520
 from COVID-19, I feel like they're abducting me again.

459
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,360
 He goes, so they're back.

460
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,880
 They're actually abducting me again.

461
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,720
 He doesn't go into details about what that is like.

462
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
 Is he waking up in there at the edge of his bed

463
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,200
 or is he being taken out of the woods anymore?

464
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,880
 But he says they have come back.

465
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,560
 And he said, they are forcing me to have sex

466
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,000
 with other alien abductee women.

467
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
 That's happening.

468
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,160
 He says with a big smile on his face.

469
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 But yeah, he goes, he ints his post like this.

470
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,880
 Did they come back to protect me or to steady me?

471
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,820
 Are they the reason I haven't gotten COVID-19

472
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,080
 when everyone else I know has?

473
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,800
 Unquote.

474
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,340
 So an interesting cause and effect story, right?

475
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,560
 Is it possible that the aliens are protecting him

476
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,400
 from COVID-19?

477
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,240
 I can't see anything.

478
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,200
 (laughs)

479
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,960
 Straight face, the most part you probably got it right.

480
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,800
 He's asymptomatic.

481
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,360
 Most people are asymptomatic.

482
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,960
 But is it possible that the aliens

483
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,080
 protected him from getting COVID-19?

484
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,380
 And why are the aliens back now after all these years?

485
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,840
 He's COVID-19, brings the aliens back.

486
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,320
 Are they there to protect him?

487
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,400
 Are they there to steady him?

488
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,160
 Why is he once again part of this breeding process?

489
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,040
 Why does he continue to eat pickles

490
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,480
 right before he goes to bed and have these crazy dreams?

491
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,280
 And he doesn't know why the aliens are back.

492
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,120
 But I don't know.

493
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,080
 I mean, I have to go back track.

494
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,120
 I do believe in the alien abduction phenomenon,

495
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,520
 but I do find, you're like, Jason, okay,

496
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,440
 we got it, don't talk about that other thing again.

497
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,280
 I just find it weird.

498
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,400
 Some of the experiments they run follow human laws.

499
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,200
 It just doesn't make sense to me.

500
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,000
 I'm glad they do, right?

501
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,920
 I'm not a proponent of them doing grosser things.

502
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,840
 Just find it weird, right?

503
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
 And is it possible that this guy's COVID

504
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,520
 was prevented by aliens?

505
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,560
 Probably not.

506
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,160
 But actually, didn't we cover a story

507
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,840
 where the aliens brought COVID-19 in the first place?

508
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,840
 If I said that enough times to get my podcast bold

509
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,600
 from every podcast distributor?

510
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,960
 It's a weird story, right?

511
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,960
 It's either the story of a crazy guy

512
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,600
 who is connecting dots that aren't there to be connected

513
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,080
 or it's a story of someone who's telling this.

514
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,080
 So it's either completely fake or completely true.

515
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,240
 And maybe something in the middle, right?

516
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,880
 Maybe, I actually believe the aliens may be coming back

517
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,160
 to visit him.

518
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,920
 He might be connecting it to COVID-19

519
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,840
 when there isn't one there.

520
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,800
 But then his account got suspended.

521
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,440
 I would've liked to talk to this guy more

522
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,920
 or see what else he was posting on.

523
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,480
 His account got suspended and in all the posts,

524
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,800
 they were just starting to argue over

525
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,120
 whether or not the vaccine was effective.

526
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,400
 So nothing interesting for me to read.

527
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,760
 I was like, all this stuff,

528
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,880
 I've been reading this stuff for years.

529
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,520
 But Garrett, we got one more place to go this episode.

530
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,760
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

531
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
 to the world famous carbon helicopter.

532
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,960
 We are leaving behind this dude's house.

533
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,880
 We're headed all the way out to Hollywood.

534
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,880
 (imitates car engine)

535
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,220
 You know, when I was down in Sacramento on my vacation,

536
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,040
 I was playing this game called Sleeping Dogs.

537
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,160
 It's about you're like this Hong Kong police detective

538
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,760
 dude who goes undercover into the gangs,

539
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,080
 the Chinese gangs in Hong Kong.

540
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,480
 It's a lot of fun, really enjoyed it.

541
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,040
 But I'm playing it and there was a scene.

542
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,360
 I always love, like, you know,

543
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
 you're consuming this media, right?

544
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,440
 I'm watching these television shows, movies,

545
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,000
 and when a video game is something like that.

546
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,760
 And when every show, often you get something

547
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,080
 that sticks with you, right?

548
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,120
 Every show often is just like a line or a scene

549
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,960
 or something like that.

550
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,800
 And the older you get, the less it happens

551
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,860
 because you've just consumed so much media

552
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,820
 that stuff stops really kind of resonating with you.

553
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,880
 But I was playing this game Sleeping Dogs

554
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,920
 and you, at one point you have to go hang out

555
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,200
 with this really sleazy record producer guy.

556
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,800
 And he said, he was there,

557
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,080
 you're supposed to escort around this bombshell

558
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,120
 singer, actress type in the game.

559
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,320
 And it was a really interesting thing.

560
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,040
 The producer was just a slime ball.

561
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,640
 He'd been sleeping with all of his talent

562
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,140
 and blackmailing them.

563
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,080
 And I think there was kind of an insinuation

564
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
 that he was killing women as well

565
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
 who weren't like doing what he wanted

566
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,920
 in his, you know, record company.

567
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,620
 He tells the main star, he goes,

568
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,460
 who's you actually?

569
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,520
 Because it's a video game.

570
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,960
 He says, have you ever had sex

571
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,000
 with a famous person before?

572
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,080
 He goes, it's amazing.

573
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,200
 It's like nothing you'll ever do before.

574
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,720
 He said, you're driving on the road

575
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,560
 and you see a 40 foot billboard of a woman

576
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,680
 and then you go to the hotel and you banger brains out.

577
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,840
 He goes, it is insane.

578
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,520
 It's just this amazing moment.

579
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,840
 I remember listening to that and I thought that,

580
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,560
 I never really considered that before, right?

581
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,840
 We all have our celebrity crushes,

582
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,640
 but I never once, and it's what's funny when that popped up

583
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,080
 when that cut scene popped up, I thought, eh, maybe,

584
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,240
 but it stuck with me.

585
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,520
 Like that, he was supposed to be a slimy character,

586
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,400
 so you're not really supposed to be agreeing with him.

587
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
 But that statement did stick with me.

588
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,640
 And I go, there might be something to that.

589
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,960
 Like when you sleep with somebody and they're famous,

590
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,600
 there's a 40 foot image of them, an effigy really,

591
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,280
 on your commute to work.

592
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,960
 Maybe there is some sort of power behind that.

593
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,600
 I've always thought one of the worst torments

594
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,520
 I could ever wish on any human,

595
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,200
 and hopefully it never happens to me,

596
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,640
 is for you to be in a relationship that ends badly,

597
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,340
 and then she goes on to be like

598
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,240
 the progressive insurance girl flow.

599
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,380
 Like whenever I see people in commercials,

600
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,040
 and it's these commercials that go over and over

601
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,540
 and over again, I'm like, someone dated that person.

602
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,560
 Nobody dated the Gecko Gecko, but somebody dated Flo.

603
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,440
 Somebody was in a relationship with Flo,

604
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,760
 the progressive insurance lady, and it didn't end well.

605
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
 They dated early in college,

606
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,420
 and maybe he messed things up,

607
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,760
 or maybe she wanted to explore her options or whatever,

608
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,880
 and it ended up being like,

609
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,720
 you like my Flo, the progressive girl fan fiction?

610
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,820
 They break up, it's freshman year in college,

611
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,680
 and they break up, and then you're like,

612
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,400
 oh, whatever, it was just the girl.

613
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,560
 You lied to yourself, your heart's broken,

614
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,560
 and then you jump ahead six, seven years,

615
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,500
 right, you're sitting at home,

616
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,400
 and your ex-girlfriend has a national commercial,

617
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,760
 and you're like, oh my God, this is the worst.

618
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,520
 Like I can't, every time I turn on television,

619
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,800
 there's Flo, that's not a real name, but whatever, right?

620
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,840
 Now imagine if that commercial ran

621
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,840
 for the next 12 years.

622
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,560
 The Flo, the progressive girl, has just been on forever.

623
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,320
 I can't imagine some guy broke up with the Charmin Bears.

624
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,880
 He's like, oh no, you were my perfect fit.

625
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,320
 Oh no, and you left that toilet paper on your butt.

626
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,720
 You know, I just think it would be the worst thing

627
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,920
 to date someone, and then, not just become famous, right?

628
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,280
 If I dated Angelina Jolie, I never see her.

629
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,800
 Does she still even make movies?

630
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,440
 I'm not for sure.

631
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,280
 I could avoid photos of Angelina Jolie,

632
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,720
 but you cannot avoid Flo, the progressive girl.

633
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,040
 She's everywhere.

634
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,560
 I always thought that would be the worst thing

635
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,040
 in the world where you can fall into a wheat thresher,

636
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,240
 in a world where you can be devoured by a pack of wild dogs.

637
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,360
 For me, the worst torment would be spending

638
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,240
 every time you turn on, every time that television

639
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,720
 went to commercial, you were in fear

640
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,440
 that your ex-girlfriend was gonna pop up.

641
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,560
 Ah man, that would be the worst.

642
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,640
 That would be the worst.

643
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,680
 But anyway, so the sleeping dogs thing,

644
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,960
 I heard that quote and I go,

645
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,200
 "Oh yeah, that could be."

646
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,640
 You know, I did think about it for a while,

647
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,760
 and then, fast forward about a week or two,

648
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,680
 I'm on the X-board and someone posts this conspiracy theory.

649
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,720
 It almost wasn't even a conspiracy theory.

650
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,800
 It was like just a headline.

651
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,640
 And the reaction that it generated was,

652
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,040
 I go, "There might be something to this.

653
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
 "There might be something to this."

654
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,120
 The post was titled,

655
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,000
 "Celebrities are the reincarnations

656
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,920
 "of old gods and goddesses."

657
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,040
 And the reason why I clicked on it,

658
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,200
 'cause they included a picture of Britney Spears.

659
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,280
 That was the first picture, Britney Spears.

660
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,680
 And I saw that and I go, "Ah, man."

661
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,760
 I actually didn't really even give it any thought.

662
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,480
 Like I saw the headline, it kind of chuckled,

663
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,400
 "Saw a picture of Britney Spears."

664
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,360
 And then I clicked on it and I'm looking through

665
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,680
 and it really is just a lot of pictures of hot women,

666
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
 hot celebrity women like Eva Green.

667
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,480
 And then, the person who's posted this

668
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,200
 isn't really backing up their statement.

669
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,480
 They're just posting pictures of hot celebrities.

670
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,200
 And, but it's so interesting,

671
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,360
 'cause again, that was it.

672
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,200
 That was the statement,

673
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,360
 there were a couple of pictures of women.

674
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,200
 And the blowback is immediate.

675
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,320
 People started going, "No, they're slaves.

676
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,320
 "The MK Ultra Mind-Controlled slaves.

677
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,740
 "These people aren't gods.

678
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,080
 "That's blasphemous."

679
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,200
 Like the comments were really, really

680
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,120
 spitting fire out of this dude.

681
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,640
 And there was, again, no pushback.

682
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,000
 There was no initial even thesis statement.

683
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,300
 It was just like, "Here we go."

684
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,400
 There was nothing backing it up.

685
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
 A couple of pictures of women.

686
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,800
 And yet, the wolves came out to hunt.

687
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,960
 And they're like, "No, these people are pathetic.

688
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,680
 "They're beneath us, they're mind-controlled.

689
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,880
 "Their brains are broken."

690
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,520
 You can look at people throwing up

691
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,120
 these satanic signs, "Rion is crazy," blah, blah, blah, blah.

692
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,140
 And I archived the page.

693
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,260
 I go, "I might look into this later."

694
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,680
 But again, just like the Sleeping Dogs comment,

695
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,840
 I kind of go, "Ah."

696
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,200
 As much as I love Britney Spears,

697
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,440
 I kind of stay out of her personal life.

698
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,760
 She has a restraining order against me.

699
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,240
 No, as much as I love Britney Spears,

700
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,760
 like I don't read all the gossip on her.

701
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,600
 I don't read it.

702
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,240
 I wasn't following the conservatorship story.

703
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,480
 I wasn't part of the Free Britney movement.

704
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,320
 I like her art.

705
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,640
 I'm sure she's a nice person.

706
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,040
 I just try to not, she's not a person

707
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,400
 that I spend a lot of time reading

708
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,880
 the personal details on.

709
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,640
 However, recently there was an interesting article

710
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,280
 that, 'cause I knew she got married recently

711
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,280
 and that her very first husband stormed the wedding.

712
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,200
 I picked up all that stuff through Osmosis,

713
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,960
 but I was like, "Okay, that's sad."

714
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,040
 Her childhood sweetheart, who she married in Vegas

715
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,800
 for 72 hours, you're like, "Jace, you don't know her.

716
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,880
 You don't know her gossip.

717
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,560
 However, you can spat it out off the top of your head."

718
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,580
 Storms the wedding.

719
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,880
 You know, I didn't really click on any links,

720
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,480
 but I did see this article recently written

721
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,600
 for BuzzFeed News and they talked about her children

722
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,400
 and how they felt their mom needed some mental health

723
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,600
 counseling, stuff like that.

724
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,600
 And I clicked on this and I actually read this article.

725
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,640
 It was really a well-written article

726
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,880
 and it kind of just went through everything

727
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,980
 that's going on with the kids.

728
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,080
 I guess the kids have a real,

729
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,520
 her two sons have a really hard time with Britney

730
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,400
 as their mom.

731
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,480
 Like they spend most of their time

732
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,880
 with Kevin Federline, their dad.

733
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,080
 And they were kind of using,

734
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,520
 they were kind of like beefing with each other.

735
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,640
 The two sons did not go to the wedding.

736
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,480
 It all seemed very tragic to me, right?

737
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,760
 They're 15 and 13 years old and it just seemed tragic, right?

738
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,200
 To everyone's, everyone's very young, right?

739
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,800
 Kevin and Britney and her new husband,

740
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
 all young people.

741
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,600
 What does any of this have to do

742
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,940
 with the conspiracy theory at all?

743
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,120
 Well, what's interesting was I saw the sleeping dogs quote

744
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,480
 and that stuck in my head.

745
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,240
 And then I saw the export post

746
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,320
 and that also stuck in my head.

747
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,560
 I actually had that.

748
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,920
 I was still kind of looking at it

749
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,800
 every once in a while, the archived page.

750
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,360
 But when I read this Britney Spears story,

751
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,800
 I thought there might actually be something

752
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,840
 to this conspiracy theory.

753
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,880
 Because when you look at the lives of celebrities,

754
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,040
 it does match up a lot of stuff.

755
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,080
 Again, correlation versus causation.

756
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,920
 Who knows?

757
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,080
 Are these people just have tragic stories

758
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,120
 or are they actually reincarnated old ones?

759
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,040
 This is interesting

760
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,440
 'cause you can't actually draw these three lines.

761
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
 When I was reading this article about our two children,

762
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,720
 I thought, that's a really, it's so funny

763
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,600
 'cause I'm not gonna try to go on about this for 20 minutes

764
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,560
 but when you look at the stories of the gods,

765
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,800
 you always see these same themes pop up.

766
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,640
 Mostly, I mean, I'm gonna be referencing

767
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,720
 a lot of Greek mythology

768
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,280
 'cause that's kind of what I know best.

769
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,920
 And then maybe something else here and there.

770
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,260
 But you see children having relationships

771
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,560
 with their parents gone wrong.

772
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
 It's part of the human condition.

773
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,720
 But when you talk about Kronos being,

774
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,040
 Kronos was eating his children,

775
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,160
 you constantly see these things.

776
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,840
 We see that play out in Hollywood all the time.

777
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,400
 However, you see families

778
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,520
 that have children issues as well.

779
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,800
 You also, something that I don't think you see reflected

780
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,880
 in modern society as much as you do in Hollywood,

781
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,920
 I think it's amplified, the idea of madness.

782
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,520
 How often, it's almost a cliche.

783
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,560
 That these celebrities have a breakdown

784
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,200
 and they go insane, right?

785
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,040
 Britney Spears famously had her breakdown

786
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,880
 where she shaved her head

787
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,240
 and she was attacking reporters with him probably.

788
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,560
 (coyote howling)

789
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,760
 Which would be funny, to be honest, was kind of funny.

790
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,800
 But I felt bad for her, but it was an interesting image.

791
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,400
 We have that type of thing, right?

792
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,040
 All of this turmoil, all of this madness,

793
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,720
 it's interesting because you have to think,

794
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,720
 is it because they're related to the old gods, right?

795
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,840
 I guess I'm kind of losing the plot here.

796
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,880
 Let me back up for a second.

797
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
 Let me give you my thesis statement.

798
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,560
 I think that is a valid conspiracy theory

799
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,000
 that what it is, is that the stories of old

800
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,600
 are retold over and over and over again.

801
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,760
 And before it was the ancient Babylonian gods

802
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,480
 and then we have the ancient Egyptian gods

803
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,080
 and then we have the ancient Greek gods

804
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,560
 to the point that when you get to the story of Jesus Christ

805
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,160
 you can go, well, you know, it's interesting

806
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,160
 that his story matches these elements

807
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,020
 from these older stories.

808
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,640
 And going forward, now we have Flo the Progressive Girl

809
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,040
 and Britney Spears and it is it

810
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,120
 because what we have is actually,

811
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,520
 let's take Jesus out of this real quick.

812
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,600
 I don't want to, I know I'm in trouble already

813
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,080
 for including him, but Jesus Christ,

814
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,440
 let's move him out of the box.

815
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,400
 Is it possible that these stories are being retold

816
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,460
 because they're intriguing?

817
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,880
 Or is it possible that these stories are being told

818
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,480
 because they are intrinsically part

819
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,600
 of the human condition?

820
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,320
 Or is it possible that these stories are being told

821
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,360
 because it is the same players each time?

822
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,520
 If you took like some Babylonian war god

823
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,160
 who consumed the flesh of his enemies

824
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,780
 and dropped him in modern day America,

825
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,640
 his name is Armie Hammer.

826
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,720
 This guy who comes from this immense wealth,

827
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,520
 everything's given to him to the point

828
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,320
 where the decadence takes over or Dionysus,

829
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,320
 the god of wine from Greek mythology type of stuff, right?

830
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,200
 You have these characters

831
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,260
 and you can even have one person split

832
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,000
 into multiple people because other way,

833
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,720
 you know, there's more celebrities

834
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,960
 than I think there are gods, but the essence of this.

835
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,840
 Is it possible?

836
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,720
 Like I think because when we look at celebrity,

837
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,200
 one of the key things to being a megastar,

838
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,220
 I'm not even talking about like,

839
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,460
 oh, I got a million subscribers on YouTube.

840
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,800
 That's not a celebrity.

841
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,720
 I'm talking about the megastars.

842
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,820
 I'm talking about the people that you know,

843
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,420
 your grandma knows, your mom knows.

844
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,360
 That's what I'm talking about.

845
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,040
 So I'm not talking about some dude who just like,

846
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,560
 look at me, I can do really cool spins on my bike.

847
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,140
 And he gets 64 million views.

848
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,260
 I'm not talking about that guy.

849
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,340
 I'm talking about people that everybody knows.

850
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,100
 Like Armie Hammer who eats people.

851
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,480
 You have this component

852
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,360
 and you almost always have to have this component.

853
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,600
 You had it with Michael Jackson.

854
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,720
 You had it with Elvis.

855
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,880
 You had it with Britney Spears.

856
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,560
 You have to have the comeback.

857
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,560
 You have to have the fall from grace,

858
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,840
 the literal, not literal,

859
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,960
 the allegorical fall from Mount Olympus.

860
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,960
 You're at the top and then you completely lose everything

861
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,440
 and then you build yourself back up.

862
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,840
 And what's interesting is there is always the component

863
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,520
 mostly always I'd say of coming from nothing.

864
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,860
 Right?

865
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,060
 If Britney Spears, we have child actresses that are,

866
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,820
 or you know, singers of like that

867
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,020
 who come from famous families like Drew Barrymore,

868
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,980
 her dad, their family was famous and Carrie Fisher,

869
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,580
 her family was famous, but for the most part,

870
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,660
 the stories that endure are,

871
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,940
 yeah, Carrie Fisher's famous,

872
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,620
 but you know, Harrison Ford was a carpenter on the set.

873
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,180
 He was building sets and someone goes,

874
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,520
 hey, you look like a rugged space smuggler.

875
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,440
 And now we have Han Solo.

876
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,680
 Like it's those stories.

877
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,160
 Did you know James Cameron started off doing special effects

878
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,640
 for Piranha, for Roger Corman.

879
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,480
 He was building these little things with his hands

880
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,800
 and now he has these whole universes to play with.

881
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,520
 Those are the stories that resonate with us, right?

882
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
 Britney Spears was a 12 year old singing

883
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,320
 at some cocktail bar in Thailand.

884
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,120
 She was at some contest in,

885
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,760
 talent contest in Bangkok or something like that.

886
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,600
 That's true.

887
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,440
 So that is true story.

888
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,540
 I'll see if I can find that video.

889
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,780
 And then she just worked the circuit

890
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,700
 and then got on Disney channel and she,

891
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,740
 you put your dues in.

892
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,860
 Those are the stories that resonate with us.

893
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,900
 And I think those also are the stories of the gods.

894
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,980
 Hercules, even though his dad was Zeus,

895
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,180
 he was putting in work, right?

896
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,100
 He was doing some stuff.

897
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,020
 And I think even the gods themselves,

898
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,820
 they came from nothing

899
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,300
 'cause the universe was nothing.

900
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,300
 Okay, okay.

901
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,460
 (laughs)

902
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,180
 Maybe the last one's a bit of a stretch.

903
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,320
 But is it possible?

904
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,680
 And you do have all the elements

905
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,400
 of people worshiping celebrities.

906
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,180
 And not only do people worship celebrities,

907
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,840
 you may go, "Well, Jason, I'm not sitting there

908
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,660
 "and like getting my hair cut like Jennifer Aniston.

909
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,720
 "I don't like her that much."

910
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,560
 You're right.

911
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,840
 You have people who go to all the concerts

912
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,740
 and have a giant tattoo of Lady Gaga on their back.

913
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,320
 That's the best to prevent her from pushing you off

914
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,920
 if you're ever on a balcony with her.

915
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,400
 If she sees her own face, she won't attack.

916
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,560
 You have a tattoo or something like that.

917
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,140
 You have people who are really into it like that.

918
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,460
 And then you have the fans.

919
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,100
 Like I'm a huge fan of, let's say, Goldfinger,

920
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,100
 that band, Goldfinger.

921
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,220
 I don't have any Goldfinger tats.

922
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,540
 I have like a hat, have all their albums.

923
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,940
 I really like that band.

924
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
 So I'm like a hanger on, right?

925
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,320
 I'm just kind of like a casual fan.

926
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,500
 But so you have that, right?

927
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,020
 Just like how you have Christians

928
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,220
 who totally celebrate the word of Christ.

929
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,140
 And then you have like the people

930
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,300
 who just show up on a Thanksgiving.

931
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,620
 Not Thanksgiving.

932
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,300
 I guess I'm a bad Christian.

933
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,580
 You know, on Easter and what's the other one?

934
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,040
 Christmas.

935
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,440
 And then you have rivalries between these celebrities.

936
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,960
 Not the celebrities themselves.

937
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,620
 It's usually rarely the celebrities themselves.

938
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,540
 You have the fans fighting each other.

939
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,040
 Britney Spears versus Christina Aguilera.

940
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,780
 They, you know, they have a little spat here and there,

941
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,160
 but they're like, I'll get in.

942
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,020
 I'll get in some arguments over that one.

943
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,440
 Who's better?

944
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,680
 So I think it's the same thing.

945
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,520
 Like you have this religious fervor

946
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,440
 and then you also have these people kind of be whipped up

947
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,980
 by these otherwise totally normal humans.

948
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,020
 And I would say that I don't think that's the mega celebrities.

949
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,740
 I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio,

950
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,920
 when we're not watching him,

951
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,820
 we think he's getting in a private jet.

952
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,400
 He's really flying around on a cloud.

953
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,960
 I don't think they have any special powers.

954
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,380
 I don't even think they really know it.

955
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,660
 And I'm not gonna say like,

956
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,120
 oh, George Clooney is that Greek dude who made armor,

957
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,700
 but Leonardo DiCaprio is Hermes

958
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,340
 'cause he moves fast.

959
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,580
 Catch me if you can.

960
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,940
 I don't think it's that simple.

961
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,000
 I don't think it's that.

962
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,820
 (laughs)

963
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,840
 Let me give you a moment to laugh at my own joke on that one.

964
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,560
 I don't think it's that simple.

965
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,760
 I don't think it's that one God equals one celebrity,

966
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,720
 but the essence of these old gods.

967
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,200
 So I think it's a really fascinating question.

968
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,040
 Like I'm actually having to shut myself up right now

969
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,920
 'cause I can just keep droning on about this,

970
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,660
 but it's really two questions.

971
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,780
 One, is it possible that the celebrities of today

972
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,960
 are the reincarnation of the old gods?

973
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,140
 And that's really why it's so hard to make it.

974
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,500
 Like people already know it's really hard to make it

975
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,060
 in successful, in any industry, right?

976
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,820
 But if your industry requires you being famous,

977
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,300
 being having you do your art to be famous,

978
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,200
 it's a really hard industry to break into.

979
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,500
 And I think that you could go,

980
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,080
 well, I gave my best,

981
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,900
 but I'm not a reincarnated deity.

982
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,340
 I don't think that they would know

983
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,060
 that they're reincarnated deities either.

984
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,980
 But let me back up.

985
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,060
 I was just wrapping this up.

986
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,280
 Now I'm getting on another subject.

987
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,360
 I don't know if they're actually the reincarnations

988
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,160
 of these old world gods,

989
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,160
 or if just the stories are so human.

990
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,440
 It's the reverse.

991
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
 Those stories belong to the gods

992
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,520
 because the people who came up with those stories back then

993
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,560
 saw those things happening in their own lives

994
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,760
 or in their own history, right?

995
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,240
 You had the corrupt king who was slain by his son,

996
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,440
 and yet the son eventually became corrupt himself.

997
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,480
 And that would be the story of Kronos and Zeus,

998
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,260
 and then the other gods kind of turned against them.

999
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,100
 So I don't know,

1000
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,660
 and those stories resonate because they're interesting to us.

1001
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,060
 The stories that resonate with the human brain

1002
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,220
 are the ones that are repeated over and over and over again.

1003
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,820
 And it's the ones that we hang onto, right?

1004
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,820
 Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Geller

1005
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,380
 just celebrated their 20th year of marriage.

1006
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,040
 That's nice for them.

1007
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,980
 I'm a little jealous.

1008
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,300
 I'm a little jealous.

1009
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,020
 But that story doesn't resonate.

1010
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,960
 There's no, oh, I'm sure there's passion,

1011
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,080
 but there's no like betrayal, and it's not dynamic.

1012
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,920
 You know what I mean?

1013
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,960
 The good stories, the fun stories,

1014
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,800
 I'm glad that they're there, but we don't remember them.

1015
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,160
 We remember Brandy Spears coming at someone with an umbrella.

1016
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,960
 I love her.

1017
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,600
 Don't get me wrong, I love her.

1018
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,680
 But what a horrible moment to have captured on camera.

1019
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,360
 Yeah, it's just, it's such a,

1020
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,520
 this is one of those conspiracies.

1021
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,400
 I have a feeling that season 19 is gonna be real heavy

1022
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,080
 on this crazy conspiracy theory stuff

1023
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,500
 'cause it's popping up a lot.

1024
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,800
 It's popping up a lot.

1025
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,900
 And some of them we're gonna laugh at,

1026
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,520
 and some of them like this, you're gonna laugh at,

1027
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,660
 and I'm gonna laugh at,

1028
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,100
 but I also, this could be true in a sense.

1029
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,220
 Could be that the gods are actually reincarnated.

1030
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,260
 Their shards, essence, little piece of their essence

1031
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,880
 is what makes them mega celebrity.

1032
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,320
 And that's why you have two people.

1033
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,740
 You may have one person who has a great amount of talent,

1034
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,900
 a better amount of talent.

1035
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,880
 There are a thousand actresses better than Angelina Jolie

1036
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,440
 or Jennifer Aniston, you know.

1037
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,920
 But they don't make it.

1038
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,680
 Why don't they make it?

1039
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,880
 Because they're not the reincarnated form of ISIS.

1040
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,520
 And maybe that's why they're always doing that one-eye thing.

1041
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,960
 'Cause they're saying, they're saying hello to their,

1042
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,720
 okay, now I'm just making stuff up.

1043
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,120
 But I don't know why they do the one-eye thing.

1044
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,820
 I don't think they're all MK Ultra victims.

1045
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,920
 But you know what, maybe, maybe.

1046
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,480
 I'm not sold on either one.

1047
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,940
 That they're all brainwashed sex slaves

1048
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,600
 or that they are ancient gods.

1049
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,100
 But I will end it like this.

1050
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,740
 I find it super odd that people hated

1051
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,600
 this conspiracy theory so much.

1052
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,580
 'Cause it's quite intriguing.

1053
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,620
 And I think people hated it

1054
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,520
 because it went against what they already believed.

1055
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,860
 And I think part of being a conspiracy theorist

1056
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,020
 is having, is opening your mind.

1057
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,820
 That's the whole point of occult knowledge

1058
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,700
 is hidden knowledge.

1059
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,460
 And if you're like, nope, this is my theory.

1060
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,660
 I'm sticking to it.

1061
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,420
 It's MK Ultra all the way down.

1062
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,480
 It's the only thing I'm gonna believe.

1063
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,900
 You're not a conspiracy theorist at that point.

1064
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,320
 You're, you're, you're a normie.

1065
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,480
 You're an NPC.

1066
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,320
 That's the definition of a NPC.

1067
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,640
 You're running on one set of program.

1068
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,080
 We can disagree on stuff,

1069
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,680
 but if you get new information

1070
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,200
 and then it makes you really mad,

1071
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,880
 so start typing stuff out, proving, quote unquote,

1072
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,240
 proving the other person wrong.

1073
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,520
 Because if you, the reason why you had that viewpoint

1074
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,600
 in the first place about MK Ultra or whatever,

1075
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,440
 which did exist.

1076
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,000
 I'm not poo pooing MK Ultra as a thing.

1077
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,580
 I mean, it does exist, but if you close your mind off

1078
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,580
 to other theories, then what got you to believe

1079
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,500
 in that in the first place?

1080
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,740
 It was having an open mind.

1081
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,100
 So basically, (laughs)

1082
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,300
 so basically the moral of the story

1083
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,500
 is no matter how much research you do

1084
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,740
 on a particular topic,

1085
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,380
 always be willing to listen to an anonymous poster online

1086
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,140
 and a guy recording a podcast in his haunted closet.

1087
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,260
 You will always be better off for it.

1088
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:59,620
 (upbeat music)

00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,340
