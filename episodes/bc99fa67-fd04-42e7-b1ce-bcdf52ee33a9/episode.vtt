WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.800
 A shocking attack in a small town has people wondering,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.320
 "Are vampires real?"

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.000
 And then we meet a man who says he knows the best way

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.520
 to avoid getting sick from COVID-19.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.520
 Having sex with women who have been abducted by aliens.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.720
 That's a cure.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.160
 I don't think you can get it right, Aide,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.920
 but apparently it works.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040
 Then we take a look at a new conspiracy theory

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.960
 that popped up and was almost immediately shut down.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.240
 However, it's quite intriguing.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.600
 I think this one might have some legs and might come back.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.640
 Is it possible that modern-day celebrities

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.640
 are actually the reincarnated forms of the old gods?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.600
 [music]

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.880
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.400
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.560
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.680
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.280
 Sure, we're gonna get started right away.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.800
 First off, racing into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 Everyone give it up for Garrett Hopkins.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.000
 Woo, yeah, come on in, doing Jumbo Jacks and stuff like that.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.640
 He's like, "I didn't know I was gonna work out, man.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.600
 You're always working out in Dead Rabbit Command."

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 Garrett's our newest Patreon supporter,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.040
 and you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.440
 or can't do Jumbo Jacks, Lord knows I can.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.480
 That's fine, too.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.080
 Just helps read the word about the show

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.720
 that really, really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.160
 What's the purpose of a jumping jack?

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 Does it make you more agile?

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.360
 Like, does it have any sort of--

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.880
 I mean, I literally can't do a jumping jack.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.160
 I imagine it's like a full-body workout,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.760
 but it just must kill your ankles, right?

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.840
 Jumping up and down, sticking your arms out

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.680
 and stuff like that.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.400
 Anyways, Garrett, let's go ahead

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.120
 and actually give this episode started.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 We do have a lot of stuff to cover.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.120
 I'm going to toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Roadboat.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.040
 We're gonna go on a nice, leisurely rowing journey.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.480
 All the way out to Pennsylvania.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.600
 [imitates engine revving]

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.760
 We're headed to Pennsylvania.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.080
 Specifically, we're in Silver Spring Township in Pennsylvania

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.400
 on a little road known as Ashburg Drive.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.160
 So if you are from this area, watch out.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.640
 On August 27th, 2022, at 7.15 in the morning,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.400
 in this little driveway, this parking lot

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.920
 for this residential care home,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.560
 a very ghoulish sight is seen.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.400
 It's blood.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.080
 Now, blood, you know, that's not super gross, right?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.600
 I mean, I don't want it on me.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.320
 I prefer to have it in me and prefer it to be my own.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.000
 But, you know, if I was walking on the street

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.120
 and saw some blood on the ground,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.760
 it wouldn't totally freak me out, right?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.040
 I wouldn't make a, I probably would step on it.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.120
 I was about to say I wouldn't make an effort to step on it.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.480
 I'm not jumping in it like a puddle.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.320
 Wee!

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.480
 You just keep on going, right?

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.040
 Blood on the ground, whatever.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.280
 But I've never, ever come across anything of this magnitude.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.780
 I've never had the police force of Silver Spring Township.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.000
 This pool of blood that was discovered at 7.15 in the morning

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.240
 outside of a residential care home

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.000
 is Silver Springs Courtyard's Retirement Center.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.380
 I'm sure they love this publicity.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.380
 There was a puddle of blood, which was four feet by seven feet.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.720
 So, basically, if you laid down on the ground,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.880
 it would be bigger than you.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.560
 I don't care who, I don't care who's listening

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.120
 to this podcast right now,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.980
 unless you're a professional basketball player or Bigfoot.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.960
 Nobody is seven feet tall and then, or four feet wide.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.600
 I don't know, that might be possible.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.560
 Maybe you're like a Roblox person, but that, it's not.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.840
 It's not, you can't be bigger than this pool of blood.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.200
 It's four feet by seven feet big.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.000
 And the police have no idea how it got there.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.560
 The police come out, they look at this blood.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.320
 There's actually a, what they call a smaller patch of blood

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.080
 nearby on the grass, 'cause this is like a dry wind.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.080
 There's a green area.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.820
 That pool of blood, as although it's smaller

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.920
 than four by seven feet, it's still pretty big.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.520
 I don't think I've ever seen that much blood in one location.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.160
 And so the police immediately go,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.840
 there must have been some sort of crime that's happened here.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.120
 How does this much blood just appear?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.920
 So they go into the residence home

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.400
 and they start going, are all of your residents,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.440
 you know, accounted for?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.560
 Is everyone at this place accounted for?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.640
 And they count them and stuff like that.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.960
 They're all the residents are there.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.920
 So it's not one of the old people that wandered out

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.480
 and then it goes, it's time to be bloody

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.180
 and just kind of turned into a puddle of blood.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.020
 So they're fine.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.360
 So then the police start contacting all the local hospitals

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.320
 and be like, hey, did you happen to have a patient

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.120
 who came in last night with no blood in them?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.280
 They just showed up and they're like,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.720
 I'm missing about seven feet of blood.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.520
 And none of the hospitals have reported any injury

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.120
 of this magnitude as well.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.320
 So the police at this point are completely flummoxed.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.600
 They have no idea what could happen.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.320
 And now they're saying, well, this is when you know,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.840
 this is when you know you have a bunch of lazy cops.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.760
 The police are saying, well, you know,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.880
 there's actually no proof of a crime having to complain.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.400
 They're actually saying that

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.480
 'cause it's their job to investigate crimes, not mysteries.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.320
 They don't want to investigate this anymore.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.640
 They go, there's no proof that a crime

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.960
 is actually taking place.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.480
 That is a lot of blood though.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.120
 We agree, we're professional bloodlookers.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120
 We see it all the time.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.160
 That is a lot of blood.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.520
 And then people ask like, you know,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.800
 journalists are curious about this.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.760
 It's a talk of the town apparently.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.760
 And they go, is it pot?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.280
 Like if you all of a sudden seven feet of blood

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.760
 out of your body, would you be fine?

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.040
 And the police go, you would be able to get up.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.480
 They say you'd be able to live for a couple of years.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.160
 They said it is possible that you could lose seven feet

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.240
 of blood and then get up and walk around.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.360
 But it's not a crime.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.480
 So basically they're done investigating it.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.960
 And that would be that, right?

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.360
 I mean, that's an interesting story in and of itself.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.520
 Just seven feet of blood appearing

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.160
 outside of a residential home,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.200
 or any home or factory or in the middle of the woods.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.920
 The location isn't weird,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.160
 but having this mass amount of blood and no body

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.680
 and the police are basically giving up,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.560
 they can't answer this.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.560
 But there is another detail in this article

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.360
 that makes me think this isn't just,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.120
 this just isn't any old blood.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.520
 Oh, and I should say they have tested it

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.360
 'cause you're probably thinking,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.120
 oh, maybe it was a pig or a bunch of ducks

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.960
 or something like that.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.160
 No, it is human blood.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.320
 But this is what they found.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.440
 Tell me this is not awesome, right?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.040
 They found a seven foot wide puddle of blood.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.900
 And next to the blood, I'm not making this up.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.020
 When I immediately read this,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.800
 all of a sudden a techno song started playing in my head.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.400
 They found a seven foot wide pool of blood.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.720
 And right next to it,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.120
 there was a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.120
 Blade, dude.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.120
 Blade, you know, from the movies,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.520
 Wesley Snipes shot people up.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.680
 He always wore sunglasses.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.840
 And he was always around blood, right?

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.960
 There was always blood where he was around.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.320
 Blood and sunglasses equals blade.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.120
 And then you go, maybe Jason, maybe you're jumping the gun.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.840
 Maybe it does not equal a fictional character.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.000
 Think about it, you're right.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.040
 Blade might be hoping for too much.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.440
 But when you think of sunglasses and blood,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.840
 you immediately think of vampires

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.080
 who are wearing sunglasses.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.400
 They're walking out of sunglasses

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.960
 'cause the sun's too bright.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.160
 And I guess they would have brought us

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.800
 a vampire sunglasses.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.520
 The rest of them burst into flames.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.240
 But he still has his baby blues

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.480
 just sitting there on the ground.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.760
 Vampire, though.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.400
 Vampire, there's no way,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.920
 despite what the police are saying,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.960
 you kid, if you lost seven feet of blood,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.840
 you're not walking away.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.920
 And if you did walk away,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.960
 you'd probably like stand up,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.720
 take a couple of steps and then fall back down.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.760
 You're like, I'm too tired.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.760
 I need a lot of blood to do this walking thing.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.280
 And the police are like, it's not a crime.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.920
 No, there's no proof of a crime being committed.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.520
 So they're done investigating it.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.160
 I think once they saw those Ray Bands,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.120
 they figured Blade's got it taken care of, right?

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.520
 The fictional character is apparently alive and well

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.200
 in our small township.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.160
 Let's let him take care of it.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.600
 But yeah, vampire attack,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.840
 the Blade theory nonwithstanding.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.800
 This does seem like a vampire, right?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.920
 It seems like a very sloppy vampire

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.520
 who doesn't maybe he does it backwards.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.640
 Maybe he drains all the blood and only eats the body.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.560
 I don't know.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.960
 But I definitely think this story

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.080
 has some sort of paranormal answer

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.360
 because what else could it be?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.600
 How, or I guess it could be like a drug deal gone bad.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.280
 A guy's like, got shot and all this blood comes out.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.640
 But why would you take the body and leave the blood?

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.540
 And they have no idea when this happened either.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.600
 It happened sometime between 11 p.m. and 7 15 a.m.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.000
 That's prime vampire hunting.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.800
 Actually, no, that's during the days of the best time to hunt.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.200
 What if it's Blade's blood?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.040
 Or what if it doesn't involve a fictional character?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.560
 Weird though, right?

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.720
 Four foot by seven foot puddle of blood

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.560
 just appearing in the middle of the town.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.000
 Very least, true crime, right?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.800
 Very most fictional character is alive and well.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.000
 The dimensional merge has begun.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.880
 Chris Chan's predictions were right.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.920
 And if you don't get that reference,

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.400
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.080
 But let's go ahead and move on.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.440
 Let's go ahead and toss Garrett Hopkins,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.920
 the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.560
 We're leaving me, I'm doing donuts in the blood.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.520
 They're like, that's evidence.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.320
 Quit spinning around in it.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.160
 We're leaving behind Pennsylvania.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.360
 We're gonna head all the way out to some dude's house.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.000
 (imitates gunshot)

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.800
 And inside this house lives a man.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.600
 He goes by the online name Howling Abandoned.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.400
 But we're gonna go in and call him Harold.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.280
 And Harold, he's a dude just kinda hanging out,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.920
 doing his thing.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.440
 But life wasn't always that great for Harold.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.080
 When he was a young man, he had some close encounters

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.960
 that got a little too close for comfort.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.160
 He says that when he was a kid,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.200
 he saw the book cover of Whitley Strybers Communion.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.080
 You know, there's a picture of a little gray alien dude

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.560
 and it scared him.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.480
 He saw that and it totally freaked him out.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.920
 And then, (laughs)

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920
 we were the whole time, we were like,

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.560
 Jason, this guy's either insane or making it up.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.000
 Yeah, maybe, maybe, right?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.700
 But first off, let's not think about how ludicrous

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.640
 any of this stuff is, but it is quite hilarious.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.480
 He sees a book cover and it scared him.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.240
 So then later on, he says when I was like a teenager,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.040
 he started to have these visitations.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.120
 He began to have these memories

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.880
 of being abducted by gray aliens.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.440
 He remembers waking up in the middle of the night

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.760
 and these figures would be standing around his bed

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.840
 in the darkness.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.380
 He'd have fleeting memories of walking through the woods.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.600
 And then he has this quote here, it goes,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.600
 quote, "And even being introduced to other abductees

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.480
 "for mating sessions."

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.800
 And then it puts in parentheses,

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.800
 when I was older, of course.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.920
 So I don't know if he started having the visions.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.880
 I don't know if he's, the way he wrote this

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.640
 and his account has been suspended.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.080
 He's posting crazy stuff all over the place.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.400
 But from what I understand, or actually I don't understand,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.280
 I don't know if he remembers being abducted

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.720
 as a kid and those memories came flooding back

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.240
 when he turned 16, or if he began to get abducted

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.360
 around the age of 16.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.600
 It's kind of hard for just the way grammatically

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.760
 he's telling the story.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.320
 But first off, I wanna take this piece apart.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.520
 I find this so fascinating.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.880
 I think we've talked about this on another episode briefly,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.600
 but he says that he was being forced to have sex

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.400
 with other human abductees.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.880
 And then he adds, when I was older, of course.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.640
 And I thought,

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.200
 (laughing)

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.960
 Please do not continue.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.080
 I know exactly what you're about to say.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.000
 Please stop.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Why would aliens care about like,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.240
 yo, no, if we're gonna abduct you

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.360
 for our breeding programs, you have to be 18.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.320
 'Cause that's the law in most parts of America.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.640
 They wouldn't, right?

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.280
 When we're having ducks, when we're breeding ducks

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.080
 for our failing duck breeding business,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.200
 how come no one wants to buy our ducks?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.960
 You don't go, well, you know,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.800
 (laughing)

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.720
 all your ducks are,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.960
 they're all 18-year-old ducks.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.200
 They're like, I don't even think ducks live that long.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.800
 When you're breeding animals,

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.400
 you don't wait until the cow gets to the point

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.200
 where it can rationally decide for itself

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.040
 whether or not to take a mate.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.480
 You're like, this cow has just started milking itself,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.480
 whatever, whatever, how you ever tell

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.360
 when a cow sexually mature, let's do it.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.280
 Let's get them cows together.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.360
 I don't think you're like, no,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.360
 let's let it wait until it's older

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.800
 and can make the decision for itself.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.960
 And that's how aliens view us.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.400
 If an alien abducted a 16-year-old

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.440
 and a 24-year-old, (laughing)

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.800
 just stop, just stop.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.920
 We know what you're saying.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.020
 Okay, I'm not, you know what I'm saying though, right?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.640
 Why would aliens follow human laws?

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.140
 They're already kidnapping people.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.240
 They've already crossed that Rubicon.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.080
 Why would they care about anything else?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.900
 Why would they worry about that?

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.840
 I just thought it was such a weird addition.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.800
 And not only are they kidnapping people,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.860
 they're raping them.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.880
 And if you ever met a rapist who was like, I do rape,

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.600
 I do rape a lot, but I wait 'til they're 18-years-old,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.840
 you'd be like, you're still like, absolutely disgusting.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.740
 So aliens are already kidnapping and raping people

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.300
 and forcing them to have sex with each other.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.460
 Why would they care if he was 16

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.420
 or he was over the age of 18?

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.020
 I don't understand that.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.020
 That makes no sense.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.580
 Now, if this was happening when he was before the age of 16,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.420
 sure, right?

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.700
 Like, I don't even want to think about that,

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.420
 but I can't imagine an alien abducting someone

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.260
 and they're just 17 and the aliens like,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.860
 oh, you can just walk around the UFO for a while.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.700
 We thought you were older.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.700
 Doesn't make sense.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.460
 And to me, it's little details like that

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.980
 that really make me question

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.500
 like the whole alien abduction phenomenon to begin with.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.080
 Because if you're all, which I do believe it exists,

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.520
 but stuff like this really makes me think,

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.600
 yeah, why are they only doing these breeding programs

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.360
 with adults?

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.720
 Like women in their 20s and stuff like that.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.680
 Like, do they have a moral code like we do?

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.520
 And see, there's a flat-out thing going,

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.600
 no, that's too gross, they're too young.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.820
 I don't get that part.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.660
 When I was older,

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.680
 I get that part being a human, obviously,

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.780
 and having a human moral code,

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.820
 but I'm not kidnapping and raping people to begin with.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.660
 And they are.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.620
 So, so weird.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.020
 And the fact that he added that in makes you go,

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:56.940
 what, yeah, that's true.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.780
 Aliens do only abduct consenting adults

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.780
 to have non-consensual sex with other aliens

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.840
 or with other humans.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.940
 I can't think of a time,

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.000
 and I'm not gonna go looking for one,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.980
 but I can't think of a time

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.380
 where the abductee was much younger

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.340
 and you had these type of experiments being run.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.360
 Just doesn't make any sense.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.360
 We don't do that for the species that we experiment on.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.280
 So anyways, back to this story.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.120
 (laughs)

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.280
 Jason, thankfully, Harold said

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.280
 that these visitations continued.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.880
 He kept waking up and finding these aliens

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.400
 at the edge of his bed until he started fighting back.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.840
 He said, sometimes he'd wake up,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.560
 and which is man after my own heart, right?

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.020
 I love beating up aliens.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.980
 He said he would start to grab them, grapple them.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.940
 And they finally was just like,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.980
 dude, this is too much.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.900
 Like we're just down here on this routine,

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.020
 kidnapping mission.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.260
 And all of a sudden they're fighting back, this sucks.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.300
 He says, I ended up rough housing with him so much

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.100
 they left me alone.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.580
 And that was back when he was 16.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.340
 Now we're gonna fast forward.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.540
 He says everything was kind of normal

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.300
 until COVID-19 came around.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.340
 And he said, listen, I've been vaccinated three times

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.760
 and I've never gotten COVID.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.760
 So, let's set that statement aside for a second, okay?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.920
 He's been vaccinated three times,

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.300
 he's never gotten COVID.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.160
 He can't figure out why he hasn't gotten COVID.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.800
 He goes, I've been vaccinated three times

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.960
 and I haven't gotten COVID, it doesn't make any sense.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.480
 He goes, my girlfriend's had COVID.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.120
 My parents have had COVID.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.520
 And he goes, I was constantly like kissing my girlfriend

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.320
 when she had COVID too.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.400
 He did state that.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.080
 That's my joke that I'm making.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.200
 He did state that.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.380
 He goes, how is it possible that I did not get COVID

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.060
 even though I was vaccinated three times?

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.300
 People go in the comments to this post,

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.220
 they go, well, it's possible

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.140
 that maybe because you were vaccinated and got the booster,

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.580
 that's the reason why you didn't get COVID.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.180
 But Harold says, no, that's ridiculous.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.180
 We all know that the vaccine doesn't work.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.340
 He says that, he goes, the vaccine didn't work.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.900
 I don't know why he got it three times then,

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.060
 maybe for his job or whatever.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.700
 Everybody goes, we all know the vaccine doesn't work.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.800
 So that doesn't give me that answer right away.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.720
 The only reason why I didn't get COVID

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.100
 isn't because most people who get it are asymptomatic.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.920
 It's not because that the vaccine was effective.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.440
 It was because of aliens.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:25.960
 You see, the aliens must have been protecting me

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.500
 from COVID-19 because that is the only thing

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.340
 I can think of.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.320
 There's no rational answer

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.380
 of why I didn't get COVID-19 other than the aliens.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.520
 And he goes, and not only did the aliens protect me

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.520
 from COVID-19, I feel like they're abducting me again.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.360
 He goes, so they're back.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.880
 They're actually abducting me again.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.720
 He doesn't go into details about what that is like.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.720
 Is he waking up in there at the edge of his bed

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.200
 or is he being taken out of the woods anymore?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.880
 But he says they have come back.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.560
 And he said, they are forcing me to have sex

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.000
 with other alien abductee women.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.520
 That's happening.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.160
 He says with a big smile on his face.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:11.160
 But yeah, he goes, he ints his post like this.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.880
 Did they come back to protect me or to steady me?

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.820
 Are they the reason I haven't gotten COVID-19

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.080
 when everyone else I know has?

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.800
 Unquote.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.340
 So an interesting cause and effect story, right?

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.560
 Is it possible that the aliens are protecting him

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.400
 from COVID-19?

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.240
 I can't see anything.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.200
 (laughs)

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.960
 Straight face, the most part you probably got it right.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.800
 He's asymptomatic.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.360
 Most people are asymptomatic.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.960
 But is it possible that the aliens

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.080
 protected him from getting COVID-19?

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.380
 And why are the aliens back now after all these years?

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.840
 He's COVID-19, brings the aliens back.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.320
 Are they there to protect him?

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.400
 Are they there to steady him?

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.160
 Why is he once again part of this breeding process?

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.040
 Why does he continue to eat pickles

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.480
 right before he goes to bed and have these crazy dreams?

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.280
 And he doesn't know why the aliens are back.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.120
 But I don't know.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.080
 I mean, I have to go back track.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.120
 I do believe in the alien abduction phenomenon,

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.520
 but I do find, you're like, Jason, okay,

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.440
 we got it, don't talk about that other thing again.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.280
 I just find it weird.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.400
 Some of the experiments they run follow human laws.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.200
 It just doesn't make sense to me.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.000
 I'm glad they do, right?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.920
 I'm not a proponent of them doing grosser things.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.840
 Just find it weird, right?

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.840
 And is it possible that this guy's COVID

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.520
 was prevented by aliens?

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.560
 Probably not.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.160
 But actually, didn't we cover a story

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.840
 where the aliens brought COVID-19 in the first place?

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.840
 If I said that enough times to get my podcast bold

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.600
 from every podcast distributor?

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.960
 It's a weird story, right?

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.960
 It's either the story of a crazy guy

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.600
 who is connecting dots that aren't there to be connected

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.080
 or it's a story of someone who's telling this.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.080
 So it's either completely fake or completely true.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.240
 And maybe something in the middle, right?

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.880
 Maybe, I actually believe the aliens may be coming back

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.160
 to visit him.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.920
 He might be connecting it to COVID-19

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.840
 when there isn't one there.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.800
 But then his account got suspended.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.440
 I would've liked to talk to this guy more

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.920
 or see what else he was posting on.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.480
 His account got suspended and in all the posts,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.800
 they were just starting to argue over

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.120
 whether or not the vaccine was effective.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.400
 So nothing interesting for me to read.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.760
 I was like, all this stuff,

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.880
 I've been reading this stuff for years.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.520
 But Garrett, we got one more place to go this episode.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.760
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.360
 to the world famous carbon helicopter.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.960
 We are leaving behind this dude's house.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.880
 We're headed all the way out to Hollywood.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.880
 (imitates car engine)

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.220
 You know, when I was down in Sacramento on my vacation,

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.040
 I was playing this game called Sleeping Dogs.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.160
 It's about you're like this Hong Kong police detective

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.760
 dude who goes undercover into the gangs,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.080
 the Chinese gangs in Hong Kong.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.480
 It's a lot of fun, really enjoyed it.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.040
 But I'm playing it and there was a scene.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.360
 I always love, like, you know,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.360
 you're consuming this media, right?

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.440
 I'm watching these television shows, movies,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.000
 and when a video game is something like that.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.760
 And when every show, often you get something

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.080
 that sticks with you, right?

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.120
 Every show often is just like a line or a scene

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:14.960
 or something like that.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.800
 And the older you get, the less it happens

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.860
 because you've just consumed so much media

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.820
 that stuff stops really kind of resonating with you.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.880
 But I was playing this game Sleeping Dogs

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.920
 and you, at one point you have to go hang out

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.200
 with this really sleazy record producer guy.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.800
 And he said, he was there,

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.080
 you're supposed to escort around this bombshell

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.120
 singer, actress type in the game.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.320
 And it was a really interesting thing.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.040
 The producer was just a slime ball.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.640
 He'd been sleeping with all of his talent

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.140
 and blackmailing them.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.080
 And I think there was kind of an insinuation

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.000
 that he was killing women as well

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.480
 who weren't like doing what he wanted

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.920
 in his, you know, record company.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.620
 He tells the main star, he goes,

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.460
 who's you actually?

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.520
 Because it's a video game.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.960
 He says, have you ever had sex

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.000
 with a famous person before?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.080
 He goes, it's amazing.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.200
 It's like nothing you'll ever do before.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.720
 He said, you're driving on the road

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.560
 and you see a 40 foot billboard of a woman

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.680
 and then you go to the hotel and you banger brains out.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.840
 He goes, it is insane.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.520
 It's just this amazing moment.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.840
 I remember listening to that and I thought that,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.560
 I never really considered that before, right?

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.840
 We all have our celebrity crushes,

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.640
 but I never once, and it's what's funny when that popped up

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.080
 when that cut scene popped up, I thought, eh, maybe,

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.240
 but it stuck with me.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.520
 Like that, he was supposed to be a slimy character,

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.400
 so you're not really supposed to be agreeing with him.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.200
 But that statement did stick with me.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.640
 And I go, there might be something to that.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.960
 Like when you sleep with somebody and they're famous,

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.600
 there's a 40 foot image of them, an effigy really,

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.280
 on your commute to work.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.960
 Maybe there is some sort of power behind that.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.600
 I've always thought one of the worst torments

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.520
 I could ever wish on any human,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.200
 and hopefully it never happens to me,

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.640
 is for you to be in a relationship that ends badly,

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.340
 and then she goes on to be like

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.240
 the progressive insurance girl flow.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.380
 Like whenever I see people in commercials,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.040
 and it's these commercials that go over and over

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.540
 and over again, I'm like, someone dated that person.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.560
 Nobody dated the Gecko Gecko, but somebody dated Flo.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.440
 Somebody was in a relationship with Flo,

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.760
 the progressive insurance lady, and it didn't end well.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.760
 They dated early in college,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.420
 and maybe he messed things up,

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.760
 or maybe she wanted to explore her options or whatever,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.880
 and it ended up being like,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.720
 you like my Flo, the progressive girl fan fiction?

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.820
 They break up, it's freshman year in college,

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.680
 and they break up, and then you're like,

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.400
 oh, whatever, it was just the girl.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.560
 You lied to yourself, your heart's broken,

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.560
 and then you jump ahead six, seven years,

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.500
 right, you're sitting at home,

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.400
 and your ex-girlfriend has a national commercial,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.760
 and you're like, oh my God, this is the worst.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.520
 Like I can't, every time I turn on television,

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.800
 there's Flo, that's not a real name, but whatever, right?

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.840
 Now imagine if that commercial ran

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.840
 for the next 12 years.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.560
 The Flo, the progressive girl, has just been on forever.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.320
 I can't imagine some guy broke up with the Charmin Bears.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.880
 He's like, oh no, you were my perfect fit.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.320
 Oh no, and you left that toilet paper on your butt.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.720
 You know, I just think it would be the worst thing

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.920
 to date someone, and then, not just become famous, right?

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.280
 If I dated Angelina Jolie, I never see her.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.800
 Does she still even make movies?

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.440
 I'm not for sure.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.280
 I could avoid photos of Angelina Jolie,

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.720
 but you cannot avoid Flo, the progressive girl.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.040
 She's everywhere.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.560
 I always thought that would be the worst thing

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.040
 in the world where you can fall into a wheat thresher,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.240
 in a world where you can be devoured by a pack of wild dogs.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.360
 For me, the worst torment would be spending

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.240
 every time you turn on, every time that television

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.720
 went to commercial, you were in fear

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.440
 that your ex-girlfriend was gonna pop up.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.560
 Ah man, that would be the worst.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.640
 That would be the worst.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.680
 But anyway, so the sleeping dogs thing,

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.960
 I heard that quote and I go,

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.200
 "Oh yeah, that could be."

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.640
 You know, I did think about it for a while,

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.760
 and then, fast forward about a week or two,

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.680
 I'm on the X-board and someone posts this conspiracy theory.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.720
 It almost wasn't even a conspiracy theory.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.800
 It was like just a headline.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.640
 And the reaction that it generated was,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.040
 I go, "There might be something to this.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.000
 "There might be something to this."

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.120
 The post was titled,

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.000
 "Celebrities are the reincarnations

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.920
 "of old gods and goddesses."

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.040
 And the reason why I clicked on it,

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.200
 'cause they included a picture of Britney Spears.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.280
 That was the first picture, Britney Spears.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.680
 And I saw that and I go, "Ah, man."

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.760
 I actually didn't really even give it any thought.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.480
 Like I saw the headline, it kind of chuckled,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.400
 "Saw a picture of Britney Spears."

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.360
 And then I clicked on it and I'm looking through

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.680
 and it really is just a lot of pictures of hot women,

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.680
 hot celebrity women like Eva Green.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.480
 And then, the person who's posted this

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.200
 isn't really backing up their statement.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.480
 They're just posting pictures of hot celebrities.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.200
 And, but it's so interesting,

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.360
 'cause again, that was it.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.200
 That was the statement,

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.360
 there were a couple of pictures of women.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.200
 And the blowback is immediate.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.320
 People started going, "No, they're slaves.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.320
 "The MK Ultra Mind-Controlled slaves.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.740
 "These people aren't gods.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.080
 "That's blasphemous."

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.200
 Like the comments were really, really

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.120
 spitting fire out of this dude.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.640
 And there was, again, no pushback.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.000
 There was no initial even thesis statement.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.300
 It was just like, "Here we go."

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.400
 There was nothing backing it up.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.400
 A couple of pictures of women.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.800
 And yet, the wolves came out to hunt.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.960
 And they're like, "No, these people are pathetic.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.680
 "They're beneath us, they're mind-controlled.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.880
 "Their brains are broken."

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.520
 You can look at people throwing up

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.120
 these satanic signs, "Rion is crazy," blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.140
 And I archived the page.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.260
 I go, "I might look into this later."

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.680
 But again, just like the Sleeping Dogs comment,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.840
 I kind of go, "Ah."

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.200
 As much as I love Britney Spears,

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.440
 I kind of stay out of her personal life.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.760
 She has a restraining order against me.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.240
 No, as much as I love Britney Spears,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.760
 like I don't read all the gossip on her.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.600
 I don't read it.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.240
 I wasn't following the conservatorship story.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.480
 I wasn't part of the Free Britney movement.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.320
 I like her art.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.640
 I'm sure she's a nice person.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.040
 I just try to not, she's not a person

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.400
 that I spend a lot of time reading

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.880
 the personal details on.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.640
 However, recently there was an interesting article

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.280
 that, 'cause I knew she got married recently

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.280
 and that her very first husband stormed the wedding.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.200
 I picked up all that stuff through Osmosis,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.960
 but I was like, "Okay, that's sad."

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.040
 Her childhood sweetheart, who she married in Vegas

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.800
 for 72 hours, you're like, "Jace, you don't know her.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.880
 You don't know her gossip.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.560
 However, you can spat it out off the top of your head."

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.580
 Storms the wedding.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.880
 You know, I didn't really click on any links,

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.480
 but I did see this article recently written

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.600
 for BuzzFeed News and they talked about her children

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.400
 and how they felt their mom needed some mental health

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.600
 counseling, stuff like that.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.600
 And I clicked on this and I actually read this article.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.640
 It was really a well-written article

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.880
 and it kind of just went through everything

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.980
 that's going on with the kids.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.080
 I guess the kids have a real,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.520
 her two sons have a really hard time with Britney

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.400
 as their mom.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.480
 Like they spend most of their time

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.880
 with Kevin Federline, their dad.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.080
 And they were kind of using,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.520
 they were kind of like beefing with each other.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.640
 The two sons did not go to the wedding.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.480
 It all seemed very tragic to me, right?

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.760
 They're 15 and 13 years old and it just seemed tragic, right?

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.200
 To everyone's, everyone's very young, right?

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.800
 Kevin and Britney and her new husband,

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.800
 all young people.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.600
 What does any of this have to do

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.940
 with the conspiracy theory at all?

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.120
 Well, what's interesting was I saw the sleeping dogs quote

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.480
 and that stuck in my head.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.240
 And then I saw the export post

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.320
 and that also stuck in my head.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.560
 I actually had that.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.920
 I was still kind of looking at it

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.800
 every once in a while, the archived page.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.360
 But when I read this Britney Spears story,

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.800
 I thought there might actually be something

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.840
 to this conspiracy theory.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.880
 Because when you look at the lives of celebrities,

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.040
 it does match up a lot of stuff.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.080
 Again, correlation versus causation.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:20.920
 Who knows?

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.080
 Are these people just have tragic stories

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.120
 or are they actually reincarnated old ones?

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.040
 This is interesting

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.440
 'cause you can't actually draw these three lines.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.440
 When I was reading this article about our two children,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.720
 I thought, that's a really, it's so funny

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.600
 'cause I'm not gonna try to go on about this for 20 minutes

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.560
 but when you look at the stories of the gods,

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.800
 you always see these same themes pop up.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.640
 Mostly, I mean, I'm gonna be referencing

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.720
 a lot of Greek mythology

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.280
 'cause that's kind of what I know best.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.920
 And then maybe something else here and there.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.260
 But you see children having relationships

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.560
 with their parents gone wrong.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.560
 It's part of the human condition.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.720
 But when you talk about Kronos being,

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.040
 Kronos was eating his children,

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.160
 you constantly see these things.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.840
 We see that play out in Hollywood all the time.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.400
 However, you see families

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.520
 that have children issues as well.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.800
 You also, something that I don't think you see reflected

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.880
 in modern society as much as you do in Hollywood,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.920
 I think it's amplified, the idea of madness.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:27.520
 How often, it's almost a cliche.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.560
 That these celebrities have a breakdown

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.200
 and they go insane, right?

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.040
 Britney Spears famously had her breakdown

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.880
 where she shaved her head

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.240
 and she was attacking reporters with him probably.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.560
 (coyote howling)

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.760
 Which would be funny, to be honest, was kind of funny.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.800
 But I felt bad for her, but it was an interesting image.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.400
 We have that type of thing, right?

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.040
 All of this turmoil, all of this madness,

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.720
 it's interesting because you have to think,

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:58.720
 is it because they're related to the old gods, right?

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.840
 I guess I'm kind of losing the plot here.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.880
 Let me back up for a second.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.880
 Let me give you my thesis statement.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.560
 I think that is a valid conspiracy theory

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.000
 that what it is, is that the stories of old

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.600
 are retold over and over and over again.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.760
 And before it was the ancient Babylonian gods

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.480
 and then we have the ancient Egyptian gods

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.080
 and then we have the ancient Greek gods

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.560
 to the point that when you get to the story of Jesus Christ

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.160
 you can go, well, you know, it's interesting

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.160
 that his story matches these elements

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.020
 from these older stories.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.640
 And going forward, now we have Flo the Progressive Girl

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.040
 and Britney Spears and it is it

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.120
 because what we have is actually,

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.520
 let's take Jesus out of this real quick.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.600
 I don't want to, I know I'm in trouble already

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.080
 for including him, but Jesus Christ,

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.440
 let's move him out of the box.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.400
 Is it possible that these stories are being retold

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.460
 because they're intriguing?

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.880
 Or is it possible that these stories are being told

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.480
 because they are intrinsically part

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.600
 of the human condition?

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.320
 Or is it possible that these stories are being told

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.360
 because it is the same players each time?

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.520
 If you took like some Babylonian war god

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.160
 who consumed the flesh of his enemies

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.780
 and dropped him in modern day America,

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.640
 his name is Armie Hammer.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.720
 This guy who comes from this immense wealth,

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.520
 everything's given to him to the point

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.320
 where the decadence takes over or Dionysus,

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.320
 the god of wine from Greek mythology type of stuff, right?

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.200
 You have these characters

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.260
 and you can even have one person split

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.000
 into multiple people because other way,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.720
 you know, there's more celebrities

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.960
 than I think there are gods, but the essence of this.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.840
 Is it possible?

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.720
 Like I think because when we look at celebrity,

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.200
 one of the key things to being a megastar,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.220
 I'm not even talking about like,

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.460
 oh, I got a million subscribers on YouTube.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.800
 That's not a celebrity.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.720
 I'm talking about the megastars.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.820
 I'm talking about the people that you know,

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.420
 your grandma knows, your mom knows.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.360
 That's what I'm talking about.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.040
 So I'm not talking about some dude who just like,

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.560
 look at me, I can do really cool spins on my bike.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.140
 And he gets 64 million views.

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.260
 I'm not talking about that guy.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.340
 I'm talking about people that everybody knows.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.100
 Like Armie Hammer who eats people.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.480
 You have this component

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.360
 and you almost always have to have this component.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.600
 You had it with Michael Jackson.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.720
 You had it with Elvis.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.880
 You had it with Britney Spears.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.560
 You have to have the comeback.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.560
 You have to have the fall from grace,

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.840
 the literal, not literal,

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.960
 the allegorical fall from Mount Olympus.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.960
 You're at the top and then you completely lose everything

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.440
 and then you build yourself back up.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.840
 And what's interesting is there is always the component

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.520
 mostly always I'd say of coming from nothing.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.860
 Right?

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.060
 If Britney Spears, we have child actresses that are,

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.820
 or you know, singers of like that

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.020
 who come from famous families like Drew Barrymore,

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.980
 her dad, their family was famous and Carrie Fisher,

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.580
 her family was famous, but for the most part,

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.660
 the stories that endure are,

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.940
 yeah, Carrie Fisher's famous,

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.620
 but you know, Harrison Ford was a carpenter on the set.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.180
 He was building sets and someone goes,

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.520
 hey, you look like a rugged space smuggler.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.440
 And now we have Han Solo.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.680
 Like it's those stories.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.160
 Did you know James Cameron started off doing special effects

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.640
 for Piranha, for Roger Corman.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.480
 He was building these little things with his hands

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.800
 and now he has these whole universes to play with.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.520
 Those are the stories that resonate with us, right?

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.520
 Britney Spears was a 12 year old singing

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.320
 at some cocktail bar in Thailand.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.120
 She was at some contest in,

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.760
 talent contest in Bangkok or something like that.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.600
 That's true.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.440
 So that is true story.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.540
 I'll see if I can find that video.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.780
 And then she just worked the circuit

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.700
 and then got on Disney channel and she,

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.740
 you put your dues in.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.860
 Those are the stories that resonate with us.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.900
 And I think those also are the stories of the gods.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.980
 Hercules, even though his dad was Zeus,

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.180
 he was putting in work, right?

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.100
 He was doing some stuff.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.020
 And I think even the gods themselves,

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.820
 they came from nothing

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.300
 'cause the universe was nothing.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.300
 Okay, okay.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.460
 (laughs)

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.180
 Maybe the last one's a bit of a stretch.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.320
 But is it possible?

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.680
 And you do have all the elements

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.400
 of people worshiping celebrities.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.180
 And not only do people worship celebrities,

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.840
 you may go, "Well, Jason, I'm not sitting there

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.660
 "and like getting my hair cut like Jennifer Aniston.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.720
 "I don't like her that much."

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.560
 You're right.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.840
 You have people who go to all the concerts

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.740
 and have a giant tattoo of Lady Gaga on their back.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.320
 That's the best to prevent her from pushing you off

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.920
 if you're ever on a balcony with her.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.400
 If she sees her own face, she won't attack.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.560
 You have a tattoo or something like that.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.140
 You have people who are really into it like that.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.460
 And then you have the fans.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.100
 Like I'm a huge fan of, let's say, Goldfinger,

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.100
 that band, Goldfinger.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.220
 I don't have any Goldfinger tats.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.540
 I have like a hat, have all their albums.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.940
 I really like that band.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.940
 So I'm like a hanger on, right?

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.320
 I'm just kind of like a casual fan.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.500
 But so you have that, right?

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.020
 Just like how you have Christians

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.220
 who totally celebrate the word of Christ.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.140
 And then you have like the people

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.300
 who just show up on a Thanksgiving.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.620
 Not Thanksgiving.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.300
 I guess I'm a bad Christian.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.580
 You know, on Easter and what's the other one?

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.040
 Christmas.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.440
 And then you have rivalries between these celebrities.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.960
 Not the celebrities themselves.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.620
 It's usually rarely the celebrities themselves.

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.540
 You have the fans fighting each other.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.040
 Britney Spears versus Christina Aguilera.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.780
 They, you know, they have a little spat here and there,

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.160
 but they're like, I'll get in.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.020
 I'll get in some arguments over that one.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.440
 Who's better?

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.680
 So I think it's the same thing.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.520
 Like you have this religious fervor

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.440
 and then you also have these people kind of be whipped up

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.980
 by these otherwise totally normal humans.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.020
 And I would say that I don't think that's the mega celebrities.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.740
 I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio,

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.920
 when we're not watching him,

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.820
 we think he's getting in a private jet.

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.400
 He's really flying around on a cloud.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.960
 I don't think they have any special powers.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.380
 I don't even think they really know it.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.660
 And I'm not gonna say like,

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:04.120
 oh, George Clooney is that Greek dude who made armor,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.700
 but Leonardo DiCaprio is Hermes

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.340
 'cause he moves fast.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.580
 Catch me if you can.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.940
 I don't think it's that simple.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.000
 I don't think it's that.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.820
 (laughs)

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.840
 Let me give you a moment to laugh at my own joke on that one.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.560
 I don't think it's that simple.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.760
 I don't think it's that one God equals one celebrity,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.720
 but the essence of these old gods.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.200
 So I think it's a really fascinating question.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.040
 Like I'm actually having to shut myself up right now

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.920
 'cause I can just keep droning on about this,

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.660
 but it's really two questions.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.780
 One, is it possible that the celebrities of today

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.960
 are the reincarnation of the old gods?

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.140
 And that's really why it's so hard to make it.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.500
 Like people already know it's really hard to make it

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.060
 in successful, in any industry, right?

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.820
 But if your industry requires you being famous,

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:54.300
 being having you do your art to be famous,

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.200
 it's a really hard industry to break into.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.500
 And I think that you could go,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.080
 well, I gave my best,

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.900
 but I'm not a reincarnated deity.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.340
 I don't think that they would know

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.060
 that they're reincarnated deities either.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:05.980
 But let me back up.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.060
 I was just wrapping this up.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.280
 Now I'm getting on another subject.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.360
 I don't know if they're actually the reincarnations

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.160
 of these old world gods,

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.160
 or if just the stories are so human.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.440
 It's the reverse.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.440
 Those stories belong to the gods

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.520
 because the people who came up with those stories back then

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.560
 saw those things happening in their own lives

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.760
 or in their own history, right?

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.240
 You had the corrupt king who was slain by his son,

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.440
 and yet the son eventually became corrupt himself.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.480
 And that would be the story of Kronos and Zeus,

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.260
 and then the other gods kind of turned against them.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.100
 So I don't know,

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.660
 and those stories resonate because they're interesting to us.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.060
 The stories that resonate with the human brain

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.220
 are the ones that are repeated over and over and over again.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.820
 And it's the ones that we hang onto, right?

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.820
 Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Geller

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.380
 just celebrated their 20th year of marriage.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.040
 That's nice for them.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:00.980
 I'm a little jealous.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.300
 I'm a little jealous.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.020
 But that story doesn't resonate.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.960
 There's no, oh, I'm sure there's passion,

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.080
 but there's no like betrayal, and it's not dynamic.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:10.920
 You know what I mean?

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.960
 The good stories, the fun stories,

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.800
 I'm glad that they're there, but we don't remember them.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.160
 We remember Brandy Spears coming at someone with an umbrella.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.960
 I love her.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.600
 Don't get me wrong, I love her.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.680
 But what a horrible moment to have captured on camera.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.360
 Yeah, it's just, it's such a,

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.520
 this is one of those conspiracies.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.400
 I have a feeling that season 19 is gonna be real heavy

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.080
 on this crazy conspiracy theory stuff

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.500
 'cause it's popping up a lot.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.800
 It's popping up a lot.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.900
 And some of them we're gonna laugh at,

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.520
 and some of them like this, you're gonna laugh at,

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.660
 and I'm gonna laugh at,

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.100
 but I also, this could be true in a sense.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.220
 Could be that the gods are actually reincarnated.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.260
 Their shards, essence, little piece of their essence

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.880
 is what makes them mega celebrity.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.320
 And that's why you have two people.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.740
 You may have one person who has a great amount of talent,

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.900
 a better amount of talent.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.880
 There are a thousand actresses better than Angelina Jolie

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.440
 or Jennifer Aniston, you know.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.920
 But they don't make it.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.680
 Why don't they make it?

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.880
 Because they're not the reincarnated form of ISIS.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.520
 And maybe that's why they're always doing that one-eye thing.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.960
 'Cause they're saying, they're saying hello to their,

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.720
 okay, now I'm just making stuff up.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.120
 But I don't know why they do the one-eye thing.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.820
 I don't think they're all MK Ultra victims.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.920
 But you know what, maybe, maybe.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.480
 I'm not sold on either one.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.940
 That they're all brainwashed sex slaves

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.600
 or that they are ancient gods.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.100
 But I will end it like this.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.740
 I find it super odd that people hated

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.600
 this conspiracy theory so much.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.580
 'Cause it's quite intriguing.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:46.620
 And I think people hated it

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.520
 because it went against what they already believed.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.860
 And I think part of being a conspiracy theorist

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.020
 is having, is opening your mind.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.820
 That's the whole point of occult knowledge

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.700
 is hidden knowledge.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.460
 And if you're like, nope, this is my theory.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.660
 I'm sticking to it.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.420
 It's MK Ultra all the way down.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.480
 It's the only thing I'm gonna believe.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.900
 You're not a conspiracy theorist at that point.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.320
 You're, you're, you're a normie.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.480
 You're an NPC.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.320
 That's the definition of a NPC.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.640
 You're running on one set of program.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.080
 We can disagree on stuff,

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.680
 but if you get new information

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.200
 and then it makes you really mad,

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.880
 so start typing stuff out, proving, quote unquote,

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.240
 proving the other person wrong.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.520
 Because if you, the reason why you had that viewpoint

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.600
 in the first place about MK Ultra or whatever,

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.440
 which did exist.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.000
 I'm not poo pooing MK Ultra as a thing.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.580
 I mean, it does exist, but if you close your mind off

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.580
 to other theories, then what got you to believe

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.500
 in that in the first place?

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.740
 It was having an open mind.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.100
 So basically, (laughs)

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.300
 so basically the moral of the story

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.500
 is no matter how much research you do

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.740
 on a particular topic,

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:49.380
 always be willing to listen to an anonymous poster online

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.140
 and a guy recording a podcast in his haunted closet.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.260
 You will always be better off for it.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:59.620
