1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
 Before your peaceful morning turns into this, set aside a little me time and ease into your

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,440
 day with Honey Bunches of Oats cereal.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,680
 Those sweet flakes and crunchy granola keep your happy tank fueled up, so when it's time

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,560
 to get moving, you're ready!

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,000
 With the boost you need to be your best self, it's amazing what a little me time can do!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,080
 So make Honey Bunches of Oats cereal part of your morning routine, and make a bunch happen!

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,960
 Pick up a box of Honey Bunches of Oats in the cereal aisle today!

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,600
 Breaking news comes out of Wyoming as Navy SEALS lay siege to a nerd's hideout, and then

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,760
 we travel to Okinawa, Japan, site of some of the bloodiest battles of World War II.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,320
 Nowadays, US military bases dot the island, but is it possible that the spirits of slain

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,680
 soldiers still haunt the land today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:05,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
 I'm your host Jason Garbender, I'm having a great day.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,120
 I hope you guys had lots of fun this weekend.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,360
 For some of us, it's Memorial Day weekend.

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400
 For others of you, it's just Monday.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,520
 Unless you're listening to this episode three years in the future, and then it's like September

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
 4th.

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,760
 But, if you're listening to it right now, have a Memorial Day!

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
 Have a burger for me.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
 Ready?

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,320
 Have one at your house, 'cause I'm gonna come and eat it.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,760
 Speaking of eating, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, eating a big bowl of spaghetti.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,760
 I'm running out of ways to introduce Fajarance of Orders.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,600
 This one, he's just eating spaghetti.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,960
 It's fabricated plastic.

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,320
 Everyone give a round of applause to fabricated plastic, our newest Fajarance of Order.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,280
 Big mouthful of spaghetti, has an apron on that says "Kiss the man eating the spaghetti."

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,880
 Fabricated plastic, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,520
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,200
 I just need you to get the word out about the show.

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,400
 Talk about it on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, wherever you hang out online.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,480
 Spread the word about the show, that's what keeps the show going.

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,960
 That's what keeps the show growing.

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,720
 There's a little rhyme there.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,960
 Fabricated plastic, go ahead and put down that spaghetti.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,880
 He's like, "Is that really my intro?

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,160
 I'm sorry, I'm running out of ideas."

40
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,000
 Fabricated plastic, I'm gonna go and entache the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,040
 But fly low, fly quiet.

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,320
 We're headed into a war zone.

43
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,920
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

44
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
 We're headed out to Wyoming.

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,240
 Before we get started on this first story, I wanted to do an update to a story we covered

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,120
 last week where I exposed, I did an expose on Throwaway Alien.

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,120
 It was this whole thing, I'm not gonna rehash it, it was Friday's episode actually.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,160
 He made this prediction, aliens were gonna show up on July 18th.

49
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,840
 He made that prediction back seven years ago and then this US government report came out,

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,560
 that's supposed to come out in July 2021 and just happened to coincide and it was this

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,960
 huge thing like, "Whoa, was this guy right?

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,320
 Well he came back and wrote this 31, I actually counted 31 paragraph blog post about him and

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,680
 this alien named Gina and it was just so ridiculous and he changed the prophecy and all this stuff.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,640
 He has deleted his account.

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,560
 Throwaway Alien is no more.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,600
 An absolute exposed LARP at this point.

57
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,000
 The post is still up.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,040
 But he's deleted his account, that account can never be reactivated.

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
 So this story's done.

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,800
 Well anyone now can pop up and say, "Oh I was Throwaway Alien and some guy made me eat

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,720
 a bunch of spaghetti until I cancelled my account."

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
 But it's done.

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
 It's done.

64
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,080
 Throwaway Alien thing, LARPed too hard.

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,640
 The story is over and anyone at this point can pretend to be Throwaway Alien.

66
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,800
 Don't get any clever ideas.

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,960
 But yeah, so that's the end of that saga.

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
 That's it.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:02,360
 A fitting end to a story that started off fun and ended up super super lame.

70
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,280
 It has a lame ending.

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,320
 Fabricated plastic is flying instead of a Durgible out to Wyoming and that's when I have these

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
 plans.

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,440
 I just roll them out on the table and I pick it to aggro up and I stick it through the plan.

74
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
 Super dramatic.

75
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,040
 I don't know where we're going now.

76
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,480
 So I just kind of circle around the area.

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,200
 I stabbed the map.

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,120
 These are plans of the Irma Lake Lodge.

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,920
 And I'm pointing and stuff like that.

80
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
 I'm pointing.

81
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,040
 I'm like, "Go right here where this dagger is."

82
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,240
 It's May 17th, 2021.

83
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,560
 We're flying over Bill Gates private ranch in Wyoming.

84
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,680
 Now I know what you guys are thinking.

85
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,460
 How did I get such a break in exclusive?

86
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,120
 How was I able to cover a story involving Bill Gates ranch?

87
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,040
 Because I follow the only news that matters.

88
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,580
 The juiciest news full of worms and salmonella.

89
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,920
 Real raw news.

90
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,680
 This is another breaking article from Michael Baxter.

91
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,480
 I'm almost thinking about starting my own podcast called Real Rawcast.

92
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,720
 It's just that podcast only covers this site.

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,920
 I'm so close to doing that.

94
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,840
 The Real Rawcast.

95
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,700
 It's a pre-dawn raid on Bill Gates compound.

96
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,620
 Navy SEALs are getting ready to launch a raid on Bill Gates compound.

97
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,620
 And you, a rational human being, rational person, goes, "What?

98
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,460
 Where is this coming from?

99
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,260
 Well, let's go back in time a little bit here."

100
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,980
 If you haven't been following the Real Raw saga.

101
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,540
 Here it is in footnotes.

102
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,540
 YouTube Spotify.

103
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,580
 I do not believe in this.

104
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,880
 YouTube I want to take down all of my Bill Gates stuff.

105
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,040
 Anyways, we know what's on there.

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,440
 They're on the cooked news side.

107
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,240
 Not the raw news side.

108
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,520
 And YouTube is just YouTube.

109
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,920
 But I don't believe in this.

110
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,520
 But this is the Real Raw news summary so far.

111
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,880
 One, President Trump is still president.

112
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,840
 And Biden is running the White House from a movie set.

113
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,520
 Two, that's such a shocking revelation to begin with, right?

114
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,540
 So, that's one.

115
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,780
 We have to believe that part before we move on forward.

116
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,860
 And that's already so ridiculous.

117
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,020
 Donald Trump is still president.

118
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,980
 Joe Biden is running it from a movie set.

119
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,800
 The movie set, that looks exactly like the White House in the location of the White

120
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
 House.

121
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,380
 Surrounded by employees of the White House.

122
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,220
 But it's all fake.

123
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,540
 So anyways, President Trump and President Trump was like, "You know what?

124
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,820
 I'm still president.

125
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,520
 So I can still do all this presidential stuff, like order around the military."

126
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,200
 So he has been arresting the swamp people.

127
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,640
 The deep state swamp people.

128
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,360
 We covered Hillary Clinton throwing poop in Guantanamo Bay.

129
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,360
 She was executed by Donald Trump.

130
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,280
 And then we covered Nancy Pelosi's face was stolen.

131
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,480
 They thought they were getting Nancy Pelosi.

132
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,560
 But they just stole a Nancy Pelosi lookalike who was wearing a lifelike mask.

133
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,800
 That's where we're at in this saga.

134
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,220
 So what does Bill Gates have to do with any of this?

135
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,380
 So Melinda Gates apparently in this mythology here.

136
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,220
 Melinda Gates apparently goes to the real White House and meets Donald Trump and goes,

137
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,020
 listen, Bill Gates is a horrible, horrible person.

138
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,220
 He's actually, he, this is, this part's true.

139
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,420
 This part's true.

140
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,220
 He did hang out a lot with Jeffrey Epstein.

141
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,220
 That part's true.

142
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,060
 Now, not, I've said this before in my episode with Jeffrey Epstein.

143
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,380
 I don't think everyone who hung out with Jeffrey Epstein knew what he was up to.

144
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,080
 But I don't think everyone also didn't.

145
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,040
 So Bill Gates did seem to hang out with this guy a lot.

146
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,280
 I'm sure the person who was selling art to Jeffrey Epstein wasn't aware of what was going

147
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,680
 on, especially before the first arrest, because he was arrested twice.

148
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,880
 And Melinda Gates hated Jeffrey Epstein.

149
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,600
 Thought he was, at the very least, thought he was a very crass, boorish man.

150
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,360
 Like there was no, and the articles I read, there was no hint.

151
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,800
 These are legit news articles.

152
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,060
 These are well, medium, well done articles.

153
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,740
 There was no hint that Melinda knew what Jeffrey Epstein was up to.

154
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,060
 She just didn't like him.

155
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,980
 She did think he hung out with younger women, but in the sense of like, oh, he's in his

156
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,020
 sixties and he's dating 20 year olds and stuff like that.

157
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,980
 There was nothing Melinda Gates, but Bill Gates, I can't say for sure whether or not

158
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,420
 he did hang out with Jeffrey Epstein a lot though.

159
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:28,300
 More than, more than you should hang out with someone who's been convicted of child

160
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,720
 molestation twice.

161
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 So anyways, Melinda Gates, that was one of the reasons she was saying like, and it's

162
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
 come out, a lot of stuff has come out with Bill Gates.

163
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,000
 This is in the middle of like real news and raw news, this kind of rumor, but he was a

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 flanderer.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,440
 Like people are saying, Spotify, the reason why I keep saying Spotify is I did an episode

166
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,640
 about Bill Gates being, is he the Antichrist?

167
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,520
 You guys listen to the show, you guys are smart.

168
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,880
 The episode was called, is Bill Gates the Antichrist or something like that?

169
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
 And it was talking about those conspiracy theories.

170
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,940
 That's the one episode of this podcast you cannot hear on Spotify.

171
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,140
 They removed it.

172
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,340
 Even though it's exploring those topics and I'm not saying that any of that stuff is

173
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,660
 true, I'm not even saying that stuff is true now.

174
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,780
 Spotify, that's the one episode out of 681 episodes.

175
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,940
 It's the one episode you can't listen to on Spotify.

176
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,900
 You can listen to it anywhere else.

177
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
 Weird.

178
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,860
 But anyways, where was I?

179
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,900
 Oh, oh, I was slandering Bill Gates.

180
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,960
 Now the rumor is, is that he, like they were covering up sexual misconduct in the workplace

181
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,560
 and he was like flirting with younger women and stuff like, younger in like overage, like

182
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,880
 20s, 25, stuff like that, not like Jeffrey Epstein Young.

183
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,220
 So it still was an unbecoming of America's favorite nerd, Bill Gates.

184
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
 So let's get back.

185
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,560
 So that stuff is fairly real.

186
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,680
 I'll put those, those in the show notes, those rumors and stuff like that.

187
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,820
 But anyways, back to this mythology.

188
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,980
 Melinda Gates goes to Donald Trump and she goes, listen, Bill Gates is not just the world's

189
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,980
 biggest nerd.

190
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,460
 He's a supervillain.

191
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,940
 He's excavated underneath his ranch in Wyoming and there's these massive tunnels down there

192
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,700
 where he canapsed children.

193
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,780
 Let me be clear again, this is the real raw news version.

194
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,580
 There is nothing to back any of this stuff up.

195
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,060
 Melinda Gates is apparently coming clean with this whole thing.

196
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,800
 So that would elevate Bill Gates from just being a creep to literally being a supervillain.

197
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,320
 He has an underground layer full of kidnapped children.

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,000
 So Donald Trump goes, do it.

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,600
 And so he orders, because he's still president, of course, right?

200
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,920
 He orders these US Navy SEALs to lay siege to Bill Gates compound.

201
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,680
 So it's May 17th, 2021, super recent, right?

202
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
 Should have been the news.

203
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,040
 They should have been the news, but it's not.

204
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
 Go, go, go!

205
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,980
 The US Navy SEALs are running through the ranch and then they're just shooting dudes.

206
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,860
 They're just shooting like stable hands.

207
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,300
 There's some guy cleaning up cow poop.

208
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,900
 He's like, ah, no, apparently this kind of grinds my gears, honestly.

209
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,380
 I never really thought of this before.

210
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,740
 I don't mean to keep going off on tangents because I know you guys want to know the end

211
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,700
 of the story, but apparently Bill Gates has a paramilitary force at this ranch armed with

212
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,540
 automatic weapons and they're wearing like this paramilitary gear and they engage in a

213
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,200
 firefight with the Navy SEALs.

214
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
 Shootin'.

215
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,880
 That really kind of grinds my gears because I never thought of a nerd having an army.

216
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,560
 Like I get it, like you need a bodyguard.

217
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,120
 But even then it's like dudes you know, like the Jonas Brothers, their bodyguard is like

218
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,200
 this family friend who just happens to be 600 pounds and seven feet tall.

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,920
 He's just someone they know.

220
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
 That's fine.

221
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,640
 That's cool, right?

222
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,920
 But to think someone could be like, oh, I've invented a microchip.

223
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,980
 And then he's able to like buy a thousand dudes to walk around with machine guns.

224
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,900
 It just sounds weird.

225
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
 It doesn't sound right.

226
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,780
 Like I think you should earn your army, not just pay for it.

227
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,300
 You should be like a Cobra Commander guy.

228
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,620
 Well, now that I think about it, Bill Gates is a super villain.

229
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,620
 Kidnapping children.

230
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,580
 I don't know why I'm being so harsh on him.

231
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,260
 They're having this gunfight with the Navy SEALs.

232
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
 Now actually it's good.

233
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,420
 I am doing this episode for Memorial Day because we're going to memorialize these fallen imaginary

234
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,880
 soldiers, these poor imaginary families that are going to have to mourn their imaginary

235
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,960
 loved ones in this firefight.

236
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,400
 Eight of these paramilitary goons working for Bill Gates, traitors, boo.

237
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,240
 They got killed by the Navy SEALs.

238
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,520
 They have no memorial day for them.

239
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,600
 For all I know, they were decorated veterans before they had to work for Bill Gates.

240
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 But still, boo.

241
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,160
 And then we lost one US Navy SEAL.

242
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,660
 Till the daughter who was never born, to a wife that doesn't exist, that I loved them

243
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,900
 both.

244
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,060
 And then they fade away into back into the imagination of Michael Baxter.

245
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,100
 You may think I'm making jokes, which I am.

246
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,260
 If you look at the comments for this article, so many comments.

247
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,860
 Here, I'll read you a comment actually from this article.

248
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,860
 This is the very first comment on this article.

249
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,140
 "Gates didn't leave the gate open."

250
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
 You like that pun there?

251
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
 I didn't come up with that.

252
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,140
 This guy did.

253
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,800
 "Gates didn't leave the gate open, but the SEALs busted open.

254
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,040
 I am sorry one had to pay the ultimate price, though."

255
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
 He doesn't exist.

256
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
 He's the same thing.

257
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,560
 It's the same thing as someone being like, "Oh no, poor Han Solo.

258
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
 His son murdered him."

259
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
 That doesn't exist.

260
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
 That doesn't happen.

261
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,080
 I mean, I guess you can be sad for the character in a narrative story, but he doesn't.

262
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,540
 Don't be sad for this guy.

263
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,100
 He doesn't exist.

264
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,660
 He never existed, dude.

265
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:55,820
 The comments are almost as funny as the article, but anyways, one had to pay the ultimate price.

266
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,780
 These Navy SEALs, though, do breach the compound.

267
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,460
 It's a 15 minute firefight.

268
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,900
 They do blow away eight of these fictional characters.

269
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,260
 And then they go to a...

270
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,260
 This is straight out of James Bond novel.

271
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,600
 I mean, maybe this exists.

272
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
 I don't know.

273
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
 If you go...

274
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
 If you...

275
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,720
 Maybe you can visit this place, Irma Lake Lodge, if you know where it's at.

276
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,440
 Go to the horse stable.

277
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,960
 And apparently there's a...

278
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,160
 There's a bale of fake hay there.

279
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
 You lift this up.

280
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
 There's a 300 foot drop.

281
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
 There's an elevator there.

282
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,920
 You don't have to be superman to get down there.

283
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,100
 There's a 300 foot elevator shaft.

284
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,920
 That's the word, not drop.

285
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,300
 And if you go down the elevator, you end up in this giant circle that's 150 feet in diameter.

286
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,980
 I'm gonna read you this passage.

287
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
 This concern...

288
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,540
 This passage really, really concerns me.

289
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,040
 For several reasons.

290
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,780
 Let's see if you can figure them out.

291
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,820
 This was written by Michael Baxter for Real Raw News.

292
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:59,900
 "The SEALs," our source said, "spent hours scouring the tunnels for signs of life.

293
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,580
 But no children were found.

294
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,480
 However, the operation was not in vain.

295
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,600
 As they did uncover a facsimile of a young girl's bedroom, with a pink frame platform

296
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,760
 bed, stuffed animals, and racks of child-sized clothing.

297
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:31,840
 Moreover, three DSLRs on tripods have also been aimed to video whoever had lain in the

298
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
 bed.

299
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,980
 At least one camera still had an SD card."

300
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,060
 That's gross because it didn't happen.

301
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,740
 That did not happen.

302
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,660
 The Navy SEALs did not go to Bill Gates' compound and have this firefight and find this chamber

303
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,660
 and then come across this pink little girl's bedroom with little girl clothes.

304
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,500
 That didn't happen.

305
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,920
 And it is very, very concerning to...

306
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,780
 You guys understand why I'm concerned, right?

307
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,900
 Someone is imagining that.

308
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,360
 It would be one thing if it was true, if it was factual.

309
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,720
 You could look at it and go, "Oh, that's sick.

310
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,600
 Bill Gates must pay for his crimes."

311
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
 But it's not.

312
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 Someone imagine...

313
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,680
 Because what does that imply, right?

314
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
 That someone...

315
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,840
 Someone has crafted this imaginary world where this is under Bill Gates' house.

316
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,320
 It doesn't actually matter if it's under Bill Gates' house.

317
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,960
 It could be under the local plumber's house.

318
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,660
 It's creepy and it's gross and it makes me...

319
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,300
 It doesn't make me suspicious of Bill Gates.

320
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,700
 I don't know if Michael Baxter is making this up out of whole cloth or if someone is telling

321
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,900
 him stuff, but whoever is telling him stuff is clearly lying.

322
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,460
 Not only are they lying, they're telling disgusting gross lies that are so specific it

323
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,660
 puts a mental image in your head of something you shouldn't have a mental image of.

324
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,600
 This article could have been just fine without that passage.

325
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,520
 That passage kicks you in the stomach and it's too much.

326
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
 It's too much.

327
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,200
 But I think there's a contingent of conspiracy theorists.

328
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
 Not just conspiracy theorists.

329
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,240
 I think true crime people get it too, but they get...

330
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,120
 There is some sort of response to that.

331
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,480
 That's not anger or revulsion.

332
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,920
 Titillation, I guess.

333
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,460
 It's completely unnecessary in the narrative.

334
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,940
 It's completely unnecessary.

335
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,440
 Hillary Clinton throwing her poop?

336
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,900
 That's important to the plot?

337
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
 I need to know that.

338
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,580
 But this, they could have totally left that out.

339
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,260
 That's there to titillate the reader.

340
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,260
 Tune in next, guys.

341
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,940
 Well, we'll discuss some other disgusting thing.

342
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:48,660
 Yeah, that type of detail really bugs me and it makes me super sus of what the motivations

343
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
 are.

344
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,660
 Does it titillate the reader?

345
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,220
 Is it to just scam people?

346
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,220
 I don't know.

347
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,220
 I don't know.

348
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
 Is it just a fun work of fiction?

349
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,180
 Not fun, but is it just a work of fiction?

350
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,780
 Is someone lying to Michael Baxter?

351
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,140
 Does he know that this isn't real?

352
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,640
 His readers don't.

353
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
 Some of them do.

354
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,340
 You read through the comments, but the unnecessarily gross detail.

355
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
 So yeah.

356
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,820
 Why did you share it with us then, you jerk?

357
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,020
 I think it's just a gross detail.

358
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,240
 It has nothing in the narrative.

359
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,540
 It titillates a percentage of the readers of people who shouldn't be getting titillated

360
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
 by that stuff.

361
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,540
 You know what I mean?

362
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
 It's gross.

363
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,020
 Just if Michael Baxter, if you listen to this podcast or if you listen to my upcoming podcast,

364
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,740
 real rawcast tone it down.

365
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,180
 Don't tone it down.

366
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
 All that type of stuff.

367
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,020
 Because if you're getting hits, if that's causing people to really enjoy your website,

368
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,180
 it's the wrong kind of people.

369
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,180
 Fabricated plastic.

370
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,860
 I want you to call in that carpenter copter.

371
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,280
 We're going to say goodbye to Bill Gates.

372
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,160
 He's on the run too, if you didn't know that.

373
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,800
 If you see him on the news, that's fake.

374
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,960
 He's actually on the run right now.

375
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,440
 So if you happen to see him, if you happen to see him walking around Seattle, it's probably

376
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
 Nancy Pelosi just wearing his face.

377
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,800
 We're leaving behind Wyoming.

378
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:10,760
 We're headed out to Okinawa in Japan.

379
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,320
 We actually brought some of those US Navy SEALs with us because this is another military

380
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,660
 theme to story and I should also introduce the theme for this week.

381
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,820
 I hope you like ghosts because I found a bunch of ghost stories.

382
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,300
 I didn't even announce it in the beginning.

383
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,540
 I found so many ghost stories this week.

384
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,740
 A lot of really good ones.

385
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,820
 A lot of ones that I've never heard of.

386
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,300
 So I hope you like ghosts because I love ghosts.

387
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,020
 We don't cover them enough on this show.

388
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,660
 It's hard to find compelling ghost stories.

389
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,660
 We got a lot of good ones this week.

390
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,940
 Fabricated plastic is bringing that carpenter copter.

391
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,220
 We're ready for war.

392
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,080
 We're actually back in the year that World War II was happening.

393
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
 What was that?

394
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,800
 1939 to 1944.

395
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,440
 Carbenter copters flying through time.

396
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,440
 Okinawa, Japan was actually the site of some of the most violent battles of World War II.

397
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,440
 That movie, "Hack Saw Ridge," if you guys haven't seen that, directed by Mel Gibson, starring

398
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,520
 Spider-Man.

399
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:17,140
 That was in Okinawa and then other battles that they didn't make movies about, starring

400
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
 Spider-Man.

401
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,340
 Overall, 12,500 US soldiers were killed.

402
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,180
 110,000 Japanese soldiers were killed.

403
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,300
 This was really the last major battle of World War II.

404
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,580
 This was right outside of Japan.

405
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,340
 European Front was over with Russia's advancing on Japan, war advancing on Japan.

406
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,100
 This is really in Okinawa were the last major battles.

407
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,720
 Yamato was sunk during these battles.

408
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,960
 So you had 110,000 Japanese soldiers and up to 150,000 civilians were killed in these

409
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,880
 battles on Okinawa.

410
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:56,280
 Nowadays, it's the home to six US Marine bases and one US Air Force base.

411
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:04,600
 And it is the first and most likely last line of defense against a Pacific theater war.

412
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:12,500
 So it's a pretty integral part of the United States military strategy in the Pacific.

413
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:19,180
 So it doesn't help thing that these bases seem to be horribly, horribly haunted.

414
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:25,180
 On Reddit, there's a user named Bananasunami and he posted this story that back in 2015

415
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,340
 he worked as an emergency technician at Camp Hanson, which was one of the Marine bases.

416
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:36,880
 He said that his team included a local ambulance service, so Japanese ambulance service and

417
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,680
 then local firefighters as well.

418
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,360
 And he goes at 2 AM, we got a call that a Marine had suffered a head injury.

419
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:51,040
 So we all go down there, we go down to the barracks and the dude is acting possessed.

420
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,720
 Or having a grand mal seizure.

421
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,720
 You kind of, there's kind of different ways to treat the two.

422
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,840
 At first glance, we're going to call him Chuck.

423
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,660
 Chuck goes, the guy's flipping around.

424
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,900
 He has 10 people on him trying to hold him down.

425
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,940
 His head is actually being held to the ground because he keeps banging the back of his head

426
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,620
 on the floor.

427
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,620
 And he's there to render aid.

428
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,000
 He's not there to start throwing holy water on the dude, but there's something super

429
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 off about this guy.

430
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,060
 He says that he had a couple goose eggs on his face.

431
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,060
 Which you don't know, you don't know.

432
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,060
 That's a turn of phrase.

433
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
 That just means giant lumps.

434
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,540
 It doesn't actually mean that as they're holding him down, a goose walked up and was like,

435
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,660
 "Haha, the perfect chance."

436
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,660
 His mouth is opening and closing.

437
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
 [gurgling]

438
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,660
 His eyes are rolling.

439
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
 Happy Memorial Day, by the way, guys.

440
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,660
 His eyes are rolling in the back of his head.

441
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,660
 [gurgling]

442
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,660
 And he's screaming, "Make it stop!

443
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
 Make it stop!"

444
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
 They're treating this guy.

445
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
 And one of the things you got to do is figure out what it is this guy.

446
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:55,660
 I guess they have a problem with spice over there, the synthetic marijuana.

447
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
 And you can buy pain pills over the counter.

448
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
 So the first thing, the thing is some sort of drug overdose.

449
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
 Like what happened?

450
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,660
 Because that'll be different.

451
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
 Was he playing with the Ouija board at 3 AM?

452
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
 Chuck asks the guy's friend.

453
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,660
 He goes, "What happened?"

454
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
 He goes, "Dude, I have no idea.

455
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
 We're standing there.

456
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
 We're drinking beer.

457
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
 It is 2 in the morning.

458
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,660
 So it's not super spooky yet.

459
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
 We're drinking beer.

460
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,660
 And then in the middle of conversation, his demeanor changed.

461
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,660
 He walked away from me, walked over to the stairwell where there's a wall there.

462
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,660
 And sort of bang in his head into the wall.

463
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
 And that's how he got all those goose eggs.

464
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,660
 Don't suspect that goose that walked away wearing the trench coat and the little hat.

465
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
 And he gave them to himself.

466
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,660
 So he goes, "That's weird."

467
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,660
 And as they're treating this guy, they eventually had to get like one of those backboards and strap them down to it.

468
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,660
 Some of the local ambulance crew goes, "Yeah, this happens."

469
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,660
 I'm like, "What do you mean it happens?"

470
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,660
 They're like, "It happens."

471
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,660
 So they take him to the hospital and they figure out, like, he said the official diagnosis was some medical thing.

472
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,660
 They said like his hemoglobin was breaking down in his liver or something like that.

473
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,660
 And it can cause like dehydration and confusion.

474
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
 He goes, "But that tends to take time.

475
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
 Like, I'm not that dumb.

476
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,660
 Like, that wouldn't happen instantly."

477
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:17,660
 And Chuck was thinking there was another case that he had heard not too long ago in the same barracks of another U.S. Marine just flipping out.

478
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,660
 Just being totally normal and then, "Ahh!"

479
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,660
 And then started screaming, "Get it out! Get it out!"

480
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:31,660
 So he did not immediately retire from the service.

481
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,660
 He did not request a transfer.

482
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,660
 Apparently Chuck just continued to work there and thought, "Well, isn't that odd?"

483
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,660
 Now, I read that in my go. That is odd.

484
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
 But you know, it's a Reddit story.

485
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
 Who knows how real it is.

486
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,660
 There's stuff like No Sleep out there that gets confusing.

487
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,660
 This wasn't from No Sleep.

488
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,660
 But you know, you always want to check this stuff out as much as you can.

489
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
 You're not always able to.

490
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,660
 But I, so I started looking up Okinawa ghosts.

491
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,660
 Okinawa is actually considered one of the most haunted military locations.

492
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,660
 Like all the bases in the world.

493
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,660
 The ghost of Okinawa military bases are so well known.

494
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,660
 The militaries had to knock buildings down and just be like, "It's not worth it.

495
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
 It's totally not worth it."

496
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,660
 This Chuck Banana Tsunami, I'll go and buy that name now.

497
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,660
 Led me down this crazy rabbit hole.

498
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,660
 It is so haunted there.

499
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
 The military is like, "We don't know what to do.

500
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,660
 This is in terror to our defenses.

501
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,660
 But it's also super, super spooky."

502
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,660
 Also at Camp Hanson, this military base, there's Gate 3.

503
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,660
 There's multiple ways to get into this base.

504
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,660
 And Gate 3, just like any other gate, you have a couple guards sitting there

505
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,660
 guarding it.

506
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
 That's why their name is called "Gards."

507
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,660
 They're on the lookout for that malicious goose.

508
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,660
 But at 3 a.m., you'd be sitting there reading some girly magazine.

509
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,660
 This isn't a current story.

510
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,660
 You wouldn't be able to get away with that today.

511
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
 It's 1952.

512
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,660
 You're reading some issue of Playboy.

513
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,660
 And you hear footsteps walking up to the gate.

514
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,660
 You're like, "Oh, dang it.

515
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
 I better do my job.

516
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,660
 I better actually guard up this facility."

517
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,660
 Instead of looking at pictures of Marilyn Monroe and you look up

518
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,660
 and there is a World War II-era Marine standing there.

519
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,660
 You know the uniform?

520
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,660
 You know exactly that this man seemed to have stepped out of time.

521
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,660
 But he's drenched in blood.

522
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:30,660
 And he looks up at you and goes, "Got a light."

523
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,660
 Now, I don't know if he actually said "Got a light."

524
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,660
 I just like that because he reminds me of which one peaks.

525
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,660
 He would, though, say, "Okay, didn't say 'Got a light.'"

526
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,660
 Fine.

527
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
 He goes, "Fine.

528
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
 You caught me.

529
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,660
 I just want twin peaks to be real."

530
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,660
 This bloody Marine would walk up to me.

531
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
 I don't know.

532
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
 It's a bloody ghost.

533
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,660
 I don't know why I'm trying to say that he's saying some catchphrase from twin peaks.

534
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,660
 It's a bloody ghost.

535
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,660
 This bloody ghost walks up and he goes, "Got a match."

536
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,660
 That's not as clever.

537
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
 Right?

538
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,660
 It sounds like he's playing Goldfish.

539
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
 "Got a match."

540
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,660
 And the guard would freak out.

541
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,660
 Would freak out, obviously.

542
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
 There's an apparition.

543
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,660
 You wouldn't know this was a ghost.

544
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,660
 If not a ghost, just a man who's cosplaying really, really seriously.

545
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,660
 So people were like, "I don't want to work there anymore."

546
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
 And they're like, "Oh, come on, Billy.

547
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,660
 This is your job.

548
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
 You're in the military.

549
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
 You can't really determine where you want to go.

550
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,660
 You've been assigned this."

551
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,660
 And they're like, "Yeah, but it happens so regularly.

552
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,660
 It was almost every Saturday you'd be sitting at the guard booth

553
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,660
 and this blood-covered marine, you, right, this one of your countrymen,

554
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,660
 walks up to you and goes, "Got a match."

555
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,660
 But you figure, yeah, that's creepy and everything like that,

556
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,660
 but he's not super spooky if you're afraid of people covered in blood.

557
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,660
 It's quite terrifying, but it's like one of your countrymen.

558
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,660
 Again, it's not like he's like, "Aha, now I'm back for revenge."

559
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,660
 If anything, he's going to want to look at your girly magazine.

560
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
 But there was another problem at Gate 3.

561
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,660
 It wasn't just the bloody marine that was seen there.

562
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,660
 Sometimes you'd be at the gate, it'd be around 3 a.m.,

563
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,660
 but you see other specters appear out of the wilderness.

564
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:25,660
 Dead Japanese soldiers lurking just outside of the lights.

565
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:35,660
 You see three, six, nine dead soldiers watching you from the darkness.

566
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
 So the US, this is true.

567
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,660
 The United States military, we're getting all these reports from Gate 3 and they go,

568
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,660
 "Listen, we have guns, we can make people do stuff.

569
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,660
 If you don't do your assignment, we throw you in the brig

570
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,660
 and people are still refusing to work Gate 3."

571
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,660
 So they shut it down.

572
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,660
 Gate 3 is no longer in operation.

573
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,660
 You cannot...

574
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,660
 I guess it's not good to announce on a podcast,

575
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,660
 but the terrorists are like, "Woohoo!"

576
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,660
 They're like running through Gate 3, they're like, "Yes!"

577
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,660
 They shut down Gate 3 because it was too spooky to work out.

578
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,660
 But then let's go to Kadena Air Base, also in Okinawa.

579
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,660
 This one I had a little...

580
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,660
 I saw multiple sources talking about this story,

581
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,660
 but I wasn't able to verify a key component.

582
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,660
 It does make me think it's a bit of...

583
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,660
 urban legend, but I'm getting this information from military.com.

584
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,660
 This isn't just...

585
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,660
 I did see these stories on a bunch of other ghost websites,

586
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,660
 but my main source for these stories were military.com.

587
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,660
 So it's not like they're sitting around really making this stuff up,

588
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,660
 but it doesn't mean that the story itself is true,

589
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,660
 it just means that the story has been told over time.

590
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,660
 And we covered this on the story about the boy in the dishwasher.

591
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,660
 It's not unheard of, and I'll put that in the show notes.

592
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,660
 It's a really creepy episode.

593
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,660
 It's not unheard of for military to cover up crimes,

594
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,660
 especially crimes on their bases, crimes involving their servicemen,

595
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,660
 for moral reasons or to avoid a scandal

596
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
 or because they had something to do with it.

597
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:13,660
 But anyways, Building 2283 was base housing on Kadena Air Base.

598
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,660
 Some say, this is military.com saying this, by the way,

599
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,660
 some say that this house is the most haunted building

600
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,660
 in the entire US military base establishment.

601
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,660
 So this is where I don't know how accurate this is,

602
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,660
 but apparently in the 1970s, there was an Air Force officer

603
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,660
 who annihilated his family, killed everyone in the house,

604
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,660
 and then killed himself.

605
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,660
 But military, if it's anything, it's efficient.

606
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,660
 They have this building, and they need to put people in it.

607
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,660
 So they clean it up, and they just house another officer

608
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,660
 in his family in this base housing.

609
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,660
 And over time, the dad starts to go crazy.

610
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,660
 He's like, "Ugh, ugh, he's seeing Gooses.

611
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,660
 He's seeing geese everywhere.

612
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,660
 Ugh, he's so crazy, he's calling them Gooses."

613
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,660
 He starts to feel paranoid, he starts to feel unwell,

614
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,660
 his family kind of starts to feel off,

615
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,660
 and then this guy also murders his family.

616
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,660
 So at that point, this military goes,

617
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,660
 "Uh, let's not put any more families in here."

618
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,660
 Now, I don't know if that's true.

619
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,660
 I saw that report at a couple of places online,

620
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,660
 military.com, being one of them.

621
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,660
 I couldn't verify this took place.

622
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,660
 It wouldn't have been in the news, really,

623
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,660
 because they would have covered it up.

624
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,660
 So the mill, I don't know if that story is true.

625
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,660
 It sounds like an urban legend,

626
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,660
 but the military does say we're not putting in here

627
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,660
 the generals here.

628
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,660
 That story, they're like, "Oh, I didn't sleep last night,

629
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
 so spooky."

630
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,660
 They no longer let people live in building 2283.

631
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,660
 They turned it into a storage facility.

632
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
 But it's still in the middle of this base housing,

633
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,660
 and there is a chain link fence,

634
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
 and on the other side of the chain link fence

635
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,660
 is the base daycare.

636
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,660
 Kids are like, "Weee," they're like running around.

637
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,660
 But the teachers at the play school realized

638
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,660
 that they would have less toys.

639
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,660
 The kids kept losing their toys,

640
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,660
 and the teachers were like, "What's going on with all their toys?"

641
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,660
 And one day they saw the kids were throwing their toys

642
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,660
 over the chain link fence

643
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,660
 to the yard of the storage shed.

644
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
 They're throwing their toys over the fence.

645
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,660
 And one of the teacher goes,

646
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,660
 "Hey, why do you guys keep throwing your toys over the fence?"

647
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,660
 And the kids tell the teacher,

648
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,660
 "The little kids on the other side of the fence

649
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
 want our toys."

650
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,660
 They say, "Give them to us."

651
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,660
 They're very, very greedy.

652
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,660
 Very greedy translucent children.

653
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
 They want our toys and we want to share.

654
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,660
 Should we throw them over the fence?

655
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
 That's pretty good arm actually,

656
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,660
 now that I think about it,

657
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
 for a preschooler to be able to throw

658
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
 something over a six-foot chain fence.

659
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,660
 Who was the shack, the little shack baby.

660
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,660
 In 2009, the military's like,

661
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
 "Okay, we're done with these spooky stories.

662
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,660
 No one wants to join the Air Force anymore.

663
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,660
 They're afraid they're going to get sent to this base."

664
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,660
 They ended up tearing down the building.

665
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,660
 Supposedly, again, rumor, or who knows,

666
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,660
 the military tried tearing this building down multiple times before,

667
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,660
 but whenever workers would start working on the building,

668
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,660
 they would suffer hallucinations, headaches,

669
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,660
 and have on-site injuries.

670
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,660
 I think they're just super lazy workers

671
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,660
 and they're like, "Hey, dude, you know,

672
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,660
 we can get the day off if we tell them that

673
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
 every time we're trying to tear this house down,

674
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,660
 we think about murdering people,

675
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,660
 and then the military won't make us tear the house down."

676
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
 And then the co-worker goes,

677
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,660
 "Oh, they'll put you in a mental asylum."

678
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,660
 "But then I won't have to work for like a week or a month.

679
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
 It'll be awesome."

680
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
 So that's an easy thing to fake.

681
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
 Oh, the ghosts are giving me a headache.

682
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,660
 Can I have the day off, sir?

683
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,660
 But anyways, they did tear it down in 2009.

684
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,660
 The most haunted building out of every US military base

685
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,660
 on the planet is now destroyed.

686
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:57,660
 Interesting story, interesting ghost story.

687
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
 It's a good way to kick off, I hope you like ghost week,

688
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
 because I got a lot of good ones.

689
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
 So we're going to end it like this.

690
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,660
 Let's go ahead and put on our conspiracy caps here.

691
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,660
 Sure, they're knocking down the buildings

692
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,660
 and they're closing gate three,

693
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,660
 and it could be because the military knows that ghosts exist.

694
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
 Apparently they do know these ghosts exist.

695
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
 Military.com is reporting about it.

696
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,660
 I don't think there's a general who's surprised by this news

697
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
 if they're based in Okinawa.

698
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
 They've at least heard the stories.

699
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,660
 Whether or not they believe it, they've heard the stories.

700
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,660
 But with our conspiracy caps fully on,

701
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,660
 when we think of ghosts and possession

702
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,660
 and banging our heads and all sorts of stuff that's bad,

703
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,660
 you know, killing your entire family is bad in general.

704
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,660
 I don't think everyone agrees with that.

705
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,660
 But what if, conspiracy caps fully on,

706
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,660
 you have military commanders who are looking at

707
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
 a peanut butter and jelly situation.

708
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,660
 They go, one, we need soldiers who can fight war without hesitation.

709
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,660
 Two, we have an island full of spirits.

710
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,660
 Some are mournful, some are lost,

711
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,660
 but some are vengeful and ready to kill again.

712
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,660
 What if Okinawa wasn't selected just because it's a perfect...

713
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,660
 What if it wasn't selected just because it was right next to Japan,

714
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,660
 had all of this great landscape for us to build these bases on,

715
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,660
 and will help us prevent aggression in the theater?

716
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,660
 What if that's all secondary?

717
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,660
 What if it was some sort of mystical, spiritual,

718
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:30,660
 layline type of land where the veil between the living and the dead is so thin,

719
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,660
 seeing ghosts are commonplace for local EMTs.

720
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,660
 It just happens. This happens all the time.

721
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,660
 So you have a division hidden within the military

722
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,660
 that is trying to fuse living man with a damned soul,

723
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
 turning them into the ultimate weapon.

724
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,660
 Now it goes wrong a lot.

725
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,660
 People turn the aggression against their allies, their family,

726
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,660
 people turn the aggression against themselves.

727
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,660
 But what if over time they perfected?

728
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:07,660
 They're able to perfect that synthesis between man and the damned.

729
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,660
 It's funny, we're always talking about building the super soldier

730
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
 and they have these high-tech suits and these exoskeletons

731
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,660
 and these smart weapons and we're marching forward in time.

732
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,660
 But what if the real answer is going backwards?

733
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,660
 Building super soldiers using things that most people would consider superstition

734
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,660
 or forbidden knowledge.

735
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,660
 So a popular science magazine and wire magazine are having these articles

736
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,660
 about these high-tech weapons.

737
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,660
 They've already figured out the formula for the super soldier.

738
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,660
 There is a platoon of Marines based out of Okinawa,

739
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,660
 right now in the middle of some godforsaken patch of land on this planet.

740
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,660
 Laying waste to everything in front of them.

741
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:58,660
 A black ops unit with no morals, no compunction about killing,

742
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,660
 no hesitation, no regret.

743
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,660
 Because these soldiers are not just US special forces.

744
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:14,660
 They have the souls of long dead warriors inside their body.

745
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:21,660
 And even if you kill them, their spirit will just find another host.

746
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,660
 Their war will never end.

747
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,660
 And that's just the way they like it.

748
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:43,660
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

749
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,660
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

750
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,660
 I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one, guys.
