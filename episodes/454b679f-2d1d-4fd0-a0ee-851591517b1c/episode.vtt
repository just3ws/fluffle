 day with Honey Bunches of Oats cereal.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.560
 to get moving, you're ready!

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.000
 With the boost you need to be your best self, it's amazing what a little me time can do!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.080
 So make Honey Bunches of Oats cereal part of your morning routine, and make a bunch happen!

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.960
 Pick up a box of Honey Bunches of Oats in the cereal aisle today!

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.600
 Breaking news comes out of Wyoming as Navy SEALS lay siege to a nerd's hideout, and then

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.760
 we travel to Okinawa, Japan, site of some of the bloodiest battles of World War II.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.320
 Nowadays, US military bases dot the island, but is it possible that the spirits of slain

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.680
 soldiers still haunt the land today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:05.040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.880
 I'm your host Jason Garbender, I'm having a great day.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.120
 I hope you guys had lots of fun this weekend.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.360
 For some of us, it's Memorial Day weekend.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.400
 For others of you, it's just Monday.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.520
 Unless you're listening to this episode three years in the future, and then it's like September

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 4th.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.760
 But, if you're listening to it right now, have a Memorial Day!

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.760
 Have a burger for me.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.760
 Ready?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.320
 Have one at your house, 'cause I'm gonna come and eat it.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.760
 Speaking of eating, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, eating a big bowl of spaghetti.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
 I'm running out of ways to introduce Fajarance of Orders.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.600
 This one, he's just eating spaghetti.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.960
 It's fabricated plastic.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.320
 Everyone give a round of applause to fabricated plastic, our newest Fajarance of Order.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.280
 Big mouthful of spaghetti, has an apron on that says "Kiss the man eating the spaghetti."

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.880
 Fabricated plastic, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.520
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.200
 I just need you to get the word out about the show.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.400
 Talk about it on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, wherever you hang out online.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.480
 Spread the word about the show, that's what keeps the show going.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.960
 That's what keeps the show growing.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.720
 There's a little rhyme there.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.960
 Fabricated plastic, go ahead and put down that spaghetti.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.880
 He's like, "Is that really my intro?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.160
 I'm sorry, I'm running out of ideas."

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.000
 Fabricated plastic, I'm gonna go and entache the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.040
 But fly low, fly quiet.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.320
 We're headed into a war zone.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.920
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920
 We're headed out to Wyoming.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.240
 Before we get started on this first story, I wanted to do an update to a story we covered

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.120
 last week where I exposed, I did an expose on Throwaway Alien.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.120
 It was this whole thing, I'm not gonna rehash it, it was Friday's episode actually.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.160
 He made this prediction, aliens were gonna show up on July 18th.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.840
 He made that prediction back seven years ago and then this US government report came out,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.560
 that's supposed to come out in July 2021 and just happened to coincide and it was this

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.960
 huge thing like, "Whoa, was this guy right?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:10.320
 Well he came back and wrote this 31, I actually counted 31 paragraph blog post about him and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.680
 this alien named Gina and it was just so ridiculous and he changed the prophecy and all this stuff.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.640
 He has deleted his account.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.560
 Throwaway Alien is no more.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.600
 An absolute exposed LARP at this point.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.000
 The post is still up.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.040
 But he's deleted his account, that account can never be reactivated.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 So this story's done.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.800
 Well anyone now can pop up and say, "Oh I was Throwaway Alien and some guy made me eat

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.720
 a bunch of spaghetti until I cancelled my account."

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 But it's done.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.720
 It's done.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.080
 Throwaway Alien thing, LARPed too hard.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.640
 The story is over and anyone at this point can pretend to be Throwaway Alien.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.800
 Don't get any clever ideas.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.960
 But yeah, so that's the end of that saga.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.960
 That's it.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.360
 A fitting end to a story that started off fun and ended up super super lame.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.280
 It has a lame ending.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.320
 Fabricated plastic is flying instead of a Durgible out to Wyoming and that's when I have these

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.320
 plans.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.440
 I just roll them out on the table and I pick it to aggro up and I stick it through the plan.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440
 Super dramatic.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.040
 I don't know where we're going now.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.480
 So I just kind of circle around the area.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.200
 I stabbed the map.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.120
 These are plans of the Irma Lake Lodge.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.920
 And I'm pointing and stuff like that.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920
 I'm pointing.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.040
 I'm like, "Go right here where this dagger is."

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.240
 It's May 17th, 2021.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.560
 We're flying over Bill Gates private ranch in Wyoming.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.680
 Now I know what you guys are thinking.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.460
 How did I get such a break in exclusive?

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.120
 How was I able to cover a story involving Bill Gates ranch?

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.040
 Because I follow the only news that matters.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.580
 The juiciest news full of worms and salmonella.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.920
 Real raw news.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.680
 This is another breaking article from Michael Baxter.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.480
 I'm almost thinking about starting my own podcast called Real Rawcast.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.720
 It's just that podcast only covers this site.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.920
 I'm so close to doing that.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.840
 The Real Rawcast.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.700
 It's a pre-dawn raid on Bill Gates compound.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.620
 Navy SEALs are getting ready to launch a raid on Bill Gates compound.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.620
 And you, a rational human being, rational person, goes, "What?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.460
 Where is this coming from?

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.260
 Well, let's go back in time a little bit here."

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.980
 If you haven't been following the Real Raw saga.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.540
 Here it is in footnotes.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.540
 YouTube Spotify.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.580
 I do not believe in this.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.880
 YouTube I want to take down all of my Bill Gates stuff.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.040
 Anyways, we know what's on there.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.440
 They're on the cooked news side.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.240
 Not the raw news side.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.520
 And YouTube is just YouTube.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.920
 But I don't believe in this.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.520
 But this is the Real Raw news summary so far.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.880
 One, President Trump is still president.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.840
 And Biden is running the White House from a movie set.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.520
 Two, that's such a shocking revelation to begin with, right?

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.540
 So, that's one.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.780
 We have to believe that part before we move on forward.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.860
 And that's already so ridiculous.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.020
 Donald Trump is still president.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.980
 Joe Biden is running it from a movie set.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.800
 The movie set, that looks exactly like the White House in the location of the White

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800
 House.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.380
 Surrounded by employees of the White House.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.220
 But it's all fake.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.540
 So anyways, President Trump and President Trump was like, "You know what?

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.820
 I'm still president.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.520
 So I can still do all this presidential stuff, like order around the military."

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.200
 So he has been arresting the swamp people.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.640
 The deep state swamp people.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.360
 We covered Hillary Clinton throwing poop in Guantanamo Bay.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.360
 She was executed by Donald Trump.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.280
 And then we covered Nancy Pelosi's face was stolen.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.480
 They thought they were getting Nancy Pelosi.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.560
 But they just stole a Nancy Pelosi lookalike who was wearing a lifelike mask.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.800
 That's where we're at in this saga.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.220
 So what does Bill Gates have to do with any of this?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.380
 So Melinda Gates apparently in this mythology here.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.220
 Melinda Gates apparently goes to the real White House and meets Donald Trump and goes,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.020
 listen, Bill Gates is a horrible, horrible person.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.220
 He's actually, he, this is, this part's true.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.420
 This part's true.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.220
 He did hang out a lot with Jeffrey Epstein.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.220
 That part's true.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.060
 Now, not, I've said this before in my episode with Jeffrey Epstein.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.380
 I don't think everyone who hung out with Jeffrey Epstein knew what he was up to.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.080
 But I don't think everyone also didn't.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.040
 So Bill Gates did seem to hang out with this guy a lot.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.280
 I'm sure the person who was selling art to Jeffrey Epstein wasn't aware of what was going

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.680
 on, especially before the first arrest, because he was arrested twice.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.880
 And Melinda Gates hated Jeffrey Epstein.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.600
 Thought he was, at the very least, thought he was a very crass, boorish man.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.360
 Like there was no, and the articles I read, there was no hint.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.800
 These are legit news articles.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.060
 These are well, medium, well done articles.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.740
 There was no hint that Melinda knew what Jeffrey Epstein was up to.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.060
 She just didn't like him.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.980
 She did think he hung out with younger women, but in the sense of like, oh, he's in his

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.020
 sixties and he's dating 20 year olds and stuff like that.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:19.980
 There was nothing Melinda Gates, but Bill Gates, I can't say for sure whether or not

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.420
 he did hang out with Jeffrey Epstein a lot though.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:28.300
 More than, more than you should hang out with someone who's been convicted of child

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.720
 molestation twice.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.720
 So anyways, Melinda Gates, that was one of the reasons she was saying like, and it's

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.720
 come out, a lot of stuff has come out with Bill Gates.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.000
 This is in the middle of like real news and raw news, this kind of rumor, but he was a

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 flanderer.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.440
 Like people are saying, Spotify, the reason why I keep saying Spotify is I did an episode

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.640
 about Bill Gates being, is he the Antichrist?

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.520
 You guys listen to the show, you guys are smart.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.880
 The episode was called, is Bill Gates the Antichrist or something like that?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.040
 And it was talking about those conspiracy theories.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.940
 That's the one episode of this podcast you cannot hear on Spotify.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.140
 They removed it.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.340
 Even though it's exploring those topics and I'm not saying that any of that stuff is

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.660
 true, I'm not even saying that stuff is true now.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.780
 Spotify, that's the one episode out of 681 episodes.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.940
 It's the one episode you can't listen to on Spotify.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.900
 You can listen to it anywhere else.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.900
 Weird.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.860
 But anyways, where was I?

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.900
 Oh, oh, I was slandering Bill Gates.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:29.960
 Now the rumor is, is that he, like they were covering up sexual misconduct in the workplace

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.560
 and he was like flirting with younger women and stuff like, younger in like overage, like

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.880
 20s, 25, stuff like that, not like Jeffrey Epstein Young.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:46.220
 So it still was an unbecoming of America's favorite nerd, Bill Gates.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.220
 So let's get back.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.560
 So that stuff is fairly real.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.680
 I'll put those, those in the show notes, those rumors and stuff like that.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.820
 But anyways, back to this mythology.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:00.980
 Melinda Gates goes to Donald Trump and she goes, listen, Bill Gates is not just the world's

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.980
 biggest nerd.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.460
 He's a supervillain.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.940
 He's excavated underneath his ranch in Wyoming and there's these massive tunnels down there

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.700
 where he canapsed children.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.780
 Let me be clear again, this is the real raw news version.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.580
 There is nothing to back any of this stuff up.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.060
 Melinda Gates is apparently coming clean with this whole thing.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:27.800
 So that would elevate Bill Gates from just being a creep to literally being a supervillain.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.320
 He has an underground layer full of kidnapped children.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.000
 So Donald Trump goes, do it.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.600
 And so he orders, because he's still president, of course, right?

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:43.920
 He orders these US Navy SEALs to lay siege to Bill Gates compound.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.680
 So it's May 17th, 2021, super recent, right?

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.680
 Should have been the news.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.040
 They should have been the news, but it's not.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040
 Go, go, go!

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.980
 The US Navy SEALs are running through the ranch and then they're just shooting dudes.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.860
 They're just shooting like stable hands.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.300
 There's some guy cleaning up cow poop.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.900
 He's like, ah, no, apparently this kind of grinds my gears, honestly.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.380
 I never really thought of this before.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.740
 I don't mean to keep going off on tangents because I know you guys want to know the end

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:15.700
 of the story, but apparently Bill Gates has a paramilitary force at this ranch armed with

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.540
 automatic weapons and they're wearing like this paramilitary gear and they engage in a

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.200
 firefight with the Navy SEALs.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.200
 Shootin'.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.880
 That really kind of grinds my gears because I never thought of a nerd having an army.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.560
 Like I get it, like you need a bodyguard.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.120
 But even then it's like dudes you know, like the Jonas Brothers, their bodyguard is like

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.200
 this family friend who just happens to be 600 pounds and seven feet tall.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.920
 He's just someone they know.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.920
 That's fine.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.640
 That's cool, right?

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.920
 But to think someone could be like, oh, I've invented a microchip.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.980
 And then he's able to like buy a thousand dudes to walk around with machine guns.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.900
 It just sounds weird.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.900
 It doesn't sound right.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.780
 Like I think you should earn your army, not just pay for it.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.300
 You should be like a Cobra Commander guy.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.620
 Well, now that I think about it, Bill Gates is a super villain.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.620
 Kidnapping children.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.580
 I don't know why I'm being so harsh on him.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.260
 They're having this gunfight with the Navy SEALs.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.260
 Now actually it's good.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:15.420
 I am doing this episode for Memorial Day because we're going to memorialize these fallen imaginary

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.880
 soldiers, these poor imaginary families that are going to have to mourn their imaginary

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.960
 loved ones in this firefight.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.400
 Eight of these paramilitary goons working for Bill Gates, traitors, boo.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.240
 They got killed by the Navy SEALs.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.520
 They have no memorial day for them.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.600
 For all I know, they were decorated veterans before they had to work for Bill Gates.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.600
 But still, boo.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.160
 And then we lost one US Navy SEAL.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.660
 Till the daughter who was never born, to a wife that doesn't exist, that I loved them

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.900
 both.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:53.060
 And then they fade away into back into the imagination of Michael Baxter.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.100
 You may think I'm making jokes, which I am.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.260
 If you look at the comments for this article, so many comments.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.860
 Here, I'll read you a comment actually from this article.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.860
 This is the very first comment on this article.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.140
 "Gates didn't leave the gate open."

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.140
 You like that pun there?

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.140
 I didn't come up with that.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.140
 This guy did.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.800
 "Gates didn't leave the gate open, but the SEALs busted open.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:24.040
 I am sorry one had to pay the ultimate price, though."

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.040
 He doesn't exist.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.040
 He's the same thing.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.560
 It's the same thing as someone being like, "Oh no, poor Han Solo.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.560
 His son murdered him."

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.560
 That doesn't exist.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.560
 That doesn't happen.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.080
 I mean, I guess you can be sad for the character in a narrative story, but he doesn't.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.540
 Don't be sad for this guy.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.100
 He doesn't exist.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.660
 He never existed, dude.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:55.820
 The comments are almost as funny as the article, but anyways, one had to pay the ultimate price.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.780
 These Navy SEALs, though, do breach the compound.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.460
 It's a 15 minute firefight.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.900
 They do blow away eight of these fictional characters.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.260
 And then they go to a...

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
 This is straight out of James Bond novel.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.600
 I mean, maybe this exists.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 I don't know.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.600
 If you go...

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.600
 If you...

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.720
 Maybe you can visit this place, Irma Lake Lodge, if you know where it's at.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.440
 Go to the horse stable.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.960
 And apparently there's a...

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.160
 There's a bale of fake hay there.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160
 You lift this up.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.440
 There's a 300 foot drop.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.440
 There's an elevator there.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.920
 You don't have to be superman to get down there.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.100
 There's a 300 foot elevator shaft.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.920
 That's the word, not drop.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.300
 And if you go down the elevator, you end up in this giant circle that's 150 feet in diameter.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.980
 I'm gonna read you this passage.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.980
 This concern...

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.540
 This passage really, really concerns me.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.040
 For several reasons.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.780
 Let's see if you can figure them out.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.820
 This was written by Michael Baxter for Real Raw News.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:59.900
 "The SEALs," our source said, "spent hours scouring the tunnels for signs of life.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.580
 But no children were found.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.480
 However, the operation was not in vain.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.600
 As they did uncover a facsimile of a young girl's bedroom, with a pink frame platform

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.760
 bed, stuffed animals, and racks of child-sized clothing.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:31.840
 Moreover, three DSLRs on tripods have also been aimed to video whoever had lain in the

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840
 bed.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.980
 At least one camera still had an SD card."

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.060
 That's gross because it didn't happen.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.740
 That did not happen.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.660
 The Navy SEALs did not go to Bill Gates' compound and have this firefight and find this chamber

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.660
 and then come across this pink little girl's bedroom with little girl clothes.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.500
 That didn't happen.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.920
 And it is very, very concerning to...

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.780
 You guys understand why I'm concerned, right?

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.900
 Someone is imagining that.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.360
 It would be one thing if it was true, if it was factual.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.720
 You could look at it and go, "Oh, that's sick.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.600
 Bill Gates must pay for his crimes."

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.600
 But it's not.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.600
 Someone imagine...

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.680
 Because what does that imply, right?

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.680
 That someone...

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.840
 Someone has crafted this imaginary world where this is under Bill Gates' house.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.320
 It doesn't actually matter if it's under Bill Gates' house.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.960
 It could be under the local plumber's house.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.660
 It's creepy and it's gross and it makes me...

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.300
 It doesn't make me suspicious of Bill Gates.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.700
 I don't know if Michael Baxter is making this up out of whole cloth or if someone is telling

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.900
 him stuff, but whoever is telling him stuff is clearly lying.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.460
 Not only are they lying, they're telling disgusting gross lies that are so specific it

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.660
 puts a mental image in your head of something you shouldn't have a mental image of.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.600
 This article could have been just fine without that passage.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.520
 That passage kicks you in the stomach and it's too much.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.520
 It's too much.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.200
 But I think there's a contingent of conspiracy theorists.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200
 Not just conspiracy theorists.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.240
 I think true crime people get it too, but they get...

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.120
 There is some sort of response to that.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.480
 That's not anger or revulsion.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.920
 Titillation, I guess.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.460
 It's completely unnecessary in the narrative.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.940
 It's completely unnecessary.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.440
 Hillary Clinton throwing her poop?

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.900
 That's important to the plot?

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.500
 I need to know that.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.580
 But this, they could have totally left that out.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.260
 That's there to titillate the reader.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.260
 Tune in next, guys.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.940
 Well, we'll discuss some other disgusting thing.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:48.660
 Yeah, that type of detail really bugs me and it makes me super sus of what the motivations

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.660
 are.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.660
 Does it titillate the reader?

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.220
 Is it to just scam people?

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.220
 I don't know.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.220
 I don't know.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.220
 Is it just a fun work of fiction?

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.180
 Not fun, but is it just a work of fiction?

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.780
 Is someone lying to Michael Baxter?

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.140
 Does he know that this isn't real?

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.640
 His readers don't.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640
 Some of them do.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:11.340
 You read through the comments, but the unnecessarily gross detail.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.340
 So yeah.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.820
 Why did you share it with us then, you jerk?

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.020
 I think it's just a gross detail.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.240
 It has nothing in the narrative.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.540
 It titillates a percentage of the readers of people who shouldn't be getting titillated

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.540
 by that stuff.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.540
 You know what I mean?

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.540
 It's gross.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.020
 Just if Michael Baxter, if you listen to this podcast or if you listen to my upcoming podcast,

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.740
 real rawcast tone it down.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.180
 Don't tone it down.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.180
 All that type of stuff.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:40.020
 Because if you're getting hits, if that's causing people to really enjoy your website,

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.180
 it's the wrong kind of people.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.180
 Fabricated plastic.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.860
 I want you to call in that carpenter copter.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.280
 We're going to say goodbye to Bill Gates.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.160
 He's on the run too, if you didn't know that.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.800
 If you see him on the news, that's fake.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.960
 He's actually on the run right now.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.440
 So if you happen to see him, if you happen to see him walking around Seattle, it's probably

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.000
 Nancy Pelosi just wearing his face.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.800
 We're leaving behind Wyoming.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:10.760
 We're headed out to Okinawa in Japan.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.320
 We actually brought some of those US Navy SEALs with us because this is another military

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.660
 theme to story and I should also introduce the theme for this week.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.820
 I hope you like ghosts because I found a bunch of ghost stories.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.300
 I didn't even announce it in the beginning.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.540
 I found so many ghost stories this week.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.740
 A lot of really good ones.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.820
 A lot of ones that I've never heard of.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.300
 So I hope you like ghosts because I love ghosts.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.020
 We don't cover them enough on this show.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.660
 It's hard to find compelling ghost stories.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.660
 We got a lot of good ones this week.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.940
 Fabricated plastic is bringing that carpenter copter.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.220
 We're ready for war.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.080
 We're actually back in the year that World War II was happening.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.080
 What was that?

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.800
 1939 to 1944.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.440
 Carbenter copters flying through time.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:02.440
 Okinawa, Japan was actually the site of some of the most violent battles of World War II.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.440
 That movie, "Hack Saw Ridge," if you guys haven't seen that, directed by Mel Gibson, starring

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.520
 Spider-Man.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:17.140
 That was in Okinawa and then other battles that they didn't make movies about, starring

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.140
 Spider-Man.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.340
 Overall, 12,500 US soldiers were killed.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.180
 110,000 Japanese soldiers were killed.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.300
 This was really the last major battle of World War II.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.580
 This was right outside of Japan.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:34.340
 European Front was over with Russia's advancing on Japan, war advancing on Japan.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.100
 This is really in Okinawa were the last major battles.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.720
 Yamato was sunk during these battles.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:46.960
 So you had 110,000 Japanese soldiers and up to 150,000 civilians were killed in these

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.880
 battles on Okinawa.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:56.280
 Nowadays, it's the home to six US Marine bases and one US Air Force base.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:04.600
 And it is the first and most likely last line of defense against a Pacific theater war.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:12.500
 So it's a pretty integral part of the United States military strategy in the Pacific.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:19.180
 So it doesn't help thing that these bases seem to be horribly, horribly haunted.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:25.180
 On Reddit, there's a user named Bananasunami and he posted this story that back in 2015

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:30.340
 he worked as an emergency technician at Camp Hanson, which was one of the Marine bases.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:36.880
 He said that his team included a local ambulance service, so Japanese ambulance service and

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.680
 then local firefighters as well.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.360
 And he goes at 2 AM, we got a call that a Marine had suffered a head injury.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:51.040
 So we all go down there, we go down to the barracks and the dude is acting possessed.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.720
 Or having a grand mal seizure.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.720
 You kind of, there's kind of different ways to treat the two.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.840
 At first glance, we're going to call him Chuck.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.660
 Chuck goes, the guy's flipping around.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.900
 He has 10 people on him trying to hold him down.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.940
 His head is actually being held to the ground because he keeps banging the back of his head

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.620
 on the floor.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.620
 And he's there to render aid.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.000
 He's not there to start throwing holy water on the dude, but there's something super

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 off about this guy.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.060
 He says that he had a couple goose eggs on his face.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.060
 Which you don't know, you don't know.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.060
 That's a turn of phrase.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.060
 That just means giant lumps.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.540
 It doesn't actually mean that as they're holding him down, a goose walked up and was like,

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.660
 "Haha, the perfect chance."

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.660
 His mouth is opening and closing.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.660
 [gurgling]

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.660
 His eyes are rolling.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.660
 Happy Memorial Day, by the way, guys.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.660
 His eyes are rolling in the back of his head.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.660
 [gurgling]

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.660
 And he's screaming, "Make it stop!

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.660
 Make it stop!"

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.660
 They're treating this guy.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.660
 And one of the things you got to do is figure out what it is this guy.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:55.660
 I guess they have a problem with spice over there, the synthetic marijuana.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.660
 And you can buy pain pills over the counter.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.660
 So the first thing, the thing is some sort of drug overdose.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.660
 Like what happened?

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.660
 Because that'll be different.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.660
 Was he playing with the Ouija board at 3 AM?

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.660
 Chuck asks the guy's friend.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.660
 He goes, "What happened?"

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.660
 He goes, "Dude, I have no idea.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.660
 We're standing there.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.660
 We're drinking beer.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.660
 It is 2 in the morning.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.660
 So it's not super spooky yet.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.660
 We're drinking beer.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.660
 And then in the middle of conversation, his demeanor changed.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.660
 He walked away from me, walked over to the stairwell where there's a wall there.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.660
 And sort of bang in his head into the wall.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.660
 And that's how he got all those goose eggs.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.660
 Don't suspect that goose that walked away wearing the trench coat and the little hat.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.660
 And he gave them to himself.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.660
 So he goes, "That's weird."

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:40.660
 And as they're treating this guy, they eventually had to get like one of those backboards and strap them down to it.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.660
 Some of the local ambulance crew goes, "Yeah, this happens."

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.660
 I'm like, "What do you mean it happens?"

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.660
 They're like, "It happens."

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:54.660
 So they take him to the hospital and they figure out, like, he said the official diagnosis was some medical thing.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.660
 They said like his hemoglobin was breaking down in his liver or something like that.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.660
 And it can cause like dehydration and confusion.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.660
 He goes, "But that tends to take time.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.660
 Like, I'm not that dumb.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.660
 Like, that wouldn't happen instantly."

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:17.660
 And Chuck was thinking there was another case that he had heard not too long ago in the same barracks of another U.S. Marine just flipping out.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.660
 Just being totally normal and then, "Ahh!"

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.660
 And then started screaming, "Get it out! Get it out!"

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:31.660
 So he did not immediately retire from the service.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.660
 He did not request a transfer.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.660
 Apparently Chuck just continued to work there and thought, "Well, isn't that odd?"

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.660
 Now, I read that in my go. That is odd.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.660
 But you know, it's a Reddit story.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.660
 Who knows how real it is.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.660
 There's stuff like No Sleep out there that gets confusing.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.660
 This wasn't from No Sleep.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.660
 But you know, you always want to check this stuff out as much as you can.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.660
 You're not always able to.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.660
 But I, so I started looking up Okinawa ghosts.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:59.660
 Okinawa is actually considered one of the most haunted military locations.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.660
 Like all the bases in the world.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.660
 The ghost of Okinawa military bases are so well known.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.660
 The militaries had to knock buildings down and just be like, "It's not worth it.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.660
 It's totally not worth it."

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.660
 This Chuck Banana Tsunami, I'll go and buy that name now.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.660
 Led me down this crazy rabbit hole.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.660
 It is so haunted there.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.660
 The military is like, "We don't know what to do.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.660
 This is in terror to our defenses.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.660
 But it's also super, super spooky."

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:34.660
 Also at Camp Hanson, this military base, there's Gate 3.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.660
 There's multiple ways to get into this base.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.660
 And Gate 3, just like any other gate, you have a couple guards sitting there

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.660
 guarding it.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.660
 That's why their name is called "Gards."

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.660
 They're on the lookout for that malicious goose.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.660
 But at 3 a.m., you'd be sitting there reading some girly magazine.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.660
 This isn't a current story.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.660
 You wouldn't be able to get away with that today.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.660
 It's 1952.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.660
 You're reading some issue of Playboy.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.660
 And you hear footsteps walking up to the gate.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.660
 You're like, "Oh, dang it.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.660
 I better do my job.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.660
 I better actually guard up this facility."

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.660
 Instead of looking at pictures of Marilyn Monroe and you look up

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:15.660
 and there is a World War II-era Marine standing there.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.660
 You know the uniform?

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.660
 You know exactly that this man seemed to have stepped out of time.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.660
 But he's drenched in blood.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:30.660
 And he looks up at you and goes, "Got a light."

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.660
 Now, I don't know if he actually said "Got a light."

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.660
 I just like that because he reminds me of which one peaks.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.660
 He would, though, say, "Okay, didn't say 'Got a light.'"

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.660
 Fine.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.660
 He goes, "Fine.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.660
 You caught me.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.660
 I just want twin peaks to be real."

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.660
 This bloody Marine would walk up to me.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.660
 I don't know.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.660
 It's a bloody ghost.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.660
 I don't know why I'm trying to say that he's saying some catchphrase from twin peaks.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.660
 It's a bloody ghost.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.660
 This bloody ghost walks up and he goes, "Got a match."

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.660
 That's not as clever.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.660
 Right?

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.660
 It sounds like he's playing Goldfish.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.660
 "Got a match."

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.660
 And the guard would freak out.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.660
 Would freak out, obviously.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.660
 There's an apparition.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.660
 You wouldn't know this was a ghost.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.660
 If not a ghost, just a man who's cosplaying really, really seriously.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.660
 So people were like, "I don't want to work there anymore."

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.660
 And they're like, "Oh, come on, Billy.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.660
 This is your job.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.660
 You're in the military.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.660
 You can't really determine where you want to go.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.660
 You've been assigned this."

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.660
 And they're like, "Yeah, but it happens so regularly.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.660
 It was almost every Saturday you'd be sitting at the guard booth

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.660
 and this blood-covered marine, you, right, this one of your countrymen,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:47.660
 walks up to you and goes, "Got a match."

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.660
 But you figure, yeah, that's creepy and everything like that,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.660
 but he's not super spooky if you're afraid of people covered in blood.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.660
 It's quite terrifying, but it's like one of your countrymen.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.660
 Again, it's not like he's like, "Aha, now I'm back for revenge."

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.660
 If anything, he's going to want to look at your girly magazine.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.660
 But there was another problem at Gate 3.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.660
 It wasn't just the bloody marine that was seen there.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.660
 Sometimes you'd be at the gate, it'd be around 3 a.m.,

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.660
 but you see other specters appear out of the wilderness.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:25.660
 Dead Japanese soldiers lurking just outside of the lights.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:35.660
 You see three, six, nine dead soldiers watching you from the darkness.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.660
 So the US, this is true.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.660
 The United States military, we're getting all these reports from Gate 3 and they go,

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:46.660
 "Listen, we have guns, we can make people do stuff.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.660
 If you don't do your assignment, we throw you in the brig

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.660
 and people are still refusing to work Gate 3."

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.660
 So they shut it down.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.660
 Gate 3 is no longer in operation.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.660
 You cannot...

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.660
 I guess it's not good to announce on a podcast,

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.660
 but the terrorists are like, "Woohoo!"

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.660
 They're like running through Gate 3, they're like, "Yes!"

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:09.660
 They shut down Gate 3 because it was too spooky to work out.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.660
 But then let's go to Kadena Air Base, also in Okinawa.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.660
 This one I had a little...

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.660
 I saw multiple sources talking about this story,

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.660
 but I wasn't able to verify a key component.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.660
 It does make me think it's a bit of...

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.660
 urban legend, but I'm getting this information from military.com.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.660
 This isn't just...

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.660
 I did see these stories on a bunch of other ghost websites,

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.660
 but my main source for these stories were military.com.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.660
 So it's not like they're sitting around really making this stuff up,

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.660
 but it doesn't mean that the story itself is true,

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.660
 it just means that the story has been told over time.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:49.660
 And we covered this on the story about the boy in the dishwasher.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.660
 It's not unheard of, and I'll put that in the show notes.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.660
 It's a really creepy episode.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.660
 It's not unheard of for military to cover up crimes,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.660
 especially crimes on their bases, crimes involving their servicemen,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.660
 for moral reasons or to avoid a scandal

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.660
 or because they had something to do with it.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:13.660
 But anyways, Building 2283 was base housing on Kadena Air Base.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.660
 Some say, this is military.com saying this, by the way,

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.660
 some say that this house is the most haunted building

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.660
 in the entire US military base establishment.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.660
 So this is where I don't know how accurate this is,

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.660
 but apparently in the 1970s, there was an Air Force officer

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:35.660
 who annihilated his family, killed everyone in the house,

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.660
 and then killed himself.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.660
 But military, if it's anything, it's efficient.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.660
 They have this building, and they need to put people in it.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.660
 So they clean it up, and they just house another officer

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.660
 in his family in this base housing.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.660
 And over time, the dad starts to go crazy.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.660
 He's like, "Ugh, ugh, he's seeing Gooses.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.660
 He's seeing geese everywhere.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.660
 Ugh, he's so crazy, he's calling them Gooses."

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.660
 He starts to feel paranoid, he starts to feel unwell,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.660
 his family kind of starts to feel off,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.660
 and then this guy also murders his family.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.660
 So at that point, this military goes,

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.660
 "Uh, let's not put any more families in here."

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.660
 Now, I don't know if that's true.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.660
 I saw that report at a couple of places online,

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.660
 military.com, being one of them.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.660
 I couldn't verify this took place.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.660
 It wouldn't have been in the news, really,

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.660
 because they would have covered it up.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.660
 So the mill, I don't know if that story is true.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.660
 It sounds like an urban legend,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.660
 but the military does say we're not putting in here

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.660
 the generals here.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.660
 That story, they're like, "Oh, I didn't sleep last night,

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.660
 so spooky."

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.660
 They no longer let people live in building 2283.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.660
 They turned it into a storage facility.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.660
 But it's still in the middle of this base housing,

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.660
 and there is a chain link fence,

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.660
 and on the other side of the chain link fence

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.660
 is the base daycare.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.660
 Kids are like, "Weee," they're like running around.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.660
 But the teachers at the play school realized

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.660
 that they would have less toys.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.660
 The kids kept losing their toys,

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.660
 and the teachers were like, "What's going on with all their toys?"

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.660
 And one day they saw the kids were throwing their toys

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.660
 over the chain link fence

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.660
 to the yard of the storage shed.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.660
 They're throwing their toys over the fence.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.660
 And one of the teacher goes,

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.660
 "Hey, why do you guys keep throwing your toys over the fence?"

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.660
 And the kids tell the teacher,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.660
 "The little kids on the other side of the fence

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.660
 want our toys."

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.660
 They say, "Give them to us."

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.660
 They're very, very greedy.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.660
 Very greedy translucent children.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.660
 They want our toys and we want to share.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.660
 Should we throw them over the fence?

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.660
 That's pretty good arm actually,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.660
 now that I think about it,

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.660
 for a preschooler to be able to throw

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.660
 something over a six-foot chain fence.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.660
 Who was the shack, the little shack baby.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.660
 In 2009, the military's like,

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.660
 "Okay, we're done with these spooky stories.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.660
 No one wants to join the Air Force anymore.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.660
 They're afraid they're going to get sent to this base."

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.660
 They ended up tearing down the building.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.660
 Supposedly, again, rumor, or who knows,

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.660
 the military tried tearing this building down multiple times before,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.660
 but whenever workers would start working on the building,

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.660
 they would suffer hallucinations, headaches,

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.660
 and have on-site injuries.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.660
 I think they're just super lazy workers

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.660
 and they're like, "Hey, dude, you know,

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.660
 we can get the day off if we tell them that

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.660
 every time we're trying to tear this house down,

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.660
 we think about murdering people,

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.660
 and then the military won't make us tear the house down."

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.660
 And then the co-worker goes,

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.660
 "Oh, they'll put you in a mental asylum."

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.660
 "But then I won't have to work for like a week or a month.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.660
 It'll be awesome."

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.660
 So that's an easy thing to fake.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.660
 Oh, the ghosts are giving me a headache.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.660
 Can I have the day off, sir?

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.660
 But anyways, they did tear it down in 2009.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.660
 The most haunted building out of every US military base

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.660
 on the planet is now destroyed.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:57.660
 Interesting story, interesting ghost story.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.660
 It's a good way to kick off, I hope you like ghost week,

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.660
 because I got a lot of good ones.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.660
 So we're going to end it like this.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.660
 Let's go ahead and put on our conspiracy caps here.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.660
 Sure, they're knocking down the buildings

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.660
 and they're closing gate three,

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.660
 and it could be because the military knows that ghosts exist.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.660
 Apparently they do know these ghosts exist.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.660
 Military.com is reporting about it.

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.660
 I don't think there's a general who's surprised by this news

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.660
 if they're based in Okinawa.

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:21.660
 They've at least heard the stories.

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.660
 Whether or not they believe it, they've heard the stories.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.660
 But with our conspiracy caps fully on,

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.660
 when we think of ghosts and possession

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.660
 and banging our heads and all sorts of stuff that's bad,

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.660
 you know, killing your entire family is bad in general.

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.660
 I don't think everyone agrees with that.

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:39.660
 But what if, conspiracy caps fully on,

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.660
 you have military commanders who are looking at

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.660
 a peanut butter and jelly situation.

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:48.660
 They go, one, we need soldiers who can fight war without hesitation.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:54.660
 Two, we have an island full of spirits.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.660
 Some are mournful, some are lost,

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:03.660
 but some are vengeful and ready to kill again.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.660
 What if Okinawa wasn't selected just because it's a perfect...

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.660
 What if it wasn't selected just because it was right next to Japan,

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.660
 had all of this great landscape for us to build these bases on,

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.660
 and will help us prevent aggression in the theater?

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.660
 What if that's all secondary?

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.660
 What if it was some sort of mystical, spiritual,

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:30.660
 layline type of land where the veil between the living and the dead is so thin,

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.660
 seeing ghosts are commonplace for local EMTs.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.660
 It just happens. This happens all the time.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.660
 So you have a division hidden within the military

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:46.660
 that is trying to fuse living man with a damned soul,

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.660
 turning them into the ultimate weapon.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.660
 Now it goes wrong a lot.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.660
 People turn the aggression against their allies, their family,

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.660
 people turn the aggression against themselves.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.660
 But what if over time they perfected?

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:07.660
 They're able to perfect that synthesis between man and the damned.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.660
 It's funny, we're always talking about building the super soldier

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.660
 and they have these high-tech suits and these exoskeletons

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.660
 and these smart weapons and we're marching forward in time.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.660
 But what if the real answer is going backwards?

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:25.660
 Building super soldiers using things that most people would consider superstition

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.660
 or forbidden knowledge.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.660
 So a popular science magazine and wire magazine are having these articles

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.660
 about these high-tech weapons.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.660
 They've already figured out the formula for the super soldier.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:43.660
 There is a platoon of Marines based out of Okinawa,

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.660
 right now in the middle of some godforsaken patch of land on this planet.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.660
 Laying waste to everything in front of them.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:58.660
 A black ops unit with no morals, no compunction about killing,

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.660
 no hesitation, no regret.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:07.660
 Because these soldiers are not just US special forces.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:14.660
 They have the souls of long dead warriors inside their body.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:21.660
 And even if you kill them, their spirit will just find another host.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.660
 Their war will never end.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.660
 And that's just the way they like it.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:43.660
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.660

 I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one, guys.
