00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320
 In 1989 Russia, a group of children's soccer players in a park, encounter three aliens and their robot companion.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.880
 Sounds like a childlike story.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.240
 It was mocked around the world when it was reported by Russia's biggest news agency.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.000
 Is there any truth to the story of this alien encounter?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.200
 And if there is, how would we ever defend against such a threat?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.200
 Do you know what I'm saying?

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
 Actually, I'm a rock figure.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.200
 [Music]

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 I got one story for you today. I actually recorded two.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
 The episode turned out to be super long.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 I really like this second story better.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 I've been thinking about it for like a week and a half.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
 Now, so I edited out the first part.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
 Maybe I'll do it some other time.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 It was okay.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.200
 I got this story for you now. Since I'm doing all this editing,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 I want to rethink my Patreons because I think them in the original version.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
 We have, these are our new Patreons.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 We have Steroids and Crack Cocaine.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 Thank you, Steroids and Crack Cocaine for supporting the show.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 Lubos Halsbauer.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 Really hope I'm pronouncing that right.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 Lubos Halsbauer, thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 Cantillians, big supporter of the show.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 We talk a lot on Twitter, or I follow him a lot on Twitter.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 I read his tweets. I don't really tweet that much, but I do read his treats.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 His treats? What? His tweets?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 He reads, I'm so exhausted, man.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.200
 I had to wake up super early, walk to the dentist.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 Four hours in the dentist chair they had, but a cap on my tooth has just been an ordeal.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 Anyways, thank you, thank you Cantillians for supporting the show.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 Means a lot.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 And hope you started, he had a podcast before.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 It got, I'll let him tell the story because it's actually a really interesting story.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.200
 But, and then, but thank you Cantillians. Yeah, it's a really interesting story.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 And then, dude no, also is supporting the show. Thank you, dude no.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 He doesn't have an exclamation point on no, but I'm just adding that.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 Thank you, dude no. So steroids and crack cocaine, Lubos, Halsbauer, Cantillians, and dude no.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 So let's go ahead and head to Russia.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 Let's talk on board the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.200
 Let's get into the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.200
 We are going to Russia. We're going to Mother Russia.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.200
 We're going to Mother Russia. And specifically we're going to the year 1989, September 27th, 1989.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 Almost 30 years to the day. Today is, today is almost 30 years to the date that this story takes place.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 So now through the magic of editing, we now join the 25 minute plus story that I have already recorded.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.200
 Enjoy.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.200
 I hope you guys enjoyed that story. It's not just filler. I was thinking about that story a lot because

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.200
 I just got done doing that play with that talking dog.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 I was in a play about a talking dog and I'd be sitting up there in the booth and I'd be like, I hate dogs.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 I love them. I'll pet them, but...

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.200
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our first official story.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 Now this story I've actually been thinking about for a long time.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 Well, I should say about a week and a half because I found out about it a week and a half ago.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.200
 We are going to Voronze, Russia.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200
 Voronze, Russia.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.200
 A small town. It's about 700,000 people. 300 miles southeast of Moscow.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 So 1989, September 27th.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.200
 There's a little park in Voronze and it's called, I'm gonna butcher this,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 Levo Brezny's Park. Levo Brezny's Park, right?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 And it is a nice fall day. Kids are out playing.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200
 People are waiting for the bus. People are walking through the park.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.200
 Young lovers, soccer balls, all sorts of park stuff.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.200
 Squirrels hanging out. It's a perfect little park is what I'm getting at.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.200
 Perfect little park. Little statue of a guy squirting out water.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.200
 You'd want to hang out there.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.200
 Now, you know what? And actually before I get into the story, let me do this because I usually do this differently.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 I'm going to go over the debunking stuff first. Normally I do that at the end.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.200
 I want to do a little bit different this episode.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.200
 So this story was reported by Taz. And what Taz is, it's a Russian news agency.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.200
 It's actually one of the biggest news agencies in the world.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 And this is during Glasnost. This is when the Soviet Union was becoming more open to the west

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200
 and we're sharing more information and resources and stuff like that.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.200
 This comes about as the Soviet Union is beginning to collapse.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200
 But they said, you know, let's just be more open to the west.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.200
 So the Taz news agency wrote up the story that I'm about to tell you.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 And they're like, this is a true story.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.200
 And the Russians are like, this story is amazing.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.200
 And the Western newspapers, because this was covered in the New York Times and the Washington Post.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.200
 But they were both like, look how stupid this story is.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.200
 The articles are online. They're going to be in the links for the Washington Post and the New York Times.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.200
 And they're both very like, get a load of these rubes over here.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.200
 So there was a lot of pushback from this story right from the beginning.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:10.200
 And one of the biggest clues that the story may be fake is that Taz quoted a specific scientist in their article.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.200
 And the scientist came forward and said, I never spoke to this newspaper before.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.200
 I have no idea what they're talking about.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.200
 And even though Taz is a legitimate news service company,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.200
 they're up there with Associated Press and Reuters, at the time they had some weird stories.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.200
 One of the stories was about a man who could take a bubble bath.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.200
 So funny. A man could take a bubble bath, create a giant bubble, crawl into it, and hang out in there for 10 seconds, and then it would pop.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.200
 And so the Western media was like, these guys have lost their rockers.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.200
 Like this in their Soviet Union. So they don't have rockers in the first place. They haven't been invented over there.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.200
 They said, this stuff is obviously fake.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.200
 To be fair though, they would call up people, reporters were calling up Taz and said, is this some sort of joke? Is this a tabloid thing?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.200
 And Taz was like, no, this is 100% true. They stand by this story today. They say, no, it's totally true.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.200
 But you quoted this guy who said he wasn't in it. No, no, no, he gave us the quote. He gave us the quote and the story is true.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.200
 We have names of, that's always a big thing. A lot of times articles will just say an unnamed source.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 There are not only names of people who are witness of this story, but they went on camera and said, my name is so and so, and they were being interviewed on camera, and they were like, yes, this story 100% happened.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:38.200
 So it's a really interesting thing to debunk because you have one culture saying the story is totally made up and you have the other culture saying, no, it's totally true.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:45.200
 And even within that you have all these little things. So it's one of those stories like, is it true or not? We don't know.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:57.200
 It does come from a source that is generally reputable, but it's a kind of a suspicious time because they have the bubble story and they would run stories about Bigfoot every once in a while, but Russia was really in, they still kind of are,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:04.200
 but especially towards the end of the Soviet Union, UFOology became really big in the Soviet Union.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.200
 So that's the debunking stuff out of it, but let's go ahead and move on to this story here.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 So what happens in Russia on September 27th, 1989? People are hanging out of the park, right? And then all of a sudden, people look up and there is a massive UFO over the park, really appearing out of nowhere.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:44.200
 It was 45 feet long and 18 feet high and it was like an Ovoid shape, kind of like an eggish type shape, a big old pill just "wong, wong, wong, wong, wong" appears over the park and everyone just kind of freezes.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.200
 They look up.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:08:00.200
 They can see the grass in the park slowly being blown around by the propulsion of this thing and then "wip" disappears.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:13.200
 What was that? Everyone's kind of looking up, looking at each other. They're like, "Uh, everyone's checking to see how much vodka they drank that day, little seven-year-olds like I've only had a fifth today and still that's kind of weird looking."

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:22.200
 A few minutes later, "wip" ship reappears in the park and it's right over where some kids are playing soccer.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:30.200
 Totally ruined that game. I mean, I'm sure one kid was able to score a goal while everyone else was looking up, but there it is again.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.200
 "Woo-m, woo-m, woo-m." I actually don't know if it's making the noise. It was just there. I like that noise.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:47.200
 You have a bunch of kids looking up at this thing and the kids weren't the only witnesses. You had adults all over the park, you had a bunch. There was at least 60 to 70 witnesses of this thing.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:55.200
 It was a little after 6pm when this was happening. They're looking up at this UFO and a door opens up underneath it.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 [Shhhh] Kind of see up into the craft. But it's not so much that they can see into the craft, it's they see something looking out of the craft.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:18.200
 It was an alien. They described it as having no neck and it had like a domed head. So imagine like a suit of-- it almost seemed like a classic alien from a 1950s movie.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:27.200
 So it had no neck and it had what was described as a knobby head. So it kind of had a helmet that came down, covered up its neck, it went to its shoulders.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:36.200
 It had these really long arms. They said it was around 9 feet tall. So it had like-- imagine the juggernaut, like a juggernaut type helmet from the comic book.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:42.200
 Not the actual like ship or whatever the juggernaut refers to, a catapult or a ram or something like that.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:49.200
 Anyways, they're looking at this thing and it's staring out of the ship and they see two white eyes like in this helmet.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:56.200
 And then there's a red eye like where the third eye would be in those drawings underneath a rabbit logo. You know what a third eye is?

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:06.200
 It was this red light that went [imitates red eye] and it rotated like a radar all the way around the helmet.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:13.200
 And it's just looking out of the craft. Just kind of scan in the area. And then the doors [imitates door opening]

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:19.200
 Shots. And then four little landing pads [imitates landing pad]

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:27.200
 Come out of the bottom of it. The ship begins to descend on the soccer field.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:37.200
 Everyone's-- there's a point where you think, "I should run?" or "This is a once in a lifetime thing" or "You're just too frozen to do anything."

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:44.200
 A little door comes out of the craft and the alien who was previously looking begins walking down this ramp.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:51.200
 They described it as walking with a heavy gate. You know, it's 9 feet tall. This isn't like a ballerina.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.200
 It's going to [imitates gunshot] It's not Pacific Rim either, but he's walking down this platform.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:06.200
 And then two more aliens of similar size, and they look exactly the same, begin walking out as well.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.200
 Now the aliens had this little disc-shaped thing on their chest. So it was like someone glued a plate to their chest.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.200
 They were walking down this gangplank, right?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.200
 And then there's a box with legs, like a little robot from-- like a gondroid from Star Wars.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:29.200
 This little box with legs begins walking down the ramp too.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:35.200
 And they're all standing at the bottom and they're standing on Earth. And there's just silence in the park.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.200
 All these humans are watching this thing. And one of the aliens turns and starts turning knobs.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:47.200
 The box robot had knobs on it, begin turning knobs, and then all of a sudden it just kind of started walking around more.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:54.200
 It starts to breakdancing. Anyways, anyways. So anyways, no, it wasn't breakdancing. It was just kind of doing its robot thing.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:01.200
 The aliens begin taking soil samples. So they went scooping up little park dirt into these little vials, holding them up to the sun,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.200
 shaking them. I don't know if they're doing that, but they were taking soil samples, right?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.200
 And then, after a couple moments of that, the lead alien, the one they first saw, the one who got off the ship first,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.200
 begins scanning the area. Now, what's weird is that they did not acknowledge the existence of the humans at all,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.200
 which to me is more terrifying. Like, remember Jurassic Park? Like, yes, being chased by a T-Rex is scary.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.200
 Actually, a better example. Remember the movie The Mist at the very end? Like, they're getting attacked by spiders and bugs the whole time,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.200
 but at the very end, they're driving by this creature. They're driving underneath it, and it's so big you can't even see the top of it.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.200
 And it's completely oblivious to the humans around it. To me, that's scary. To me, that's scarier.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.200
 To be around something that's so magnificent, it doesn't even register that you exist.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.200
 These aliens are--it's the same way that we look at squirrels and ants. Like, every so often we'll see a squirrel and go, "Oh, that's cute."

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.200
 But they're all around us. We don't acknowledge them all the time. These aliens are walking around.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:01.200
 And the lead alien, the one that's supposed to lead an alien, is making these weird, like, chirping noise.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 These weird language. They say it's indecipherable. It didn't sound like any known language. It's making these weird noises, and it seemed like the other aliens were responding to it.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:17.200
 And then, out of its dish-shaped chest plate, it begins projecting geometric images.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:25.200
 Like, it would turn and you look at a tree and then it would--and you would see, like, a rectangle and a square and a triangle just appear on the tree.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:35.200
 And it seemed to the people there that he was trying to direct his fellow scientists, foot soldiers, whatever they were, his goons, to pay attention to that particular thing.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.200
 Now, for whatever reason, this is the point where somebody freaks out.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:47.200
 There is a young boy, by the time the alien was shooting the geometric images around, he's like, "Oh, no, circles! My most hated enemy!"

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:56.200
 This little kid begins screaming out loud. And for the first time, the aliens acknowledge there are humans around.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:03.200
 And the lead alien turns and looks right at the screaming boy, and the screaming stops.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.200
 The boy is completely frozen.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:12.200
 And everyone in the park sees what happened. Everyone in the park freaks out.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:20.200
 And then, the aliens are gone. The ship is gone. It's over.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:27.200
 Now, the aliens don't get on the ship and fly away. It's just blink. Everything's back to normal.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.200
 And the frozen kid--oh, man, that was weird.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:39.200
 Oh, wait, I mean, aah, start screaming again. Now, the second they disappeared, the frozen kid was unfrozen.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.200
 And people just stood there and thought, "What in the world happened?"

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.200
 Now, by 1989, even in the Soviet Union, you had a working knowledge of what a UFO is and stuff like that.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.200
 So the general idea of, you know, aliens get off a ship, they fly a ship around, you get off the ship,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.200
 then when you want to leave, you get back on the ship and fly away.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.200
 But that's not what happened here. They just blinked out of existence.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.200
 The robot, little boxy robot, who's in the middle of doing the worm, just--

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:14.200
 The park is totally back to normal. This is known as the Veronza incident, however, announced it earlier.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.200
 And it's a really interesting story for two reasons.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:27.200
 One, it really was a culture clash between western news, really western UFOology and western mainstream news.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.200
 Versus Soviet Union UFOology and Soviet Union mainstream news.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.200
 And you really have like these two things clashing at this time.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.200
 This story is also really interesting for another reason.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:45.200
 And this reason doesn't involve two different cultures. This reason involves you.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:56.200
 You see, you, dear listener, made the exact same mistake that those Russians did in the park.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.200
 Almost 30 years ago to the day.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.200
 You made the exact same mistake they did.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:10.200
 Because you thought the story was over. Just like they did.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:17.200
 The aliens reappeared five minutes later in the exact same positions they were in.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.200
 So the three aliens who were walking around the park disappeared.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.200
 Everyone's milling about. Can't figure out what happened.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.200
 And five minutes later, the UFO is back. It's landed.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.200
 The aliens are still standing on the ground exactly where they were before they disappeared.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:40.200
 There's only one difference. One of the aliens is holding a foot-long tube.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 He turns, points it at a 16-year-old boy. The boy disappears.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.200
 Pandemonium. People begin running out of the park.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.200
 And the aliens just turn and slowly...

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.200
 Start walking back to the ship. A little robot box. Picking up its cardboard box.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.200
 Put it away. Walking up into the ship.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:14.200
 They all board the UFO. Landing pads. Go back into the UFO.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:24.200
 It starts flying away. The boy reappears.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.200
 The idea of running into an alien would be scary.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.200
 I know I talk a lot of times about being up grey aliens and they're lame.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.200
 I meet up grey aliens all day long.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:42.200
 But the idea of encountering this type of alien activity, one that doesn't even recognize that you are worth acknowledging.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.200
 It's over. And then hanging out there trying to figure out what went wrong.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:58.200
 And then finding out that those aliens were still there watching you, steadying you as you just stand there confused.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.200
 And then they come back.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:10.200
 But the creepiest thing about that story to me is if you had a buddy that you watched dematerialize

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.200
 and then just appear again, would you ever trust him?

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.200
 Like, I mean, that might sound cold. He's like, "Hey, can I borrow 20 bucks?"

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.200
 You're like, "I don't know." You used to pay me back, but that was before you dematerialized.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:32.200
 But did he just vanish? Or was he replaced?

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.200
 The story is pretty much buried at this point.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:45.200
 I stumbled across it because I'm reading this amazing website that I've been referring to a lot recently called Cryptopia.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.200
 Rob Morphe, he's written for a mysterious universe. He did that right up.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.200
 He's done a lot of stories we've covered recently. If you look through the show notes, I reference him a lot.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.200
 But have you ever heard that story before? I haven't. I heard it about a week and a half ago.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:02.200
 I read it on his website and I mean, I was just like, is that the real kid?

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.200
 Or is it a replacement?

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:13.200
 Is that real Russian kid still living his life in Russia 30 years older, complaining about his back and his job?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.200
 Or is it some sort of alien sleeper agent?

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.200
 Was that the same kid?

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:28.200
 You get shot with an alien-- the whole thing-- okay, so not only does he get shot with an alien beam, disappears, the aliens leave and he comes back.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:36.200
 That's weird in and of itself. But what if the aliens, the reason why they became invisible to begin with, was because they were looking for--

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:43.200
 they were just steady in this crowd of people looking for who they thought would be the perfect experiment.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:51.200
 And once they found that kid out of the 70 people who had gathered, they got their equipment ready and got to work.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:59.200
 Yesterday when we were talking about the ass-wing, I made a joke as part of the legend is, the ass-wings would kill you in the middle of nowhere,

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:07.200
 and then take a banana tree stump and carve an image of you and then send it back into the city to say, "Oh, I'm so sick."

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.200
 And then die, and people don't know that you really died in the forest.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.200
 It was a way to deflect suspicion.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:23.200
 They were just-- if you had a bunch of people die in town, they were just sick, it's not that they really just banana tree stumps, and I laughed about that.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:32.200
 This story's kind of the same, because how-- I'm not saying the guy's a banana tree stump, but how do you know that that guy is the real guy?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:40.200
 Would you ever trust him again? Or would you ever think in the back of your head, "What happened to you when you disappeared?"

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:47.200
 Oh man, it was really weird, like I got shot with that beam and then I just came back, like for me it was just a second, but--

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.200
 and you'd be like, "Here, eat this banana."

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.200
 He's like, "No, I'm no cannibal!" and runs away.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.200
 No, but it's like the same idea.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:05.200
 That story ends with the kid reappearing, and at first glance when I read it I thought, "Oh, so everything had a happy ending."

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:12.200
 But how do we really know if this story's true? How do we really know that 30 years almost to the date?

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:20.200
 How do we know that that Russian kid, this kid isn't some specimen in a laboratory somewhere?

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.200
 Maybe he's still alive, and they're steady in him.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.200
 Maybe he's already-- he's already been dissected.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:44.200
 And now there's just little samples of him sitting somewhere in some alien laboratory next to little jars of soil taken from a perfect little park in Russia.
