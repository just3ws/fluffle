1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 It's the gentle ocean breeze that sweeps you off your feet.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,140
 The 99 holes of championship golf that offer endless possibilities.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,580
 The small town southern charm that embraces you everywhere you go.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,900
 From the beaches in the east to the marshes in the west,

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,900
 there's a special feeling you get on Amelia Island.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,480
 It's a real thing.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,140
 It's an island thing.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,900
 Make it your thing.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,180

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,780
 When human remains are found in a California desert,

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,980
 authorities have to ask themselves,

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,980
 "Is this an accident? Is this murder?"

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,480
 or something far more vicious.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,580
 And then we travel back in time to the year 2008,

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,980
 when hundreds of people looked to the sky and waited for the digi clips.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,780
 Was there really a plan to open the portal between our world

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,980
 and an old Japanese cartoon today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:08,780
 [music]

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,780
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,880
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,180
 I'm having a great day.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,580
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,480
 The pig wrestling went fine.

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,680
 Lil' Piggy got her hooves clipped.

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,880
 I got a little injured.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,880
 Pulled some muscles in my shoulders, but everything else is fine.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,880
 If you're a new listener to this podcast, that may no sense,

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,280
 but to you returning listeners, I am healthy.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,880
 Also, I got the test results back for my heart.

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,880
 Totally healthy, totally fine.

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,680
 Two weeks of observation with a little heart monitor.

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,280
 Everything was absolutely fine.

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,980
 I just used too much nicotine, too much caffeine,

34
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,180
 and threw my heart for a loop.

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,780
 So great news all around.

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,980
 Piggy got her hooves clipped and my heart's fine.

37
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,080
 I mean, what more could you ask for a way to start a podcast?

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,480
 There's one more thing.

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,280
 Another great thing about this is introducing our newest Patreon supporter,

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,580
 writing in on a floating heart, because it's Valentine's Day, actually.

41
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,080
 He's dressed up in a little Cupid's outfit.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,480
 It's Mike Knoop.

43
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,380
 Everyone give a round of applause to Mike Knoop.

44
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,780
 He's wearing a diaper.

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,280
 He has the little arrow thing,

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,880
 and he's floating around on a human heart,

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,780
 an anatomically correct human heart.

48
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,580
 Mike, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,280
 If you can't support the Patreon and you're not a Greek God of Love,

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,180
 that's okay.

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,780
 Just help spread the word about the show.

52
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,380
 Really, really helps out a lot.

53
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,680
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,080
 So Mike, you can keep on your Cupid outfit.

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,280
 You look adorable,

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,080
 but I am going to tashi the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,280
 Get off that heart.

58
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,080
 We are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,580
 We are headed out to San Bernardino County.

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,580
 Jason Jalopy,

61
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,580
 driving down the freeway.

62
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,680
 Now, this story, man,

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,980
 I zeroed in on this story.

64
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,480
 I swear the second it was published,

65
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,880
 my spidey senses popped off.

66
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,480
 The ones and zeros weren't even fully formed in the matrix

67
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
 before I was reading this article.

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,980
 However, I also got a request to do this one as well.

69
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,180
 Long time fan of the show, Stuart Meatball,

70
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,180
 YouTube champion, Stuart Meatball,

71
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,080
 hit me up and goes, "Hey, man, if you read this article,"

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,180
 and the answer was, "I had it."

73
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,480
 It's San Bernardino County, California.

74
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,580
 January 31st, 2021.

75
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,380
 We're standing out in the desert,

76
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,180
 wind sweeping the ground.

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,680
 We see a sheriff's department truck there,

78
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,480
 and a bunch of cops are walking around.

79
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,380
 They're all dusty and stuff like that.

80
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,980
 They don't take baths.

81
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,780
 You didn't know that?

82
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,780
 Cops down there, they never take baths.

83
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,580
 [breathing]

84
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,980
 So they see like bones and a skull,

85
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,580
 and there's like an evil vulture.

86
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,080
 I don't know.

87
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,180
 Maybe it's just a good vulture,

88
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,680
 but it just happens to eat humans.

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,980
 It's sitting there as well.

90
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,880
 They're taking pictures.

91
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,580
 Ka-klick-jj.

92
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,780
 Ka-klick-jj.

93
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,980
 Because they have an old camera.

94
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,680
 Apparently they have the camera from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre opening credits.

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,380
 They're specifically in Wonder Valley,

96
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,880
 which is next to Joshua Tree National Park here in San Bernardino County, California.

97
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,980
 Now, at this point, the remains have not been identified.

98
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,180
 These human remains have just been found.

99
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,880
 Let's go back in time to June 2020, though.

100
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,480
 There's people who think they know who this body may belong to.

101
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,680
 June 2020, there was a woman named Erica Lloyd.

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,480
 She was doing a solo trip.

103
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,380
 She wanted to drive to Joshua Tree National Park,

104
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,280
 but they lost track of her.

105
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,180
 She never came home.

106
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,280
 She's been missing since June 2020.

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,480
 The authorities did find her car abandoned,

108
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,780
 and it was vandalized.

109
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,980
 Now, the fact that she's missing, the fact that it's vandalized,

110
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,280
 could be totally two separate events.

111
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,180
 People could have just seen the car out there and decided, you know,

112
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,480
 this is a good target.

113
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,780
 However, this is why you shouldn't just be a once-in-vandal,

114
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,980
 because I'm sure that those vandals are actually being looked for by the police.

115
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,480
 They're all,

116
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,580
 "Mikey was here!"

117
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,580
 And they're like,

118
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,680
 "Find all Mikeys!

119
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,980
 Find all the Mikeys in San Bernardino, California.

120
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,880
 Don't vandalize stuff because you might become a murder suspect."

121
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,580
 That's tip one from a veteran vandal.

122
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,580
 Around the same time, in the same area,

123
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,980
 there was a dude he'd bought a motel, an old rundown motel,

124
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,080
 and he wanted to rebuild it.

125
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,480
 It would be a project for him,

126
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,280
 maybe turn it into a tourist attraction.

127
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,980
 He was kind of a wealthy guy,

128
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,680
 but, you know, it gets you to use your hands.

129
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,980
 He gets to, like, actually create things and craft things.

130
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,580
 Plus, it's a business investment.

131
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,280
 It's old--

132
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,080
 I don't know if he's old.

133
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,380
 This man buys this hotel,

134
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,180
 and he's repairing it, and he asked his buddy,

135
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,880
 "Hey, you want to come out? You're not working right now.

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,280
 The pandemic's going on. Everything's shut down.

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,980
 Why don't you come out and help me rebuild this motel in the middle of nowhere?"

138
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,080
 It's in Wonder Valley, right near Joshua Tree National Park.

139
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,980
 So, a man gets in his car and drives from his home in Hollywood in June 2020

140
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,980
 to go work with his friend at this hotel.

141
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,380
 He pulls up outside the hotel.

142
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,680
 It's just him and his buddy there in the middle of nowhere.

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,480
 Somewhere nearby, Eric Aloyde is also driving to an unknown destination.

144
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,580
 But this man who gets out of his car, this man who was invited by his friend

145
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,880
 to be in the middle of nowhere to build this hotel...

146
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,180
 [Sigh]

147
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,580
 His name is Armie Hammer.

148
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,880
 Now, if you're new--

149
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,480
 If you're new listener to the show,

150
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,880
 welcome.

151
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,980
 We've been talking about Armie Hammer a lot in the past couple weeks.

152
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,580
 This is a true story.

153
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,180
 Armie Hammer's been in the news.

154
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,780
 I've talked about him a couple times on the show.

155
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,780
 I've made several jokes about him.

156
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,880
 He's to wrap it up real quick.

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,480
 To wrap it up like a piece of meat.

158
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,080
 Armie Hammer allegedly--

159
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,580
 He denies it, but was sending messages saying how much he wanted to eat women,

160
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,280
 how he wanted to break their ribs and eat them,

161
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,780
 how he wanted to cut off their toes and keep them in their pocket.

162
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,980
 And he declared himself in one of these texts,

163
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,480
 "I am 100% accountable."

164
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,980
 There's no wiggle room there.

165
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,680
 Unless you're talking about the fingers wiggling off of a newly severed hand.

166
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,480
 That guy, that was just dark.

167
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,580
 That was disturbing, but anyways,

168
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
 that's what Armie Hammer calls Top Ramen.

169
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,980
 The point is, is that he's talking all this stuff about wanting to eat people.

170
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
 He denies it.

171
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,380
 There's all these allegations of people saying he's having all these women

172
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,480
 who come forward and saying,

173
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,880
 "We all got messages saying he wanted to eat me."

174
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,880
 Now, what happened was last summer, he was texting from this hotel.

175
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,380
 "Hey guys, isn't this so awesome?

176
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,180
 I'm out here in the middle of nowhere.

177
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,080
 You can run, you can hide, but you can scream all you want.

178
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,280
 But I'll still build this hotel."

179
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
 And people are like, "What?

180
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,480
 That's weird why he had that medicine part."

181
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,280
 He was texting, he was posting on Instagram

182
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,880
 that he was out in Joshua Tree, out in Wonder Valley,

183
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,680
 rebuilding this hotel with his buddy.

184
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,280
 And people are like, "Oh, you know, he doesn't have anything else to do.

185
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
 The pandemic's going on, all the movies are closed down.

186
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,080
 Who doesn't like spending time in the outdoors building stuff?"

187
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,080
 Now, this woman, these human remains have been found.

188
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,880
 The question is, is it Erica Lloyd?

189
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,180
 Is it somebody else?

190
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,880
 There are some news reports saying there are three sets of human remains found.

191
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
 Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

192
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,680
 That wouldn't make sense.

193
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,980
 But I've only seen that reported in the gossip sites.

194
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,680
 The actual news sites say one set of human remains have been found.

195
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,280
 In an area where Army Hammer was working,

196
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,280
 i.e. in the area in the middle of nowhere.

197
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,280
 It would be like if there were human remains found in downtown Los Angeles,

198
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,780
 that's Wednesday.

199
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,780
 The garbage men are just like, "Oh, they put on their corner cap?"

200
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,780
 And they're already like dissecting it.

201
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,180
 And Army Hammer's just walking on the street.

202
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,880
 You wouldn't even think about it.

203
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,080
 But the fact that Army Hammer is in the desert, Army Hammer is in the desert.

204
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
 And now we're finding human remains in the desert.

205
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
 And it may have been this woman.

206
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,480
 Absolutely insane.

207
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,080
 I woke up, I saw this story.

208
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,680
 I was like, "This is...

209
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,880
 I have to talk about this."

210
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,180
 But what happened was, I had actually, this story is a couple days old.

211
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,880
 I had already recorded those episodes because I had to go wrestle that pig.

212
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,480
 So I had to wait.

213
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,980
 I had to wait to tell the story.

214
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,880
 And then Stuart's like, "Hey, did you read this?"

215
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,680
 And I was like, "Dude, yes."

216
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,180
 I also, and this is funny because I've been discussing the story with people in my private life as well.

217
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,680
 I think the Army Hammer saga, I had never thought it would get to the point

218
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,080
 where he's a suspect in a murder.

219
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,880
 To be fair, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office

220
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,880
 have said he is not a suspect in the murder.

221
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,980
 Which is exactly what you would say to a man who has millions of dollars

222
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,080
 and can fly to Thailand.

223
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,980
 He would just fly away.

224
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,280
 So of course, the sheriff's like, "Shh."

225
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,880
 She's like holding his finger to his lips.

226
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,580
 "No, he's not a suspect."

227
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,380
 And then they're like, "Getting cuffs ready."

228
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,080
 They're getting Army Hammer-sized cuffs ready.

229
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,280
 So they're officially saying he's not a suspect.

230
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,880
 But that's a little premature.

231
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,680
 There's human remains found in the location of a man once again

232
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,080
 who declared himself 100% accountable.

233
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,180
 He denies it.

234
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,180
 So he denies it, but his Instagram said it, right?

235
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,580
 His Instagram said it.

236
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,880
 And a bunch of his exes have come forward and said,

237
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,080
 "Yeah, he was kind of about eating people and stuff like that."

238
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,880
 Two more things.

239
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,380
 One, he did a movie called "Call Me By Your Name."

240
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,980
 No, no, no, no, no.

241
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,180
 He's like, "Hey, my name's Timmy.

242
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,480
 Hey, Timmy, come back here."

243
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,280
 That'd be confusing.

244
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,180
 "Call Me By Your Name."

245
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,080
 Wait, no, what?

246
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,780
 "Call Me By My Name."

247
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,080
 It was a romance, I guess.

248
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,180
 I never saw it, but it was him and Timothy Chalmet.

249
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,680
 It's some dude, some other actor,

250
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
 and then there was the director.

251
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,280
 Obviously, that's how movies are made, right?

252
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,080
 It's a home video.

253
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,680
 His mom's filming it.

254
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,380
 The director and the actor, Timothy Chalmay, whatever,

255
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,080
 they're going on to do another movie right now.

256
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,180
 So, out of the three of them,

257
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,280
 two of them have gone to do this new movie called "Bones and All."

258
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,480
 And the movie is literally about this.

259
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,780
 It's about a young girl, or like a college-age girl, I'm assuming.

260
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,880
 Every time she falls in love, she eats them.

261
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,080
 So it's a cannibal movie.

262
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,980
 So all three of them, all three of them,

263
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,780
 maybe and on this for all I know.

264
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,980
 But they're doing a cannibal movie.

265
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,380
 No, I don't like to conflate the art.

266
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,980
 I think that's just a funny aside.

267
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,580
 They're making a cannibal movie.

268
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,080
 I'm not going to conflate the art with the weirdness of him being murder suspect,

269
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,180
 because people make, I don't think Tom Cruise is a taxi cab hijacking serial killer.

270
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,180
 Like, the art's the art.

271
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,080
 That's the way I view it.

272
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,080
 But I just think that's a funny coincidence.

273
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,180
 And I'm sure Armie Hammer wished he was cast in that.

274
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,880
 He's like, "Oh, dude, can I at least be on the set?"

275
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,280
 I got a Twitter email from DreamPillot.

276
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,880
 And then let's segue into this.

277
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,280
 In my segment, because I've been trying to figure this out.

278
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,980
 Monday Musings, this is our new segment.

279
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,880
 Mike Knoop, let's go ahead and hop out of the Jason Jalopy.

280
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,280
 We're going to hop in the Dead or Abit Durgeable.

281
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,380
 We're going to fly to a banquet hall.

282
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,380
 We're still doing the Armie Hammer story, though.

283
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,080
 So a few guys were hoping this was over.

284
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,780
 Nope.

285
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,580
 Mike Knoop, fly us out.

286
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,280
 He probably hears that joke all the time.

287
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,080
 Mike Knoop, fly us in this Dead or Abit Durgeable out to this large dining hall.

288
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,380
 Oh, you know what?

289
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,380
 Just have the dining hall in the Durgeable.

290
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,880
 Make it easier.

291
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,280
 Mike Knoop wanted to fly.

292
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,480
 Okay, fly us to that hometown buffet.

293
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
 We're going there.

294
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,880
 DreamPillot sent me an article.

295
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,680
 It was in Cosmopolitan Magazine.

296
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,180
 I think the kids call it Cosmo.

297
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,880
 But Cosmopolitan Magazine had an article about the kink of cannibalism.

298
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,080
 And it was saying, you know, this is a subset of BDSM.

299
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,980
 Here's my Monday.

300
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,680
 I can't figure this out.

301
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,980
 I can't figure this out.

302
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,180
 How do you pretend to eat somebody?

303
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,380
 I get like role-playing and stuff like that.

304
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,680
 She's a cop.

305
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,280
 You're the bank robber.

306
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,880
 Or she's Dr. Octopus and your Spider-Man, whatever.

307
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,080
 Like stuff to spice up the bedroom.

308
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,280
 And like you could, I mean, both of those involve you actively fighting somebody?

309
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,980
 You'll never stop being Doc Ock or Spray Shaving Cream in her face.

310
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,280
 But like, you can do that.

311
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,280
 Like you can spray Shaving Cream in your loved one's face.

312
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,980
 You can pretend like you can role-play and do stuff like that.

313
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,780
 How do you pretend to get eaten?

314
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,480
 That's what I can't figure out.

315
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,180
 Like the cannibal guy would be like,

316
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,680
 "What's up? Just imagine how people play with babies."

317
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,180
 And they go, "Num, num, num.

318
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,880
 I'm gonna eat your tummy."

319
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,180
 And then you like gum the kids' tongue.

320
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,780
 "I can't go, go, go, go."

321
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,780
 But you're not actually eating.

322
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,080
 Is that what cannibal fetish is?

323
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,980
 Like I read this big article in Thanks Dream Pillet for sending it over, but I still don't get it.

324
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,180
 Like, "Mmm, mm, mm, I'm gonna eat you up."

325
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,080
 No, no.

326
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,380
 And then like you take bites of, because you don't actually eat them.

327
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,880
 Like they're like, the article is like,

328
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,780
 "You can nibble on their neck and you can like draw sometimes, draw some blood."

329
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,580
 I'm like, "That's not eating.

330
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,080
 I don't ever go to a steak restaurant."

331
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,380
 And I'm like, "I'm like, "Let's a suck on that sirloin, please."

332
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,380
 It's like you eat it.

333
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,080
 So how do you pretend to eat somebody?

334
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,180
 And I can kind of figure that out.

335
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,080
 I can kind of figure out you being like,

336
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,480
 "Oh, I'm gonna eat you. I'm a cannibal."

337
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,380
 I'm 100% a cannibal.

338
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,980
 But the fetish goes both ways.

339
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,780
 There are people who want to be cannibals.

340
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,780
 And then there are people who want to be eaten.

341
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,080
 I don't get that.

342
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,480
 Like I don't get that.

343
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,480
 I get the mental gymnastics part of it.

344
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,580
 But I don't get how you would pretend to do that.

345
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,680
 Like you're laying in bed.

346
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,180
 You're like, "Jason, please go on to the next segment."

347
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,680
 You're laying in bed and then someone's like,

348
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,480
 "Nom, nom, nom. I'm gonna eat you."

349
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,880
 And do you imagine them actually like eat?

350
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,980
 Is it the psychological fear of being eaten?

351
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,580
 Or is it like, when someone's like,

352
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,480
 "Nom, nom, nom."

353
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,280
 Like gumming on your neck, do you imagine it's like walking dead

354
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,880
 and they're actually like ripping pieces?

355
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,180
 Because they're not.

356
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,680
 They're like, "I'm gonna take your nose.

357
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,780
 I want to take your nose."

358
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,780
 You're like, "No, my nose."

359
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,580
 They got their little thumb in between their fingers.

360
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,980
 You're like, "No, no. Let it stop. Let it stop."

361
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,080
 Like how do you do that?

362
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,580
 Do you like hide your arms in shirts and stuff like that?

363
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,980
 So you just have like your elbows are sticking out.

364
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,580
 And you're like, "Oh, no. He ate my arms. I don't get it."

365
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,580
 I don't get it. It's just a fetish.

366
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,280
 Or I don't understand it.

367
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,780
 And it's one of those things.

368
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,480
 Like again, if you were pretending that she's the cop

369
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,580
 and you're the burglar, you're breaking into the house

370
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,280
 and she's like, "Stop. Be sexy or I'm gonna shoot."

371
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,480
 And you turn around and you start being sexy.

372
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,180
 Fine. Whatever. Whatever.

373
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,680
 But the eating thing, like I can't figure out

374
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,480
 how you would pretend to be eaten.

375
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,080
 I don't get it.

376
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,680
 Because obviously, like I can see my arms.

377
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,280
 Like it just doesn't make any sense to me.

378
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,480
 It's like this.

379
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,580
 If I had a fetish of sleeping with a waitress,

380
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,280
 if that's, yeah, I do. I do.

381
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,580
 I love sleeping with waitresses.

382
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,680
 But hypothetically say that I don't have that fetish

383
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,380
 and I now do for the sake of this argument.

384
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,980
 Let's say I hypothetically like sleeping with waitresses.

385
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,480
 I can easily fulfill that.

386
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,580
 I can have my girlfriend dress up like a waitress.

387
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,880
 Super easy.

388
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,980
 Or I can just sleep with waitresses.

389
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,480
 So either way, I'm golden.

390
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,080
 But that doesn't work with being a fetish.

391
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,980
 That doesn't work with being a cannibal.

392
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,480
 Because I can go "Nom, nom, nom.

393
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,580
 I'm gonna eat your belly.

394
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,780
 Oh, no, I ate your thumbs."

395
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,380
 And you like have them hide their thumbs.

396
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,580
 No.

397
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,780
 But you know it's not real.

398
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,580
 You know it doesn't, isn't actually real.

399
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,580
 I think that's a fetish that you're far more likely

400
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,480
 to engage in in real life.

401
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,980
 Because there's nothing you can do to replicate it

402
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,380
 in the bedroom at all.

403
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,080
 I mean, I guess if you brought in like fake blood

404
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,080
 and had like Greg Nicotero in the background doing special

405
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,980
 effects makeup and things like that.

406
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,780
 But other than that, no matter what you did in the bedroom,

407
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,880
 it would always leave you wanting more.

408
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,180
 It would always leave you hungry for more.

409
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,280
 Most fetishes you can completely fulfill

410
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,180
 with a consenting partner.

411
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,280
 Like furries.

412
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,980
 You just yiffing around in the first suits.

413
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,880
 There you go.

414
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
 You want to have sex with Donald Duck.

415
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,180
 You just have sex with a guy dressed like Donald Duck.

416
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,680
 That's fine.

417
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,680
 You don't actually then have to go out and find a duck.

418
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,280
 You fulfilled the fantasy of having sex with an anthropomorph.

419
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,080
 That's actually makes more sense because the fantasy isn't

420
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
 to have sex with a duck.

421
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,180
 It's to have sex with, but you want to have sex

422
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,480
 with an anthropomorphic duck.

423
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,980
 So you actually can't fulfill that in real life.

424
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,480
 You have to use the furry community.

425
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,380
 So that makes sense.

426
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,880
 I get like the logic in that.

427
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,480
 I'm not worried about them running around being in ducks.

428
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,780
 I am worried about them possibly murdering one or more women

429
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,880
 in the desert.

430
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,780
 And this is actually you guys are going to be shocked

431
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,080
 that this is actually a great segue for our next story.

432
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,380
 Mike Know is like, No, I don't want you to the next story.

433
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,380
 This is a segue.

434
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,280
 Mike Know.

435
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,180
 Yeah, you do.

436
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,880
 Is this next story is all about love?

437
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,780
 Actually, the first story was about love.

438
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,980
 The love of eating people.

439
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,080
 But nope.

440
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,880
 It's Valentine's Day.

441
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,780
 Love is in the air.

442
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,080
 Let's hop in that carbon helicopter.

443
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,480
 We're leaving behind San Bernardino County and the hometown

444
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,180
 buffet.

445
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,080
 We got our pockets full of onion rings.

446
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,280
 We are leaving and we are headed out to an unnamed town in

447
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,480
 the middle of America.

448
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,980
 We're flying out there.

449
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,780
 We're eating onion rings.

450
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,180
 Having a grand old time.

451
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,180
 What we're here in this small town for is a story that was

452
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,480
 recommended to me by Kentillions, a long time listener of the

453
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,180
 show Kentillions.

454
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,880
 Thank you so much for sending this over.

455
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,980
 This is the saga.

456
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,280
 No one is project Digi Clips.

457
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,880
 Now as Mike is piloting the carbon helicopter over the small

458
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,180
 town, we see a bunch of preteens, teenagers walking out of

459
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,780
 their houses.

460
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,880
 They all have a backpack strapped to their wrist and in

461
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,780
 their freehand, they're holding a Digi device.

462
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,380
 These are basically Tomagachi type toys where you'd raise

463
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,680
 Digimon and make them fight each other.

464
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,580
 And that was pretty much it.

465
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,980
 But it was also the basis for cartoons and comic books and

466
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,980
 video games, other video actual video games rather than

467
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
 these pieces of junk.

468
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,280
 As Mike is flying the carbon helicopter over, I'm putting my

469
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,980
 hand on the shoulder.

470
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,480
 I'm like, dude, be ready, be ready.

471
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,680
 And then all of a sudden, all these people raise their Digi

472
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,980
 devices into the air.

473
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,080
 The sky cracks open.

474
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:02,280
 Reality shifts and we see the children one by one getting

475
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,180
 sucked up into personalized black holes.

476
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,380
 We have just witnessed the Digi Clips.

477
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,480
 The idea is this.

478
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,580
 This actually was really big back in 2008 for about two or

479
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,380
 three months.

480
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,480
 You had February to March 2008.

481
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,780
 The idea is this.

482
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,980
 Digimon are real.

483
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,980
 The goal, bring them to us or for the more adventure prone,

484
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,680
 we go to them.

485
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,080
 They believed if you held your Digi device to the sky at a

486
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,980
 precise moment.

487
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,480
 Now, the agreed upon time seemed to be March 16th, 2008,

488
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,780
 but apparently they were localized Digi Clipses as well.

489
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,280
 You had to confer with your local Digi Dwarfs to figure

490
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,080
 that one out.

491
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
 Hey, if you guys are Digimon fans, sorry, because I'm

492
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,580
 probably not going to be super kind to the program, but

493
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,180
 you're hanging out with the other Digi people and you have

494
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,280
 to hold up your Digi device all at the same time.

495
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,080
 You'll create these black holes.

496
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,780
 Now, they say, listen, we know these are toys.

497
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,180
 So it's not so much the fact that the Digi device has the

498
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,780
 ability to transport you to another dimension because they

499
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,780
 did they'd have to put that on the warning label.

500
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
 So they're just toys.

501
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,280
 The idea is that you're in love with your Digimon.

502
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,180
 So anything that identifies your Digimon you can use.

503
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,480
 They said you can even use your stuffed animals.

504
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,580
 So if you ever were like driving around your town back on

505
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,680
 March 16th, 2008 and you saw a man holding a stuffed dinosaur

506
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,080
 and pointing it at the sky, you didn't know it, but that man

507
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,980
 was a man who didn't have a Digi device but still wanted to

508
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,480
 go to the digital realm.

509
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,680
 What do you do once you enter the Digiverse?

510
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,180
 The Digiverse is basically, again, I didn't really get into

511
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,980
 the mythology and I read a Wikipedia article on Digimon

512
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,580
 itself and it's just generic.

513
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,280
 It was more of a sci-fi version of Pokemon.

514
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,380
 Pokemon always seemed like a very nature-based.

515
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,080
 Well, it definitely is more sci-fi because they're digital

516
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,180
 animals and that was one of the things people go, "Well, if

517
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,680
 Digimon is real, why can't Pokemon be real?"

518
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,380
 And they go, "Pfft, you idiots, you fool.

519
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,180
 What are you talking about?"

520
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,180
 Digital can include anything, anything can be programmed.

521
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,280
 So the Digiverse could actually be real.

522
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,380
 They keep using string theory and the infinite universe

523
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,880
 theorem, which is true.

524
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,180
 And on infinite timeline and infinite universes, everything's

525
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,680
 possible.

526
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,180
 There is a Digiverse.

527
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,480
 Fine, I'll give you that.

528
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
 But everything else is ridiculous.

529
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,180
 The fact that on a certain day you could hold up a stuffed

530
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,680
 dinosaur or something that reminded you of your favorite

531
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,280
 Digimon, you'd get sucked into an alternate universe.

532
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,680
 They believed a lot of it on Law of Attraction.

533
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,680
 They believed a lot of it on, "If you love something so much,

534
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,080
 it has to be true."

535
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,480
 Which is basically the motto of every stalker, right?

536
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,780
 So you have that.

537
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,580
 They say it's like a placebo.

538
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,680
 Placebos aren't real, but they help you.

539
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,880
 So if you can give someone a sugar pill and it calms their

540
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,380
 nervous stomach, you can hold up a stuffed animal and fly to

541
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,280
 an alternate universe.

542
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,480
 They make this leap of logic.

543
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
 But it's digital, see?

544
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
 So it's possible.

545
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,280
 So what do you do when you go to the Digiverse?

546
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,780
 This is the steps that were laid out.

547
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,780
 First off, you find your partner, which I'm assuming is like

548
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,980
 their waifu.

549
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,580
 I'm assuming it's like the girl, which I know a lot of

550
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,680
 people like, like animated girls, like drawings of girls.

551
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,180
 But if you went to that universe, they'd probably look super

552
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,580
 weird.

553
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,380
 Because you would not become a cartoon.

554
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,580
 You would go to a digital verse.

555
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,880
 And so you'd be 3D.

556
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,080
 Everything else would be 3D.

557
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,280
 The reason why we're seeing it as a drawing is because

558
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,880
 animators are drawing.

559
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,980
 Let's assume here for a second that their theory is right.

560
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,480
 Because I've found this fascinating.

561
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
 I think we talked about this during the Chris Chan episode

562
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,180
 as well.

563
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,180
 If you went to the world of Digimon, it would not be

564
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,580
 2D cell shaded animation.

565
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,680
 That is a human representation of that.

566
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,080
 It's the same thing as if you read the Bible and there's

567
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,280
 no photos from the Bible.

568
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,180
 You would not go back and you'd be like, oh, look at all

569
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,380
 these texts.

570
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,480
 Look at all these words.

571
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,180
 Jesus looks like a giant wood carving coming at me.

572
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,480
 Because that's all the imagery of how he looks like a

573
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,780
 Renaissance painting coming at me.

574
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,780
 No, you'd go back and you know that if you went back in

575
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,980
 time, you would see stuff as it was not as it's represented.

576
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,080
 So if you went to the Digi verse, there wouldn't be

577
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,380
 little dinosaur, little poorly designed dinosaur.

578
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,180
 I didn't like the character designs on that show.

579
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,380
 I was not a huge fan of it.

580
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,580
 Try not to completely trash it during this segment.

581
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,180
 But it wouldn't look like that.

582
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,580
 The girl, Trixie or Noxie or whatever their names were.

583
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,880
 She would look like a normal human girl and she wouldn't

584
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,780
 look like that drawing.

585
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,480
 There may be a vague comparison because the person who

586
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,880
 drew that drawing was like influenced by the psychic

587
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,480
 power of that character across the universe.

588
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,280
 Fine.

589
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,980
 But it's like Optimus Prime would look like a Michael

590
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,880
 Bay Optimus Prime.

591
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,880
 He wouldn't look less like the drawing because the cartoon

592
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,680
 drawing would be a representation of him.

593
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,380
 So you would be like, I'm finally going to go to this

594
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,480
 world and I'm going to meet my two dimensional girlfriend

595
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,680
 and then you go there and she's going to be three

596
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,580
 dimensional girlfriend.

597
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,480
 And when you ask her, hey, are we going to go out

598
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
 Digi hunting today?

599
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,580
 She's going to be like, I have to wash my hair because

600
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,480
 she's still a fully realized human being and maybe

601
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,180
 she's not that into you just because you teleported to her

602
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,180
 through the ether.

603
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,980
 She still may not like you.

604
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,480
 So that's something to be prepared for if you ever

605
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,380
 think about traveling to a fictional universe, but you

606
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,280
 find your partner.

607
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,880
 You also have to then find a real Digi device.

608
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,180
 Digi device is like how you like they jump out of it

609
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,180
 or something like that.

610
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,780
 Probably should have done more research, but I just

611
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,780
 the show just doesn't interest me.

612
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,280
 Then you just kind of go on adventures.

613
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,280
 It's like Pokemon.

614
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,680
 Just keep thinking Pokemon, but try to be more edgy.

615
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,980
 I guess the devil's in it.

616
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,580
 There's a guy named devil man.

617
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,980
 All the people have mon at the end of the name, which

618
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,980
 means monster.

619
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,580
 I wonder if there's a Mon Mon, which is like a monster

620
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:51,980
 monster.

621
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,280
 Okay.

622
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
 I think that's a dad joke, but it's not.

623
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
 It's a Monday musing.

624
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,180
 But anyways, they go there and they're kind of like going

625
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,180
 on adventures and they're trying to defeat evil.

626
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,180
 I think Digi Mon was less about just, you know,

627
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,680
 cock fighting with electrical animals like Pokemon.

628
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,080
 It was out like they were trying to save the world or

629
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
 or whatever.

630
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,680
 Now that I'm recording this segment, when I was doing

631
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,080
 the research, I was like, I'm fine.

632
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,680
 I read a single Wikipedia article on it.

633
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,280
 I'm good devil exist.

634
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,980
 I'm totally good.

635
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,580
 So what type of people though are best suited to go to

636
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,380
 the Digiverse?

637
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,180
 This is a very, very fascinating subculture and I guess

638
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,480
 I should give you the spoiler alert.

639
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
 It didn't happen.

640
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,980
 This happened, right?

641
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,680
 But for two months, we really had people really believe

642
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,180
 in this.

643
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,480
 Now here's the thing.

644
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,780
 Digimon is not like Pokemon.

645
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,080
 You go to the Pokemon universe.

646
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,980
 The most you're going to do is get like electrocuted,

647
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,380
 which is pretty bad, right?

648
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,680
 Squirtle, Squirtle, ruins your new shirt.

649
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,980
 It's pretty benign.

650
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,680
 It's like being in our world, but a little more intense,

651
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,480
 but most of the Pokemon, as long as you're not walking

652
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,180
 around the forest or an active Pokemon trainer,

653
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,480
 you're not going to run into them that much.

654
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
 Digimon is far more violent.

655
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,980
 There's like a conflict going on.

656
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,180
 You have the devil Mon trying to do whatever the

657
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,080
 devil Mon does.

658
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,280
 His Mon Mon inchmans are coming after you.

659
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,580
 All sorts of craziness.

660
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,380
 So this isn't for the weak of heart.

661
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,080
 These people, these teenagers are possibly heading

662
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,480
 into a war zone.

663
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,780
 That's what makes us so fascinating.

664
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,580
 I could go on and on about particular anecdotes.

665
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,780
 One guy says he goes to the gymnasium every day.

666
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,080
 Who calls it a gymnasium unless he's like on a balance

667
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,180
 beam, but he goes to the gymnasium every day.

668
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,080
 He'll be fine fighting, fighting T-Rexes, digital T-Rexes.

669
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,880
 He'll be fine.

670
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280
 He's worried about other people.

671
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,580
 One guy says that he's afraid if he goes there,

672
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,380
 he won't be Christian anymore.

673
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,880
 To which an atheist says you're an idiot for believing

674
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,180
 in Christianity anyways, but the Digiverse, now that,

675
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,680
 that is something to believe in.

676
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,280
 You have all these weird anecdotes that I could kind

677
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,080
 of pick apart.

678
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,180
 We've done that before.

679
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,680
 We did that with the Christian episode.

680
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,380
 We've done that before.

681
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,180
 I find it so fascinating that these people are willing

682
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,780
 to enter a bloodbath for a better life.

683
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,380
 It's fascinating.

684
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,780
 It's a fascinating thing.

685
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,580
 There was one person who posted, "Listen, we got to be

686
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,180
 realistic about this stuff."

687
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,980
 Traveling to a digital realm, a whole lot of things

688
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,880
 can go wrong.

689
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,280
 There was one voice of sanity, because everyone was

690
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,980
 taking this seriously, but there was one voice of

691
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,480
 sanity amongst these people.

692
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,180
 They go, "You're going through a portal to a digital

693
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,480
 world first off."

694
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,880
 You may go insane simply by being transmitted into

695
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,680
 digital energy.

696
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,680
 We don't know what's going to happen when you become

697
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,780
 part of the digital world.

698
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,880
 Two, they said, "There's no guarantee that you're going

699
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,180
 to land in a lush forest."

700
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,980
 And you look over and there's a cute little digimon

701
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,280
 next to you, Pairmon or Radishmon or whatever.

702
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
 You have no idea.

703
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,180
 You may appear in a part of the planet where there's

704
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,880
 nothing.

705
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,980
 He goes, "What if you appear on a deserted island?

706
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,480
 What if you appear in the middle of the ocean?

707
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,080
 You get sucked out of Des Moines, Iowa.

708
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,380
 And the next thing you know, you're plummeted into

709
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,480
 the warm, salty depths of an alien planet's ocean.

710
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,480
 You don't know what's on the other side of that portal.

711
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,980
 As much as you want to go through that realm to

712
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,280
 someplace different, you are going to be deposited

713
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,380
 someplace random.

714
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,580
 It's not like Starfleet beaming me up.

715
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,080
 They're not going to be me up in a deep space.

716
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,480
 They're not going to be me up on a deserted island.

717
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,280
 But if there was a thing, hold up your Star Trek

718
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,380
 communicator toy on October 4th.

719
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,180
 Space ship comes overhead.

720
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,680
 You get beamed aboard the Defiant.

721
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,580
 I'm doing it.

722
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,180
 But this would be random in the world.

723
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,080
 Digimon is so wild and untamed.

724
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,780
 And there's all these conflicts going on.

725
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,780
 You may just appear in the middle of a battle and get

726
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,780
 squished or eaten or enslaved before you find your partner

727
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,680
 before you get your Digi device and become part of the saga.

728
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,080
 You're a footnote.

729
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,980
 You're not even that.

730
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,380
 You're just an event.

731
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,880
 You get in the way of a battle and are quickly dispatched.

732
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,080
 You're a pile of bones on a deserted island.

733
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,880
 You're devoured in the dark depths.

734
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,180
 You don't even see what eats you and what spins days

735
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,380
 dissolving you in its stomach.

736
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,380
 That joke was for you.

737
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:12,880
 Or me.

738
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,480
 That one is for you for still listening.

739
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,580
 You don't know where you're going to end up.

740
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,480
 There's a very fascinating way to look at this.

741
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,880
 That person then said, however, there's also the chance that

742
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,480
 you find your soulmate in the Digiverse.

743
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,780
 So he was willing to play the odds.

744
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,580
 That was literally how he ended that comment.

745
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,080
 Like he said a very, very lucid thing.

746
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,380
 We don't know what's going to happen, but on the other hand,

747
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,680
 you may get some.

748
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,780
 I don't think I would take that chance.

749
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,380
 I would take a chance going into a safe universe, a safe fish,

750
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,780
 like obviously Marvel Universe.

751
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,880
 You're going to get squished by Giant Man or Thanos is going

752
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,080
 to snap you out of existence or something like that.

753
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,580
 It's a chance of it at least.

754
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,280
 Star Trek.

755
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,480
 There's a chance you get the alien brain parasite, but at

756
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,980
 least you would be going to like New York or you would be going

757
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,080
 to the Enterprise.

758
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,480
 This guy knew that this was such a chaotic event.

759
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,380
 They were trying to force happen that anything could go wrong.

760
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,380
 It's funny because as much as I dismiss this part of it comes

761
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,480
 from the fact that I don't really know Digimon that well.

762
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,480
 If out of all the fictional universes that existed, if this

763
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,980
 was the one that existed, I'd be extremely disappointed.

764
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,180
 I obviously have favorites you do too.

765
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,680
 But on the other hand, I believe in stuff like infinite

766
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,880
 universes, infinite timelines, all things are possible and law

767
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,580
 of attraction.

768
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,080
 I don't think they work in the way that they're talking about.

769
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
 There's limits to it.

770
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,280
 I can't law of attraction my body and to be in yogurt.

771
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,280
 But there's probably in an infinite timeline and alternate

772
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,780
 universe a reality where I am yogurt.

773
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,580
 I'm yogurt right now.

774
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,580
 I think it's an interesting concept and it's something we've

775
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,780
 covered before and it's something we've thought about before

776
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,080
 as kids wanting to go to these fictional universes.

777
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,380
 But what if you didn't want to go to the fictional universe?

778
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,280
 The thing when you use magic and law of attraction can be

779
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,080
 considered magic in a sense.

780
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,780
 You're bending the world to your will is that if you don't

781
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,680
 know what you're doing, things aren't going to work out well.

782
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,580
 When you have a bunch of preteens and teens holding up pieces

783
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,380
 of plastic and stuffed animals on March 16th waiting to be

784
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,580
 thrust into this digital world and nothing happens.

785
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
 They just go home.

786
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,180
 But did nothing happen?

787
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:26,280
 Is it possible that they remained on her but their combined

788
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:31,480
 willpower did open up a portal somewhere just wasn't for them.

789
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,880
 It's for the young woman jogging with her dog through the forest.

790
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,680
 She went missing.

791
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,080
 You know the story.

792
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,180
 She's never found.

793
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,280
 No trace of her.

794
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,680
 Husbands of suspect.

795
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,280
 He's eventually cleared.

796
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,480
 12 years later people are still wondering what happened to Nancy

797
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,180
 Silva.

798
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,580
 It was March 16th 2008 when she was on that run.

799
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,880
 But she doesn't know what date it is now in the Digiverse.

800
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,980
 She's considered an anomaly.

801
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,280
 Nobody knows where she came from.

802
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,580
 Nobody knows what power she might have and all sides are

803
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,580
 looking for her.

804
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,480
 So she runs.

805
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,180
 She hides and she prays.

806
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:22,480
 But in our world she's just a face on a missing poster.

807
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,180
 The smiling face of a woman.

808
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,780
 Who will never be found again.

809
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:34,080
