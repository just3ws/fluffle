00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 It's the gentle ocean breeze that sweeps you off your feet.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.140
 The 99 holes of championship golf that offer endless possibilities.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.580
 The small town southern charm that embraces you everywhere you go.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 From the beaches in the east to the marshes in the west,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
 there's a special feeling you get on Amelia Island.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.480
 It's a real thing.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.140
 It's an island thing.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.900
 Make it your thing.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.180

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.780
 When human remains are found in a California desert,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.980
 authorities have to ask themselves,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 "Is this an accident? Is this murder?"

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.480
 or something far more vicious.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.580
 And then we travel back in time to the year 2008,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.980
 when hundreds of people looked to the sky and waited for the digi clips.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.780
 Was there really a plan to open the portal between our world

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.980
 and an old Japanese cartoon today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.780
 [music]

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.880
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.180
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.580
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.480
 The pig wrestling went fine.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.680
 Lil' Piggy got her hooves clipped.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.880
 I got a little injured.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 Pulled some muscles in my shoulders, but everything else is fine.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 If you're a new listener to this podcast, that may no sense,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.280
 but to you returning listeners, I am healthy.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.880
 Also, I got the test results back for my heart.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 Totally healthy, totally fine.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.680
 Two weeks of observation with a little heart monitor.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.280
 Everything was absolutely fine.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.980
 I just used too much nicotine, too much caffeine,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.180
 and threw my heart for a loop.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.780
 So great news all around.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.980
 Piggy got her hooves clipped and my heart's fine.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.080
 I mean, what more could you ask for a way to start a podcast?

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.480
 There's one more thing.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.280
 Another great thing about this is introducing our newest Patreon supporter,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.580
 writing in on a floating heart, because it's Valentine's Day, actually.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.080
 He's dressed up in a little Cupid's outfit.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.480
 It's Mike Knoop.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.380
 Everyone give a round of applause to Mike Knoop.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.780
 He's wearing a diaper.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.280
 He has the little arrow thing,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.880
 and he's floating around on a human heart,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.780
 an anatomically correct human heart.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.580
 Mike, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.280
 If you can't support the Patreon and you're not a Greek God of Love,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.180
 that's okay.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.780
 Just help spread the word about the show.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.380
 Really, really helps out a lot.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.680
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.080
 So Mike, you can keep on your Cupid outfit.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.280
 You look adorable,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.080
 but I am going to tashi the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.280
 Get off that heart.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.080
 We are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.580
 We are headed out to San Bernardino County.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.580
 Jason Jalopy,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.580
 driving down the freeway.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.680
 Now, this story, man,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.980
 I zeroed in on this story.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.480
 I swear the second it was published,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.880
 my spidey senses popped off.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.480
 The ones and zeros weren't even fully formed in the matrix

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480
 before I was reading this article.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.980
 However, I also got a request to do this one as well.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.180
 Long time fan of the show, Stuart Meatball,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.180
 YouTube champion, Stuart Meatball,

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.080
 hit me up and goes, "Hey, man, if you read this article,"

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.180
 and the answer was, "I had it."

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.480
 It's San Bernardino County, California.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.580
 January 31st, 2021.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.380
 We're standing out in the desert,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.180
 wind sweeping the ground.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.680
 We see a sheriff's department truck there,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.480
 and a bunch of cops are walking around.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.380
 They're all dusty and stuff like that.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.980
 They don't take baths.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.780
 You didn't know that?

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.780
 Cops down there, they never take baths.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.580
 [breathing]

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.980
 So they see like bones and a skull,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.580
 and there's like an evil vulture.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.080
 I don't know.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.180
 Maybe it's just a good vulture,

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.680
 but it just happens to eat humans.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.980
 It's sitting there as well.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.880
 They're taking pictures.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.580
 Ka-klick-jj.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.780
 Ka-klick-jj.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.980
 Because they have an old camera.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.680
 Apparently they have the camera from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre opening credits.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.380
 They're specifically in Wonder Valley,

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.880
 which is next to Joshua Tree National Park here in San Bernardino County, California.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.980
 Now, at this point, the remains have not been identified.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.180
 These human remains have just been found.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.880
 Let's go back in time to June 2020, though.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.480
 There's people who think they know who this body may belong to.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.680
 June 2020, there was a woman named Erica Lloyd.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.480
 She was doing a solo trip.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.380
 She wanted to drive to Joshua Tree National Park,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.280
 but they lost track of her.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.180
 She never came home.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.280
 She's been missing since June 2020.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.480
 The authorities did find her car abandoned,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.780
 and it was vandalized.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.980
 Now, the fact that she's missing, the fact that it's vandalized,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.280
 could be totally two separate events.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.180
 People could have just seen the car out there and decided, you know,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.480
 this is a good target.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.780
 However, this is why you shouldn't just be a once-in-vandal,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.980
 because I'm sure that those vandals are actually being looked for by the police.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.480
 They're all,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.580
 "Mikey was here!"

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.580
 And they're like,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.680
 "Find all Mikeys!

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.980
 Find all the Mikeys in San Bernardino, California.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.880
 Don't vandalize stuff because you might become a murder suspect."

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.580
 That's tip one from a veteran vandal.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.580
 Around the same time, in the same area,

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.980
 there was a dude he'd bought a motel, an old rundown motel,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.080
 and he wanted to rebuild it.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.480
 It would be a project for him,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.280
 maybe turn it into a tourist attraction.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.980
 He was kind of a wealthy guy,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.680
 but, you know, it gets you to use your hands.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.980
 He gets to, like, actually create things and craft things.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.580
 Plus, it's a business investment.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.280
 It's old--

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.080
 I don't know if he's old.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.380
 This man buys this hotel,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.180
 and he's repairing it, and he asked his buddy,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.880
 "Hey, you want to come out? You're not working right now.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.280
 The pandemic's going on. Everything's shut down.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.980
 Why don't you come out and help me rebuild this motel in the middle of nowhere?"

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.080
 It's in Wonder Valley, right near Joshua Tree National Park.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.980
 So, a man gets in his car and drives from his home in Hollywood in June 2020

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.980
 to go work with his friend at this hotel.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.380
 He pulls up outside the hotel.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.680
 It's just him and his buddy there in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.480
 Somewhere nearby, Eric Aloyde is also driving to an unknown destination.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.580
 But this man who gets out of his car, this man who was invited by his friend

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.880
 to be in the middle of nowhere to build this hotel...

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.180
 [Sigh]

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.580
 His name is Armie Hammer.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.880
 Now, if you're new--

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.480
 If you're new listener to the show,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.880
 welcome.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.980
 We've been talking about Armie Hammer a lot in the past couple weeks.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.580
 This is a true story.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.180
 Armie Hammer's been in the news.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.780
 I've talked about him a couple times on the show.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.780
 I've made several jokes about him.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.880
 He's to wrap it up real quick.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.480
 To wrap it up like a piece of meat.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.080
 Armie Hammer allegedly--

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.580
 He denies it, but was sending messages saying how much he wanted to eat women,

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.280
 how he wanted to break their ribs and eat them,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.780
 how he wanted to cut off their toes and keep them in their pocket.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.980
 And he declared himself in one of these texts,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.480
 "I am 100% accountable."

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.980
 There's no wiggle room there.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.680
 Unless you're talking about the fingers wiggling off of a newly severed hand.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.480
 That guy, that was just dark.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.580
 That was disturbing, but anyways,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.580
 that's what Armie Hammer calls Top Ramen.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.980
 The point is, is that he's talking all this stuff about wanting to eat people.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.980
 He denies it.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.380
 There's all these allegations of people saying he's having all these women

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.480
 who come forward and saying,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.880
 "We all got messages saying he wanted to eat me."

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.880
 Now, what happened was last summer, he was texting from this hotel.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.380
 "Hey guys, isn't this so awesome?

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.180
 I'm out here in the middle of nowhere.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.080
 You can run, you can hide, but you can scream all you want.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.280
 But I'll still build this hotel."

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280
 And people are like, "What?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.480
 That's weird why he had that medicine part."

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.280
 He was texting, he was posting on Instagram

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.880
 that he was out in Joshua Tree, out in Wonder Valley,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.680
 rebuilding this hotel with his buddy.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.280
 And people are like, "Oh, you know, he doesn't have anything else to do.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.680
 The pandemic's going on, all the movies are closed down.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.080
 Who doesn't like spending time in the outdoors building stuff?"

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.080
 Now, this woman, these human remains have been found.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.880
 The question is, is it Erica Lloyd?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.180
 Is it somebody else?

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.880
 There are some news reports saying there are three sets of human remains found.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.480
 Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.680
 That wouldn't make sense.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.980
 But I've only seen that reported in the gossip sites.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.680
 The actual news sites say one set of human remains have been found.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.280
 In an area where Army Hammer was working,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.280
 i.e. in the area in the middle of nowhere.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.280
 It would be like if there were human remains found in downtown Los Angeles,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.780
 that's Wednesday.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.780
 The garbage men are just like, "Oh, they put on their corner cap?"

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.780
 And they're already like dissecting it.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.180
 And Army Hammer's just walking on the street.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.880
 You wouldn't even think about it.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.080
 But the fact that Army Hammer is in the desert, Army Hammer is in the desert.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.080
 And now we're finding human remains in the desert.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.080
 And it may have been this woman.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.480
 Absolutely insane.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.080
 I woke up, I saw this story.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.680
 I was like, "This is...

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.880
 I have to talk about this."

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.180
 But what happened was, I had actually, this story is a couple days old.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.880
 I had already recorded those episodes because I had to go wrestle that pig.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.480
 So I had to wait.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.980
 I had to wait to tell the story.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.880
 And then Stuart's like, "Hey, did you read this?"

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.680
 And I was like, "Dude, yes."

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.180
 I also, and this is funny because I've been discussing the story with people in my private life as well.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.680
 I think the Army Hammer saga, I had never thought it would get to the point

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.080
 where he's a suspect in a murder.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.880
 To be fair, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.880
 have said he is not a suspect in the murder.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.980
 Which is exactly what you would say to a man who has millions of dollars

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.080
 and can fly to Thailand.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.980
 He would just fly away.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.280
 So of course, the sheriff's like, "Shh."

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.880
 She's like holding his finger to his lips.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.580
 "No, he's not a suspect."

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.380
 And then they're like, "Getting cuffs ready."

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.080
 They're getting Army Hammer-sized cuffs ready.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.280
 So they're officially saying he's not a suspect.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.880
 But that's a little premature.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.680
 There's human remains found in the location of a man once again

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.080
 who declared himself 100% accountable.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.180
 He denies it.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.180
 So he denies it, but his Instagram said it, right?

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.580
 His Instagram said it.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.880
 And a bunch of his exes have come forward and said,

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.080
 "Yeah, he was kind of about eating people and stuff like that."

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.880
 Two more things.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.380
 One, he did a movie called "Call Me By Your Name."

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.980
 No, no, no, no, no.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.180
 He's like, "Hey, my name's Timmy.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.480
 Hey, Timmy, come back here."

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.280
 That'd be confusing.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.180
 "Call Me By Your Name."

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.080
 Wait, no, what?

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.780
 "Call Me By My Name."

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.080
 It was a romance, I guess.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.180
 I never saw it, but it was him and Timothy Chalmet.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.680
 It's some dude, some other actor,

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.680
 and then there was the director.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.280
 Obviously, that's how movies are made, right?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.080
 It's a home video.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.680
 His mom's filming it.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.380
 The director and the actor, Timothy Chalmay, whatever,

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.080
 they're going on to do another movie right now.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.180
 So, out of the three of them,

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.280
 two of them have gone to do this new movie called "Bones and All."

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.480
 And the movie is literally about this.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.780
 It's about a young girl, or like a college-age girl, I'm assuming.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.880
 Every time she falls in love, she eats them.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.080
 So it's a cannibal movie.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.980
 So all three of them, all three of them,

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.780
 maybe and on this for all I know.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.980
 But they're doing a cannibal movie.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.380
 No, I don't like to conflate the art.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.980
 I think that's just a funny aside.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.580
 They're making a cannibal movie.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:02.080
 I'm not going to conflate the art with the weirdness of him being murder suspect,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.180
 because people make, I don't think Tom Cruise is a taxi cab hijacking serial killer.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.180
 Like, the art's the art.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.080
 That's the way I view it.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.080
 But I just think that's a funny coincidence.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.180
 And I'm sure Armie Hammer wished he was cast in that.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.880
 He's like, "Oh, dude, can I at least be on the set?"

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.280
 I got a Twitter email from DreamPillot.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.880
 And then let's segue into this.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.280
 In my segment, because I've been trying to figure this out.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.980
 Monday Musings, this is our new segment.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.880
 Mike Knoop, let's go ahead and hop out of the Jason Jalopy.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.280
 We're going to hop in the Dead or Abit Durgeable.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.380
 We're going to fly to a banquet hall.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.380
 We're still doing the Armie Hammer story, though.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.080
 So a few guys were hoping this was over.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.780
 Nope.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.580
 Mike Knoop, fly us out.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.280
 He probably hears that joke all the time.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.080
 Mike Knoop, fly us in this Dead or Abit Durgeable out to this large dining hall.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.380
 Oh, you know what?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.380
 Just have the dining hall in the Durgeable.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:52.880
 Make it easier.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.280
 Mike Knoop wanted to fly.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.480
 Okay, fly us to that hometown buffet.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480
 We're going there.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.880
 DreamPillot sent me an article.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.680
 It was in Cosmopolitan Magazine.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.180
 I think the kids call it Cosmo.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.880
 But Cosmopolitan Magazine had an article about the kink of cannibalism.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.080
 And it was saying, you know, this is a subset of BDSM.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.980
 Here's my Monday.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.680
 I can't figure this out.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.980
 I can't figure this out.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.180
 How do you pretend to eat somebody?

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.380
 I get like role-playing and stuff like that.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.680
 She's a cop.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.280
 You're the bank robber.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.880
 Or she's Dr. Octopus and your Spider-Man, whatever.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.080
 Like stuff to spice up the bedroom.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.280
 And like you could, I mean, both of those involve you actively fighting somebody?

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.980
 You'll never stop being Doc Ock or Spray Shaving Cream in her face.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.280
 But like, you can do that.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.280
 Like you can spray Shaving Cream in your loved one's face.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.980
 You can pretend like you can role-play and do stuff like that.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.780
 How do you pretend to get eaten?

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.480
 That's what I can't figure out.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.180
 Like the cannibal guy would be like,

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.680
 "What's up? Just imagine how people play with babies."

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.180
 And they go, "Num, num, num.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.880
 I'm gonna eat your tummy."

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.180
 And then you like gum the kids' tongue.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.780
 "I can't go, go, go, go."

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.780
 But you're not actually eating.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.080
 Is that what cannibal fetish is?

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.980
 Like I read this big article in Thanks Dream Pillet for sending it over, but I still don't get it.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.180
 Like, "Mmm, mm, mm, I'm gonna eat you up."

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.080
 No, no.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.380
 And then like you take bites of, because you don't actually eat them.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.880
 Like they're like, the article is like,

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.780
 "You can nibble on their neck and you can like draw sometimes, draw some blood."

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.580
 I'm like, "That's not eating.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.080
 I don't ever go to a steak restaurant."

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.380
 And I'm like, "I'm like, "Let's a suck on that sirloin, please."

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.380
 It's like you eat it.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.080
 So how do you pretend to eat somebody?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.180
 And I can kind of figure that out.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.080
 I can kind of figure out you being like,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.480
 "Oh, I'm gonna eat you. I'm a cannibal."

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.380
 I'm 100% a cannibal.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.980
 But the fetish goes both ways.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.780
 There are people who want to be cannibals.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.780
 And then there are people who want to be eaten.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.080
 I don't get that.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.480
 Like I don't get that.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.480
 I get the mental gymnastics part of it.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.580
 But I don't get how you would pretend to do that.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.680
 Like you're laying in bed.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.180
 You're like, "Jason, please go on to the next segment."

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.680
 You're laying in bed and then someone's like,

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.480
 "Nom, nom, nom. I'm gonna eat you."

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.880
 And do you imagine them actually like eat?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.980
 Is it the psychological fear of being eaten?

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.580
 Or is it like, when someone's like,

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.480
 "Nom, nom, nom."

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.280
 Like gumming on your neck, do you imagine it's like walking dead

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.880
 and they're actually like ripping pieces?

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.180
 Because they're not.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.680
 They're like, "I'm gonna take your nose.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.780
 I want to take your nose."

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.780
 You're like, "No, my nose."

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.580
 They got their little thumb in between their fingers.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.980
 You're like, "No, no. Let it stop. Let it stop."

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.080
 Like how do you do that?

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.580
 Do you like hide your arms in shirts and stuff like that?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.980
 So you just have like your elbows are sticking out.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.580
 And you're like, "Oh, no. He ate my arms. I don't get it."

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.580
 I don't get it. It's just a fetish.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.280
 Or I don't understand it.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.780
 And it's one of those things.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.480
 Like again, if you were pretending that she's the cop

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.580
 and you're the burglar, you're breaking into the house

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.280
 and she's like, "Stop. Be sexy or I'm gonna shoot."

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.480
 And you turn around and you start being sexy.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.180
 Fine. Whatever. Whatever.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.680
 But the eating thing, like I can't figure out

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.480
 how you would pretend to be eaten.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.080
 I don't get it.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.680
 Because obviously, like I can see my arms.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.280
 Like it just doesn't make any sense to me.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.480
 It's like this.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.580
 If I had a fetish of sleeping with a waitress,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.280
 if that's, yeah, I do. I do.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.580
 I love sleeping with waitresses.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.680
 But hypothetically say that I don't have that fetish

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.380
 and I now do for the sake of this argument.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.980
 Let's say I hypothetically like sleeping with waitresses.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.480
 I can easily fulfill that.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.580
 I can have my girlfriend dress up like a waitress.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.880
 Super easy.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.980
 Or I can just sleep with waitresses.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.480
 So either way, I'm golden.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.080
 But that doesn't work with being a fetish.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.980
 That doesn't work with being a cannibal.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.480
 Because I can go "Nom, nom, nom.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.580
 I'm gonna eat your belly.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.780
 Oh, no, I ate your thumbs."

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.380
 And you like have them hide their thumbs.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.580
 No.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.780
 But you know it's not real.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.580
 You know it doesn't, isn't actually real.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.580
 I think that's a fetish that you're far more likely

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.480
 to engage in in real life.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.980
 Because there's nothing you can do to replicate it

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.380
 in the bedroom at all.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.080
 I mean, I guess if you brought in like fake blood

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.080
 and had like Greg Nicotero in the background doing special

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.980
 effects makeup and things like that.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.780
 But other than that, no matter what you did in the bedroom,

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.880
 it would always leave you wanting more.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.180
 It would always leave you hungry for more.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.280
 Most fetishes you can completely fulfill

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.180
 with a consenting partner.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.280
 Like furries.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.980
 You just yiffing around in the first suits.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.880
 There you go.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.880
 You want to have sex with Donald Duck.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.180
 You just have sex with a guy dressed like Donald Duck.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.680
 That's fine.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.680
 You don't actually then have to go out and find a duck.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.280
 You fulfilled the fantasy of having sex with an anthropomorph.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.080
 That's actually makes more sense because the fantasy isn't

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.080
 to have sex with a duck.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.180
 It's to have sex with, but you want to have sex

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.480
 with an anthropomorphic duck.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.980
 So you actually can't fulfill that in real life.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.480
 You have to use the furry community.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.380
 So that makes sense.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.880
 I get like the logic in that.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.480
 I'm not worried about them running around being in ducks.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.780
 I am worried about them possibly murdering one or more women

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.880
 in the desert.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.780
 And this is actually you guys are going to be shocked

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.080
 that this is actually a great segue for our next story.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.380
 Mike Know is like, No, I don't want you to the next story.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.380
 This is a segue.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.280
 Mike Know.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.180
 Yeah, you do.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.880
 Is this next story is all about love?

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.780
 Actually, the first story was about love.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.980
 The love of eating people.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.080
 But nope.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.880
 It's Valentine's Day.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.780
 Love is in the air.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.080
 Let's hop in that carbon helicopter.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.480
 We're leaving behind San Bernardino County and the hometown

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.180
 buffet.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.080
 We got our pockets full of onion rings.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.280
 We are leaving and we are headed out to an unnamed town in

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.480
 the middle of America.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.980
 We're flying out there.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.780
 We're eating onion rings.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.180
 Having a grand old time.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.180
 What we're here in this small town for is a story that was

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.480
 recommended to me by Kentillions, a long time listener of the

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.180
 show Kentillions.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.880
 Thank you so much for sending this over.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.980
 This is the saga.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.280
 No one is project Digi Clips.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.880
 Now as Mike is piloting the carbon helicopter over the small

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.180
 town, we see a bunch of preteens, teenagers walking out of

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.780
 their houses.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.880
 They all have a backpack strapped to their wrist and in

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.780
 their freehand, they're holding a Digi device.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.380
 These are basically Tomagachi type toys where you'd raise

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.680
 Digimon and make them fight each other.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.580
 And that was pretty much it.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.980
 But it was also the basis for cartoons and comic books and

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.980
 video games, other video actual video games rather than

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.980
 these pieces of junk.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.280
 As Mike is flying the carbon helicopter over, I'm putting my

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:45.980
 hand on the shoulder.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.480
 I'm like, dude, be ready, be ready.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.680
 And then all of a sudden, all these people raise their Digi

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.980
 devices into the air.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.080
 The sky cracks open.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:02.280
 Reality shifts and we see the children one by one getting

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.180
 sucked up into personalized black holes.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:11.380
 We have just witnessed the Digi Clips.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.480
 The idea is this.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.580
 This actually was really big back in 2008 for about two or

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.380
 three months.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.480
 You had February to March 2008.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.780
 The idea is this.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.980
 Digimon are real.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.980
 The goal, bring them to us or for the more adventure prone,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.680
 we go to them.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.080
 They believed if you held your Digi device to the sky at a

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.980
 precise moment.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.480
 Now, the agreed upon time seemed to be March 16th, 2008,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.780
 but apparently they were localized Digi Clipses as well.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.280
 You had to confer with your local Digi Dwarfs to figure

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.080
 that one out.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.480
 Hey, if you guys are Digimon fans, sorry, because I'm

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.580
 probably not going to be super kind to the program, but

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.180
 you're hanging out with the other Digi people and you have

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.280
 to hold up your Digi device all at the same time.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.080
 You'll create these black holes.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.780
 Now, they say, listen, we know these are toys.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.180
 So it's not so much the fact that the Digi device has the

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.780
 ability to transport you to another dimension because they

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.780
 did they'd have to put that on the warning label.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.780
 So they're just toys.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.280
 The idea is that you're in love with your Digimon.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.180
 So anything that identifies your Digimon you can use.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.480
 They said you can even use your stuffed animals.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.580
 So if you ever were like driving around your town back on

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:29.680
 March 16th, 2008 and you saw a man holding a stuffed dinosaur

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.080
 and pointing it at the sky, you didn't know it, but that man

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.980
 was a man who didn't have a Digi device but still wanted to

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.480
 go to the digital realm.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.680
 What do you do once you enter the Digiverse?

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.180
 The Digiverse is basically, again, I didn't really get into

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.980
 the mythology and I read a Wikipedia article on Digimon

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.580
 itself and it's just generic.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.280
 It was more of a sci-fi version of Pokemon.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.380
 Pokemon always seemed like a very nature-based.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.080
 Well, it definitely is more sci-fi because they're digital

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.180
 animals and that was one of the things people go, "Well, if

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.680
 Digimon is real, why can't Pokemon be real?"

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.380
 And they go, "Pfft, you idiots, you fool.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.180
 What are you talking about?"

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.180
 Digital can include anything, anything can be programmed.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.280
 So the Digiverse could actually be real.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.380
 They keep using string theory and the infinite universe

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.880
 theorem, which is true.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.180
 And on infinite timeline and infinite universes, everything's

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.680
 possible.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.180
 There is a Digiverse.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.480
 Fine, I'll give you that.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.480
 But everything else is ridiculous.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.180
 The fact that on a certain day you could hold up a stuffed

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.680
 dinosaur or something that reminded you of your favorite

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.280
 Digimon, you'd get sucked into an alternate universe.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.680
 They believed a lot of it on Law of Attraction.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.680
 They believed a lot of it on, "If you love something so much,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.080
 it has to be true."

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.480
 Which is basically the motto of every stalker, right?

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.780
 So you have that.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.580
 They say it's like a placebo.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.680
 Placebos aren't real, but they help you.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.880
 So if you can give someone a sugar pill and it calms their

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.380
 nervous stomach, you can hold up a stuffed animal and fly to

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.280
 an alternate universe.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.480
 They make this leap of logic.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480
 But it's digital, see?

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480
 So it's possible.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.280
 So what do you do when you go to the Digiverse?

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.780
 This is the steps that were laid out.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.780
 First off, you find your partner, which I'm assuming is like

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.980
 their waifu.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.580
 I'm assuming it's like the girl, which I know a lot of

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.680
 people like, like animated girls, like drawings of girls.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.180
 But if you went to that universe, they'd probably look super

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.580
 weird.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.380
 Because you would not become a cartoon.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.580
 You would go to a digital verse.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.880
 And so you'd be 3D.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.080
 Everything else would be 3D.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.280
 The reason why we're seeing it as a drawing is because

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.880
 animators are drawing.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.980
 Let's assume here for a second that their theory is right.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.480
 Because I've found this fascinating.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.480
 I think we talked about this during the Chris Chan episode

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.180
 as well.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.180
 If you went to the world of Digimon, it would not be

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.580
 2D cell shaded animation.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.680
 That is a human representation of that.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.080
 It's the same thing as if you read the Bible and there's

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.280
 no photos from the Bible.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.180
 You would not go back and you'd be like, oh, look at all

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.380
 these texts.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.480
 Look at all these words.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.180
 Jesus looks like a giant wood carving coming at me.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.480
 Because that's all the imagery of how he looks like a

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.780
 Renaissance painting coming at me.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.780
 No, you'd go back and you know that if you went back in

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.980
 time, you would see stuff as it was not as it's represented.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.080
 So if you went to the Digi verse, there wouldn't be

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.380
 little dinosaur, little poorly designed dinosaur.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.180
 I didn't like the character designs on that show.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.380
 I was not a huge fan of it.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.580
 Try not to completely trash it during this segment.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.180
 But it wouldn't look like that.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.580
 The girl, Trixie or Noxie or whatever their names were.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.880
 She would look like a normal human girl and she wouldn't

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.780
 look like that drawing.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.480
 There may be a vague comparison because the person who

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.880
 drew that drawing was like influenced by the psychic

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.480
 power of that character across the universe.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.280
 Fine.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.980
 But it's like Optimus Prime would look like a Michael

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.880
 Bay Optimus Prime.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.880
 He wouldn't look less like the drawing because the cartoon

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.680
 drawing would be a representation of him.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.380
 So you would be like, I'm finally going to go to this

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.480
 world and I'm going to meet my two dimensional girlfriend

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.680
 and then you go there and she's going to be three

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.580
 dimensional girlfriend.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.480
 And when you ask her, hey, are we going to go out

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.480
 Digi hunting today?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.580
 She's going to be like, I have to wash my hair because

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.480
 she's still a fully realized human being and maybe

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.180
 she's not that into you just because you teleported to her

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.180
 through the ether.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.980
 She still may not like you.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.480
 So that's something to be prepared for if you ever

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.380
 think about traveling to a fictional universe, but you

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.280
 find your partner.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.880
 You also have to then find a real Digi device.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.180
 Digi device is like how you like they jump out of it

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.180
 or something like that.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.780
 Probably should have done more research, but I just

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.780
 the show just doesn't interest me.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.280
 Then you just kind of go on adventures.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.280
 It's like Pokemon.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.680
 Just keep thinking Pokemon, but try to be more edgy.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.980
 I guess the devil's in it.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.580
 There's a guy named devil man.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.980
 All the people have mon at the end of the name, which

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.980
 means monster.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.580
 I wonder if there's a Mon Mon, which is like a monster

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:51.980
 monster.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.280
 Okay.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.280
 I think that's a dad joke, but it's not.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.280
 It's a Monday musing.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.180
 But anyways, they go there and they're kind of like going

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.180
 on adventures and they're trying to defeat evil.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.180
 I think Digi Mon was less about just, you know,

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.680
 cock fighting with electrical animals like Pokemon.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.080
 It was out like they were trying to save the world or

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.080
 or whatever.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.680
 Now that I'm recording this segment, when I was doing

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.080
 the research, I was like, I'm fine.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.680
 I read a single Wikipedia article on it.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.280
 I'm good devil exist.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:20.980
 I'm totally good.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.580
 So what type of people though are best suited to go to

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.380
 the Digiverse?

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.180
 This is a very, very fascinating subculture and I guess

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.480
 I should give you the spoiler alert.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.480
 It didn't happen.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.980
 This happened, right?

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.680
 But for two months, we really had people really believe

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.180
 in this.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.480
 Now here's the thing.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.780
 Digimon is not like Pokemon.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.080
 You go to the Pokemon universe.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.980
 The most you're going to do is get like electrocuted,

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.380
 which is pretty bad, right?

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.680
 Squirtle, Squirtle, ruins your new shirt.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.980
 It's pretty benign.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.680
 It's like being in our world, but a little more intense,

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.480
 but most of the Pokemon, as long as you're not walking

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.180
 around the forest or an active Pokemon trainer,

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.480
 you're not going to run into them that much.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.480
 Digimon is far more violent.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.980
 There's like a conflict going on.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.180
 You have the devil Mon trying to do whatever the

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.080
 devil Mon does.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.280
 His Mon Mon inchmans are coming after you.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.580
 All sorts of craziness.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.380
 So this isn't for the weak of heart.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.080
 These people, these teenagers are possibly heading

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.480
 into a war zone.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.780
 That's what makes us so fascinating.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.580
 I could go on and on about particular anecdotes.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.780
 One guy says he goes to the gymnasium every day.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.080
 Who calls it a gymnasium unless he's like on a balance

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.180
 beam, but he goes to the gymnasium every day.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.080
 He'll be fine fighting, fighting T-Rexes, digital T-Rexes.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.880
 He'll be fine.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.280
 He's worried about other people.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.580
 One guy says that he's afraid if he goes there,

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.380
 he won't be Christian anymore.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.880
 To which an atheist says you're an idiot for believing

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.180
 in Christianity anyways, but the Digiverse, now that,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.680
 that is something to believe in.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.280
 You have all these weird anecdotes that I could kind

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.080
 of pick apart.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.180
 We've done that before.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.680
 We did that with the Christian episode.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.380
 We've done that before.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.180
 I find it so fascinating that these people are willing

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.780
 to enter a bloodbath for a better life.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.380
 It's fascinating.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.780
 It's a fascinating thing.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.580
 There was one person who posted, "Listen, we got to be

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.180
 realistic about this stuff."

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.980
 Traveling to a digital realm, a whole lot of things

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.880
 can go wrong.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.280
 There was one voice of sanity, because everyone was

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.980
 taking this seriously, but there was one voice of

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.480
 sanity amongst these people.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.180
 They go, "You're going through a portal to a digital

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.480
 world first off."

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.880
 You may go insane simply by being transmitted into

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.680
 digital energy.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.680
 We don't know what's going to happen when you become

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.780
 part of the digital world.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.880
 Two, they said, "There's no guarantee that you're going

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.180
 to land in a lush forest."

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.980
 And you look over and there's a cute little digimon

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.280
 next to you, Pairmon or Radishmon or whatever.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.280
 You have no idea.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.180
 You may appear in a part of the planet where there's

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:48.880
 nothing.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.980
 He goes, "What if you appear on a deserted island?

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.480
 What if you appear in the middle of the ocean?

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.080
 You get sucked out of Des Moines, Iowa.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.380
 And the next thing you know, you're plummeted into

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.480
 the warm, salty depths of an alien planet's ocean.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.480
 You don't know what's on the other side of that portal.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.980
 As much as you want to go through that realm to

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.280
 someplace different, you are going to be deposited

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.380
 someplace random.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.580
 It's not like Starfleet beaming me up.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.080
 They're not going to be me up in a deep space.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.480
 They're not going to be me up on a deserted island.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.280
 But if there was a thing, hold up your Star Trek

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.380
 communicator toy on October 4th.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.180
 Space ship comes overhead.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.680
 You get beamed aboard the Defiant.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.580
 I'm doing it.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.180
 But this would be random in the world.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.080
 Digimon is so wild and untamed.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.780
 And there's all these conflicts going on.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.780
 You may just appear in the middle of a battle and get

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.780
 squished or eaten or enslaved before you find your partner

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.680
 before you get your Digi device and become part of the saga.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.080
 You're a footnote.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.980
 You're not even that.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.380
 You're just an event.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.880
 You get in the way of a battle and are quickly dispatched.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.080
 You're a pile of bones on a deserted island.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.880
 You're devoured in the dark depths.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.180
 You don't even see what eats you and what spins days

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.380
 dissolving you in its stomach.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.380
 That joke was for you.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:12.880
 Or me.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.480
 That one is for you for still listening.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.580
 You don't know where you're going to end up.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.480
 There's a very fascinating way to look at this.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.880
 That person then said, however, there's also the chance that

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.480
 you find your soulmate in the Digiverse.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.780
 So he was willing to play the odds.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.580
 That was literally how he ended that comment.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.080
 Like he said a very, very lucid thing.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.380
 We don't know what's going to happen, but on the other hand,

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.680
 you may get some.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.780
 I don't think I would take that chance.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.380
 I would take a chance going into a safe universe, a safe fish,

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.780
 like obviously Marvel Universe.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.880
 You're going to get squished by Giant Man or Thanos is going

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.080
 to snap you out of existence or something like that.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.580
 It's a chance of it at least.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.280
 Star Trek.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.480
 There's a chance you get the alien brain parasite, but at

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.980
 least you would be going to like New York or you would be going

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.080
 to the Enterprise.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.480
 This guy knew that this was such a chaotic event.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.380
 They were trying to force happen that anything could go wrong.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.380
 It's funny because as much as I dismiss this part of it comes

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.480
 from the fact that I don't really know Digimon that well.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.480
 If out of all the fictional universes that existed, if this

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.980
 was the one that existed, I'd be extremely disappointed.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.180
 I obviously have favorites you do too.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.680
 But on the other hand, I believe in stuff like infinite

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.880
 universes, infinite timelines, all things are possible and law

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.580
 of attraction.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.080
 I don't think they work in the way that they're talking about.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.080
 There's limits to it.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.280
 I can't law of attraction my body and to be in yogurt.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.280
 But there's probably in an infinite timeline and alternate

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.780
 universe a reality where I am yogurt.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.580
 I'm yogurt right now.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.580
 I think it's an interesting concept and it's something we've

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.780
 covered before and it's something we've thought about before

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.080
 as kids wanting to go to these fictional universes.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.380
 But what if you didn't want to go to the fictional universe?

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.280
 The thing when you use magic and law of attraction can be

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.080
 considered magic in a sense.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.780
 You're bending the world to your will is that if you don't

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.680
 know what you're doing, things aren't going to work out well.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.580
 When you have a bunch of preteens and teens holding up pieces

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.380
 of plastic and stuffed animals on March 16th waiting to be

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.580
 thrust into this digital world and nothing happens.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.080
 They just go home.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.180
 But did nothing happen?

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:26.280
 Is it possible that they remained on her but their combined

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:31.480
 willpower did open up a portal somewhere just wasn't for them.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.880
 It's for the young woman jogging with her dog through the forest.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.680
 She went missing.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.080
 You know the story.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.180
 She's never found.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.280
 No trace of her.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.680
 Husbands of suspect.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.280
 He's eventually cleared.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.480
 12 years later people are still wondering what happened to Nancy

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.180
 Silva.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.580
 It was March 16th 2008 when she was on that run.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:01.880
 But she doesn't know what date it is now in the Digiverse.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.980
 She's considered an anomaly.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.280
 Nobody knows where she came from.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.580
 Nobody knows what power she might have and all sides are

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.580
 looking for her.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.480
 So she runs.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.180
 She hides and she prays.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:22.480
 But in our world she's just a face on a missing poster.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.180
 The smiling face of a woman.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.780
 Who will never be found again.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:34.080
