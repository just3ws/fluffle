 As Russian special forces move through Ukraine, we find out what their true targets are.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.840
 Hillary Clinton's Adrenaline Chrome factories.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.160
 And then we travel to China to meet a scientist who one day accidentally swallowed a germ.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.440
 But this wasn't any normal germ. It was a germ that turned him into a bloodthirsty vampire.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:06.160
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.240
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.360
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.760
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so don't don't swallow any germs yet.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.840
 First off let's go ahead and welcome in one of our Thanksgiving livestream contributors.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.160
 Everyone give it up for young Hemlock.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.160
 Give him a big round of applause as he's summer salting into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.360
 Young Hemlock you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.000
 If you guys can't support the show financially I totally understand.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.320
 Just help spread the word about the show.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.960
 Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your enemies.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.320
 As you're crushing them beneath your heel listen to Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.280
 Don't kill them because otherwise they won't listen to it.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.560
 But those are also great ways to help the show grow.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.280
 Now young Hemlock I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason jet.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.520
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.840
 And we are flying on out to the very subject that no one wants to hear about.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.960
 But some crazy things are going on.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.240
 Young Hemlock take us all the way out to Ukraine.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.400
 The reason why we're flying out to Ukraine is right now.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.720
 If you haven't been to the newspaper in the past couple of weeks.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.080
 Russia has invaded Ukraine.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.520
 They've been there for a couple of weeks.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.520
 They invaded on Christian's birthday.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.800
 The weirdest of all.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.760
 You know what the thing is is like originally I said because we didn't cover the election.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.040
 We don't do politics.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.680
 We really didn't cover COVID either like early on.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.080
 I said you know what people hear about this all the time.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.800
 The last thing they want to do is turn on a conspiracy theory podcast.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.840
 And hear about COVID so we never really touched that issue right.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.280
 We every show often.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.440
 And I was planning on taking the same tact and probably going forward will.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.200
 With the war in Ukraine.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.720
 Because you hear about it all the time.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.160
 It's all over your Facebook feed.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.680
 It's all over the news.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.120
 You want a place to get away from it.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.600
 However.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.680
 I can't turn weird stuff like this down man.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.480
 This stuff is just showing up on the internet.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.360
 I can't turn it down.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.320
 I actually saw a skitso van.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.920
 I saw a photo of a skitso van.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.480
 Those are those vans with all the paintings on it.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.080
 Not like the cool barbarian slaying the dragon and holding the busty winch.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.480
 No it's like stuff on the side of the van that says Stephen King killed John Lennon.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.520
 Stuff like that.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.080
 I saw a skitso van about the war in Ukraine.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.080
 And it said Spetsnaz frees captured kids.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.800
 I was like I don't understand what those words mean individually.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.320
 But what in the world Spetsnaz is Russia's special forces.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.680
 And I saw that on the side of the car.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.440
 No context.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.160
 No context.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.640
 And I was like hmm I wonder if that'll pop up on my radar.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.760
 And it did because I look up conspiracy theories all the time.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.400
 This is apparently what is truly going on.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.800
 The lame stream media won't tell you about this.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.360
 Spetsnaz which is Russian special forces are currently moving through the country of Ukraine.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.680
 And this has nothing to do with geopolitics.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.400
 This has nothing to do with the expansion of Russia.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.840
 No you fool.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.160
 You fool for paying attention to current events.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.960
 Nothing none of that.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.680
 None of that.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.520
 What what the real scoop is.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.320
 Is that Vladimir Putin was pacing around in his palace his building his house.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.000
 I don't know where he lives.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.400
 He's walking around and he goes what are we going to do.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.080
 About all those adrenochrome processing factories in Ukraine.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.480
 And he's been fretting over this for years right.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.360
 He scratches his head.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.280
 He wakes up every night sweaty.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.440
 Only if I could destroy those adrenochrome factories.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.760
 But how.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.640
 I know I'll commit my entire military to going in and this whole war.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.120
 Is about shutting down adrenochrome factories.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.200
 Now if you don't understand what adrenochrome is.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.200
 It is this chemical that apparently you remove from the base of the skull of a terrified child.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.920
 And then you inject it into your eyeball.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.120
 Your eyeball.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.280
 And then you get high or something.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.520
 Here's the thing with the adrenochrome mythology.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.440
 It doesn't make much sense.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.360
 But you take the adrenochrome is a real chemical and it's like decaying adrenaline.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.840
 And you inject it and you either get you either live forever.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.440
 Or you get super high.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.560
 It's addictive.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.240
 It's the reason why Hillary Clinton is always walking around looking like a zombie most of the time.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.600
 Because she's addicted to adrenochrome.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.320
 Not because she's a 70 year old woman.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.600
 And what's so weird about it.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.720
 It was always set up as you would take a child.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.600
 You would scare him.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.480
 Apparently Halloween is the best time to get this adrenochrome.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.160
 You would scare a child.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.400
 And then you would suck out their adrenochrome with a needle.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.000
 And then you would turn it into this drug.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.240
 Right.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.520
 Or you would just inject it straight into your own eyeball.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.920
 Whatever.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.960
 Apparently there's always been a step missing.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.800
 It's not just child.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.560
 It's not just terrified child.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.160
 Hypodermic needle.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.360
 Your eyeball.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.960
 It's terrified child.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.720
 Massive industrial adrenochrome processing plant.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.640
 This was never part of the mythology.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.320
 I mean this was never part of the totally true stuff.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.440
 That you need these giant processing plants that have like just like smoke towers and like armed guards.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.800
 I'm assuming if you were kidnapping kids and taking them to the factory.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.200
 I think you'd want it to be fairly secured.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.720
 Also do you have to follow OSHA requirements when you're at a factory that has terrified children.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.320
 Like how does this work.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.560
 Like are the kids hooked up to these giant pumps.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.080
 Is it a fun factory.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.000
 Maybe there's like a balloon house in the middle of it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.720
 I don't know.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.960
 You can't keep a kid terrified 24 hours a day.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.400
 Eventually he'll get used to it.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.800
 So maybe they just terrify them a bit.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.760
 And drain them.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.600
 And then they get into the bouncy house after the kids have been scared to death.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.640
 They're like here you go.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.280
 Bouncing around.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.480
 Then you go in the ball pit.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.680
 And then some guards like nope.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.000
 Stop.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.320
 Stop.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.280
 I'm scaring you again.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.240
 Come on kids.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.440
 What a horrible existence for these poor fictional children.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.720
 So anyways.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.720
 That's the adrenochrome mythology.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.960
 Now they have these giant industrial plants.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.800
 Apparently these plants are all over the eastern.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.600
 Apparently just out of coincidence all of these plants are located on the border of Ukraine.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.560
 And Russia.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.800
 And every tactical part that Russia needs to invade is an adrenochrome plant.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.400
 Who would have thought that.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.600
 So Russia is pouring their troops in and sending their special forces into Ukraine.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.480
 Not to take it over.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.440
 Not to set up another public government or whatever.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.680
 No.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.360
 It's to destroy Hillary Clinton's adrenochrome factories.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.440
 So that's where we're at right now with the mythology.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.960
 Vladimir Putin.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.160
 Adrenochrome factories.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.680
 That's the reason behind the war.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.680
 In all this information we're getting from the very reputable website.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.560
 The best website named after a 1990s horror movie.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.520
 Dark Outpost.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.120
 Darkoutpost.com is always keeping us abreast of all of these disturbing allegations.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.160
 Apparently Spetsnaz Russian special forces are moving ahead of the advancing army.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.960
 And they're taking out these processing plants.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.320
 So far they've rescued 100 children.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.840
 They've rescued 100 children.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.880
 They're in these basements under.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.840
 There's no ball pit.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.240
 They didn't mention a ball pit or a bouncy house.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.760
 The special forces are going in.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.120
 They're rescuing these kids.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.760
 But see there's a bit of a conundrum going on.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.720
 Because you're rescuing these kids and some of them are from Estonia.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.000
 Some of them are from Russia.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.280
 Some of them are from Ukraine.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.120
 They're just visiting.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.280
 They just can walk back home after the torture.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.640
 They're like see you tomorrow.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.800
 But there's a bunch of American kids down there.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.560
 There's a bunch of American kids who are kidnapped.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.880
 And Vladimir Putin's like oh no what am I going to do with all of these American kids.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.880
 So Vladimir Putin called up President Donald Trump.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.240
 Who according to this storyline is still the president.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.400
 Joe Biden's like a hologram.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.080
 Or I think they kind of established that he's a hologram or a clone in this version.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.280
 In this version of events that is published every day.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.400
 There is a this guy.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.040
 Think about it.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.120
 Dude as ridiculous as all this sounds a man painted this on his van.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.160
 Right we can look at this and go that's really weird and kind of crass that people are taking

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.600
 this current war zone and turning it into conspiracy theory.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.760
 Who would believe this a guy does at least one guy does because he painted his van like that.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.880
 And again I thought he was just a one a single lunatic.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.120
 Darkoutpost.com has a huge reach.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.040
 This is a really big website in this community.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.240
 So they believe that Joe Biden is President Joe Biden is a hologram or a giant.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.560
 Or a giant hologram or clone.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.640
 I always I'm not really for sure on that.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.680
 Vladimir Putin calls up President Trump in Florida which is where the real White House is.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.520
 The non holographic one.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.920
 And he goes hey Trump I have all of these American kids and I don't know what to do with

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.720
 them because if I send them back to America Joe Biden is going to get them.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.600
 So can you ensure that you can take these kids.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.280
 And President Trump to his credit says yes if you want to send over if you want to send over

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.960
 a bunch of fictional children I will take care of them because Putin I know that you're really

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.600
 waging this whole war just to take out these adrenochrome factories that were built by

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.160
 Hillary Clinton back during whenever whenever mythical time that Hillary Clinton had enough

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.120
 power to do that.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.440
 That's where we're at right now if you've ever been concerned about

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.120
 fictional American children getting back home fret no longer.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.240
 Because they are currently headed out to Florida I guess I don't know.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.360
 At a certain point the mythology kind of breaks down.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.080
 Because if Joe Biden is just a hologram then why would you care if he got the kids.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.520
 What's a hologram going to do to a bunch of kids so he's still real I guess.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.600
 Anyways I always wonder if these people read their own information.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.800
 Like because so much of it stops making sense.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.320
 Technically this one never made sense right.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.040
 I don't know why you all of a sudden have to have these huge industrial factories.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.280
 It kind of takes away from that this is a secret drug only used by the elite.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.640
 If they need a city block if they need an entire city block to have this factory

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.960
 processing this stuff because people are working there right.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.160
 People are going in for job interviews and they're like yeah I really want to work in

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.040
 this factory.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.040
 What do you do and the guys like don't ask that question you're not getting on the job.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.880
 You're like oh and then you're working in the factory and you just see like this these huge

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.440
 vats of like red dust being like being processed and you're like huh I wonder what

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.520
 wonder what all of that stuff is.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.720
 And then you see like a bunch of little kids walking into a room and you're like uh I don't

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.880
 know I really don't know what's going on here.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.240
 They would all have to know.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.440
 You don't ever work at a Ford factory and go do we make cars or do we make toys or do

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.680
 we make lollipops like you know what you're making.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.080
 Young hemlock let's go ahead and Tashiki's the carpenter copter we're gonna leave behind

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.080
 the darkout post we're headed all the way out to Shanghai China.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.280
 I want to say up front I got most of my information from a website called pandayo.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.560
 That's so ridiculous I don't know why that's any more ridiculous than dead wrap radio.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.520
 I got most of my or really all my information from a website called pandayo.com and there's

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.960
 article written by Jeffrey W. so thanks Jeff this is really really entertaining story.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.600
 We're in Shanghai China we're walking down the street it's the fall of 1995 and we're just

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.640
 kind of grooving there we're sitting out on a bench now outside of a Chinese laboratory.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:18.240
 We're eating some popcorn and we're just waiting for the fireworks we're waiting for this laboratory

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.760
 story to get started. I guess we should probably be in the laboratory I don't know why we are

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.120
 narratively sitting outside because inside the laboratory there is a scientist going by the

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.760
 last name of Ling no first name given but his last name is Ling we're gonna call him Joe.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.000
 So Joe is walking around the laboratory in Shanghai and he's looking at all the experiments

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.320
 going on he like looks at a beaker and he's like exactly what I expected fluid and a beaker good

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.280
 job mark and mark nods and then he walks to the next laboratory and there's like a robot arm like

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:55.040
 picking up a ping pong ball and he's like all right dude great on that AI and the robot gives

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.800
 him a thumbs up he's like yeah this is the best place to work and as he's walking through this

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.080
 laboratory he's like you know I really enjoy working in this unnamed laboratory in Shanghai

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.080
 but my favorite thing I love to do is to go into my own laboratory I don't even know why

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.480
 he's doing the tour that's more for us than for him he goes into the tour and there's like a bunch

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.080
 of beakers sitting there and he's like ah just show your clear this is what I imagine a laboratory

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.040
 or science lab looks like they're just beakers everywhere and he walks in and all these beakers

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.320
 have different colors on them there's like a microscope with a little slide and stuff like

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.680
 that he's like oh yeah I'm at home in my laboratory what a good place to be and as he's talking he

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.560
 doesn't realize that a germ is flying around this is so ridiculous I've spent more time building this

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:48.400
 up here's the start of the story okay this guy named Ling accidentally swallows a germ at a

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.400
 laboratory so I don't know if they had really lack security I don't know if one germ can do this but

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:02.880
 he swallows a germ in a laboratory he actually feels the germ go down his throat and something

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:09.680
 starts going wrong with him he does quickly realize this one germ is more than just the average germ

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:17.440
 he's thirsty all of a sudden oh man so thirsty maybe that germ has something to do with this

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.840
 so he goes and he's like drinking water mmm go go go go go go go but he's still thirsty he can't

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.680
 really figure it out so then he goes to the company vending machine and get some of that Chinese milk

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.920
 that I saw in Transformers movie go go go go go go go go go go go go still not quenching his thirst

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:37.680
 and then as he's like looking for maybe like a Pepsi or Coca Cola he's walking past a room

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.400
 and he sees a scientist holding up a blood bag and they're like pouring it down the sink or something

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:50.400
 like that and he goes oh that's what I'm thirsty for I'm thirsty for blood but you know it's kind

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.120
 of hard to drink human blood if you guys have never tried it it's difficult but luckily he works at a

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.160
 research laboratory and they have tons of human blood around so one night he goes in there and

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.280
 he uses his key cart and he goes into where the they store all the blood and he starts drinking

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.440
 the blood out of the bags mmm this is so good this is what really quenched my thirst it wasn't a Pepsi

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:18.800
 it wasn't a coke it was human plasma that I needed and he begins doing that every night he goes into

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.440
 the laboratory he pretends to do regular science stuff he's like hey I need this blood they're like

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.520
 I oh I thought you were a germ scientist he's like yeah I want to see what happens if you put

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.720
 blood on a germ just quit asking questions and give me that blood he begins drinking the human blood

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.320
 he begins demanding it for more scientific experiments and then he runs out because they

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:45.040
 didn't have that much blood right so then he goes oh man I really need to drink more blood what other

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.160
 things in this laboratory can I drink so he's like looking at scientists and he's like oh no that

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.440
 scientist could probably beat me up and then he looks at another scientist and he goes I don't

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.280
 know she looks kind of squirrely she might be able to scratch my eyes out or something like that

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.480
 but then he is he's walking through the laboratory apparently there's like a rat

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:06.080
 place where they have all of these rats which is why it's called the rat place and at night he

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.280
 begins breaking in and killing the rats ripping them open with his teeth and squeezing them in

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.520
 like a gogurt drinking all that blood up but again this laboratory only has a fixed amount of rats

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.440
 you can imagine the scientist he's like oh no I have a big experiment to do today I don't want to

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.680
 get fired and then he goes in and all the rats are gone he's like oh no oh no what did I procrastinate

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.520
 why did I wait until the last day to do my science ah I'm totally gonna lose my job all the rats are

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.840
 gone all the human blood is gone nobody's suspecting anything's weird at this point right you would

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.440
 probably start to figure wait a second we've everything in this laboratory that has blood in

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.040
 it is gone but it must not be something we haven't done an inventory of all of our germs

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.640
 maybe a germ's missing we don't know but joe ling is still walking around drinking all this blood

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:04.080
 but now he's out of rat blood he's out of human blood so he starts to go insane he's sitting

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.600
 the argument could be made he went insane the second he started drinking human blood

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:15.760
 but now he's truly going insane so at night instead of breaking the laboratory and drinking blood

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:22.160
 he's walking through the streets of shanghai and attacking women clip clip clip clip high heels making

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:28.320
 the sound against a cobblestone street apparently there's streets in shanghai china like the 1800s

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:35.120
 of england click click click click and then behind them and the women turn around in the darkness and

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:41.360
 go what was that and then they see a scientist they see a scientist standing there in a blood soaked

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.440
 laboratory coat and she's like oh it's a scientist there's nothing to be scared of then click click

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:52.080
 click and she's walking but then joe attacks her and rips her throat open and drinks all of her blood

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.680
 and then goes to work the next day he's not insane so we were like oh we want to suspect this guy

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:04.400
 he's not insane but it's only because he just had some fresh blood so as night continues to descend

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.040
 he once again starts to go insane he has to go drink more blood and this crime spree is going on

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.440
 for a while and the authorities in shanghai are like oh dude this totally sucks we keep

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.840
 him all these women with their throats ripped open this is really bad for the tourist industry

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:25.120
 and for those women we should find out who's doing this so the police begin to walk through the area

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.840
 they're trying to find this killer and joe is continuing to stalk and kill these women the police

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.360
 aren't catching them and the media is like you have to find this serial killer and they're people

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.240
 like we're afraid to go out at night and there is a scientist in the laboratory who's really happy

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.040
 and constantly covered in blood and he's like i don't know i'm not a suspect and all this is going

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.360
 on and then eventually one night a woman's walking through the park clip clip clip clip

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:56.240
 little high heels on the cobblestone park and then behind the tree it's joe ling and then

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.360
 like a couple bushes our police officers all things have converged at this point

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.040
 he jumps out from behind the tree to attack the women the police jump out of the bushes to attack

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:16.880
 joe they open fire joe ling turns around and this huge fight breaks out joe begins gutting

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.440
 these police officers in the park they thought they could just shoot this guy they were sorely

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:28.640
 mistaken but then but then a sniper from a building does shoot him and kills him so the sniper was

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.120
 correct those two police officers with revolvers they were sorely mistaken they were actually

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:40.160
 killed a sniper who was watching from above blows this vampire's brains out kills him

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:46.560
 little germ little germ rolls out of his stomach i'll get you next time little germ high heels on

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:52.000
 a cobblestone street the cops now know that it's joe ling who's been attacking these women

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.600
 so now they want to figure out why why is this respected scientist why is this respected scientist

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:03.520
 in a blood-soaked laboratory coat attacking these women so they go back to his house and they find

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:09.440
 his diary luckily he kept a diary i don't know of any adult man who keeps a diary outside of

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.240
 like a journal maybe you're on a submarine you have to write stuff like fought an octopus off today

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:20.080
 it was a good day and i know like like on boats they keep journals watch out iceberg

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:26.240
 exclamation point exclamation point exclamation point but most civilians don't keep diaries maybe

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.960
 scientists too i don't know but anyways this guy does like a pink fuzzy blood-soaked diary with a

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.000
 little key you can't open it without the key and they just break the lock and they start reading it

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.080
 and they said that it starts off fairly sane right it's like today i became a scientist i hope this

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.720
 works out and then like he writes about finding a new beaker walking down the street is like this

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.800
 is my favorite beaker ever and then as they're going through it it's like today i swallowed a germ

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:58.240
 uh-oh this guy would even write in this diary but what's so weird about this is as the diary goes

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:04.480
 on it becomes more and more insane there it becomes the ramblings of a madman which he was he was

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.600
 killing women in the street this is an interesting cultural thing too because remember this whole

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.120
 story takes place in china and one thing they notice this is really interesting one thing they

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:22.960
 notice as they're flipping through the diary the language changes it starts off in chinese

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.960
 because he's chinese this story takes place in chinghai but as he progressively gets more and

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:34.720
 more insane and the vampirism takes more charge of his body the writing turns to hebrou

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:44.560
 that's weird i i think that's one of the most curious details about the story like i wonder if

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:50.960
 in the chinese culture the hebrou language is considered like super weird right super weird

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.640
 super esoteric uh that's just an interesting detail i don't think i've come across that before

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.760
 we've come across the stories of people going crazy in the diary becoming more and more rambling

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.240
 but this one it becomes more and more rambling and then they turn a page and it's like

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:13.120
 mishugana it's like in straight hebrou so then i guess i guess the cops are like we don't know what

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.000
 this says these are truly the scribbles of a madman but apparently they got someone who could speak

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.440
 hebrou and then the story continues as he became a vampire i don't know if they're and i don't know

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:31.520
 if they're saying he became jewish or if he just was so insane he could only speak hebrou or that

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:38.320
 this that hebrou is like this language of magic and like this forbidden knowledge like the kabbalah

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.400
 type stuff i don't know really interesting cultural shift i haven't seen that before where the language

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:50.400
 changes let alone changes into hebrou this is a story a long time ago actually was a long time

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:56.720
 ago feels like forever ago but maybe a couple weeks ago we covered the zombie story of shengdu

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:02.960
 which is a town in china that had a zombie uprising jeffrey w wrote an article that was

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:08.240
 basically the five most famous urban legends in china and this is one of them now he was able to

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.960
 find some stuff that may have backed up the story of the zombie of shengdu specifically that a case

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.920
 of rabies may have gone around town that a man got rabies and then he bit a pig and gave the pig

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.040
 rabies and then the family killed the pig and ate it and then the family got rabies and he goes

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.840
 that might have been the start of the zombie story he says i'm not able to find anything that could

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:37.920
 point to the beginning of this urban legend but it's so popular oddly enough shanghai has this

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:44.560
 obsession the city itself has this obsession with vampires pre-pandemic the stuff has stopped

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:50.880
 recently but i'm sure it'll come back pre-pandemic they had a lot of vampire tours of shanghai they

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.320
 had vampire parties in shanghai and you go jason that's kind of normal like a lot of big cities

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.920
 will have stuff like that yeah maybe but this i mean you'll have big costume parties and stuff

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:09.120
 like this but this city is vampire central in china they're very very vampiric i don't i can't

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.480
 think of another word but they do seem to have an obsession with vampires and you don't see that in

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.840
 other provinces or other towns in china at least that i could see so whatever the origin for the

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:27.280
 story was the city of shanghai has a long history of really liking the vampire mythos and they have

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.840
 these when i say vampire parties i'm not saying a couple buddies down at the local bar dressing

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.240
 up from walmart costumes like there are these elaborate vampire parties that were happening

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.680
 pre-pandemic so they may be coming back now it's interesting because on one hand the vampire myth

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:47.120
 is so old right you can look at almost any culture of having a blood-sucking fiend

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:54.720
 but this story has a lot of the hallmarks of the western european vampire but some of them

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.720
 not right there were this guy could be killed with a bullet to the brain he was able to go out into the

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:05.280
 sun the fact that the writing changed to hebru does link it not to a western european vampire

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:11.440
 but definitely a middle east vampire right so these old legends it's this just kind of combination

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:19.360
 of myths with a shanghai spin on it right coming out of modern age this is 1995 it's starts off as a

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.680
 virus out of a laboratory part of me when i was reading this i thought it might be viral marketing

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.240
 for that new marvel movie morbius or sony movie whoever in the world's making it but

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.560
 it's kind of the same thing a guy accidentally becomes a vampire and then he becomes superhero

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.240
 but yeah it's it has like these different cultural influences on it but the vampire itself is such an

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:44.640
 old story you find it all over the place we do tend to look at the western european vampire as kind

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.920
 of being the gold standard or the blood red standard of vampires that's the most common one

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.360
 but we can't forget that these creatures have existed throughout all cultures and

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:03.200
 i think the reason why they are is because these creatures exist in some form now of course i would

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.400
 love it if bubby the vampire slayer and angel was real and like i could run up and stab people with

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.960
 wooden stakes and they would disappear they wouldn't leave a body that i'd have to dispose of later

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.480
 like if you had to fight supernatural vampires it would be dope assuming i wasn't killed immediately

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.840
 but i i don't know i don't think that's true but the idea of a blood-sucking fiend

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:32.160
 it's just too universal for it to be made up but because we focus on the movie versions of it

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.120
 one a lot of people just dismiss these legends i've talked before on podcasts

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:44.080
 that i think a war would be the perfect place for a vampire to hunt because you're not doing

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:50.560
 autopsy in a war zone but there's another killing ground that is just as fertile for the vampire

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.120
 we'll wrap the episode up like this i was talking to a friend of mine at work

00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:00.080
 we were talking about mexican and south american cryptids

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.120
 and she told me a story that she had heard as a young girl

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:12.480
 she said there was a family that was trying to cross the border from Mexico into the united

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.000
 states now they knew they couldn't do it legally they weren't going to be able to go through that

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.600
 process because she had a mom and a dad older brother younger sister and they were going to

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.240
 cross the border somewhere between Mexico and the united states and try to find a better life

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:36.560
 up north but as they made their way through the rugged countryside the father realized

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:46.560
 something was following him one morning the family woke up and the father was dead

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:53.040
 he was pale with a look of fear spread across this face

00:27:53.040 --> 00:28:00.640
 they don't know how he died but it seemed like all the blood was drained from his body

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:10.080
 the family continues the next morning when they wake up the older brother is dead

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:19.760
 pale a look of terror on his face the mother and the daughter continue to make their way across

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:28.080
 the hostile landscape that separates mexico and the united states and one morning a young girl

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.880
 crosses into this country alone

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:39.680
 when she is picked up by authorities she tells them the tale

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:46.480
 i didn't leave alone i left with my family but something out there was hunting us

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:53.040
 and it picked us off one by one i'm the only one left

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.360
 so whether it's the story of a vampire hunting lonely women walking down darkened streets

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:08.720
 in the massive city of shanghai or if it's a creature stalking a family searching for a better

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.320
 life as they march across the desolate landscape that separates mexico and the united states

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.680
 remember this there's nothing romantic about the vampire

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.760
 it doesn't live in a dark castle watching the machinations of humanity pass it by

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:37.680
 no it's a predator it's a blood-soaked maniac that hunts down the lonely the lost the desperate

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:45.920
 and takes them drinks their blood and discards them like trash

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.800
 the vampire is nothing to be traveled with it is one of the few cryptids

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:58.720
 that is recognized around the world every culture has a version of this creature

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:08.320
 so just remember that the next time the sun sets the next time the world is draped in darkness

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:16.560
 that there is a creature out there that has existed in human stories for thousands of years

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.920
 across the world countless civilizations have told the story of a blood-sucking fiend

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:33.280
 just remember that out there they very well may be a creature who is designed to do one thing

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.800
 to kill humans to kill you

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.520
