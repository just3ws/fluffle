 As Russian special forces move through Ukraine, we find out what their true targets are.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,840
 Hillary Clinton's Adrenaline Chrome factories.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,160
 And then we travel to China to meet a scientist who one day accidentally swallowed a germ.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,440
 But this wasn't any normal germ. It was a germ that turned him into a bloodthirsty vampire.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:06,160
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,240
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,760
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so don't don't swallow any germs yet.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,840
 First off let's go ahead and welcome in one of our Thanksgiving livestream contributors.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,160
 Everyone give it up for young Hemlock.

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,160
 Give him a big round of applause as he's summer salting into Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,360
 Young Hemlock you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
 If you guys can't support the show financially I totally understand.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,320
 Just help spread the word about the show.

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,960
 Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your enemies.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,320
 As you're crushing them beneath your heel listen to Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,280
 Don't kill them because otherwise they won't listen to it.

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,560
 But those are also great ways to help the show grow.

28
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,280
 Now young Hemlock I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason jet.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,520
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,840
 And we are flying on out to the very subject that no one wants to hear about.

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
 But some crazy things are going on.

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
 Young Hemlock take us all the way out to Ukraine.

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,400
 The reason why we're flying out to Ukraine is right now.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
 If you haven't been to the newspaper in the past couple of weeks.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,080
 Russia has invaded Ukraine.

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,520
 They've been there for a couple of weeks.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
 They invaded on Christian's birthday.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800
 The weirdest of all.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,760
 You know what the thing is is like originally I said because we didn't cover the election.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,040
 We don't do politics.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,680
 We really didn't cover COVID either like early on.

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,080
 I said you know what people hear about this all the time.

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,800
 The last thing they want to do is turn on a conspiracy theory podcast.

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
 And hear about COVID so we never really touched that issue right.

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
 We every show often.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,440
 And I was planning on taking the same tact and probably going forward will.

47
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
 With the war in Ukraine.

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
 Because you hear about it all the time.

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
 It's all over your Facebook feed.

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
 It's all over the news.

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
 You want a place to get away from it.

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,600
 However.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,680
 I can't turn weird stuff like this down man.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,480
 This stuff is just showing up on the internet.

55
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,360
 I can't turn it down.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,320
 I actually saw a skitso van.

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,920
 I saw a photo of a skitso van.

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
 Those are those vans with all the paintings on it.

59
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,080
 Not like the cool barbarian slaying the dragon and holding the busty winch.

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
 No it's like stuff on the side of the van that says Stephen King killed John Lennon.

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,520
 Stuff like that.

62
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,080
 I saw a skitso van about the war in Ukraine.

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,080
 And it said Spetsnaz frees captured kids.

64
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,800
 I was like I don't understand what those words mean individually.

65
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,320
 But what in the world Spetsnaz is Russia's special forces.

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,680
 And I saw that on the side of the car.

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
 No context.

68
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,160
 No context.

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,640
 And I was like hmm I wonder if that'll pop up on my radar.

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
 And it did because I look up conspiracy theories all the time.

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,400
 This is apparently what is truly going on.

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,800
 The lame stream media won't tell you about this.

73
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,360
 Spetsnaz which is Russian special forces are currently moving through the country of Ukraine.

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
 And this has nothing to do with geopolitics.

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,400
 This has nothing to do with the expansion of Russia.

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
 No you fool.

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,160
 You fool for paying attention to current events.

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,960
 Nothing none of that.

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,680
 None of that.

80
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,520
 What what the real scoop is.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,320
 Is that Vladimir Putin was pacing around in his palace his building his house.

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
 I don't know where he lives.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,400
 He's walking around and he goes what are we going to do.

84
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,080
 About all those adrenochrome processing factories in Ukraine.

85
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,480
 And he's been fretting over this for years right.

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360
 He scratches his head.

87
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
 He wakes up every night sweaty.

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,440
 Only if I could destroy those adrenochrome factories.

89
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,760
 But how.

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,640
 I know I'll commit my entire military to going in and this whole war.

91
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,120
 Is about shutting down adrenochrome factories.

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,200
 Now if you don't understand what adrenochrome is.

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,200
 It is this chemical that apparently you remove from the base of the skull of a terrified child.

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,920
 And then you inject it into your eyeball.

95
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,120
 Your eyeball.

96
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,280
 And then you get high or something.

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,520
 Here's the thing with the adrenochrome mythology.

98
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
 It doesn't make much sense.

99
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,360
 But you take the adrenochrome is a real chemical and it's like decaying adrenaline.

100
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
 And you inject it and you either get you either live forever.

101
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,440
 Or you get super high.

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,560
 It's addictive.

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,240
 It's the reason why Hillary Clinton is always walking around looking like a zombie most of the time.

104
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,600
 Because she's addicted to adrenochrome.

105
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,320
 Not because she's a 70 year old woman.

106
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,600
 And what's so weird about it.

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,720
 It was always set up as you would take a child.

108
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,600
 You would scare him.

109
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,480
 Apparently Halloween is the best time to get this adrenochrome.

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,160
 You would scare a child.

111
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
 And then you would suck out their adrenochrome with a needle.

112
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
 And then you would turn it into this drug.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,240
 Right.

114
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,520
 Or you would just inject it straight into your own eyeball.

115
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:39,920
 Whatever.

116
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,960
 Apparently there's always been a step missing.

117
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,800
 It's not just child.

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
 It's not just terrified child.

119
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
 Hypodermic needle.

120
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,360
 Your eyeball.

121
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,960
 It's terrified child.

122
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,720
 Massive industrial adrenochrome processing plant.

123
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,640
 This was never part of the mythology.

124
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,320
 I mean this was never part of the totally true stuff.

125
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,440
 That you need these giant processing plants that have like just like smoke towers and like armed guards.

126
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,800
 I'm assuming if you were kidnapping kids and taking them to the factory.

127
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,200
 I think you'd want it to be fairly secured.

128
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,720
 Also do you have to follow OSHA requirements when you're at a factory that has terrified children.

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,320
 Like how does this work.

130
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,560
 Like are the kids hooked up to these giant pumps.

131
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
 Is it a fun factory.

132
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
 Maybe there's like a balloon house in the middle of it.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,720
 I don't know.

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
 You can't keep a kid terrified 24 hours a day.

135
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
 Eventually he'll get used to it.

136
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
 So maybe they just terrify them a bit.

137
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,760
 And drain them.

138
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,600
 And then they get into the bouncy house after the kids have been scared to death.

139
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,640
 They're like here you go.

140
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,280
 Bouncing around.

141
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,480
 Then you go in the ball pit.

142
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,680
 And then some guards like nope.

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,000
 Stop.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,320
 Stop.

145
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,280
 I'm scaring you again.

146
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,240
 Come on kids.

147
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,440
 What a horrible existence for these poor fictional children.

148
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
 So anyways.

149
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
 That's the adrenochrome mythology.

150
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
 Now they have these giant industrial plants.

151
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,800
 Apparently these plants are all over the eastern.

152
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,600
 Apparently just out of coincidence all of these plants are located on the border of Ukraine.

153
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,560
 And Russia.

154
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
 And every tactical part that Russia needs to invade is an adrenochrome plant.

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
 Who would have thought that.

156
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,600
 So Russia is pouring their troops in and sending their special forces into Ukraine.

157
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
 Not to take it over.

158
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,440
 Not to set up another public government or whatever.

159
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:19,680
 No.

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
 It's to destroy Hillary Clinton's adrenochrome factories.

161
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,440
 So that's where we're at right now with the mythology.

162
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
 Vladimir Putin.

163
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
 Adrenochrome factories.

164
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,680
 That's the reason behind the war.

165
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,680
 In all this information we're getting from the very reputable website.

166
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
 The best website named after a 1990s horror movie.

167
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
 Dark Outpost.

168
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,120
 Darkoutpost.com is always keeping us abreast of all of these disturbing allegations.

169
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,160
 Apparently Spetsnaz Russian special forces are moving ahead of the advancing army.

170
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,960
 And they're taking out these processing plants.

171
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,320
 So far they've rescued 100 children.

172
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,840
 They've rescued 100 children.

173
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,880
 They're in these basements under.

174
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,840
 There's no ball pit.

175
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
 They didn't mention a ball pit or a bouncy house.

176
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,760
 The special forces are going in.

177
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,120
 They're rescuing these kids.

178
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,760
 But see there's a bit of a conundrum going on.

179
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,720
 Because you're rescuing these kids and some of them are from Estonia.

180
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,000
 Some of them are from Russia.

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,280
 Some of them are from Ukraine.

182
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,120
 They're just visiting.

183
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
 They just can walk back home after the torture.

184
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,640
 They're like see you tomorrow.

185
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,800
 But there's a bunch of American kids down there.

186
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
 There's a bunch of American kids who are kidnapped.

187
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,880
 And Vladimir Putin's like oh no what am I going to do with all of these American kids.

188
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,880
 So Vladimir Putin called up President Donald Trump.

189
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,240
 Who according to this storyline is still the president.

190
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,400
 Joe Biden's like a hologram.

191
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,080
 Or I think they kind of established that he's a hologram or a clone in this version.

192
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,280
 In this version of events that is published every day.

193
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,400
 There is a this guy.

194
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,040
 Think about it.

195
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,120
 Dude as ridiculous as all this sounds a man painted this on his van.

196
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,160
 Right we can look at this and go that's really weird and kind of crass that people are taking

197
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,600
 this current war zone and turning it into conspiracy theory.

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,760
 Who would believe this a guy does at least one guy does because he painted his van like that.

199
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,880
 And again I thought he was just a one a single lunatic.

200
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
 Darkoutpost.com has a huge reach.

201
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
 This is a really big website in this community.

202
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,240
 So they believe that Joe Biden is President Joe Biden is a hologram or a giant.

203
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
 Or a giant hologram or clone.

204
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
 I always I'm not really for sure on that.

205
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,680
 Vladimir Putin calls up President Trump in Florida which is where the real White House is.

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,520
 The non holographic one.

207
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,920
 And he goes hey Trump I have all of these American kids and I don't know what to do with

208
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,720
 them because if I send them back to America Joe Biden is going to get them.

209
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,600
 So can you ensure that you can take these kids.

210
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,280
 And President Trump to his credit says yes if you want to send over if you want to send over

211
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,960
 a bunch of fictional children I will take care of them because Putin I know that you're really

212
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,600
 waging this whole war just to take out these adrenochrome factories that were built by

213
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,160
 Hillary Clinton back during whenever whenever mythical time that Hillary Clinton had enough

214
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,120
 power to do that.

215
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,440
 That's where we're at right now if you've ever been concerned about

216
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,120
 fictional American children getting back home fret no longer.

217
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
 Because they are currently headed out to Florida I guess I don't know.

218
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,360
 At a certain point the mythology kind of breaks down.

219
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,080
 Because if Joe Biden is just a hologram then why would you care if he got the kids.

220
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,520
 What's a hologram going to do to a bunch of kids so he's still real I guess.

221
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,600
 Anyways I always wonder if these people read their own information.

222
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
 Like because so much of it stops making sense.

223
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,320
 Technically this one never made sense right.

224
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,040
 I don't know why you all of a sudden have to have these huge industrial factories.

225
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,280
 It kind of takes away from that this is a secret drug only used by the elite.

226
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,640
 If they need a city block if they need an entire city block to have this factory

227
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,960
 processing this stuff because people are working there right.

228
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,160
 People are going in for job interviews and they're like yeah I really want to work in

229
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,040
 this factory.

230
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,040
 What do you do and the guys like don't ask that question you're not getting on the job.

231
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,880
 You're like oh and then you're working in the factory and you just see like this these huge

232
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,440
 vats of like red dust being like being processed and you're like huh I wonder what

233
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,520
 wonder what all of that stuff is.

234
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,720
 And then you see like a bunch of little kids walking into a room and you're like uh I don't

235
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
 know I really don't know what's going on here.

236
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
 They would all have to know.

237
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,440
 You don't ever work at a Ford factory and go do we make cars or do we make toys or do

238
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
 we make lollipops like you know what you're making.

239
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,080
 Young hemlock let's go ahead and Tashiki's the carpenter copter we're gonna leave behind

240
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,080
 the darkout post we're headed all the way out to Shanghai China.

241
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,280
 I want to say up front I got most of my information from a website called pandayo.

242
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,560
 That's so ridiculous I don't know why that's any more ridiculous than dead wrap radio.

243
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,520
 I got most of my or really all my information from a website called pandayo.com and there's

244
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,960
 article written by Jeffrey W. so thanks Jeff this is really really entertaining story.

245
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,600
 We're in Shanghai China we're walking down the street it's the fall of 1995 and we're just

246
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,640
 kind of grooving there we're sitting out on a bench now outside of a Chinese laboratory.

247
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,240
 We're eating some popcorn and we're just waiting for the fireworks we're waiting for this laboratory

248
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,760
 story to get started. I guess we should probably be in the laboratory I don't know why we are

249
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,120
 narratively sitting outside because inside the laboratory there is a scientist going by the

250
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,760
 last name of Ling no first name given but his last name is Ling we're gonna call him Joe.

251
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,000
 So Joe is walking around the laboratory in Shanghai and he's looking at all the experiments

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,320
 going on he like looks at a beaker and he's like exactly what I expected fluid and a beaker good

253
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,280
 job mark and mark nods and then he walks to the next laboratory and there's like a robot arm like

254
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,040
 picking up a ping pong ball and he's like all right dude great on that AI and the robot gives

255
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,800
 him a thumbs up he's like yeah this is the best place to work and as he's walking through this

256
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,080
 laboratory he's like you know I really enjoy working in this unnamed laboratory in Shanghai

257
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,080
 but my favorite thing I love to do is to go into my own laboratory I don't even know why

258
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,480
 he's doing the tour that's more for us than for him he goes into the tour and there's like a bunch

259
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,080
 of beakers sitting there and he's like ah just show your clear this is what I imagine a laboratory

260
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,040
 or science lab looks like they're just beakers everywhere and he walks in and all these beakers

261
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,320
 have different colors on them there's like a microscope with a little slide and stuff like

262
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,680
 that he's like oh yeah I'm at home in my laboratory what a good place to be and as he's talking he

263
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,560
 doesn't realize that a germ is flying around this is so ridiculous I've spent more time building this

264
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:48,400
 up here's the start of the story okay this guy named Ling accidentally swallows a germ at a

265
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,400
 laboratory so I don't know if they had really lack security I don't know if one germ can do this but

266
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:02,880
 he swallows a germ in a laboratory he actually feels the germ go down his throat and something

267
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,680
 starts going wrong with him he does quickly realize this one germ is more than just the average germ

268
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,440
 he's thirsty all of a sudden oh man so thirsty maybe that germ has something to do with this

269
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,840
 so he goes and he's like drinking water mmm go go go go go go go but he's still thirsty he can't

270
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,680
 really figure it out so then he goes to the company vending machine and get some of that Chinese milk

271
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,920
 that I saw in Transformers movie go go go go go go go go go go go go still not quenching his thirst

272
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,680
 and then as he's like looking for maybe like a Pepsi or Coca Cola he's walking past a room

273
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,400
 and he sees a scientist holding up a blood bag and they're like pouring it down the sink or something

274
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:50,400
 like that and he goes oh that's what I'm thirsty for I'm thirsty for blood but you know it's kind

275
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,120
 of hard to drink human blood if you guys have never tried it it's difficult but luckily he works at a

276
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,160
 research laboratory and they have tons of human blood around so one night he goes in there and

277
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,280
 he uses his key cart and he goes into where the they store all the blood and he starts drinking

278
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,440
 the blood out of the bags mmm this is so good this is what really quenched my thirst it wasn't a Pepsi

279
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,800
 it wasn't a coke it was human plasma that I needed and he begins doing that every night he goes into

280
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,440
 the laboratory he pretends to do regular science stuff he's like hey I need this blood they're like

281
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,520
 I oh I thought you were a germ scientist he's like yeah I want to see what happens if you put

282
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,720
 blood on a germ just quit asking questions and give me that blood he begins drinking the human blood

283
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,320
 he begins demanding it for more scientific experiments and then he runs out because they

284
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,040
 didn't have that much blood right so then he goes oh man I really need to drink more blood what other

285
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,160
 things in this laboratory can I drink so he's like looking at scientists and he's like oh no that

286
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,440
 scientist could probably beat me up and then he looks at another scientist and he goes I don't

287
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,280
 know she looks kind of squirrely she might be able to scratch my eyes out or something like that

288
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,480
 but then he is he's walking through the laboratory apparently there's like a rat

289
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,080
 place where they have all of these rats which is why it's called the rat place and at night he

290
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,280
 begins breaking in and killing the rats ripping them open with his teeth and squeezing them in

291
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,520
 like a gogurt drinking all that blood up but again this laboratory only has a fixed amount of rats

292
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,440
 you can imagine the scientist he's like oh no I have a big experiment to do today I don't want to

293
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,680
 get fired and then he goes in and all the rats are gone he's like oh no oh no what did I procrastinate

294
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,520
 why did I wait until the last day to do my science ah I'm totally gonna lose my job all the rats are

295
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,840
 gone all the human blood is gone nobody's suspecting anything's weird at this point right you would

296
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,440
 probably start to figure wait a second we've everything in this laboratory that has blood in

297
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,040
 it is gone but it must not be something we haven't done an inventory of all of our germs

298
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,640
 maybe a germ's missing we don't know but joe ling is still walking around drinking all this blood

299
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,080
 but now he's out of rat blood he's out of human blood so he starts to go insane he's sitting

300
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,600
 the argument could be made he went insane the second he started drinking human blood

301
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,760
 but now he's truly going insane so at night instead of breaking the laboratory and drinking blood

302
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,160
 he's walking through the streets of shanghai and attacking women clip clip clip clip high heels making

303
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,320
 the sound against a cobblestone street apparently there's streets in shanghai china like the 1800s

304
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:35,120
 of england click click click click and then behind them and the women turn around in the darkness and

305
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,360
 go what was that and then they see a scientist they see a scientist standing there in a blood soaked

306
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,440
 laboratory coat and she's like oh it's a scientist there's nothing to be scared of then click click

307
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,080
 click and she's walking but then joe attacks her and rips her throat open and drinks all of her blood

308
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,680
 and then goes to work the next day he's not insane so we were like oh we want to suspect this guy

309
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,400
 he's not insane but it's only because he just had some fresh blood so as night continues to descend

310
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,040
 he once again starts to go insane he has to go drink more blood and this crime spree is going on

311
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,440
 for a while and the authorities in shanghai are like oh dude this totally sucks we keep

312
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,840
 him all these women with their throats ripped open this is really bad for the tourist industry

313
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:25,120
 and for those women we should find out who's doing this so the police begin to walk through the area

314
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,840
 they're trying to find this killer and joe is continuing to stalk and kill these women the police

315
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,360
 aren't catching them and the media is like you have to find this serial killer and they're people

316
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,240
 like we're afraid to go out at night and there is a scientist in the laboratory who's really happy

317
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,040
 and constantly covered in blood and he's like i don't know i'm not a suspect and all this is going

318
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,360
 on and then eventually one night a woman's walking through the park clip clip clip clip

319
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,240
 little high heels on the cobblestone park and then behind the tree it's joe ling and then

320
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,360
 like a couple bushes our police officers all things have converged at this point

321
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,040
 he jumps out from behind the tree to attack the women the police jump out of the bushes to attack

322
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:16,880
 joe they open fire joe ling turns around and this huge fight breaks out joe begins gutting

323
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,440
 these police officers in the park they thought they could just shoot this guy they were sorely

324
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,640
 mistaken but then but then a sniper from a building does shoot him and kills him so the sniper was

325
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,120
 correct those two police officers with revolvers they were sorely mistaken they were actually

326
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,160
 killed a sniper who was watching from above blows this vampire's brains out kills him

327
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,560
 little germ little germ rolls out of his stomach i'll get you next time little germ high heels on

328
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,000
 a cobblestone street the cops now know that it's joe ling who's been attacking these women

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,600
 so now they want to figure out why why is this respected scientist why is this respected scientist

330
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,520
 in a blood-soaked laboratory coat attacking these women so they go back to his house and they find

331
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,440
 his diary luckily he kept a diary i don't know of any adult man who keeps a diary outside of

332
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,240
 like a journal maybe you're on a submarine you have to write stuff like fought an octopus off today

333
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,080
 it was a good day and i know like like on boats they keep journals watch out iceberg

334
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,240
 exclamation point exclamation point exclamation point but most civilians don't keep diaries maybe

335
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,960
 scientists too i don't know but anyways this guy does like a pink fuzzy blood-soaked diary with a

336
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,000
 little key you can't open it without the key and they just break the lock and they start reading it

337
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,080
 and they said that it starts off fairly sane right it's like today i became a scientist i hope this

338
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,720
 works out and then like he writes about finding a new beaker walking down the street is like this

339
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,800
 is my favorite beaker ever and then as they're going through it it's like today i swallowed a germ

340
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:58,240
 uh-oh this guy would even write in this diary but what's so weird about this is as the diary goes

341
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,480
 on it becomes more and more insane there it becomes the ramblings of a madman which he was he was

342
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,600
 killing women in the street this is an interesting cultural thing too because remember this whole

343
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,120
 story takes place in china and one thing they notice this is really interesting one thing they

344
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,960
 notice as they're flipping through the diary the language changes it starts off in chinese

345
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,960
 because he's chinese this story takes place in chinghai but as he progressively gets more and

346
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:34,720
 more insane and the vampirism takes more charge of his body the writing turns to hebrou

347
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:44,560
 that's weird i i think that's one of the most curious details about the story like i wonder if

348
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,960
 in the chinese culture the hebrou language is considered like super weird right super weird

349
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,640
 super esoteric uh that's just an interesting detail i don't think i've come across that before

350
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,760
 we've come across the stories of people going crazy in the diary becoming more and more rambling

351
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,240
 but this one it becomes more and more rambling and then they turn a page and it's like

352
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,120
 mishugana it's like in straight hebrou so then i guess i guess the cops are like we don't know what

353
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,000
 this says these are truly the scribbles of a madman but apparently they got someone who could speak

354
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,440
 hebrou and then the story continues as he became a vampire i don't know if they're and i don't know

355
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:31,520
 if they're saying he became jewish or if he just was so insane he could only speak hebrou or that

356
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,320
 this that hebrou is like this language of magic and like this forbidden knowledge like the kabbalah

357
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,400
 type stuff i don't know really interesting cultural shift i haven't seen that before where the language

358
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,400
 changes let alone changes into hebrou this is a story a long time ago actually was a long time

359
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,720
 ago feels like forever ago but maybe a couple weeks ago we covered the zombie story of shengdu

360
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,960
 which is a town in china that had a zombie uprising jeffrey w wrote an article that was

361
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,240
 basically the five most famous urban legends in china and this is one of them now he was able to

362
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,960
 find some stuff that may have backed up the story of the zombie of shengdu specifically that a case

363
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,920
 of rabies may have gone around town that a man got rabies and then he bit a pig and gave the pig

364
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,040
 rabies and then the family killed the pig and ate it and then the family got rabies and he goes

365
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,840
 that might have been the start of the zombie story he says i'm not able to find anything that could

366
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:37,920
 point to the beginning of this urban legend but it's so popular oddly enough shanghai has this

367
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,560
 obsession the city itself has this obsession with vampires pre-pandemic the stuff has stopped

368
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,880
 recently but i'm sure it'll come back pre-pandemic they had a lot of vampire tours of shanghai they

369
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,320
 had vampire parties in shanghai and you go jason that's kind of normal like a lot of big cities

370
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,920
 will have stuff like that yeah maybe but this i mean you'll have big costume parties and stuff

371
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:09,120
 like this but this city is vampire central in china they're very very vampiric i don't i can't

372
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,480
 think of another word but they do seem to have an obsession with vampires and you don't see that in

373
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,840
 other provinces or other towns in china at least that i could see so whatever the origin for the

374
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:27,280
 story was the city of shanghai has a long history of really liking the vampire mythos and they have

375
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,840
 these when i say vampire parties i'm not saying a couple buddies down at the local bar dressing

376
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,240
 up from walmart costumes like there are these elaborate vampire parties that were happening

377
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,680
 pre-pandemic so they may be coming back now it's interesting because on one hand the vampire myth

378
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,120
 is so old right you can look at almost any culture of having a blood-sucking fiend

379
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,720
 but this story has a lot of the hallmarks of the western european vampire but some of them

380
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,720
 not right there were this guy could be killed with a bullet to the brain he was able to go out into the

381
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,280
 sun the fact that the writing changed to hebru does link it not to a western european vampire

382
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,440
 but definitely a middle east vampire right so these old legends it's this just kind of combination

383
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:19,360
 of myths with a shanghai spin on it right coming out of modern age this is 1995 it's starts off as a

384
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,680
 virus out of a laboratory part of me when i was reading this i thought it might be viral marketing

385
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,240
 for that new marvel movie morbius or sony movie whoever in the world's making it but

386
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,560
 it's kind of the same thing a guy accidentally becomes a vampire and then he becomes superhero

387
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,240
 but yeah it's it has like these different cultural influences on it but the vampire itself is such an

388
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,640
 old story you find it all over the place we do tend to look at the western european vampire as kind

389
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,920
 of being the gold standard or the blood red standard of vampires that's the most common one

390
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,360
 but we can't forget that these creatures have existed throughout all cultures and

391
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:03,200
 i think the reason why they are is because these creatures exist in some form now of course i would

392
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,400
 love it if bubby the vampire slayer and angel was real and like i could run up and stab people with

393
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,960
 wooden stakes and they would disappear they wouldn't leave a body that i'd have to dispose of later

394
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,480
 like if you had to fight supernatural vampires it would be dope assuming i wasn't killed immediately

395
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,840
 but i i don't know i don't think that's true but the idea of a blood-sucking fiend

396
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:32,160
 it's just too universal for it to be made up but because we focus on the movie versions of it

397
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,120
 one a lot of people just dismiss these legends i've talked before on podcasts

398
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:44,080
 that i think a war would be the perfect place for a vampire to hunt because you're not doing

399
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,560
 autopsy in a war zone but there's another killing ground that is just as fertile for the vampire

400
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,120
 we'll wrap the episode up like this i was talking to a friend of mine at work

401
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,080
 we were talking about mexican and south american cryptids

402
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,120
 and she told me a story that she had heard as a young girl

403
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:12,480
 she said there was a family that was trying to cross the border from Mexico into the united

404
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,000
 states now they knew they couldn't do it legally they weren't going to be able to go through that

405
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,600
 process because she had a mom and a dad older brother younger sister and they were going to

406
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,240
 cross the border somewhere between Mexico and the united states and try to find a better life

407
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:36,560
 up north but as they made their way through the rugged countryside the father realized

408
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:46,560
 something was following him one morning the family woke up and the father was dead

409
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,040
 he was pale with a look of fear spread across this face

410
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:00,640
 they don't know how he died but it seemed like all the blood was drained from his body

411
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:10,080
 the family continues the next morning when they wake up the older brother is dead

412
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:19,760
 pale a look of terror on his face the mother and the daughter continue to make their way across

413
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:28,080
 the hostile landscape that separates mexico and the united states and one morning a young girl

414
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,880
 crosses into this country alone

415
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,680
 when she is picked up by authorities she tells them the tale

416
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:46,480
 i didn't leave alone i left with my family but something out there was hunting us

417
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,040
 and it picked us off one by one i'm the only one left

418
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,360
 so whether it's the story of a vampire hunting lonely women walking down darkened streets

419
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:08,720
 in the massive city of shanghai or if it's a creature stalking a family searching for a better

420
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,320
 life as they march across the desolate landscape that separates mexico and the united states

421
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,680
 remember this there's nothing romantic about the vampire

422
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,760
 it doesn't live in a dark castle watching the machinations of humanity pass it by

423
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:37,680
 no it's a predator it's a blood-soaked maniac that hunts down the lonely the lost the desperate

424
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:45,920
 and takes them drinks their blood and discards them like trash

425
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,800
 the vampire is nothing to be traveled with it is one of the few cryptids

426
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,720
 that is recognized around the world every culture has a version of this creature

427
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:08,320
 so just remember that the next time the sun sets the next time the world is draped in darkness

428
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,560
 that there is a creature out there that has existed in human stories for thousands of years

429
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,920
 across the world countless civilizations have told the story of a blood-sucking fiend

430
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:33,280
 just remember that out there they very well may be a creature who is designed to do one thing

431
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,800
 to kill humans to kill you
