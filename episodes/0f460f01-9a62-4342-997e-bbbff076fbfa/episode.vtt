 Ghosts of Arizona Week continues!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 As we take a look at two schools in Arizona

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 that are currently haunted.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 But these ghosts don't walk around

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 rattling chains.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 These ghosts remind us that practice

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 makes perfect.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And then we travel to Cam Loops,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 British Columbia, to take a look at two buddies

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 who are spending a nice quiet evening fishing.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 That quietness is broken

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 when the lake is invaded

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 by thousands of ducks.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 [Music]

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 I'm your host, Jason Garvenor.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 We got a ton of stuff to cover,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 so let's go ahead and slide

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 right into this walking into Dead Rabbit Command

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 right now as one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Everyone give a nice warm round of applause

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 for fellow content creator.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Yeah! Woohoo!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Come on in buddy, come on in.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 He's been a long time supporter of the show.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Fellow content creator,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 If you guys can't swear to Patreon,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 I totally understand.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Just help us read the word about the show.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Now, fellow, let's go ahead

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 and toss you the hair hang glider.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 We're going to fly all the way out

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 to the sunny state of Arizona.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 [deep breath]

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Fellow content creator,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 let's go ahead and glide in front of Hayden High School.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 We're going to land,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 make a nice little soft landing here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 We're in Gila County, Arizona.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 We're at Hayden High School,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 the home of the fight and gila monsters.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 I don't know if that's actually your mascot,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 but it should be.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 That'd be dope.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 If one of their players bites you,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 you slowly die from their poisonous saliva.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 At Hayden High School,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 we actually have two ghosts at this school.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 So the first thing we've got to do

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 is we've got to suit up.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 We're getting ready to play in the big game.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 You didn't know that.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 We're actually going to play high school football right now.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Get on your gear,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 and we are headed out to the field.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 [huffing]

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 We're throwing footballs back and forth.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 I barely know anything about football.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 I shouldn't say I don't know anything.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 I know it involves feet.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 The thrown football is back and forth.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 The referee is like,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 "No, there's supposed to be one football in the field, you buffoons!"

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 "You're not even one of the teams!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 You're a bunch of adults running around in football uniforms!"

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 "We tackle the referee!"

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 "We're like, this is how we play!"

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 "Ugh!"

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Beating up the referee.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 After we all do time

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 in the local jail for assault and battery,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 we show back up at the football field,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 and now it's empty.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 There's no fans in the stands.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Just a empty football field.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 And that's where this is where this story should have started,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 because this is how the haunting is.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Apparently, at Hayden High School,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 you show up late at night.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 It's so creepy to me.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 This type of haunting is so creepy to me.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 If you show up late at night

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 at the Hayden High School football field,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 sometimes, not all the time,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 you'll see a football dude

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 all alone on the field running.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 [panting]

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 He has his little football.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 His cleats are digging into the soil.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 We see him run,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 and then he gets to a certain point in the field,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 and then he falls down.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Just disappears.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Now, apparently, this is what I find so...

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 I wasn't able to find any news articles to back any of this stuff up.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 But what I find so fascinating about this is,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 we have this ghostly phenomenon,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 and the question is,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 "How did this ghost appear?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 What is this?"

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Now, the supposedly the story,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 the supposedly the story that sets us up

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 is at one time, there was a football player

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 on the football field during a game,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 and he was tackled so viciously,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 he got his neck snapped,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 and he died shortly afterwards.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 And what you're seeing is that event

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 play out over and over.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Creepy, creepy haunting, right?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 One, you're out.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 We talk about liminal space a lot nowadays.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 The back rooms and that whole thing.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 There's also something just genuinely creepy

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 about an empty arena,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 an empty field,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 because all that energy,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 all that psychic and physical energy

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 constantly smashing against each other

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 every weekend,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 and you have these fans screaming on both sides,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 and all of this energy is infusing the players on the field

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 and getting everyone psyched up,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 and this is what it was built for.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 These are ancient rituals.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 And then when it's empty at night,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 there is an eeriness to it.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 It's the same thing as if you were going to a church

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 all alone late at night,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 or a library alone late at night.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 These places are constantly being infused with energy,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 and there is a bizarre feeling

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 when you're there by yourself.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 And this would be the perfect place for a haunting, really,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 because you have so much intense energy going on there.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 I had a really good friend who was,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 and I had a bunch of friends in football in high school,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 and I thought it was so interesting because

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 the dynamic between myself and them,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 I always was an artist.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 I was always writing or performing in plays,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 things like that,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 and for the artist,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 my future was always ahead of me.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 I would always say,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 "Well, there's no great novelist

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 who writes before the age of 30,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 so I don't really need to write now.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 I can just do whatever I want."

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 That's how the artist looks. They look ahead.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 And even at the time I realized this,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 I thought this was super interesting.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 I had a good friend of mine

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 who was a really, really good football player.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Nick, I remember when he played his last game

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 of high school football,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 and he cried afterwards.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 He cried.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Because he knew,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 unlike me as an artist,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 "Well, you know, someday I'll do this,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 someday I'll write this novel,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 someday I'll write this screenplay."

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 He knew that was the end of it now, forever.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 It was gone.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 This was the last time he would ever play

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 competitive football.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 He knew he wasn't going to play in college.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 He knew he wasn't good enough to play in college.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 He knew he never would go pro.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 This would be the last time that it would be

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 an organized football game in a football field.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 It's interesting because people,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 physical fitness, physical sports are all,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 they're front loaded.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 You can't just do all the stuff as early as possible.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 You can't be 30 years old and go,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 "Oh, you know, I think I'll join the Bullshoi Ballet."

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 I've never done it before,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 but I'm sure you know about six weeks of training.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 No.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 You can learn how to write a novel in six weeks.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 You can be 42 and write your first book.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 You can't be 42 and play your first game

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 of competitive football.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Like organized football.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 I'm not talking about your local football,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 touch football or whatever.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 It's fascinating to watch that difference

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 between my dreams and his.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 That was the night he knew he would never play football again.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Unless he was playing with the buddies,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 tossing the old pigskin back and forth.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Very interesting.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 I had never seen that before.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 And then I go, "Oh, well, that's..."

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 There's a different energy to that.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 And that's why being out there and watching this ghost

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 try to make it to the end zone, right?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 But he can't.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 He died.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And he didn't die on the field.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 He died later, probably like in a hospital or something.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 I don't know if they just took him up to the stands

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 and just had him sit there and die.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 So his ghost would return to that area.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 And as a paranormal investigator,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 we would classify this as a recording, right?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 It's an image that had been recorded in time.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 His own soul may be somewhere else in the afterlife,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 but this psychic imprint left such a mark on the area

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 that it's still there.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Fascinating.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Ghost story.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Now it's time to go into the gym.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 This next haunting is also recorded to be at Hayden High School.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 And again, I looked for any sort of historical newspaper article

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 on this.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Couldn't find anything.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Now part of it could be, because it's urban legend,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 part of it could be that the hauntings exist.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 This is what's interesting about ghost.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Because we see this happen all the time.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 The haunting itself exists.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 The backstory is made up.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Or not necessarily made up, but misinterpreted or misremembered.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 It's very common.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 You'll have a ghost at a place in a medium shows up and says,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 "Oh, well this farm hand died in this area,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 like the haunted Toys R Us in Sunnyvale or Sunnydale

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 or wherever in California."

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 There was like a farm, if I remember correctly,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 it was years and years and years ago.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 I remember the story totally terrifying me.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 I think it might have even been on Unsolved Mysteries.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Like a farm hand died in this area,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 and now they built a Toys R Us on top of it,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 and his ghost is kind of walking around the Toys R Us,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 and little bicycles are riding down the aisles late at night.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 The haunting itself was real.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Was that backstory real?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Who knows?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 That was one medium who came out and said,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 "This is the impression I got."

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 But we don't know.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 We don't know.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And this could be a phantom of a ghost falling down a break in its neck,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 or it could just be a ghost of a guy always trying to make that final play,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 and he got stopped at that goal line,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 and got knocked down or whatever,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 and the other team won.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And that was enough to build the psychic energy up.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 That's the interesting thing about ghosts.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Sometimes the phenomenon is real,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 but the backstory's made up.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 But I'm just saying that again,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 because I was trying to look for players getting killed

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 and hating high school.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 I did not have the most relaxing weekend.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 This next story is along the same lines.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Apparently in 1988 or 1989,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 around that time period,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 there was a beautiful high school senior.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 She was everyone's favorite,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 because she was the most popular girl in school,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 and she was on the cheerleading team.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And she was just so beautiful

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 that the world was just opening up before her.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Some versions of the story,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 she had just gotten a job to be a professional cheerleader for the NFL.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 And other versions of the story say

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 she wasn't going to be a cheerleader,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 but she was going to be a model.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 She was going to be an international superstar,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 a beauty on the runway,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 a beauty in the pages of magazines,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 or just the most beautiful professional cheerleader.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 She was about to have all of her dreams come true.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 But before all of that could happen,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 she was at school and she was smoking weed.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Parking lot late at night.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Now, in 19 now and nowadays,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 you're like, "Okay, well, who cares?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 A model smoking weed, who cares?"

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 1988, 1989, obviously highly illegal.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Gonna have marijuana.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 And the police roll up,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 and they catch her,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 and I assume catch other people as well,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 smoke on this weed.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And during the whole processing thing,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 where the police are saying,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 "Well, we're going to have to take you downtown,"

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 and stuff like that,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 she realizes that she'll never achieve the dreams

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 that the whole world had told her she would.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Right?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 She was always, "Oh, you're so beautiful."

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And the world will just kind of fall at your feet,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 and she saw the world falling at her feet.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 But now, 1988, getting caught with marijuana,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 it would definitely end her time

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 on the cheerleading team in the high school.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 She would have been gone.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 And most likely would have ended her career

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 as a professional cheerleader as well.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 And she asked the police officers,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 "Hey, can I go back to my car and grab something?"

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 And police officers, you know,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 what could possibly go wrong?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 This young high school girl,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 what's she gonna do?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Get in the car, drive away from us?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 She's a good girl.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 Yeah, she's smoking weed,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 so we gotta do our job.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 But yeah, so they let her walk over to where her car is parked,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 and then they hear a "Pfft!"

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 She had a gun in her car,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 'cause it is Arizona.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 I'm probably sure most people had gun in their cars,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 especially back then.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 She had a gun in her car,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 and she shot herself in her own car in that parking lot.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 People say to this day, sometimes when you're in the gym,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 apparently this young lady,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 her ghost is now sighted in the gymnasium

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 at Hayden High School.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Some people say you can hear the sounds of her shoes

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 against the court, right?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 You can hear the sound of someone practicing

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 a cheerleading routine.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 You'll hear the sounds of her shoes,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 and you'll hear a faint voice.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Gooo...Gila Monsters!

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 And because throughout the area, right,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 there are stories of this haunted gymnasium,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 once they had a softball competition at the Hayden High School,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 and one of the visiting teams said,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 "Hey, you know what?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Let's stay the night in the gymnasium."

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 We all heard that it was haunted.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 That would be really fun.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 We'll stay there all night long,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 and apparently this group of softball players were there,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 and they heard the stories about,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 you can hear the faint sounds of cheerleading,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 you can hear the sound of the shoes squeaking on the floor.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 One night they're all there really late at night,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 and off in the corner of the gymnasium,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 a full-body apparition of a cheerleader appeared,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 and she began doing a full cheerleading routine.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Her eyes focused.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Her muscles tight as she performs maneuver after maneuver

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 after maneuver of this cheerleading routine.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And the softball team just watched this phantom practice this over,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 and over again until once the routine was done,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 the phantom vanished.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 What she couldn't achieve in life,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 you know, finishing her high school career,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 she is attempting to achieve in death.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Again, this might just be a recording, right?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 This was when she was the most happy,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 was doing these routines in the gymnasium practicing.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 It could just be an after-image of this young woman who did die.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 It could also just be a psychic residue of a cheerleader

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 doing this routine over and over again, trying to nail it,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 and the story made up about the suicide was made up.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 You know, it could have been attached to it,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 but I got one more ghost story for you.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 If you're tired of hearing about dead teenagers,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 this one is not an after-image.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 This ghost story has far more sinister implications

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 than what the afterlife may hold.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 We're going to leave Hayden High School.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 We're headed to Mesa, Arizona,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 and we're going to stop by Powell Junior High School.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 There's a lot of stories when you look up,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 this is one of the, so Powell Junior High doesn't exist anymore.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 They've turned it into like a community center,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 but when Powell Junior High did exist,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 it had a lot of stories about the locker rooms being haunted.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 But we're going to look at something outside the school grounds,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 really right outside the school grounds.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Powell Junior High was built in 1971,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 and apparently, according to the Shadowlands.net,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 a young girl one day was taking swimming lessons at Powell Junior High,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 and after her swim practice, she was headed home.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 So she leaves the building and she begins crossing the street,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 and right now we're on 8th Street in extension.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 If you want to experiment with this, you can, though.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Let me finish the story before you get all your buddies on the car.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 This young girl is leaving Powell Junior High to walk home,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 and as she is crossing the street, a car slams into her and kills her instantly.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 She dies on the street right there.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Apparently, every bone broken in her body,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 that's how savage this car impacted this little girl.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 And people say that to this day,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 you can sometimes see the image of this girl trying to cross the street.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 But as this girl gets closer to the middle of the street,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 she starts to disappear.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 She starts to fade away as she's getting to the location of where the car hit her.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 She's translucent. She's beginning to just disappear.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 But you can hear her cry out in pain, in agony, and sadness.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 You can hear her voice scream out,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 "I just want to go home."

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Apparition disappears.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 See, I don't think that's a recording.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 I don't think that is an after image.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 I think that is the spirit of this little girl trying to...

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 My remaining two listeners are like, "Oh, this is super depressing."

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 I think this little girl is trying to get home,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 and she can't get past the point where she died.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And her saying that, "I just want to go home," is...

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 It is a... She's saying that now.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 She sees home as this impossibly far destination,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 and she's been trying to cross the street now for decades.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 "Just want to go home."

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 And it's interesting, this is the type of ghost

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 that you, I believe you probably could interact with.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 I think that is her consciousness in some way stuck in that loop.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 But how you... I think this would be, you know, people say,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 "Try to get the spirits to cross over."

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 That seems like this would be a prime candidate for that thing.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 It is in the middle of traffic.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 I don't recommend you guys sitting there,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 trying to hold the seance as cars are flying by you.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 You might just add to the ghost population.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 What's interesting about this story, and again,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 one of the things I like to do is to do more reporting

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 than just reading the ghost information.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 On Shadowlands.net, they do get some key details wrong.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 They said the school was built in the 1950s. That's not true.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 And they said this story took place on First Street.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 But that's not true either. The school is not in that location.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 So just throwing that out there,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 because I know a lot of you guys like to go research this stuff as well.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 I had to kind of piece together the date that the school is actually open.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 But as far as forgetting those factual issues,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 forgetting those factual problems with the story,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 this would be a prime candidate to try to contact this ghost

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 and try to get the spirit to move on.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 And to me, this is scary.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Like the cheerleader doing the routine,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 that's fascinating.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 It could just be an after-image of recording,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 say anything with a football player.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 I don't think the football player is thinking,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 "Well, if I can just get to the end zone,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 then I'll be fine. Then my ghost will go on."

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 I think it might just be an after-image.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 But I think this little girl is stuck here.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 She's trying to get home.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 But in this case, she needs to stop thinking about trying to get home

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 and trying to get into the afterlife,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 trying to reach paradise.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 But she's still finding herself stuck in that earthly prison,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 walking across the street that she will never fully cross.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 You know, I don't have time to do the Duck Lake segment.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 That one takes a long time.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 It's a really, really interesting one.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 I've been saving it for a while.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 I'm not going to have time to do that one this session.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 But let's go ahead.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Fellow content creator, let's go ahead and toss you the keys for the carboner copter.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 We are leaving behind Arizona.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 We'll be back later this week because I got some more cool.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 The next one is when ghosts go weird.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Some really bizarre hauntings.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 I don't even know if you could call it that.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Just some weird weirdness going on in Arizona.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Let's all hop in the carboner copter.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 We're leaving behind Arizona.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 We're headed all the way out to a bird nest.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 [imitates bird nest]

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 This story was sent to me by Patreon supporter Zachary McCree.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 So thank you so much for sending this over.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Quite a bizarre story.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Technically, it's a fable, but it has real world implications.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 This was written by a fellow named Nick Bostrom.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 Some of you guys will recognize that name so you'll know where it's going.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 But for the rest of you dudes, let's go ahead and we are sitting in the Sparrows Nest.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 We're not human sized or tiny little Sparrows sized people.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Because we're here for a meeting.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 The Sparrows are having a meeting.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 What happens is, one day these Sparrows are sitting there and they realize it's nest building season.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 This nest they're in, it's kind of junky looking.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 It's like half complete.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 There's just like a little bit of twigs and some string.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And a couple of Sparrows are falling out during this meeting.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 They're like, "Listen, we really got to finish this nest."

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 However, it sucks.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Nest building is really hard.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 To do all this manual labor sucks.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 What if, one of the Sparrows says,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 What if we could have an owl build our nest?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Sparrows are like, "What are you talking about?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Dude, owls would like totally eat us."

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, a normal owl, like a big giant owl would probably grab us right out of the nest,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 bite our heads off one by one.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 But, what if we could raise an owl?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 What if we could find an owl egg,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 and when the owl pops out, we're all standing around and he thinks that we're the parents.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 And we raise this owl to do our bidding.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Everyone's like, "That does sound like a great idea."

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 You could have this big owl building all of our nests.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 And then another Sparrow goes, "Yeah, not only that, can we have him build our nest.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 He'll protect us."

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 When a neighborhood cat is trying to eat one of us,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 our pet owl will scare the cat away.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 So it won't just help us do this manual labor, it'll actually be a security force.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 All the Sparrows are like, "This is a great idea. How come we never thought about this before?"

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 If we had an owl to do our bidding, we wouldn't have to do much work at all.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 We would just train the owl to do everything we don't want to do.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 And there you go.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 And not only the stuff we don't want to do, but the stuff we can do,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 like defending it from local pests, like cats, skunks, I don't know,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 skunks eat Sparrow's, I don't know much about Sparrow's.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 But anyways, every problem that we face nowadays can be solved with an owl.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 An owl we trained to serve us.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 And at that point, there's a little Sparrow sitting on the dark side of the nest.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 It's all in the shade underneath the tree. It's all dramatic.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 There's a little Sparrow sitting there, and he kind of walks out of the shadows,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 and everyone's like, "Ugh."

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 He kind of walks out of the shadows, and they're like, "Yep."

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Here comes good old Scronkfinkle.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 He's going to rain on our parade, the Sparrow's think.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 And they're right, they're right. Scronkfinkle is going to rain on their parade.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 He comes out of the shadows, and he has a little patch over one eye.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 He's definitely seen some stuff.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 He's been in it, right?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 He's been in it. That skunk is trying to eat him one day.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 Took an eye out.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 And Scronkfinkle walks out, and he goes, "Guys, what you are saying is beyond dumb.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 You want to get an owl egg, and you want to raise it as one of our own,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 and make it do all the stuff we don't want to do."

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And they go, "Yeah, why is that dumb?"

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 And Scronkfinkle goes, "Just by show of feathers.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Can anyone just raise a wing if they know anything about raising an owl?"

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 The little Sparrow's kind of look at each other, and Scronkfinkle goes,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 "That's the right thought.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 None of us know anything about how to raise an owl, how to train an owl.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 We don't know anything.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 And yet you're talking about grabbing an owl egg, bringing it here,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 and when it hatches, you are going to take control of it."

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Doesn't make any sense, and that's when the Sparrow's get upset and they said,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 "Listen, it's going to be hard enough to have Phase 1 of this plan take place.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Phase 1, find an owl egg that's not currently being guarded by a mama owl,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 and snatch it out of the nest.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 That's the hardest part of the plan."

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 Now, sure, raising the owl might be hard, but why are we even thinking about that

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 if we don't even have the owl egg first?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 We're going to bring an owl egg, and we'll raise it.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 We'll figure out the second part.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Scronkfinkle goes, "Don't, please don't do this.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 You can't bring an owl here, but the majority has spoken,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 and the Sparrow's fly off in all directions, looking for an owl egg,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 each of them having the little image in their head of how perfect life in the nest will be

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 with this giant owl to build for them, and to protect them, and to care for them."

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 And Scronkfinkle and a few other Sparrow's stay behind in the nest,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 and they go, "Well, if they are dead set on finding an owl egg,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 we better learn how to raise an owl.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 We got to have this part.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Phase 2 is very important, and honestly, it's probably more important than Phase 1."

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 And the Sparrow's who are left go about trying to figure out a way to raise an owl.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 But what they figure out very quickly is they know nothing about raising owls.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 They really don't know anything about owls to begin with.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 It's very hard to practice raising an owl if you don't have an owl to work with.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And as they're trying to figure out all of these things that could possibly go wrong with an owl,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 and all of these things that they could possibly use to train an owl while they're figuring this out,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 every so often, Scronkfinkle looks up and scans the sky.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Because he knows at any moment one of his fellow Sparrow's is going to come flying over the horizon,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 carrying an owl egg.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 And they have until that very moment to figure out how to control an owl.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Nick Bostrom wrote that. It's called "The Unfinished Fable of the Sparrow."

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 And Nick Bostrom is a famous Swedish philosopher and a famed warrior about artificial intelligence taking over the planet.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 And he wrote this book called, it came out back in 2015, I believe,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 called "Superintelligence - Paths, Dangers, Strategies."

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 And he uses the unfinished fable of the owl, he uses that story to basically say, this is what AI is.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 That we are building a monster within our nest, the nest being the planet Earth.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 And we know nothing about how these things are going to work in the real world. Zero.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 And we can't even practice on them. We can't even figure out a way to contain superintelligence.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 He's actually the guy who coined the term superintelligence.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 And superintelligence, you don't have to have like a galactic level consciousness.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Superintelligence is simply smarter than a human.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 He goes, once these things become smarter than a human, it's game over.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 It doesn't have to be exponentially smarter than a human, it just has to be a little bit smarter than a human.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 And we're done. And we're building an owl.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 And we have no idea how to raise, it is so fascinating. Zachary McCree sent this over to me.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 And I was like, that is so bizarre. Because there is, how do you practice controlling an AI?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 If we don't even know how an AI thinks. And he goes, listen, it could be something that you set up a very basic thing for an AI to do.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Solve a math problem that humans believe is unsolvable. And it might be unsolvable.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 And you tell this AI, can you give us the answer to this problem?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 And the AI will have its main goal.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 But just like humans will have sub goals, right?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 We may say solve this math problem, the AI will have the main goal and then have a sub goal going, well, if I need to solve this math problem,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 and I can't solve it using the state that I'm in right now, I'm going to turn the entire planet into a computer.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 And he goes once, you can't predict it. He goes, you cannot predict what the AI will do.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And once it is smarter than a person, it's too late.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 It will do things we never thought of because it's smarter than us.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Just like you can outwit a cat or a lobster, we would be the lobster.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 We wouldn't even be able to comprehend, be like, huh, I wonder why he did that?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Because our body is being digitized.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 We wouldn't even be able to predict the why. We wouldn't even know what it was, what it was doing, let alone the why.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 And he, him, it's funny because he posted this, he came out with this book.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And I remember reading about this at the time, this was when Elon Musk was saying,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 I'm more afraid of artificial intelligence than I am of nuclear weapons.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And there was a lot of people who, Bill Gates was also on that boat. He goes, yeah,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 I'm more afraid of AI taking over than nuclear weapons being deployed.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 We've had nuclear weapons around for what, 50, 60, 70 years at this point, and they've been used in war twice.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 It was really in just in the one war.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 At this point, we're fairly responsible with our nuclear weapons as a civilization.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 The AI is something far more dangerous than people being like, you know what, I don't want to press this button,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 even though I'm getting orders from my leader, I don't think it's, you have so many safeguards

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 with humans making moral decisions about whether or not to deploy nuclear bombs.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 And really at this point, they're kind of passe.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 We have non-nuclear bombs that can still do a massive amount of damage

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 and they don't have the cultural or the moral outrage as if you dropped a nuke.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 But with the AI, you don't have any of those safety protocols,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 because we don't know what the safety protocols would be, we don't know what we would need.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 There's no instruction manual on how to deal with an AI because there's never been an AI.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 I find that absolutely fascinating. I had never thought about that before.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 We did an episode a long time ago.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 I'll see if I can remember the title of it.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 I'll put in the show notes about putting an AI in a box and how you can never truly keep it in the box.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 And that was when we were talking about building something we knew was dangerous.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 This is, we're going to accidentally build something that's super dangerous.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 And they put together like Nick Bostrom and a bunch of other eggheads put together this thing like the 23 things that need to be set in place,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 the 23 rules for artificial intelligence.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 But really the main thing they were saying is that if any government or any corporation ever invents,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 like they're on the cusp of getting true AI, they need to stop immediately.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 Nick Bostrom says you need to stop immediately and then all of the governments of the world sit down to figure out how to raise an owl.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 And he goes, it may come to the point that if they can't figure it out, we need to physically destroy the equipment.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Now this is not when the, once the AI is online, that is too late.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 He's saying if you think that you're actually super close to developing this, stop.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And we will think about it.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 And if we can't come up with a foolproof way of raising this owl, we destroy it.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 We do not even turn it back on.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 That is the threat level that's going on here.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 I thought it was fascinating too because as I was reading this, I go, this applies not just to AI, but things, everything, really.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Every week I go, I drop $5 on the lottery.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 I don't know anything about wealth management.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 I've never had an accountant.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 I barely pay my taxes, right?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 And yet if I won $50 million in the lottery, I go, oh, I would do this.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 I would do that.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 I would do this.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 But I couldn't even prepare for the idea of having $50 million in my account.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 I'm trying to get that owl leg without knowing how to raise an owl.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 But you go Jason, why would you go and learn about wealth management?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Why would you go and learn about taxes and stuff like that and paying them on time and not having the IRS harass you all the time?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 If you don't already have the money, why would you be planning on how to have the money?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 I mean, technically, I probably should take a wealth management class.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Probably everyone should know how to handle their money.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 But it's that same thing.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 I understand why the Sparrows wanted the owl egg first.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Winning the lottery is the hard part.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 But if you, if all of a sudden $50 million dropped into my lab,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 it would be very, very difficult for me to not blow it all.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Because I don't know anything about wealth management.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 I tell myself I put some in savings and I put this, and I know me, I would become a super paranoid that people are going to steal from me.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 So I'd be like, I don't want accounts.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 I don't want any of these people have access to my accounts.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 I just want my money to sit in a bank and I just live off of it.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 That's what I would do.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 But I don't know.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Is that what you do when you win the lottery?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 And then I also think about the paranormal angle, right?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 So many people are always constantly trying to summon demons, this Faustian pack.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 It's always about looking for one simple goal, one simple thing, and everything spins out of control.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Literally, the genie is out of the bottle type of thing.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 So we look at this as an AI thing, but throughout history,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 people have constantly tried to snatch the owl egg and not know how to raise an owl.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 And whether that be something as simple as winning the lottery,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 and now you have this owl egg, you have all of this wealth,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 you don't know how to handle it, you don't know how to deal with it,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 or you're trying to summon a succubus, which we see all the time,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 that might be one of the most common things people use magic for,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 is trying to summon a lover, demonic, or use law of attraction to suck someone into your life.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 But once they're there, then what?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 You've never had a girlfriend before, ever had a girlfriend before,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 and now you use the dark arts to seduce a woman, now she's in your life, now what?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 You have that owl egg, but you know nothing about how to raise an owl.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 You know nothing about how to have a healthy relationship.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 And here is this woman that you've basically demonically influenced to show up.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 It's so fascinating, it literally is, be careful what you wish for.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 But that always was kind of the thing like, be careful what you wish for,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 because you may be disappointed when you get it,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 or be careful what you wish for, because it might be more than you can handle.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 This one is, be careful what you wish for, it will destroy the planet Earth.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 Scientists, and I understand why they do, right? They're scientists.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 They want to discover things, but they want that AI so much,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 they want that owl egg in their possession, that they'll say,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 "We'll figure out the rest later."

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 I mean, this AI research has been going on for decades, this guy wrote this book in 2015,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 and that's when people go, "Oh, this might actually be a problem."

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 So fascinating, we are constantly chasing the owl egg,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 and we say, "We'll figure out phase two next."

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 It's going to be hard enough to get the owl egg, we'll figure out how to raise it after we have it.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 But once you have that owl egg, and once that starts to hatch,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 you better learn real quickly how to deal with it.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 Because it's not just going to consume you, it's going to consume everything around you.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 If we're talking about using black magic to seduce people,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 it's going to consume you, it's going to consume them, it may affect your family.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 If you're talking about winning the lottery, it's going to consume you,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 it's going to consume your friends, your enemies will line up to take you down.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 But if it's in the case of an AI, it's going to consume the scientists who develop it,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 it's going to consume those who are trying to shut it down,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 and eventually it will consume the entire planet, and it won't care.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 Because to this AI, it is the mighty owl.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And the human race is just a bunch of weak sparrows taking up space in its nest.
