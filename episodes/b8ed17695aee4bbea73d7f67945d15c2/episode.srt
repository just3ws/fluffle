 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I'm having a great day.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 It's actually still Thanksgiving for me because I recorded these the day before.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 For you, future listener, if it's no longer Thanksgiving, it's still Thanksgiving for me.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And I have right here, because I'm celebrating Thanksgiving, a strawberry-ta.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Strawberry-ta.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 It is sparkling margarita in a can.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I actually have had this before.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 It's pretty good.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And before anyone says that it's a girl drink, I'll have you know it is 8% alcohol.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 That makes it 16 proof.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 That's not a girl drink.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I also, this isn't a sponsorship or anything.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I'm just celebrating Thanksgiving.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And then after I recorded this, I'm going to eat some Thanksgiving dinner.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Some instant potatoes and some stovetop stuffing.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And I got these little turkey TV, they're not even TV dinners.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 They're like, completes.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 But it's like, eats is all capitalized.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 So that's it.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I like having a laid-back Thanksgiving.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 My family's all over the place.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 So I like just kind of chilling.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And I'm chilling with you guys.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I'm chilling with you guys.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So that's totally cool too.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And I hope you guys had a great Thanksgiving.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And if you're in parts of the world that don't celebrate Thanksgiving, I hope you had a great Thursday.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 So we're going to go ahead and talk about a couple different things here.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 First story we're going to talk about is something of particular interest to me.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And I think it's something that people have thought about.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And that's, do blind people, what do blind people dream of?

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I said on an earlier episode, people who wear glasses all the time, in their dreams, do they wear glasses?

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I've wondered about that.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Like, in the dream are you wearing glasses on your face?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And if your glasses aren't on your face in your dream, are your dreams blurry?

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 I wear glasses off and on.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Like, I'm starting to wear them more as I get older, but generally I only wear them if I'm going to be doing a lot of reading.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Most of the time I don't have my glasses on.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 But I was wondering about how the blind people, how the blind people, what blind people dream.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Now, I will say this to start this off, this will probably get a lot of listeners to just drop the show.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But I used to hook up with this blind chick a couple years ago, and she kind of explained it to me.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So she had this, or has this degenerative eye thing, and started when she was like a teenager,

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 where her field of vision gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 She may eventually end up being completely blind, or it may just stop.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I used to know the name of it, but it's this thing.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 So she was explaining it to me one night, and she said, "This was so bizarre."

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So she goes, "My field of vision is very limited, but my mind is still processing the visual input as if I still had a normal field of vision."

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 So we're over at my apartment, and my apartment's messy as is.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And there was something on the floor, like a wrapper, or I don't know, candy bar, something.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Not a candy bar, but there was something on the floor.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And she said, "You see that on the floor?"

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 She goes, "What I'm seeing right now is..."

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 She goes, "You're just seeing like a little green box sitting on the floor."

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And then the rest of it is just the wood paneling, the wood floor.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 She goes, "When I look at it, I see the green box sitting on the floor,

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 and I see that green box replicated a hundred times in every direction."

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Because her brain is saying, since it only has this little field of vision,

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 her brain is assuming that that obstacle is everywhere.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 She goes, "But if I look a couple feet over where there is no obstacle on the floor,

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I'll just see wood paneling go on forever and ever."

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So her brain is trying to process the limited information that it has.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And so that's why she kind of has to focus...

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 That's why she can't drive, that's why she kind of has to focus when she's navigating.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 She had the walking stick and everything like that,

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 but you would talk to her, you wouldn't know that she was legally blind,

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 but she had to be very careful.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And because it was degenerative, it wasn't like it happened overnight.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Like her brain has learned to cope with this loss of vision.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And I will say this too, it was super bizarre.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 She was super nice and incredibly hot.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And she did all this stuff that I don't want to go into,

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 because then people could probably identify her better.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 But she just lived the life normally and did all this stuff,

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 and she's an amazing woman.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 But anyways, she doesn't listen to the podcast though, so I hold that against her.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 The point is that the brain will try to figure out how to cope with any obstacle that comes in its way.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And that's where we get into the idea of dreaming,

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 because what scientists feel dreams are,

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 is it is a way to do practice runs, especially nightmares.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Nightmares, science believes, is a way to do practice runs of tragic and traumatic events.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 So when these things really do happen, you're prepared for it mentally.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 It's a theory, but I think it's actually a pretty good theory.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Now of course we have dreams about dragons and nightmares about stuff that will never happen,

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 but it's still your brain just basically putting itself in a traumatic state to prepare itself for something traumatic happening in the future.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 It's a safety mechanism basically.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 So this is where we're going to get into what do blind people dream about.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I know that was a bit of a lead up, but I think it's important because we're going to get into what my friend's experience was with her waking vision.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 You'll see kind of start to play out in the dreams as well.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 So Danish researchers did a study, it's a very small study.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 There's only 50 people.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 They had 11 blind people who were blind from birth, 14 people who became blind after the age of, I think it was one,

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 and then 25 non-blind people or seeing people.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 They had to take surveys on their dreams.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 They asked questions like, "Did you see? Was it in color? Did you taste, smell, feel pain? What emotions did you have?

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 What type of themes did the stories have?"

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Seeing people had at least one visual dream.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Now this was, I think, a six-week survey.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 So within the six weeks, seeing people on average had at least one visual dream, usually more, but at least one.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 The blind from birth had none, no visual dreams, which is to be expected.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They've never seen anything.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 People who became blind, the older they got since they had become blind, the less likely they would see something.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Because their brain now is working, being like, "Oh, there's no visual stimuli coming in, so we don't have to produce visual stimuli in the dreams."

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 What's interesting, and also they had, across the board, across the three groups, they had the same, they were able to identify themes in their dreams.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 But one of the weirdest things was that when it came for nightmares, blind people had over-triple the amount of nightmares of the seeing people.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 25% of the blind people said they had a nightmare, versus 7% of the seeing people who said they had a nightmare.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And when they were looking at that, they said, "This is kind of showing that the brain is going through basically practice runs for reality,"

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 because the blind people, their nightmares were things that they worry about, things that are major obstacles for people who are blind, things like getting lost.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Falling in manholes was a very common nightmare in this group.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I've never once worried about falling in a manhole.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I've thought about climbing into them and seeing what was down there, but I've never thought like, "Oh, no, what if I'm walking on the street and I fall in a manhole?"

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 That's not a problem that I face.

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Getting hit by a car was a common one, because they have to deal with that.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Losing their guide dog.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 So, I mean, these are real threats that blind people face.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And so their brain is doing those practices, so if that happens, if they're out walking and their dog runs away, goes chases a squirrel or whatever,

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 their brain will know how to deal with a situation that immediate panic will start to be quelled, because basically this has already happened to them a hundred times in their sleep,

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 but even though this is the first time it's ever happened in real life.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 So, and then there's this quote.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I thought this was an interesting quote from this one study.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It said, "When a blind man is asked if he dreams, the answer is an immediate yes.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 But if we ask him if he sees anything in the dream, the answer is always doubtful, because he does not know what it is to see.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Even if there were images and colors in his brain during the dream, how could he recognize them?

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 There is, therefore, no direct way through the dream reports to evaluate the presence of a visual activation in the dream of congenitally blind subjects."

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 So, it's weird.

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 They may actually see in their dream, but they don't.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 People who are blind from birth could never explain it.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Their dreams could be full of visual stimuli, but they wouldn't never be able to explain it to somebody.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And I think this story is interesting.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I find it absolutely fascinating, because that's almost how we try to talk about like cosmic level things,

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 or there's so much stuff in the world that we don't have the language to explain, not only to ourselves, but to other people.

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I find that fascinating.

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I find everything with the human brain fascinating, because it's not just like, "Oh, I'm blind, but everything else is normal."

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Their brain still is processing all that information, and the brain, if just their eyes are blind, their brain is still able to receive visual stimuli.

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 It's just not getting there.

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 So, what's that part of the brain doing?

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Is it creating its own?

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 How would you define a color to someone who's never seen the color red?

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I find all that stuff fascinating.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It's all philosophical arguments at a certain point, but these people are living that philosophical argument.

154
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Absolutely fascinating.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 The next story we're going to cover is an odd one.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 It's one that I saw pop up a couple of times on the conspiracy iceberg.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I figured there's nothing to it.

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 There's no resources behind it.

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 A lot of people requested it, and I said, "I'll look into it."

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 It wasn't something I was too thrilled about.

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And then I looked into it, and I was like, "Okay, there's something here."

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 So, the conspiracy theory is that the Sentinelese are guarding alien artifacts.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So, to get into it, I'm going to have to give you some background to who the Sentinelese are.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 There is an island off the coast of India, the Andaman Islands, and there's multiple islands there.

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And there's a lot of tribes there.

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I think there's like four or five tribes there that are throwbacks.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Now, out of most of those tribes, there are trade and contact with the Indian government.

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, we know you guys are like way back.

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 You guys are still using spears and stuff like that, but we want to have regular contact with you."

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And the people on those islands are like, "Yeah, okay, you know, that's fine.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It's beneficial to both sides."

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 One, India gets to contact the people, and then the people on the islands get food and supplies and stuff from India.

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 However, one of the islands, North Sentinel Island, has a tribe on there called the Sentinelese.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 They are completely, for the most part, uncontacted by the modern world.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 They know we exist and we know they exist, but there's been no formal contact between the two.

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 There's been attempts, but there's been no shaking hands, sending ambassadors, stuff like that.

177
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 India has said, "This island's off limits. They don't want to talk to us.

178
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 They're a fully functioning, basically prehistoric society. They don't want to talk to us."

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 There have been attempts where people have gone there, and two of the elders from the Sentinelese came and met the sailors.

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 They ended up getting diseases, the Sentinelese, because they're such a throwback.

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's the same thing that when the Europeans came to America.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 The government of India was like, "Okay, we can't be messing with these people. They're a fully functioning tribe.

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 We're only going to make things worse."

184
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 They have tribes like this. Brazil has a couple of tribes like this. South America overall has a couple of tribes like this.

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 The government actually says, "Don't go near them. Let them be."

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 There was a time where some sailors came to the island and they gave them pigs and some toys and things like that.

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 The Sentinelese came out, killed the pig and buried it. They'd never seen a pig before. They didn't know what it was.

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 They've only really lived on this island.

189
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Killed the pig, basically ran people off of spears. There have been times where the Sentinelese will come out and they'll look like they're going to accept the explorers.

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And then they chase them off of spears. They shoot arrows at them.

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 So they're a very, very closed off tribe. They don't want to get to know people on the mainland.

192
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So this guy, just a couple days ago, felt that he was in his heart to go preach Christianity to the Sentinelese.

193
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 You're not supposed to go there. It's completely illegal to go there.

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 He hired some fishermen, said, "Let me take me to the Sentinelese islands. I'll talk about Jesus." They killed them.

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 They just lit them up full of arrows.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And India, in response, arrested the fishermen.

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Because India has said that they've killed other...

198
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 A couple of years ago, there was a fishing boat that the two fishermen fell asleep in their boat and it drifted too close to North Sentinel Island.

199
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 They lit them up. The Sentinelese fired much arrows, killed them.

200
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 India said, "We consider that island to be a sovereign state. You invaded their border. They have the right to do that."

201
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 We're not going to interfere with that island. So India really has their back.

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Now let's go into a little bit more history of the Sentinelese and then we're going to get into the conspiracy theory because this all wraps up together.

203
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Sentinelese, they believe they're about 40,000 years old. Not the people on the island, but I mean the civilization somewhere around there.

204
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 They believe they traveled from Africa to the island. I don't know how, but somehow they got from Africa to this island.

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I guess if you have 40,000 years, you can kind of do anything.

206
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 We don't know how many of them are on the island. Estimates have ranged over time anywhere from 40 to 500.

207
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 So sometimes there's peaks in the population, sometimes there's valleys, but we don't know because we've never been there.

208
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 We can fly drones overhead. We can sit on the beach, not on their beach because they'll kill us, but you can sit in a boat, look at them from a distance.

209
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 They don't know how to write. They don't even know how to make fire.

210
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 What we can tell is they wait for lightning to strike and they keep the fire going for as long as they can.

211
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Very, very primitive people. There's a little bit of relation between, like I said, there's other tribes on the other islands in that area.

212
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 There's a little bit of relation of the language between the Sentinelese and one other tribe, but it's still such a far gap.

213
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 They can't communicate with each other. So they're basically cut off even from their closest neighbor.

214
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 We know that they, anything that washes up on the island, they use, we've seen them with metal, but they don't know how to do metal working.

215
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 So when we see them with metal, we go, oh, they must be getting debris that washes up on the island, making these spearheads, making whatever.

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Dude, and you're thinking, Jason, you're reading a Wikipedia article about North Sentinel Island on board.

217
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 No, because this gets really good. Trust me. I'm just have to set this stuff up because we're going to go back to this stuff.

218
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 The idea, that's the setup. The idea that the Sentinelese are guarding alien artifacts.

219
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Let's take a look at that. Now, of course, the planet's been around for billions of years.

220
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 If there were ever aliens moving through the, so let's assume the aliens are the aliens coming from other planets, not interdimensional things like that for the sake of this story.

221
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Aliens coming through the galaxy and things like that. Over the course of four billion years, it's possible that artifacts and ships, I mean, you have such a long period of time, things are dropped off on our planet.

222
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And actually, there have been some scientists that to look for proof of alien life, they're not looking up into the sky because that's such a small window of time.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 They want to look at the Earth and Mars and Venus for energy signatures that they believe would be coming from alien craft.

224
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 And they said, well, we know Venus is basically a big old hot swamp, not a literal swamp, like I used to believe.

225
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I said this in our earlier episode, when I was a kid, I was taught that Venus had lush rainforest jungles full of dinosaurs.

226
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And that's why I was so cloudy. And I believed that until I was about 15, and I would quote that all the time to people and no one was ever like, you're an idiot, that's not true.

227
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And I always wondered why whenever people talked about looking for a life on other planets, I'm like, why are you worried about microbes on Mars?

228
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 There's dinosaurs on Venus. And I literally would tell people that and they would never question it.

229
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 But anyway, so there's no jungles on Venus. Any alien craft that crashed on Venus would have been liquefied by now, you know, given the time period of millions of years.

230
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 But if an alien ship or an alien satellite or alien artifact was crashed or left behind on Mars or Earth, we should be able to detect some sort of energy signature from it.

231
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And that's one of the things with the idea of an alien artifact being left on North Sentinel Island.

232
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 If it was just a piece of metal that had like, you know, alien graffiti on it, that's very interesting.

233
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 But it doesn't really help. It would be like, yeah, okay, an alien ship crashed here.

234
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 But what people are looking for when we talk about alien artifacts isn't necessarily just a hunk of metal.

235
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It would be something that would be incontravertible proof of alien technology.

236
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Is it alien technology? A piece of metal is a piece of metal.

237
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 And you go, oh, an alien must have crashed here. But a power source or a weapon or something like that is what we would really want to find.

238
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Something that would change, not just change our view of the universe and say, yes, there is living stuff out here.

239
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Here's a picture of an alien, like, you know, a Betty Boop alien on the side of a ship or, you know, like how they used to paint the World War II bombers.

240
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 That would just be proof there's aliens.

241
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 We would want some sort of artifact that would give us free energy or teach us the secrets of the universe or something like that.

242
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And if those things existed on this planet, we should pick up the energy signature.

243
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 We haven't on North Sentinel Island.

244
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 So you're thinking, well, Jason, okay, then I guess you are saying there's no alien artifacts on North Sentinel Island.

245
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And I say, don't interrupt me. Not done.

246
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And I'll go back to this, a little bit of pushback on detecting for alien signatures.

247
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 It's possible that there would be alien signatures in our solar system.

248
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 We just don't have the technology to decipher what it is.

249
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 We don't know what it is.

250
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 If they're not using nuclear or chemical or something like that, they may be using some sort of power source or artifact that's undetectable.

251
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So a little bit of pushback on that.

252
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I'm not so sold on the idea that if an alien artifact was here, we would detect it.

253
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 But we're giving it our best shot trying to detect these things.

254
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I don't think there's alien technology on North Sentinel Island.

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 I don't believe the Sentinelese are protecting alien technology.

256
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 This is what I think.

257
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I have some interesting, I don't want to say evidence, but I have some interesting facts to support this.

258
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Let's say I was an alien and I wanted to put something, hide something on Earth that nobody would find.

259
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 You could say you could put it on a place that was going to be guarded by a bunch of prehistoric people

260
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 that wouldn't know what it was.

261
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 So you won't have to worry about them dealing with it.

262
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 However, here's the thing.

263
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 You wouldn't necessarily know when you put it there that somebody else, a more powerful government, wasn't just going to show up and take it.

264
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 You could say I'm going to put it here and these people around it will never know what it is.

265
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 But there's always a chance that somebody else will just go in.

266
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 If this tribe was located anywhere else in the world at any other point in time, they would have just been taken over.

267
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Like all the other indigenous people on the planet.

268
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 It's just because this isn't a super strategic area where all of this stuff started really coming out like the 1800s where they're like, "I'll just kind of leave them alone."

269
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 But if it was a more strategic area and if it was in the 1400s when these people were discovered and all this stuff going on, they would have just been taken over.

270
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Nowadays, there's enough land and enough resources and stuff like that that they don't have to deal with this island that has enough to natural.

271
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 So if you were an alien race and you wanted to hide something, yes.

272
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 But if you were an alien and an indigenous population who don't know what it is, it's a good idea.

273
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 But if they had done this with a Navajo, the Navajo got steamrolled and we would have found this huge reactor.

274
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 If it landed there accidentally, if an alien didn't purposely put it there, if it landed there accidentally, then the same thing.

275
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Eventually, the chances of somebody summing across it and if it landed there accidentally, it could have landed anywhere, it could have landed in New York City, it could have landed in North Sentinel Island.

276
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 In New York City, they wouldn't have known what it was, in North Sentinel Island they wouldn't have, but then they're not necessarily guarding it.

277
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 It's just a piece of wreckage that's there and they're there as well.

278
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 But what if the alien knew that no one was going to go there?

279
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 The alien knew for a fact that for hundreds of years, no one was ever going to go there, that group of people were going to be left alone by the government of India.

280
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 They knew for a fact that was going to happen.

281
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 You would put it there because you'd have the best of both worlds.

282
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 You'd have a group of people who would have no idea what it was.

283
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 They'd probably stay away from it if it was too creepy.

284
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And you knew no one would go to discover it.

285
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 You would actually be able to say, "We know eventually they're going to discover it in the year like 2100 or 2055 or whatever."

286
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 But we're going to place this here now and we know if for the next 500 years no one's going to mess with it because of all these policies with India and the way that people are structured and all that stuff.

287
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Now of course, this... okay, we're coming to the end here.

288
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Of course, they would have no way of predicting if India was going to go there tomorrow, 400 years ago, or 300 years in the future.

289
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Aliens wouldn't know that, but time travelers would.

290
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 They're not guarding alien artifacts on North Sentinel Island.

291
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 They're guarding a time machine.

292
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Hear me out.

293
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And let me back up here.

294
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 This conspiracy is true. I'm not saying that it's true, but let's assume that they are guarding something for the sake of the narrative.

295
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 They're guarding a time machine because in the future they would know for a fact how history would play out.

296
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 They would know that they would try to make contact with the tribe.

297
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 The tribe wouldn't want it.

298
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 The government of India would step in and say, "Nobody contacted this tribe."

299
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 People from the future would know how even...

300
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And they would know for a fact in the year 2049 eventually someone does go to the island and that's when we moved the time machine.

301
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 But for now we're going to put it here.

302
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 It's perfect location because it is completely isolated.

303
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 It's an island that you cannot get to.

304
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 You will be arrested if you go to and you survive.

305
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 If you die, you die.

306
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 But it's close enough to the mainland that you can leave the island and get to the mainland.

307
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Sri Lanka, India, wherever you want to go.

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 It's possible that the people, the North Sentinelese, were brought from the past by the time travelers.

309
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Bring them from the past in Africa and put them on the island.

310
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 That's why the language doesn't match up.

311
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 They're there to guard the time machine.

312
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 They said, "We're going to go back to Africa.

313
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 We're going to get this tribe of people. We're going to put them on this island.

314
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 We'll take care of them.

315
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 We'll give them the metal they need.

316
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 We'll make a lightning strike every once in a while to give them fire.

317
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 We'll watch over them because they're going to protect this time machine

318
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 that will give us access to come and go as we please.

319
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Where we're completely concealed, we're close enough to the mainland.

320
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And you go, "Okay, Jason, interesting theory.

321
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Do you have any proof?"

322
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I'll say this.

323
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I have more proof of that theory than of alien artifacts.

324
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And this is why.

325
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 In 2004, the Indian Ocean earthquake, the Boxing Day earthquake,

326
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 massive earthquake, huge tsunami, hundreds of thousands of people killed.

327
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Just devastated the coastlines of that area.

328
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 North Sentinel Island, the earthquake was so powerful,

329
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 it lifted it up three to seven feet in some areas.

330
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Just completely crumpled the ground underneath it.

331
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Massive tsunami hit North Sentinel Island, hit the rest of the Andaman Islands.

332
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 As the world was starting to put everything back together after the tsunami,

333
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 officials in India said, "They're all dead.

334
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 The Sentinelese are all dead.

335
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 The other tribes on those islands are all dead.

336
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 That tsunami wiped out all the coastlines in this area.

337
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Those islands had no chance.

338
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Let's get a helicopter and fly overhead and confirm what we already know.

339
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 The helicopter flies overhead.

340
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 They see a villager come out and shake his spear angrily at the helicopter.

341
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 The helicopter goes, "Well, at least there's one of them."

342
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 None of them died.

343
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 None of them.

344
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 As far as we can tell, they just went on as normal.

345
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 This massive tsunami and earthquake that devastated the lives of millions of people

346
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 and took the lives of hundreds of thousands of people

347
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 didn't even scratch a population between 40 and 500.

348
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 The official line is that because they're such a primitive society,

349
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 they're used to being in a tune to nature and they could tell the animals were acting weird.

350
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 They could tell the birds were acting weird and all this stuff.

351
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 They found high ground.

352
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 The other tribes in the area also found high ground

353
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 because they didn't suffer massive casualties.

354
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 So they knew it was coming in a way.

355
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 They used their nature-based instincts for being so close to the Earth

356
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 they knew something was coming.

357
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 I have another theory.

358
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 They were warned from the future.

359
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Get to higher ground.

360
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Their God spoke to them.

361
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And the time-tribe people from the future,

362
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 not only would they know that was going to happen,

363
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 they would warn the people on the other islands as well

364
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 because it would look weird if only the Sentinelese survived this tsunami

365
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 and all the other tribes were wiped out.

366
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 You just go to the other tribes and say, "Hey, get to high ground.

367
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Make sure you're at high ground before such and such time tomorrow.

368
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Disguise yourself as a villager they wouldn't know.

369
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Make it some sort of miracle."

370
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Or maybe the leaders of the other tribes are from the future.

371
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 But for whatever reason, they were warned

372
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 whether it was their own natural instinct

373
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 or a message from somebody who knew what was going to happen.

374
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 They suffered.

375
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 As far as we can tell, no casualties.

376
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Their society definitely continues.

377
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 And entire coastlines, like I said, were destroyed.

378
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You can watch the YouTube footage of the tsunami

379
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 and imagine a prehistoric village surviving that.

380
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Is it possible that there is a time machine on North Sentinel Island?

381
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 When I started looking at the theory that the Sentinelese were guarding alien artifacts,

382
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 like I said, I figured there wasn't anything there.

383
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 But what I found is far more interesting

384
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 than why I could have thought of originally.

385
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I have no proof of any of this, just facts that can be put together in any way

386
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 because that's one of the problems with facts.

387
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 But I will say this.

388
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 If I had a time machine, I would put it someplace that I knew

389
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 not only no one would ever go to,

390
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 but the people there would have no idea what it was.

391
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And North Sentinel Island is the perfect place in the modern world

392
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 for a time machine from the future.
