00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 At GreatGardenPlants.com, we believe gardening is for everyone.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,800
 I'm Miranda, lifelong gardener and manager of GreatGardenPlants.com.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,400
 This season, I hope you'll make us your first choice for online plant shopping.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,000
 Whether you're looking for an old-fashioned favorite or the hottest new variety,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,600
 you'll find more than 900 preneals, flowering shrubs, and evergreens,

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,400
 ready to ship directly to your door and backed by your 60-day risk-free guarantee.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,600
 Get started on your dream garden at GreatGardenPlants.com.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,600
 It's been the dream of everyone who follows the world of the weird,

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,800
 to come across an ancient spellbook and try to learn its secrets.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,800
 And now, thanks to a library, you can do that online.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,400
 And then we travel to Bismarck, North Dakota,

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,600
 a medium-sized town in a desolate state in America.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,400
 But this town has had a string of mysteries cut.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,800
 And then we travel to Bismarck, North Dakota,

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,800
 where a string of missing people, all seemingly unrelated,

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,000
 may point to a sinister conspiracy today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,600
 [music]

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,200
 I really do hope you guys are having an awesome, awesome day.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,600
 So I'm gonna be taking a week off next week.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,600
 It's my scheduled break. I take every 50 episodes I take a week off.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,800
 But I put the call out to my Patreon supporters.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,000
 I asked them a question this time.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,600
 How would you guys feel about me doing best of episodes,

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,400
 where I'm going to re-release some of those classic episodes

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,000
 that you guys may have missed with a little introduction?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
 And that's what we're going to do.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
 They all thought that was a really cool idea.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,400
 So thank you to all of my Patreon supporters who voted on that.

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,800
 We're so next week we're gonna have five episodes

33
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,400
 that are notable in one way or the other.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,800
 Some of them might be my favorite episodes.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,400
 Some of them may be episodes that I think could be more acknowledged.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,800
 We're gonna re-release the Golf Rumors episode,

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,400
 which has never fully been available on YouTube.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
 The Golf Rumors episode.

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,400
 It's gonna be a lot of the older stuff.

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,000
 Like, I think the newest episode I have is like 120.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,800
 But we're gonna revisit some of those old favorites you may have missed.

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,400
 And if that seems to go over well with you guys,

43
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,800
 then when I take the week off, we'll do best of episodes.

44
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,600
 I think that'd be a really cool idea.

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,800
 Let's go ahead though and move on to our first topic.

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,000
 We are headed out to the internet.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
 We're just sitting down at your computer.

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
 No need for a vehicle.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
 Just walk over to a computer.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,200
 Do it.

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
 I'm not gonna continue this podcast until you're sitting at a computer.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,800
 Okay, there you go.

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
 Thank you for following my instructions.

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,800
 I appreciate it.

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,400
 And you're gonna go and you're gonna search for a library.

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
 Type it in.

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,000
 I'm not gonna tell you.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
 You can check the show notes.

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,200
 What we're gonna do, I'm not gonna actually read the address to you.

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,200
 What we're doing is we are going to Newberry Library in Chicago.

61
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,000
 So, bing!

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,400
 Now we've, this has become a magic school bus episode, by the way.

63
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
 Now we get sucked into the computer and now we're in the library.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,600
 We're in Newberry Library in Chicago.

65
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,200
 We get mugged immediately upon arriving in Chicago.

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,400
 We're like, "Ah, should have stayed online!"

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
 Get forced to the ground.

68
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,000
 They take our wallets, run out of the library.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,200
 And that was actually the librarian who was mugging us.

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
 Chicago is quite a brutal city.

71
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,800
 But we're here to find three books.

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
 Three spell books.

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,800
 The Book of Magical Charms.

74
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,400
 That's pretty self-explanatory.

75
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,800
 You're like, "Hmm, I wonder what's in that book?"

76
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,200
 It's probably full of magical charms.

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,400
 The other one was Cases of Conscience concerning Witchcraft.

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,800
 That one apparently is Should We or Should We Not Hang Witches?

79
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,200
 I guess in that book there's a story about a guy going, "Hmm,

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,000
 "probably shouldn't have hung all those women the book."

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,800
 That's what that is.

82
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,200
 And then the last book, it seems odd.

83
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
 Seems like an odd title for a magical text.

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,200
 And this is one of those things that you could be walking through a library.

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
 You could walk right by it, not even know it's magical.

86
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
 It's called the Common Place Book.

87
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
 The Common Place Book.

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,200
 So, all of these books are written in the 1600s.

89
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,000
 They believe they were all written by the same two people.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,200
 So, they're written in a combination of Old-Timey English and Latin.

91
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
 The pages are all worn out and yellowed and gross and stuff like that.

92
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,000
 And so, Newberry Library.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
 That rhymes.

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
 Why didn't I pick up on that?

95
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
 Newberry Library.

96
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,800
 Doesn't matter.

97
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
 That's what the new-- Sorry.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
 Just thought it was interesting.

99
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,800
 If I ever need a rap lyric, I'm like, "Yo, I'll take you to the library.

100
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,600
 "Oh, and then I'll eat you like a newberry."

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
 See, I like it.

102
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
 I got flows.

103
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,000
 What was I saying before the freestyle started?

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Oh, oh, what was I-- Oh, yeah, yeah.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
 So, these books at the library, right?

106
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,200
 Newberry Library has-- I can't not be able to say that anymore without laughing.

107
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
 Newberry Library has these books.

108
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,600
 And they go, "We need to help translating these.

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
 "Why don't we crowdsource them?"

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
 They actually have a whole website dedicated to crowdsourcing translations.

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
 So, I think this is something they've done before.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 But they have released images of all of these texts online.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 You type it into a little text bar at the bottom.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,600
 So, you can actually translate it real time.

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,400
 And then all of the possible translations goes to a team.

116
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,200
 And they-- That way, you just can't write, you know, like, stupid stuff all day long.

117
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,600
 They all go to a team and then they figure out,

118
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
 "Oh, this is probably the most logical one, or let's take this sentence from this one,

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,200
 "this sentence from another one."

120
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,600
 And then that way, the books will be available digitally for anyone to read.

121
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,400
 And people have already started translating a lot of this stuff.

122
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,200
 So, this is some of the stuff they've come across.

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
 They love these.

124
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,000
 They're spells on how to get rid of a toothache.

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,400
 You're like, "Oh, that's awesome."

126
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
 But they require a dead man's tooth.

127
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
 Apparently, you take the tooth of a dead man.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,800
 Which, I mean, technically, you know, actually, that raises a good question.

129
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,600
 How-- How does a spell know if the dude's dead?

130
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,400
 Like, if I find a tooth on the ground and the guy's still alive, would the spell work?

131
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
 If-- So, do they do teeth transplants?

132
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,000
 Let's say that I die and some guy really likes my tooth.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,600
 So, he takes his tooth out, puts my tooth in, and then throws his tooth on the ground.

134
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,600
 This is like, what is it, the ship of Agamemnon or whatever, that philosopher's thing.

135
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,900
 If a living man puts a dead man's tooth in his mouth and then throws his tooth on the

136
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:31,500
 ground, wouldn't the dead man's tooth in his mouth now become part of a living body?

137
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,500
 What if he took his tooth and put it in my dead skull?

138
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,700
 How would the spell ten years later know which one was which?

139
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,200
 But anyways, that's a thought experiment.

140
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,600
 Use that at your next dinner party.

141
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
 Hey, guys, guys.

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,600
 Sorry to interrupt the conversation, but I have a philosophical question for you.

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,600
 Let's say I find a dead man and I need a new tooth.

144
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,100
 Also, they have a spell on how to get rid of the cramp, which is not like the awesome

145
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,000
 name for some new super villain.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It was like the old-timey name for menstrual cramps.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,200
 So put away your, I know you just sketched out the cramp fighting Superman, this giant,

148
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,420
 just uncomfortable force punching Superman in the face.

149
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,600
 The cramp is menstrual cramps.

150
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,920
 Apparently you take some sort of rag and you just lay it on your thigh.

151
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,220
 So there you go, ladies.

152
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
 Try that out.

153
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,100
 And if that doesn't work, it's find a dead man, pull his tooth out.

154
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,700
 Try that as well.

155
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
 Cheat at dice games.

156
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,600
 You're like, Jason, these are stupid.

157
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,700
 You're telling me that they have these magical texts that I can help translate, possibly

158
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
 into the world.

159
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,640
 And you're telling me how to cure two thakes, but I have to dig up a human corpse.

160
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,840
 How to fight a menstrual cramp.

161
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
 And how to...

162
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
 You know what?

163
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,880
 I'm wondering why...

164
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,200
 Here's a question for you.

165
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
 Don't get mad.

166
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,320
 Don't get mad.

167
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,840
 Do superheroes like Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel menstruate?

168
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,120
 Now I'm not saying I'm not making a joke.

169
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
 And I'm not rippin'.

170
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,800
 I'm not saying like the Legion of Dooms like, "Hey guys, look out.

171
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,040
 Wonder Woman's menstruating this week, so she's gonna be super aggressive.

172
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,720
 I'm not making a joke."

173
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,720
 In the continuity of the comic books, has that ever been addressed?

174
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:25,040
 Has that ever been addressed where you have Spider Woman or Captain Marvel or Rescue,

175
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,480
 who's the female Iron Man?

176
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,800
 Any of these characters, Wonder Woman, I already said, Black Canary, Magic, anyone.

177
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,080
 Anyone ever said, "There doesn't have to be a plot point."

178
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,600
 I'm not saying that the point of the comic book was that Superman has to like fly around

179
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,440
 the world looking for a tampon for Wonder Woman.

180
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
 I'm not saying that.

181
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,120
 I'm just saying, has it ever been addressed ever in the continuity?

182
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,280
 'Cause some of these characters have been around, Wonder Woman's been around for like

183
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,200
 50 years at this point.

184
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
 Captain Marvel's been around since the 1970s, the female Captain Marvel.

185
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,280
 Magic's been around since the early 80s.

186
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:07,560
 All of these characters, have they ever once addressed the fact that they're like, "Ugh,

187
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
 my stomach hurts."

188
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,240
 Like, has that ever been, I don't think so.

189
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,480
 And it's not a huge deal.

190
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,360
 They never announced that when Spider-Man has explosive diarrhea.

191
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,600
 Like, there's bodily functions, but that's just weird now that I think about it.

192
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,720
 And, I guess it raises this question, does Wonder Woman even menstruate?

193
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,040
 Like being an Amazonian, she can have children, right?

194
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,720
 Like, I don't know if she's ever had a kid in like alternate continuity.

195
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,160
 But I mean, again, you're going chasing Deanna Troy.

196
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,280
 Did she ever have a, I don't know, okay?

197
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,200
 Maybe it's just kind of blowing my mind because like you can look and say, yeah, Princess

198
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,800
 Leia probably has a menstruate.

199
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,800
 I've already heard the clicks of half of my audience just be like, "Nope.

200
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,640
 I'll wait for tomorrow's episode.

201
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,200
 This is way too much."

202
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
 The way too much.

203
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,280
 Yeah, I just wanted to hear about spell books.

204
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,240
 And I was talking about, I don't think it's a shameful thing that women have menstruation

205
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
 or periods.

206
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,560
 I don't know why they don't mention it.

207
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,400
 But I guess, because it's just this natural thing that happens, but I guess that you,

208
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,760
 people don't want to, people don't want to read about it.

209
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,840
 People don't want to have like Wonder Woman being like, after I defeat Evil, then I have

210
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,520
 to go to the grocery store real quick because I don't.

211
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,560
 Like where would she even carry her tampons at in her costume?

212
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,080
 Like she doesn't have a purse.

213
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,560
 Her plane is invisible.

214
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,640
 You would just see her flying by and then some maxi pads just like floating where the

215
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,920
 glove, you assume the glove compartment would be.

216
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,480
 I mean, she flies an invisible jet.

217
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,080
 So I'm just, I guess they just never menstruate.

218
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,120
 I guess female characters never menstruate.

219
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,680
 But you would assume, you wouldn't assume that none of these fictional characters ever

220
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,920
 go to the bathroom at all.

221
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,840
 Like Spider-Man is just full of feces from 1963 to today.

222
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
 He's never pooped.

223
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,280
 Like you assume those characters pooped.

224
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,440
 So you would assume the female characters would also menstruate.

225
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,040
 But yeah, just weird.

226
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,560
 What were we talking about?

227
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,880
 Yes, spell books.

228
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
 Spell books.

229
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,520
 Let's get back to spell books.

230
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,840
 So yes, yes.

231
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,720
 With me until you're done fast forwarding.

232
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,960
 Okay, perfect.

233
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,480
 You can also cheat at dice.

234
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
 Don't fast forward yet.

235
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
 I got some good spells.

236
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,640
 They also have spells on summoning spirits.

237
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,680
 You can conjure up an ancient demon using this spell book.

238
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,880
 And it was all like really weird language.

239
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,000
 Well, I mean, a lot of it was Latin.

240
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,280
 I thought about reading it on the podcast, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it.

241
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,760
 It also teaches you how to invoke the seal of Solomon, which I should actually do an

242
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,520
 episode on Solomon, King Solomon.

243
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
 Biblical figure.

244
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,720
 And you guys are like great, not another one of those episodes, but he's, it's like,

245
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,760
 it's one of those things like in the Bible, he's like, "Eh, chop that baby in half."

246
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,920
 And people are like, "No, no, don't chop the baby in half."

247
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,160
 And he's like, "I've done good work today.

248
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,480
 I found out who the real mother is."

249
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
 That's how people kind of know King Solomon.

250
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,160
 Why is this man his big biblical figure?

251
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,440
 What a lot of people aren't aware of is that apparently he had a ring and a seal that allowed

252
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,800
 him to control demons, like actual like Satan, like fallen angels who, who sided against God

253
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,400
 with Lucifer go to hell.

254
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,960
 Solomon, King Solomon somehow figured out to turn them into slaves and had them build

255
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,120
 these great works and work.

256
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,400
 It's as slaves, they're like mining gold for him.

257
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,640
 Like not like, "Phew, go give me some gold as Riyadh."

258
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,560
 And comes giving gold.

259
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,840
 He's like, "Ball Barath, you grab this pickaxe, put on this little miner's hat and dig for

260
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
 five weeks in a row."

261
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,760
 And the demons are like, "Ah, never mind."

262
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
 That's an interesting story.

263
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,640
 I'll see if I can dig more information up on it.

264
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,080
 But anyway, so you too, if you have this book, if you can translate this section, or actually

265
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,960
 this part's translated, if you can just read it, you can invoke the seal of Solomon, get

266
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,320
 some nice demon slaves.

267
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,480
 I'm not recommending doing that.

268
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,320
 Not, do not get a bunch of demon slaves, end up getting possessed and going to prison

269
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,080
 for doing awful things and saying, "But dead rabbit radio told me to."

270
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
 Don't mess with it.

271
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,080
 But I'm just saying that according to this book there, you can do it.

272
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,580
 But don't.

273
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,580
 Don't.

274
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,580
 Don't is what I'm saying.

275
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,600
 Is I can already tell you guys are googling Newberry Library, you're like, "I need some

276
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,440
 demon slaves."

277
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
 Let's go ahead.

278
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,000
 If you know any Latin or old-time English or you just want to spend a fun rainy afternoon

279
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,360
 summoning dark spirits to completely ruin your life or simply getting rid of a toothache,

280
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,280
 follow the show notes, you'll be able to go down there, or just Google Newberry Library.

281
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,840
 Actually go to the show notes because when I went to Newberry Library, it took me a bit

282
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,800
 of time to find that actual section.

283
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,440
 If you go through the show notes, it'll take you directly to the translation part of those

284
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
 books.

285
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,880
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.

286
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,520
 We're walking out of Newberry Library.

287
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,400
 See you guys later.

288
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,720
 Librarians are like, "Spending our money, throwing it up in the air.

289
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,520
 They're like, "Making it rain with other people's money."

290
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,680
 We're like, "Ugh."

291
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
 So I don't have any money.

292
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,240
 I'm assuming you don't have any money either.

293
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
 You had a second wallet.

294
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,640
 You go, "I know traveling with Jason is quite dangerous.

295
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
 We've been assaulted.

296
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,400
 He's pushed me into piles of poop before.

297
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,360
 I got my second wallet.

298
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,840
 With is wrapped in a Ziploc baggie in case I get pushed into poop again."

299
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,960
 I'm like, "Awesome."

300
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,640
 So we are traveling, you're paying.

301
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,800
 We're traveling to Bismarck, North Dakota.

302
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,520
 So let's buy some private plane tickets.

303
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,240
 Like Jason, can't we just fly commercial?

304
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,240
 Did I ever do the story actually about that guy, that minister?

305
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,480
 I think it was one of the big televangelists.

306
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,880
 And I don't know if I covered this yet.

307
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,960
 He said, I was about to make a joke about it, there was this televangelist minister who

308
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,160
 won't fly commercial planes.

309
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,200
 He had to buy private jets.

310
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
 And they asked why.

311
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,040
 And he said, because a flying, a commercial plane is a tube full of demons.

312
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,680
 That's where all the demons fly commercial.

313
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,840
 So he needed a private jet.

314
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,160
 I should, I don't think I've covered that story yet.

315
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
 That's the story.

316
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
 That's basically all it is.

317
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,480
 Some weirdo saying something.

318
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,760
 And they asked him to clarify that.

319
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,800
 And he wasn't saying everyone on a commercial jet is a demon, but demons always fly commercial

320
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,640
 jets.

321
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,360
 So it's one of those weird things.

322
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
 So anyway, he flies private jet.

323
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,160
 He has like two or three private jets.

324
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,320
 Anyways, we're flying private because I don't want to be stuck in a tube full of demons.

325
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,400
 You're like, considering we just talked about evoking them, definitely risk.

326
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,000
 So yes, you spend your life savings or maybe your allowance.

327
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,800
 I don't know how rich you are to get us a private jet.

328
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,200
 We're flying up to Bismarck, North Dakota.

329
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,400
 And we're going back in time.

330
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,600
 This is a really, really fancy jet.

331
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,920
 We're going back in time.

332
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,320
 That's why I got you your life savings.

333
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,400
 We're going back in time to the year 1989.

334
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,000
 So Bobby Brown is humping around.

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,600
 Ace of Base is a few years away.

336
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,440
 And we are in Fargo, North Dakota.

337
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,640
 It's February 26th, 1989.

338
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,440
 And there's this dude named Roy Hagel.

339
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,840
 He's 38 years old.

340
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,360
 He's from Bismarck, North Dakota.

341
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,760
 He's in Fargo.

342
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,920
 He's at a bowling tournament.

343
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,240
 And this is the last time he has seen a life, but not the last time he's ever heard of.

344
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,200
 Because on March 6th, he calls a buddy from Arizona.

345
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,920
 So he's in Fargo, North Dakota.

346
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,680
 Then what, 12 days later, he's in Arizona.

347
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,760
 He calls up his buddy in Bismarck, his hometown.

348
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,280
 And he goes, listen, I've been to nine states in nine days and I'm out of money.

349
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,640
 But you know, I'm going to get back to Bismarck.

350
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,840
 I'm headed back to Bismarck.

351
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,640
 But he's like, OK, yeah, come back here.

352
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,000
 Odd phone call to make.

353
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,480
 Four days later, though, his car is found at Death Valley Monuments.

354
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,520
 So it's exactly what it sounds like.

355
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
 It's Death Valley.

356
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,640
 It's the place you don't want to go.

357
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,320
 We've covered it before.

358
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,360
 At the very least, it's a complete wasteland full of heat and vultures and buzzards and

359
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,680
 Wiley Coyote and Roadrunner.

360
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,880
 At the most, there's been stories of hidden civilizations underneath that.

361
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,160
 But his car is found there.

362
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,600
 He's not.

363
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:15,240
 They see when authorities get to the car, the keys and his wallet are in the front

364
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,640
 seat.

365
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,760
 And as you see me steal his wallet, you're like, shaking your finger at me.

366
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,000
 I'm like, dude, I don't have any money.

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Those librarians.

368
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,200
 I dig his wallet.

369
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,320
 We also see, because now we're there, with the investigators, there is footprints leading

370
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
 away from this car.

371
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,600
 Now, what's interesting is the news reports don't say the state of the car.

372
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,520
 The news reports don't really say what the state of the car is as in that a breakdown

373
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
 was it out of gas?

374
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
 Who knows.

375
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,040
 But we see this car and there's footprints leading away from it.

376
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,920
 We and the authorities follow the footprints for six miles.

377
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,920
 And then just an arid desert.

378
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,520
 Nothing past six miles.

379
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
 Which is quite a long journey.

380
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,080
 I wonder if they followed them on feet.

381
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,400
 Or at a certain point, they're like, let's go get the car.

382
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,000
 Let's just drive alongside these things.

383
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,720
 Now the police were looking into this.

384
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
 There was one suspicious thing.

385
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,520
 He's never been seen since.

386
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,480
 The police are still investigating this.

387
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,960
 There was one suspicious thing.

388
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,680
 When Roy was a child, his father disappeared, came back and then disappeared for good.

389
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,440
 Never saw him again.

390
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,920
 People thought maybe he was trying to emulate his father.

391
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,880
 Maybe he was trying to start a new life.

392
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,120
 And that may be true.

393
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,400
 If you do decide to leave it all behind and start a new life, don't start it in the direction

394
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
 of a desert.

395
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,840
 Don't be like, "Hmmm, fortune is that way."

396
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,360
 And you're like walking into doom.

397
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,200
 You're like, "Hmmm, I wonder what's over the next ridge.

398
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 It's a volcano."

399
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,000
 Like, if you're going to start a new life, start it in Iowa or San Diego or something.

400
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
 Never been found since.

401
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,960
 1994, August 2nd.

402
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,680
 So he was from Bismarck.

403
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,240
 He was headed back to Bismarck.

404
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,800
 And he went on this weird nine-state and nine-day journey.

405
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,000
 August 2nd, 1994.

406
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,400
 We're in the city of Bismarck now.

407
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,560
 Michelle Joulson.

408
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,920
 She's hanging out.

409
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
 She has a job.

410
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,400
 She worked at like a casino.

411
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,080
 She goes, "Hey, I got a little baby.

412
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,960
 Got a little baby boy here.

413
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,160
 I'm going to drop you off with your grandpa and I got to go take care of some business.

414
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,120
 I got to go get a paycheck and maybe I'll play a little dice.

415
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,600
 Maybe I'll go to the casino a little bit."

416
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,320
 And the little three-year-old's like, "Yay!

417
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,960
 I'll see you, mommy.

418
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,680
 You're not going to disappear, right?"

419
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,160
 And mommy's like, "No."

420
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
 That was dark.

421
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,520
 That was super dark.

422
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,040
 Baby's like, "What does dark mean?"

423
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,920
 Mommy's like, "Just ignore it.

424
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,280
 Ignore this insensitive podcast."

425
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,920
 And she takes the baby to grandpa and says, "Can you watch the baby?

426
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,840
 I got to pay for this paycheck."

427
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
 Grandpa's like, "Yeah.

428
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
 Are you going to disappear?"

429
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
 He's also has a baby voice.

430
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,320
 "Are you going to come back or are you going to disappear?"

431
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,840
 And mommy's like, "Why does the people keep asking me that?

432
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
 I'll be fine."

433
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,360
 But she's not.

434
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
 She disappears.

435
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,320
 She's never seen again.

436
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,920
 And she's reported missing within hours.

437
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,520
 Like she says, "I'm going to go do this paycheck.

438
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,240
 I'm going to go play bingo, not cards, not dice.

439
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
 Sorry, I misspoke."

440
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
 Totally.

441
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
 And I'm sure right when I said that people go, "Mmm, mafia.

442
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,840
 Yep, she's going to get abducted by the mafia."

443
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
 No.

444
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
 There's no bingo mafia.

445
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,160
 There's no blue-haired mafia.

446
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
 There might be actually.

447
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:25,680
 Actually, that'd be a good idea for like a really terrible comedy starring Melissa McCarthy,

448
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:32,760
 where you have this bingo hall that is like being run poorly.

449
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,240
 You have a bingo hall that's kind of like in disrepair.

450
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,200
 Melissa McCarthy comes in to drop her mom off and she realizes, "Whoa, we can make a

451
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
 lot of money doing this stuff.

452
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,040
 Like if we took a little bit off the top, but first we have to make this place look

453
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
 better."

454
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,000
 So it starts off like a lovable comedy where there's a business, like there's a, there's

455
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,200
 like a bloodthirsty businessman played by the rock in his first role as a villain.

456
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,440
 He's trying to tear down the bingo hall.

457
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,640
 And Melissa McCarthy has to hold like bake sales, but like some stupid old woman puts

458
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,120
 a bunch of her son's weed in the brownies so everyone's tripping out.

459
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,520
 And then they hold like a bikini car wash so there's like this montage of all these

460
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,120
 80-year-old women spraying cars down with hoses and stuff like that.

461
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,640
 And it starts off like a little rascals.

462
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,480
 And that's not in the little rascals, but I hope it's not in the little rascals.

463
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,480
 It starts off as that type of comedy where these guys are trying to beat this businessman.

464
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,120
 And then about say 45 minutes an hour into the movie, you're like, "Just get back to

465
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
 the same people."

466
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,240
 About 45 minutes to an hour into the movie, the rock admits defeat and falls in love with

467
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,980
 an old woman at the bingo hall.

468
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,320
 So like his character arc comes full stop.

469
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
 He goes, "I don't know why I was trying to tear this.

470
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,600
 My great grandma used to play here."

471
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,880
 That's not the woman he's dating.

472
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
 That's not the woman he's dating.

473
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,240
 My great grandma used to play here, but I found true love with this 80-year-old woman.

474
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,480
 Everything's going to work out.

475
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,600
 And then the last half hour is Melissa McCarthy becoming like straight up casino level mobster,

476
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,720
 like chopping old people's fingers off if they can't bake their bingo bills.

477
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,640
 Just like dunking their heads in like hot jars of mylanta.

478
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,600
 She's like, "Pfft, how's your stomach now?"

479
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,280
 And it becomes just like this brutal, the first hour you're clapping and laughing at like

480
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,540
 stoned old women in bikinis.

481
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,920
 And then the ending is her like forcing old, selling old women into sexual slavery.

482
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,760
 And you're just like, and it would be called, the movie would just be called bingo with

483
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,880
 a exclamation point.

484
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,920
 And the bottom of the exclamation point is a bingo number.

485
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,600
 So everyone's like, "Oh, this is going to be like a total romp."

486
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,520
 And then it just ends with, and it ends with Melissa McCarthy shot of Melissa McCarthy sitting

487
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,240
 on a throne made out of bingo cards.

488
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,880
 That's just, and then it just, there's no credits.

489
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,200
 The movie just ends.

490
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,520
 So anyways, I think make that movie, Hollywood, make that movie.

491
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,920
 Anyways, Michelle Joulson is missing.

492
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,320
 And she's never seen again.

493
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,760
 They find her on August, and that happened on August 2nd.

494
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,640
 On August 8th, they find her car at a comfort inn in Bismarck.

495
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,680
 And they had been looking for the car from the beginning.

496
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,640
 And one of the detectives on the case was known for finding stolen cars like that, like

497
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,680
 just really, really good at tracking stuff down.

498
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,600
 And he said, "I don't believe that car was there."

499
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,840
 He goes, "I can't say for sure that we specifically checked that parking lot of that comfort in,

500
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,560
 but I'm almost for sure that that car was not there on August 2nd."

501
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,440
 Because again, like I said, they reported her missing after hours.

502
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,720
 Her car had nothing in it, except for a half-eaten gas station sandwich.

503
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,680
 And one thing the detectives thought was weird, they found Skoria, which is like a pumice-type

504
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,160
 rock in the intake manifold of the car.

505
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,400
 So it's kind of like this car was driving in an area with a lot of Skoria.

506
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,600
 There is not a lot of Skoria in Bismarck.

507
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,200
 There is Skoria in North Dakota.

508
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,800
 There's Skoria all over.

509
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,160
 But an interesting place where there's a lot of Skoria, DeFalli.

510
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,840
 And you're like, "Jason, come on, seriously, these missing people took place years apart."

511
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,800
 One wasn't even in the city of Bismarck, he was from the city of Bismarck.

512
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 And there's Skoria all over the United States.

513
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,120
 Why are you even connecting these two?

514
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,000
 It's kind of bizarre.

515
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,120
 To that I say.

516
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,480
 November 16th, 1996, Bismarck, North Dakota.

517
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,400
 Now North Dakota in 1996 had a population of 54,000 people.

518
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,920
 And I was looking at this, and they do have a couple hundred missing people every year.

519
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,320
 But the majority of them are found right away.

520
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,800
 And then there's maybe like 20 or 30 where the detectives have to do some sort of follow-up.

521
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,880
 And then these cases have never been solved.

522
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,520
 The story of Roy Hagel, the story of Michelle, and the story I'm about to tell you, of Sandra

523
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,200
 Mary Jacobson and John Jacobson, her five-year-old son.

524
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,600
 She is headed to Bismarck to go to dinner with her mom.

525
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,200
 She's in a neighboring town, she's driving to Bismarck.

526
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,480
 And she calls the police in Bismarck.

527
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,360
 911, what's your emergency?

528
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:28,280
 I was just driving through center, center North Dakota.

529
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:34,960
 And I saw a ritual.

530
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,520
 I saw a ritual.

531
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,800
 I mean, I don't know.

532
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 It looked satanic.

533
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,400
 There's something wrong out here.

534
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,520
 I swear there's a bunch of sane worshipers out here and they were having a ritual and

535
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
 I saw them.

536
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,400
 And I don't know if they saw me, but I saw them.

537
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,520
 I'm not in center anymore.

538
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
 I'm headed to Bismarck.

539
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:05,200
 I'm going to go see my mom, but I think there's something bad going on out here in center.

540
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,960
 Now the police go, that's really bizarre.

541
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,240
 And they say, why didn't you call the police in center?

542
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,880
 Why didn't you call the police in center?

543
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,320
 And she says, I don't trust the police in center.

544
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,240
 And I don't trust the police that are closer to them as well.

545
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,040
 I trust you guys.

546
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,320
 Because I think they may be part of it.

547
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,920
 I think there's a conspiracy you see.

548
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,440
 There's just satanic conspiracy.

549
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,480
 I don't trust them.

550
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,920
 Sandra does have, according to articles, it doesn't go into specifics, but I think we

551
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
 can imagine.

552
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,240
 She has issues with mental health.

553
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,240
 So that could be she has full blown delusions about things.

554
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,960
 It could be anxiety or depression.

555
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,400
 Both of those would be, and a whole plethora of other symptoms would be considered mental

556
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,760
 health issues.

557
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,400
 Someone who is constantly anxious or depressed would be listed as having mental health issues

558
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,720
 as is someone who had schizophrenia or manic depressive bipolar stuff like that.

559
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,880
 It's all in that umbrella.

560
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,280
 So we just hear words like mental health issues.

561
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,960
 Not necessarily mental illness.

562
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,720
 But when she got to her mother's house, her mom immediately could tell something was wrong

563
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,360
 with her daughter.

564
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,960
 Which makes me think that the mental health issues are a little more serious than she

565
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,400
 just has clinical depression.

566
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,680
 But the mom realizes something's wrong with the daughter and the mom says, we need to

567
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
 go to the hospital.

568
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,040
 Let's go to the hospital and just get you checked out.

569
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
 It's not going to be a big deal.

570
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
 Everything's fine.

571
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,760
 She goes, okay, we go to the hospital, but can I get gas?

572
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,320
 Put gas in my car first.

573
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,640
 The mom goes, sure.

574
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,000
 The daughter, Sandra, puts her five year old son in her car, drives to go get gas.

575
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,800
 She is seen putting gas in her car.

576
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,680
 But all of that happened about 7.30.

577
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
 She goes to get gas.

578
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,960
 The mom's at home.

579
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,160
 By 10pm she calls the police and says my daughter and my grandson are missing.

580
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:15,120
 And again, let this and the story of Michelle be a wake up call for you.

581
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:22,200
 You do not under any circumstances have to wait 24 hours to report a missing person.

582
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,600
 That is not true.

583
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,800
 That is probably one of the biggest dumbest myths that have ever come out of Hollywood,

584
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
 honestly.

585
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,640
 I think that has cost people their lives.

586
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,520
 It's a narrative device in stories to make the characters go out and search instead of

587
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,840
 having a massive police force do the search.

588
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,360
 That is an adventures and babysitting plot device.

589
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,440
 That is not real life.

590
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,120
 If you believe someone is missing, you can call police very, very quickly.

591
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,880
 You will never call up and the police go, you gotta wait 24 hours.

592
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,600
 That is 100% an invention of Hollywood and I think it's probably one of the most destructive

593
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,960
 myths out of Hollywood.

594
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,480
 She goes missing.

595
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,280
 The next day her car is found at Centennial Beach, North Dakota.

596
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,920
 No Sandra.

597
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,040
 No John.

598
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,680
 And yes, Centennial Beach is at a river.

599
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:20,840
 So the cops get there and they go, we're looking for this missing person.

600
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,440
 The mom said she had some mental health issues.

601
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,080
 She parked by a river.

602
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,600
 No one's in the car.

603
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,040
 They couldn't search the river.

604
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,360
 At the time the weather was bad.

605
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,720
 We're in November.

606
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,160
 It's North Dakota and it's a raging river.

607
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:43,040
 They go, if the bodies went into the river, we'll never find them.

608
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:51,400
 The car is found with a door wide open.

609
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:58,920
 Keys in the ignition purse on the seat.

610
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,200
 These three cases have all taken place seven years apart.

611
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,560
 We had 89, 94 and now 96.

612
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,280
 And they were all linked in quite a few auto ways.

613
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:18,000
 All the victims are related to Bismarck, Bismarck and North Dakota.

614
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,280
 All of the victims, one of the main things found about them is their vehicle.

615
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,680
 They're not getting snatched out of their house.

616
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,280
 Their vehicle is in a location where it normally would not be.

617
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,120
 All of them had items left on the driver's side seat.

618
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:40,760
 Two of them specifically keys and purse wallet where they carry their money.

619
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,520
 These articles, the reason why I came across these three cases, these were written in an

620
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,880
 article called missing person cases are not forgotten.

621
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,480
 It was written by a reporter named Jenny Michael.

622
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
 She wrote this in February 22, 2008.

623
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,560
 And it's really the last recorded article about these three cases.

624
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,520
 I've seen follow up articles on one of the cases or the other cases, but only this article

625
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,840
 ever put all three of them together.

626
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,000
 Originally I was looking up the story of Sandra Jacobson and I found this article and I was

627
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,240
 like it's just a missing story that has the satanic cult in it.

628
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
 It'll be interesting.

629
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,120
 And as I was researching it, I came across this article and we start to see these connections.

630
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
 Coincidences?

631
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
 Sure.

632
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
 Sure.

633
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:31,240
 A woman who has a mental health issue sees a satanic cult performing some sort of ritual

634
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,840
 and has enough interaction with law enforcement in her area.

635
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,840
 She doesn't trust them.

636
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,160
 She thinks they're part of the conspiracy.

637
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,560
 So right there you go, she's just having some mental health issues.

638
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,240
 But when we have a string of missing people who have these coincidences, who have these

639
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,880
 similarities, disappear off the face of the earth, never to be found.

640
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,320
 All with abandoned vehicles, all with items on their seat, all either headed to or living

641
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,400
 in Bismarck.

642
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:09,600
 I'm not saying I do, as a normal practice, I do not take to heart what people say in

643
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,720
 the throes of panic.

644
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,400
 And a woman's frantic 911 call while she's driving through North Dakota talking about

645
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:22,120
 seeing a satanic ritual and a county-wide conspiracy is not something that you would

646
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,920
 normally put a lot of faith in.

647
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:32,960
 But when you have a total of four missing people, possibly connected, and then you have

648
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:42,080
 stories of a satanic cult operating in North Dakota, there's a difference between being

649
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,280
 afraid of coincidences and having a little bit of common sense.

650
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:53,800
 So if you live in the city of Bismarck, or anywhere in the middle of nowhere, be a little

651
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
 more careful.

652
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,000
 Because we don't know why any of these people disappeared.

653
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,240
 They could be completely random, completely unrelated, and just tragic circumstances.

654
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:13,080
 Or they could have stumbled onto a dark secret in the middle of the night.

655
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,760
 They could have known too much.

656
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:24,480
 And they just had to disappear before they said too much.
