 Pick up a box of Honey Bunches of Oats in the cereal aisle today!

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.320
 An old timey ghost realizes sometimes the best way to hurt somebody is to hurt their

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.440
 pocketbook.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.600
 We say goodbye to a legendary and feared author.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.640
 Then we meet a young woman who met her soulmate and couldn't wait to begin a new life with

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.480
 the one she loves the most.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.360
 When an alien appeared and told her, "You can't get married."

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.480
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:09.480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.480
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter, I'm having a great day.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.520
 Hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys got a lot of cool plans for

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.680
 this weekend.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.200
 We got so much stuff to cover, first off let's give a shout out to our fan art Friday submission.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.360
 This one actually we used to use a lot.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.200
 Until we went to the Ash Black logo pretty much across the board and now we're doing

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 the fan art Friday.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.680
 So this is from John.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.880
 Long time listeners of the show will remember this artwork used to be all over the place.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.120
 So John thank you so much for, I think on YouTube you'll still see it a lot too, but

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.520
 John thank you so much for sending this art in.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.880
 Really really appreciate it.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.080
 And then let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters, the long time

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.120
 listener of the show, our Forrest Finn correspondent coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.120
 It's Beatrice Lava.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.080
 Everyone give a round of applause to Beatrice.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.360
 Really really appreciate your continued support for the show.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.800
 She's also my TikTok consultant.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.880
 I've been trying to do more stuff on TikTok, just limited to the amount of time.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.880
 I'm not doing dances.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 Before you guys all go check out the TikTok channel.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.720
 It's not me doing Fortnite dances.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.240
 I'm trying to take episodes and shrink them down to a minute.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.320
 And I've been really good with it because I know that's what you guys love most.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.840
 You guys want the episodes to get shorter.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.080
 I'm taking stories and making them a minute long.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.080
 Being really good at it.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.000
 It's just a matter of time of putting the pictures together and stuff like that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.320
 We're going to do a lot of TikTok in the future.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.640
 And Beatrice has really helped out on that front.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.280
 So Beatrice let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.920
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.680
 We are headed out to North Carolina.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.560
 Beatrice is expertly flying this vehicle.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560
 She's done it before.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.000
 We're headed out to Caribou's County in North Carolina.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.440
 Specifically, old skin flint mine.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.880
 This is actually I think the last holdover of I had that ghost theme week.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.080
 And then it spilled over until the week after it.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 I was just happy I was able to find all these ghost stories.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.400
 This one also takes place in North Carolina at a mine.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.720
 I could have all fit him into one week, but it was too much haunted mine for a week.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720
 The story is really awesome.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.320
 I just didn't want you to guys be like, oh, me oh, mine.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.720
 Too many ghost stories.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720
 Do you like that?

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.920
 Do you like the Friday puns?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.720
 John's like giving me my artwork back.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.360
 We're landing in Caribou's County the year 1799.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.600
 And that was when a 12 year old boy found a big rock in the water.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.640
 There's a bunch of rocks, but this one was gold and shiny.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.240
 Paul, look at what I found.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.560
 I found this rock.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.520
 And the dad goes, oh, that's kind of cool.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.760
 My kid obviously has some weird fetish for rocks, but we'll deal with that in the future.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.280
 Right now, why don't we use that rock as a doorstop?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.400
 And then one day a dude was walking by and he goes, that's weird.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.800
 How come this door is state open?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.000
 They're like, well, if you look down, if you crane your neck down, you'll see there is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.480
 a doorstop there.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.080
 And the guy goes, oh, and he realizes this doorstop is a hunk of gold.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.040
 This is when the first gold rush in America started in North Carolina.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.320
 You guys are like, Jason, you should have given us this information last week when you

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.040
 talked about all these North Carolina goldmine stories.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.240
 The problem was that information was in the notes for this story.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.120
 Wasn't in the notes for those other stories.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.320
 So this guy goes, tell you what, I'll give you $3.50 for that doorstop.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.480
 And the guy's like, yeah, sure, that's a lot of money back then.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.880
 I mean, that's a lot of money right now.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.160
 And so he pays it, but then eventually the homeowner finds out that that rock, that shiny

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.520
 gold colored rock was actually gold worth $3,500 in old timey money.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.860
 So that's like Scrooge McDuck bucks.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.600
 So eventually he's able to track down the guy.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.080
 I think he did get some more money for that doorstop.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.640
 But a bunch of other people started coming into the area, the first major gold rush in

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.000
 American history.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.240
 North Carolina was the leading producer of gold until 1848 when gold was discovered in

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.840
 California and people go, North Carolina, pew, this place sucks.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.000
 But before people realized that North Carolina wasn't where it's at, you had people from

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.360
 all over the world come to North Carolina to try to strike it rich.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.440
 They didn't have a rule though.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.280
 No slaves were allowed.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.520
 No slaves, this is interesting.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.040
 I didn't have thought about this because if you thought, think about it, the gold rush

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.120
 was during slavery times.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.120
 California wasn't a slave state, but North Carolina wasn't.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.160
 They had a rule.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.440
 No slaves were allowed in the mine because they were afraid that they would hide gold.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440
 Can you believe this?

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.480
 They were afraid that slaves would try to purchase their freedom and the freedom of

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.480
 their friends and family by finding gold and then coming back out of the cave and being

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.320
 like, I don't work for you anymore.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.320
 You have a big chunk of gold.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320
 They couldn't allow it.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.800
 They couldn't allow these people to actually be people.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.960
 So no slaves were allowed.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.240
 So they had to import labor from around the world and people wanted to come.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.360
 They wanted to try to make money.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 Enter Jonathan McIntosh.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.600
 He's the owner of the McIntosh mine.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.480
 450 foot deep mine.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.240
 It seems to be doing pretty well.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.320
 Lots of gold is coming out of it, but it's not enough for Jonathan McIntosh.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.920
 Because despite him saying, oh, we got the best timber in the world, we got the best,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.920
 we got the best other stuff that makes a mine function.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.200
 You want dynamite?

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.040
 Our dynamite is dynamite.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.480
 Everyone in the mine knew that Jonathan was a liar.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.640
 They'd go down there and they'd see the wood.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.840
 It wasn't rotting, but he would use very, very new timber.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.840
 So it wasn't strong enough.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.320
 They had seen that dynamite explode and they weren't impressed.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.560
 It was just like regular dynamite.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.160
 They knew that Jonathan was selling them a bill of goods.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.840
 He wasn't actually putting money into the mine, which you don't go down there to be

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840
 bedazzled, right?

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.080
 They weren't worried about the fact that it wasn't the jazziest place to work.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.720
 They weren't about their own safety.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.240
 And they could tell he was cutting corners.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.640
 So people were like, "I don't know."

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.040
 So as the mine got deeper and deeper, it was harder to find people to go down there.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.160
 There's a local miner named Joe McGee.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160
 He's an expert.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.640
 He's been doing this all of his life.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.240
 The first tunnel he crawled out of was his mother and he hasn't stopped crawling through

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.680
 tunnels since.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.880
 And he knows reputation of McIntosh Mine.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.200
 It is not safe.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.400
 But no one else is going deep into the mine.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.080
 Jonathan calls up Joe and says, "Hey, listen, I got a deal for you.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.880
 You go into my super safe mine at the deepest point and start digging and doing your mine

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.160
 magic.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.440
 And then everyone else will go down to join you because you're such a cool guy, Joe.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.440
 You're so cool.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.160
 Everyone will follow you."

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
 And Joe goes, "Listen, I know the stories.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.480
 Your mine is not safe.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.760
 You cut a bunch of corners.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.560
 But I will do it.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:01.040
 However, if I die, you have to pay my wife $1,000."

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.960
 Today would be the equivalent of about $30,000.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.640
 So pretty good life insurance policy.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.200
 Actually, that's kind of lame for a life insurance policy.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.280
 Anyways, Joe goes, "If I go down there and I die, you have to pay my wife $1,000."

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.800
 And Jonathan was kind of shocked.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.320
 How dare he say his mine isn't safe?

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.320
 What are you talking about?

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.360
 I mean, I don't go down there myself.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.880
 I wouldn't let any of my friends and family down there.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.880
 But it's totally safe.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.200
 And in fact, it's so safe I want you to know if you die, whatever that is, I'll give your

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.200
 wife $2,000.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.360
 Joe goes into the mine.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.360
 Couple days pass.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.240
 Hey, you don't remember that guy, Joe?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.640
 We used to kick it with all the time.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.480
 He was a really good miner and all that stuff.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.480
 Have you seen him lately?

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.480
 Uh-uh, no.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.480
 I thought he was hanging out with you.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.480
 No, I wish.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.480
 He was pretty cool.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.480
 Couple weeks go by.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.000
 Hey, dude, what are you doing, man?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 I thought you were Joe.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 I thought you were super cool.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 I don't really care about you.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.520
 Speaking of Joe, have you seen him?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.840
 No, dude, no one's seen Joe for weeks.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.200
 Not even his wife.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.680
 Joe must have left.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.500
 That's the only thing when you think of, I mean, we do know that he's working in a super

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.360
 dangerous industry, but maybe he just left and left his wife.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.240
 Oh, okay.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:17.000
 Now nobody knew about this arrangement, this life insurance arrangement, except for Joe's

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 wife.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.160
 And Joe's wife went to Jonathan McIntosh and said, "Hey, you know, pretty sure my husband's

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.160
 dead.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.880
 He's not one to run away.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.520
 He was in your mind and he told me that he told you.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.360
 He could only do it, you know, the thousand, you know, rewind the podcast a little bit,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360
 remember that part?"

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.640
 And Jonathan goes, "Oh, I did say that, but he didn't die.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.480
 Nobody's found his body and he probably just left you.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.480
 You're kind of busted.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.760
 You're kind of busted and he loved you, so I don't have to give you any money.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.240
 It was if he died, I gave him the money, not if he cheated on you or something like that."

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.280
 Slams the door in her face.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:09.760
 One night, a minor who was also a good friend of Joe, here's a knock on his door.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.240
 And standing there is Joe McGee's ghost.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.160
 He thought it was just Joe McGee, thought he was just really cheating on his wife.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.160
 No.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.920
 It was his ghost and he's floating there.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.840
 He doesn't say if he has Casper legs.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.600
 He doesn't say if he's eating a bunch of hot dogs like Slimer, but he is.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.400
 He's inventing the hot dogs so he can eat them.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.840
 He's floating there.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.600
 And he tells his friend, "Hey, dude, you won't believe what happened to me."

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.800
 The friend's like, "Let me guess, you died?"

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.800
 "Yes."

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800
 "What was the giveaway?"

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800
 "The fact that I have Casper legs?"

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.640
 "Why do I keep saying Casper legs?"

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.840
 Casper actually had legs, but you know what I mean?

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.000
 It's like a little wavy ghost buddy.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.840
 He's like, "Listen, forget that anachronism.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.360
 Forget what's going on with that host."

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.000
 I died in the mine, dude.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.880
 I went down there and that jerk, Jonathan, had fresh timbers, like the freshest.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.280
 These were amoeba trees down there and they collapsed.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.920
 I was killed in the mine.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.760
 Joe says, "Listen, I'm gonna tell you where my body's at in the mine so maybe you can

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760
 give me a proper burial.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.760
 I mean, I am buried.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.360
 I am buried by tons of rock, but you know, bury me in the soil where it's a little nicer."

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.360
 And, "Hey, do you know?

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.280
 I don't know if I told you about this.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.160
 I probably should have told more people about this, but I arranged for a life insurance policy.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.680
 Did my wife ever get any money?"

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.280
 And the friend goes, "No."

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.280
 He didn't.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.720
 The ghost is like, "Ahhh, dag nev it."

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.320
 Then he just turns and he slowly floats away.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.640
 It's interesting that he didn't go visit his wife, right?

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.640
 It's interesting that he goes and visits his friend and asks him all this stuff.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.320
 He could have went to his wife first or last even.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.640
 I mean, like, "Hey, honey, I'm not home.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.640
 I'm just the ghost.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.160
 But, hey, did you get that money?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.160
 Also, I love you."

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.080
 Like, he never visits his wife, but he does visit this dude.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.360
 But before he floats away, he turns back around because I forgot this detail.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.360
 I read a little bit more of my notes.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:07.560
 He turns around and he goes, "And I curse the Macintosh mine forever, forever, forever,

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560
 forever."

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.280
 And then he gets tired of saying that.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.840
 He says it for like 30, 40 minutes.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.120
 Then he turns around and floats away.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.720
 Jonathan's minor friend gets some other minors together.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.600
 They confront Macintosh.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.360
 They go to his house and this basically formed a lynch mob and they want to know what's going

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.080
 on.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.080
 Jonathan admits to this.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.080
 He says, "Yes, okay.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.280
 Oh, you got me.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.600
 You got me, my bad.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 I sent this expert miner down in the mineshaft and, yeah, sure, the timber might have been

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 a little new."

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.760
 And he died and I realized that he died pretty early on, so I did the noble thing.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.560
 I just told everyone he was a cheater and he left his wife and he is forced to give

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.400
 the wife this $2,000.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:58.520
 And the miners were able to go down and locate Joe's body and give it a proper burial.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.160
 Into the story, right?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.200
 Not as far as Joe's concerned.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.800
 Because what happens is miners are still working in that mine.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.320
 They're like, "Yeah, the guy did.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.960
 The owner of this mine did murder someone and tried to rip off his widow."

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.960
 But you know, works work.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:20.800
 As they're working in this mine, they would see Joe's ghost floating through the darkness.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.800
 Ooh.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.720
 He's like putting gold back in the mountain.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.280
 They're like, "Joe, come on, man."

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.280
 You know how long that took?

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.840
 He's like phasing it through the mountain.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.640
 He's like, "Find it again, dudes."

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.640
 He's floating away.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.240
 See on the flip side?

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.960
 He's haunting this mine.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.160
 So miners are like, "Listen, man.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.960
 There's a bunch of gold in North Carolina.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.600
 This is the first major gold rush.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 We can go work anywhere because this mine is definitely haunted.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.880
 Whenever we go down there, there's this ghost dude floating around."

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.880
 Jonathan McIntosh can't hire anyone to work in this mine.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.160
 They all know the legend.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.720
 Not only do they know what Jonathan McIntosh did, but they know the story of this ghost

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.160
 that when you go into this mine, there's a chance you will see the specter of Joe McGee

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.120
 standing behind you.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.240
 But McIntosh mine is full of gold.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:21.840
 This mine shaft has rich, rich veins of gold, but no one wants to work it.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:31.000
 And the story goes that old man Jonathan McIntosh went insane over time.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.640
 And that mine became known as Skinflint's Mine, because he was so worried about saving

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.880
 money, he put profit above his workers.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:49.400
 And no one would work an old Skinflint's Mine because a ghost guarded it.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.400
 It followed them through the darkness.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.080
 It haunted them.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.720
 Old man McIntosh slowly went insane and died in poverty.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:09.160
 He could have been a millionaire, but nobody wanted to work in the mine haunted by Joe

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.840
 McGee.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.200
 And some people say he still haunts the mine to this day.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.920
 Even though no one's mining and now he's just floating there, he's like kicking rocks

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.080
 around, he's like, "Oh, come on, can anyone come down here and mine it?

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.320
 I want to haunt them."

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.880
 Interesting ghost story.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.160
 He actually has a purpose.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.920
 It's not just a ghost walking down a hallway.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.800
 It's an economic terrorist ghost.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.600
 He's basically ruined this guy's business.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.440
 Because this guy not only killed him, but then tried ripping off his wife.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.480
 Just interesting ghost story.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.080
 How true is it?

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.120
 The mine is called McIntosh's Mine.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.080
 I did find this story repeated several times, but did Joe McGee actually exist?

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080
 Who knows?

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.200
 This story goes so far back.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.800
 I really wasn't able to find a lot of genealogical.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.720
 It's not like I look at a family tree and one of it branches off and it's a ghost floating

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.720
 through a mine.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.520
 I'm like, "Oh, there's Joe McGee."

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.520
 Interesting story, nonetheless.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.320
 Classic American ghost story.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.640
 Beatrice, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the carboner copter.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.320
 We are leaving behind North Carolina.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:16.720
 We are headed out to Santander, Spain.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.240
 A while back I got an email from a listener named Colin O'Connor.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.040
 They said, "You do a lot of movie recommendations.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.160
 You have many book recommendations."

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
 I responded, "I read trash."

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.040
 I read...I'm going through your garbage right now.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040
 I'm like, "Ooh."

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.160
 No, I read...I'm not knocking this stuff because I do enjoy it.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.520
 I read Star Trek novels.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.720
 I really enjoy those.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.880
 I enjoy them, but that's not something I would recommend.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.400
 And I'll read zombie books.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.640
 I'll read stuff by Joe McKinney.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.480
 But I mean, it's hard to recommend a book versus I can recommend a movie.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.920
 You can watch it the first five minutes.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.920
 You're like, "Oh, that's good."

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.240
 Or you finish it and it's only like an hour and a half of your life.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.480
 It's really hard to recommend a book.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.240
 But I got a book I have to recommend, a Dead Rabbit Recommends book, because the author

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240
 just died.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.600
 Not like I wouldn't have recommended if that hadn't happened, but it popped back on my

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600
 wrist.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.000
 I actually just bought another copy of this book.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.920
 It's one of the few books I've read twice.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.600
 I'm not going to get ready to read it a third time.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.800
 I bought a copy of this book a month ago.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.080
 I read it in high school.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.640
 Steve Daimwood recommended it to me.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.240
 He basically is all this should be Steve Daimwood's week.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.840
 I read it again in college.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.760
 It's called Monster, the autobiography of an LA gang member.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.040
 This should be required reading for anyone who's into true crime.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.600
 It's basically a true crime book written by the person committing the crimes.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.360
 He's in prison writing this book.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.520
 It's totally true.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.520
 It's not fictional.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:45.520
 There was a man, his name was, he passed away just today on June 8th, but San Yacca Shakura.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.880
 He was the co-founder of the H. Ray Gangster Crips in Los Angeles.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.120
 Fascinating story.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.920
 It starts off in the late 1970s.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.280
 Carries to about the early 90s.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.640
 And then he ends up in prison.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.760
 He becomes a Muslim and he's trying to reform his behavior.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.600
 It's that narrative arc that we've seen in the autobiography of Malcolm X.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.560
 But Malcolm X was like a car thief and a pimp in his early days.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.240
 And so when he goes to prison and he's trying to find something to hold onto and he joins

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.160
 the nation of Islam.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:26.680
 It's an easy pivot from basic like minor crimes to finding God.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.680
 Monster.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.560
 Because that was his gang name.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.880
 He murders people throughout his life.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.560
 It's a fascinating book.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:42.480
 This is the story of a murderer who is constantly killing people with no regard to anything.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.720
 And he's writing this stuff and then he just moves on to the next paragraph.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.720
 It's horrifying.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.840
 It's just a fascinating book.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.000
 There's one part of it that I never forgot where he's like hanging out.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.440
 He's hanging out with his gang and some dude was in the Navy.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.720
 Like his girlfriend, I don't remember, it's been years since the red button.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.680
 His girlfriend's cousin was in the Navy and he comes and he hangs out with Monster.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.760
 And he goes, "Hey, I got this flare gun off the boat."

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.320
 It was the sign of this boat.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.040
 I was able to smuggle this flare gun off.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.640
 You want it?

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640
 Monster's like, "Yeah, sure."

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.200
 And then he takes it to the state fair or the county fair and he shoots a rival gang

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.480
 member with it and sets him on fire.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.160
 And then it just goes to the next paragraph.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.640
 His very first thing when he was 13 years old, he had a double barrel sawed off shotgun.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.400
 He walked up to a park where some kids were playing basketball just a little older than

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.040
 him, I believe, and he put the double barrel up to the chain link fence and pulled the trigger

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.560
 twice and a bunch of people start scattering and at least one or two of them are laying

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.840
 on the ground and he leaves.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.640
 That's how the story starts off.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.880
 And he got his nickname Monster because he stomped on an old man's face for so long.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.040
 Guy was permanently disfigured and the police said only a monster could do this.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.200
 And he's like, "That's my name."

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:03.400
 It's a fascinating book because it's not like he's an anti-hero.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:09.440
 It's not like you're like, "Oh, he's doing this for truth, just it's such a bizarre read."

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.120
 It is really such a bizarre read because you're reading this guy's story and he's the protagonist

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.120
 in his story.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.680
 And it's an interesting history book of LA at that time period and the gang crisis

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.360
 at that time period.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.760
 He goes on to explain, it used to be that when we wanted guns, we'd break into someone's

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.960
 house, we'd steal two revolvers and a shotgun.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.080
 But as cracks started flowing into the city and we were making tons of money, we began

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.920
 buying guns by the crate.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.680
 We began having AK-47s shipped in from other countries and at one point as they were buying

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.840
 all these guns, the arms dealer said, "Hey, do you want to buy a grenade launcher?"

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.080
 And he looks at the dude and goes, "What am I going to do with the grenade launcher?"

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.080
 That's ridiculous.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.680
 And nowadays we have gangs that have their own armored vehicles.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:05.120
 Fascinating first-person view of the gang wars starting off in the 1970s to the 1990s.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.120
 He's passed away.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.960
 He was 57 years old.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.040
 As of today, we don't know how he passed away.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:17.160
 I watched this YouTube channel called Nick916 where he covers like true crime stuff in Sacramento.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.640
 And he mentioned he was going to have, he was trying to set up an interview with him,

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.560
 but he said his addictions kept getting the worse of him.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.360
 So it could have been a drug-addicted thing.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.920
 It's just a fascinating book.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.960
 If you're interested in true crime, it is a must read.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.320
 If you're not into true crime, see again, this is like my thing with books.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.920
 I recommend it to people who enjoy true crime or people who don't know anything about LA

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.720
 gang society because this book will bring you right.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.280
 If that stuff interests you, this book is something you have to read.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.960
 But again, if it's those things don't interest you, then I don't, it's not one of those books

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.640
 that I say you have to read.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.640
 You have to read.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.760
 1984 is a book I think everybody should read.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.840
 I think that book is, that's another book I've read more than once.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.760
 That, The Hobbit, Monster, and World War Z.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.560
 Those are the only four books I've ever read more than once.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.440
 They're very, very diverse group of books.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:13.080
 But yeah, if you are interested in true crime, check out Monster, the autobiography of an

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.080
 LA gang member.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:21.080
 I have a copy that I just bought and I'm going to reread it and maybe get some more insight

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.080
 on that.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.360
 Beatrice, go ahead and land this carpenter copter here at Santander, Spain.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.880
 The year is 1997.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.380
 It's nighttime.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.760
 We're walking off the carpenter copter.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.640
 We're wearing our tourist clothing, our big floppy hats.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.640
 Beatrice is reading her copy of Monster.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640
 She's like, "No, I'm not.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.080
 The book doesn't interest me at all.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.920
 The book sounds terrifying."

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.280
 It's really, it is really interesting though.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.200
 Okay, Beatrice, you're not reading the book.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.000
 You're reading like Nora Roberts or whatever.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.680
 We're walking off of the carpenter copter and we see a young woman, Sereta Macpherson,

00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:03.680
 is sitting on this beach all alone and she sees out on the distance these lights hovering

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.400
 off in the distance.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.440
 They're just gently gliding over the sea.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.320
 The lights though eventually leave and other people join her on the beach.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.320
 Not friends of hers.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.360
 Just there are other people on the beach now and she's still sitting there just enjoying

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.920
 the night.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.920
 All of a sudden, Sereta hears someone walking up to her.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:33.280
 She turns and she sees a tall, thin man coming towards her.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.520
 Man might not be the right word.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.120
 There was something odd about this person.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.600
 I mean, there could be odd things about humans too, but there was something not right about

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.600
 this person.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.600
 One, he was wearing a plastic suit.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.600
 Right?

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.960
 He was wearing a plastic suit.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.520
 That's your first dead giveaway.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.520
 Something's not right.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.000
 It's kind of like a cover all.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.880
 So it's not like it was a plastic suit like that robot from Pluto Nash.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.760
 It was actually like a biohazard suit, but without the helmet.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:07.000
 He's walking towards her and he had an expressionless face with gray skin.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.520
 Very, very pallid man.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.520
 He's not making zombie noises.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.280
 I don't know why I started doing that.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.920
 He's not making zombie noises, but he's walking closer.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.920
 He walks and he sits down next to her and as she's looking at him, she realizes he only

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.620
 has four fingers on each hand.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:30.280
 This tall man looks to her and goes, "You should not get married."

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.480
 This really scared Sereta because she was about to get married.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.520
 Who was this man?

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520
 How did he know this stuff?

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.760
 Where did he get that outfit?

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.440
 What happened to his other fingers?

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.240
 These are all questions that Sereta wanted answers to, but she wasn't going to sit around

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.240
 and find out.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.200
 She jumps up and she runs home.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.600
 Sereta told this story to her friends.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.080
 She thought it was a weird event.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.800
 It was a weird thing and I think it would be something that you would share with people,

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.800
 right?

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.800
 What would you do today?

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.960
 Well, a giant man with gray skin told me not to get married.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.960
 What?

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.120
 But it just became a memory.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.120
 Just became a memory.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.960
 Sereta does get married like she had planned.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.160
 Everything was going great.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.240
 She had found her soulmate.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.800
 But a few months after she was married, she was murdered.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:25.640
 She was found at home alone with a towel wrapped around her neck.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.120
 She was strangled.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.080
 When the police began investigating this crime, several of her neighbors said that around

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:39.760
 the same time that she was murdered, a tall gray man was spotted hanging out around the

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.760
 apartment complex.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.120
 The police are doing police sketch.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.440
 They're drawing some big old tall weirdo and the neighbors are like, "Yep, that's him."

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.040
 Why they didn't call the police when a tall gray dude was hanging out there for so long?

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.040
 Who knows?

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.440
 But maybe things are different in Spain.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440
 Maybe that is not abnormal.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.120
 For whatever reason, they didn't call the cops because this giant weirdo was walking

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.480
 around.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.320
 That matched up to the story she had told her friends that there was a tall gray weirdo

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.360
 who told her she shouldn't get married.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.760
 She gets married a couple months later, she's murdered.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:20.120
 When her funeral was held, when her friends and family had shown up to pay their respects

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:28.960
 to Sereta, some of the attendees of the funeral looked up into the night sky and saw several

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:35.400
 luminous objects hovering in the area.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.760
 This story came from Testigo Avni, published in 1998.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.560
 I got it from thinkaboutadox.com, one of my favorite websites I go to all the time.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.560
 Is it true?

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.680
 I tried looking for any other information on Seretimik Fiersten.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.680
 I couldn't.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.040
 Everything I found with her name linked back to this story.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.840
 As far as I can tell, this person didn't exist outside of this narrative.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.920
 That's always a little fishy when trying to back stuff up.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.040
 1997 is recent enough that we should be able to get other hits on this.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.560
 However, there could be other articles on it, they're in Spanish, I wasn't able to

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.000
 pull anything up.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.320
 So who knows.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.880
 Taking this story at face value.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.960
 Assuming this isn't just some sort of internet myth going around.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.840
 Taking the story at face value.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.440
 It's a terrifying new layer on the UFO story.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.880
 Because we've had stories of aliens coming down and abducting people and running experiments

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.400
 or coming down and saying you have been chosen to save the human race or all sorts of stuff.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.440
 This one specifically gave her very, very specific information.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.440
 Don't get married.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.920
 I mean, I think we can assume this is an alien, right?

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.280
 With the luminous objects and things like that.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.480
 This wasn't outside of old skin flint's mind.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.920
 And Joe's like, don't get married.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.920
 We assume this is an alien.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.400
 Very, very specific information saying don't do this.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.480
 We've seen aliens give advice, but this is so specific.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.480
 Don't get married.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.400
 She does.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.160
 She's murdered shortly afterwards.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.640
 Why would the aliens care?

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.640
 Well, in the grand scheme of things, they probably don't.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640
 But it happened anyways.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.720
 Let's put our conspiracy caps on and wrap this up.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:18.880
 If you have the US Navy doing their job, their job is to defend the oceans and fight pirates.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.400
 But every so often, every so often you'll have a member of the Navy give a flare gun

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.920
 to a gang member.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.680
 You'll have a member of the armed forces go rogue.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.520
 And sometimes it could be something just stupid and not thinking things through like

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.520
 that.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.920
 Or they could be a serial killer.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.620
 We covered that one guy who was in the Navy who was killing prostitutes.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.440
 We have all of this stuff, right?

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.320
 But the US Navy itself is this organization.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.280
 What if aliens are the same way?

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.520
 Where they have these missions where they come down and they go, you are the chosen one.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.560
 You will save humanity.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.160
 Don't use nukes, fix the environment, all that stuff.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.880
 But every so often, you're going to have one who's a little screwy.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.240
 You're going to have one that's a little nuts.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.920
 Taking in everything we know about aliens and what aliens are capable of doing.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:17.240
 What if this tall grey man came down and fell in love with Sereta McPherson?

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.200
 He viewed her from afar.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.520
 He stalked her.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:30.360
 When he heard she was going to get married, he reacted like any insane stalker would.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.240
 He threatened her.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:40.600
 And when she got married anyways, he made those threats come true.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.000
 Or did he?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.520
 UFO lore is full of stories of clones, cloned humans.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:58.040
 What if he simply cloned Sereta and left that dead body in her house so no one would look

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.080
 for her?

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.160
 What if the real Sereta is still alive?

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.000
 On a starship somewhere?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.360
 Beyond rescue.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.120
 Beyond hope.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:17.440
 Filled captive by an alien who is obsessed with her.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.200
 Who would use technology so advanced it seems like magic to us.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:28.240
 Just so he could have his desires filled.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:35.480
 But just like human perverts, eventually this alien gets bored with his prize.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.360
 And he disposes of her like garbage.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:49.120
 It is only then when this tall grey man pilots his ship back to earth.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:55.520
 He tells his commanders he's going on a normal routine mission.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.680
 Something that his race has done for thousands of years on this globe.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.840
 Instead, he's coming back to find another lover.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:33.160
 Another woman that he will take and no one can stop him.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.740
 (upbeat music)

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.320
 (upbeat music)

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.900
 (upbeat music)

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.480
 (upbeat music)

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.060
 (upbeat music)

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.640
 (upbeat music)

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.220
 (upbeat music)

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.800
 (upbeat music)

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.380
 (upbeat music)
