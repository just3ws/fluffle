1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,440
 day with Honey Bunches of Oats cereal.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,680

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,560
 to get moving, you're ready!

 With the boost you need to be your best self, it's amazing what a little me time can do!

6

 So make Honey Bunches of Oats cereal part of your morning routine, and make a bunch happen!

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,800
 Pick up a box of Honey Bunches of Oats in the cereal aisle today!

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,320
 An old timey ghost realizes sometimes the best way to hurt somebody is to hurt their

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,440
 pocketbook.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,600
 We say goodbye to a legendary and feared author.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,640
 Then we meet a young woman who met her soulmate and couldn't wait to begin a new life with

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,480
 the one she loves the most.

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,360
 When an alien appeared and told her, "You can't get married."

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,480
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:09,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter, I'm having a great day.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,520
 Hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys got a lot of cool plans for

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,680
 this weekend.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,200
 We got so much stuff to cover, first off let's give a shout out to our fan art Friday submission.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,360
 This one actually we used to use a lot.

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,200
 Until we went to the Ash Black logo pretty much across the board and now we're doing

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
 the fan art Friday.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,680
 So this is from John.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,880
 Long time listeners of the show will remember this artwork used to be all over the place.

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,120
 So John thank you so much for, I think on YouTube you'll still see it a lot too, but

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,520
 John thank you so much for sending this art in.

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,880
 Really really appreciate it.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,080
 And then let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters, the long time

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,120
 listener of the show, our Forrest Finn correspondent coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
 It's Beatrice Lava.

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,080
 Everyone give a round of applause to Beatrice.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,360
 Really really appreciate your continued support for the show.

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,800
 She's also my TikTok consultant.

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,880
 I've been trying to do more stuff on TikTok, just limited to the amount of time.

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
 I'm not doing dances.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,880
 Before you guys all go check out the TikTok channel.

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,720
 It's not me doing Fortnite dances.

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,240
 I'm trying to take episodes and shrink them down to a minute.

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,320
 And I've been really good with it because I know that's what you guys love most.

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,840
 You guys want the episodes to get shorter.

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,080
 I'm taking stories and making them a minute long.

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
 Being really good at it.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,000
 It's just a matter of time of putting the pictures together and stuff like that.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,320
 We're going to do a lot of TikTok in the future.

45
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,640
 And Beatrice has really helped out on that front.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,280
 So Beatrice let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,920
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,680
 We are headed out to North Carolina.

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,560
 Beatrice is expertly flying this vehicle.

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
 She's done it before.

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,000
 We're headed out to Caribou's County in North Carolina.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,440
 Specifically, old skin flint mine.

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,880
 This is actually I think the last holdover of I had that ghost theme week.

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,080
 And then it spilled over until the week after it.

55
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,000
 I was just happy I was able to find all these ghost stories.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,400
 This one also takes place in North Carolina at a mine.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,720
 I could have all fit him into one week, but it was too much haunted mine for a week.

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
 The story is really awesome.

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,320
 I just didn't want you to guys be like, oh, me oh, mine.

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,720
 Too many ghost stories.

61
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
 Do you like that?

62
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,920
 Do you like the Friday puns?

63
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,720
 John's like giving me my artwork back.

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,360
 We're landing in Caribou's County the year 1799.

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,600
 And that was when a 12 year old boy found a big rock in the water.

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,640
 There's a bunch of rocks, but this one was gold and shiny.

67
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,240
 Paul, look at what I found.

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,560
 I found this rock.

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,520
 And the dad goes, oh, that's kind of cool.

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,760
 My kid obviously has some weird fetish for rocks, but we'll deal with that in the future.

71
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,280
 Right now, why don't we use that rock as a doorstop?

72
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,400
 And then one day a dude was walking by and he goes, that's weird.

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,800
 How come this door is state open?

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,000
 They're like, well, if you look down, if you crane your neck down, you'll see there is

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,480
 a doorstop there.

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,080
 And the guy goes, oh, and he realizes this doorstop is a hunk of gold.

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,040
 This is when the first gold rush in America started in North Carolina.

78
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,320
 You guys are like, Jason, you should have given us this information last week when you

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,040
 talked about all these North Carolina goldmine stories.

80
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,240
 The problem was that information was in the notes for this story.

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
 Wasn't in the notes for those other stories.

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,320
 So this guy goes, tell you what, I'll give you $3.50 for that doorstop.

83
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,480
 And the guy's like, yeah, sure, that's a lot of money back then.

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,880
 I mean, that's a lot of money right now.

85
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,160
 And so he pays it, but then eventually the homeowner finds out that that rock, that shiny

86
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,520
 gold colored rock was actually gold worth $3,500 in old timey money.

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,860
 So that's like Scrooge McDuck bucks.

88
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,600
 So eventually he's able to track down the guy.

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,080
 I think he did get some more money for that doorstop.

90
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,640
 But a bunch of other people started coming into the area, the first major gold rush in

91
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
 American history.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,240
 North Carolina was the leading producer of gold until 1848 when gold was discovered in

93
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,840
 California and people go, North Carolina, pew, this place sucks.

94
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,000
 But before people realized that North Carolina wasn't where it's at, you had people from

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,360
 all over the world come to North Carolina to try to strike it rich.

96
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,440
 They didn't have a rule though.

97
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
 No slaves were allowed.

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,520
 No slaves, this is interesting.

99
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,040
 I didn't have thought about this because if you thought, think about it, the gold rush

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,120
 was during slavery times.

101
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,120
 California wasn't a slave state, but North Carolina wasn't.

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,160
 They had a rule.

103
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,440
 No slaves were allowed in the mine because they were afraid that they would hide gold.

104
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
 Can you believe this?

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,480
 They were afraid that slaves would try to purchase their freedom and the freedom of

106
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,480
 their friends and family by finding gold and then coming back out of the cave and being

107
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,320
 like, I don't work for you anymore.

108
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
 You have a big chunk of gold.

109
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
 They couldn't allow it.

110
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,800
 They couldn't allow these people to actually be people.

111
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,960
 So no slaves were allowed.

112
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
 So they had to import labor from around the world and people wanted to come.

113
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
 They wanted to try to make money.

114
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
 Enter Jonathan McIntosh.

115
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,600
 He's the owner of the McIntosh mine.

116
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,480
 450 foot deep mine.

117
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,240
 It seems to be doing pretty well.

118
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,320
 Lots of gold is coming out of it, but it's not enough for Jonathan McIntosh.

119
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,920
 Because despite him saying, oh, we got the best timber in the world, we got the best,

120
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
 we got the best other stuff that makes a mine function.

121
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,200
 You want dynamite?

122
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,040
 Our dynamite is dynamite.

123
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,480
 Everyone in the mine knew that Jonathan was a liar.

124
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,640
 They'd go down there and they'd see the wood.

125
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,840
 It wasn't rotting, but he would use very, very new timber.

126
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
 So it wasn't strong enough.

127
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,320
 They had seen that dynamite explode and they weren't impressed.

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,560
 It was just like regular dynamite.

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,160
 They knew that Jonathan was selling them a bill of goods.

130
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,840
 He wasn't actually putting money into the mine, which you don't go down there to be

131
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
 bedazzled, right?

132
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,080
 They weren't worried about the fact that it wasn't the jazziest place to work.

133
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,720
 They weren't about their own safety.

134
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,240
 And they could tell he was cutting corners.

135
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,640
 So people were like, "I don't know."

136
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,040
 So as the mine got deeper and deeper, it was harder to find people to go down there.

137
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,160
 There's a local miner named Joe McGee.

138
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
 He's an expert.

139
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,640
 He's been doing this all of his life.

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,240
 The first tunnel he crawled out of was his mother and he hasn't stopped crawling through

141
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,680
 tunnels since.

142
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,880
 And he knows reputation of McIntosh Mine.

143
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,200
 It is not safe.

144
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,400
 But no one else is going deep into the mine.

145
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,080
 Jonathan calls up Joe and says, "Hey, listen, I got a deal for you.

146
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,880
 You go into my super safe mine at the deepest point and start digging and doing your mine

147
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
 magic.

148
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,440
 And then everyone else will go down to join you because you're such a cool guy, Joe.

149
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
 You're so cool.

150
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,160
 Everyone will follow you."

151
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
 And Joe goes, "Listen, I know the stories.

152
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,480
 Your mine is not safe.

153
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,760
 You cut a bunch of corners.

154
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,560
 But I will do it.

155
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,040
 However, if I die, you have to pay my wife $1,000."

156
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,960
 Today would be the equivalent of about $30,000.

157
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,640
 So pretty good life insurance policy.

158
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,200
 Actually, that's kind of lame for a life insurance policy.

159
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,280
 Anyways, Joe goes, "If I go down there and I die, you have to pay my wife $1,000."

160
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,800
 And Jonathan was kind of shocked.

161
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,320
 How dare he say his mine isn't safe?

162
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
 What are you talking about?

163
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,360
 I mean, I don't go down there myself.

164
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,880
 I wouldn't let any of my friends and family down there.

165
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
 But it's totally safe.

166
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,200
 And in fact, it's so safe I want you to know if you die, whatever that is, I'll give your

167
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,200
 wife $2,000.

168
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,360
 Joe goes into the mine.

169
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
 Couple days pass.

170
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,240
 Hey, you don't remember that guy, Joe?

171
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,640
 We used to kick it with all the time.

172
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,480
 He was a really good miner and all that stuff.

173
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
 Yeah, yeah.

174
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
 Have you seen him lately?

175
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
 Uh-uh, no.

176
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
 I thought he was hanging out with you.

177
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
 No, I wish.

178
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
 He was pretty cool.

179
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
 Couple weeks go by.

180
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
 Hey, dude, what are you doing, man?

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Oh, sorry.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 I thought you were Joe.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 I thought you were super cool.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I don't really care about you.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,520
 Speaking of Joe, have you seen him?

186
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,840
 No, dude, no one's seen Joe for weeks.

187
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,200
 Not even his wife.

188
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,680
 Joe must have left.

189
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,500
 That's the only thing when you think of, I mean, we do know that he's working in a super

190
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,360
 dangerous industry, but maybe he just left and left his wife.

191
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,240
 Oh, okay.

192
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,000
 Now nobody knew about this arrangement, this life insurance arrangement, except for Joe's

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 wife.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,160
 And Joe's wife went to Jonathan McIntosh and said, "Hey, you know, pretty sure my husband's

195
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
 dead.

196
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,880
 He's not one to run away.

197
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,520
 He was in your mind and he told me that he told you.

198
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,360
 He could only do it, you know, the thousand, you know, rewind the podcast a little bit,

199
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
 remember that part?"

200
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,640
 And Jonathan goes, "Oh, I did say that, but he didn't die.

201
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,480
 Nobody's found his body and he probably just left you.

202
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
 You're kind of busted.

203
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,760
 You're kind of busted and he loved you, so I don't have to give you any money.

204
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,240
 It was if he died, I gave him the money, not if he cheated on you or something like that."

205
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,280
 Slams the door in her face.

206
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:09,760
 One night, a minor who was also a good friend of Joe, here's a knock on his door.

207
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,240
 And standing there is Joe McGee's ghost.

208
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,160
 He thought it was just Joe McGee, thought he was just really cheating on his wife.

209
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
 No.

210
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,920
 It was his ghost and he's floating there.

211
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,840
 He doesn't say if he has Casper legs.

212
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,600
 He doesn't say if he's eating a bunch of hot dogs like Slimer, but he is.

213
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,400
 He's inventing the hot dogs so he can eat them.

214
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,840
 He's floating there.

215
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,600
 And he tells his friend, "Hey, dude, you won't believe what happened to me."

216
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,800
 The friend's like, "Let me guess, you died?"

217
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
 "Yes."

218
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 "What was the giveaway?"

219
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
 "The fact that I have Casper legs?"

220
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
 "Why do I keep saying Casper legs?"

221
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,840
 Casper actually had legs, but you know what I mean?

222
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,000
 It's like a little wavy ghost buddy.

223
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,840
 He's like, "Listen, forget that anachronism.

224
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,360
 Forget what's going on with that host."

225
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,000
 I died in the mine, dude.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,880
 I went down there and that jerk, Jonathan, had fresh timbers, like the freshest.

227
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,280
 These were amoeba trees down there and they collapsed.

228
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,920
 I was killed in the mine.

229
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,760
 Joe says, "Listen, I'm gonna tell you where my body's at in the mine so maybe you can

230
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
 give me a proper burial.

231
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
 I mean, I am buried.

232
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,360
 I am buried by tons of rock, but you know, bury me in the soil where it's a little nicer."

233
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
 And, "Hey, do you know?

234
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,280
 I don't know if I told you about this.

235
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,160
 I probably should have told more people about this, but I arranged for a life insurance policy.

236
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
 Did my wife ever get any money?"

237
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,280
 And the friend goes, "No."

238
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
 He didn't.

239
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,720
 The ghost is like, "Ahhh, dag nev it."

240
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,320
 Then he just turns and he slowly floats away.

241
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,640
 It's interesting that he didn't go visit his wife, right?

242
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,640
 It's interesting that he goes and visits his friend and asks him all this stuff.

243
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,320
 He could have went to his wife first or last even.

244
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,640
 I mean, like, "Hey, honey, I'm not home.

245
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
 I'm just the ghost.

246
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,160
 But, hey, did you get that money?

247
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
 Also, I love you."

248
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,080
 Like, he never visits his wife, but he does visit this dude.

249
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,360
 But before he floats away, he turns back around because I forgot this detail.

250
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 I read a little bit more of my notes.

251
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:07,560
 He turns around and he goes, "And I curse the Macintosh mine forever, forever, forever,

252
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
 forever."

253
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,280
 And then he gets tired of saying that.

254
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,840
 He says it for like 30, 40 minutes.

255
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,120
 Then he turns around and floats away.

256
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,720
 Jonathan's minor friend gets some other minors together.

257
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,600
 They confront Macintosh.

258
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,360
 They go to his house and this basically formed a lynch mob and they want to know what's going

259
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,080
 on.

260
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,080
 Jonathan admits to this.

261
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
 He says, "Yes, okay.

262
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
 Oh, you got me.

263
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,600
 You got me, my bad.

264
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 I sent this expert miner down in the mineshaft and, yeah, sure, the timber might have been

265
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
 a little new."

266
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,760
 And he died and I realized that he died pretty early on, so I did the noble thing.

267
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,560
 I just told everyone he was a cheater and he left his wife and he is forced to give

268
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,400
 the wife this $2,000.

269
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:58,520
 And the miners were able to go down and locate Joe's body and give it a proper burial.

270
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,160
 Into the story, right?

271
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,200
 Not as far as Joe's concerned.

272
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,800
 Because what happens is miners are still working in that mine.

273
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
 They're like, "Yeah, the guy did.

274
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,960
 The owner of this mine did murder someone and tried to rip off his widow."

275
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
 But you know, works work.

276
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:20,800
 As they're working in this mine, they would see Joe's ghost floating through the darkness.

277
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
 Ooh.

278
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,720
 He's like putting gold back in the mountain.

279
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,280
 They're like, "Joe, come on, man."

280
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
 You know how long that took?

281
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,840
 He's like phasing it through the mountain.

282
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,640
 He's like, "Find it again, dudes."

283
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
 He's floating away.

284
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,240
 See on the flip side?

285
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,960
 He's haunting this mine.

286
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,160
 So miners are like, "Listen, man.

287
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,960
 There's a bunch of gold in North Carolina.

288
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,600
 This is the first major gold rush.

289
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 We can go work anywhere because this mine is definitely haunted.

290
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,880
 Whenever we go down there, there's this ghost dude floating around."

291
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,880
 Jonathan McIntosh can't hire anyone to work in this mine.

292
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,160
 They all know the legend.

293
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,720
 Not only do they know what Jonathan McIntosh did, but they know the story of this ghost

294
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,160
 that when you go into this mine, there's a chance you will see the specter of Joe McGee

295
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,120
 standing behind you.

296
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,240
 But McIntosh mine is full of gold.

297
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:21,840
 This mine shaft has rich, rich veins of gold, but no one wants to work it.

298
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:31,000
 And the story goes that old man Jonathan McIntosh went insane over time.

299
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,640
 And that mine became known as Skinflint's Mine, because he was so worried about saving

300
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,880
 money, he put profit above his workers.

301
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:49,400
 And no one would work an old Skinflint's Mine because a ghost guarded it.

302
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
 It followed them through the darkness.

303
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,080
 It haunted them.

304
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,720
 Old man McIntosh slowly went insane and died in poverty.

305
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:09,160
 He could have been a millionaire, but nobody wanted to work in the mine haunted by Joe

306
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,840
 McGee.

307
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,200
 And some people say he still haunts the mine to this day.

308
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,920
 Even though no one's mining and now he's just floating there, he's like kicking rocks

309
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,080
 around, he's like, "Oh, come on, can anyone come down here and mine it?

310
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,320
 I want to haunt them."

311
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,880
 Interesting ghost story.

312
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,160
 He actually has a purpose.

313
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,920
 It's not just a ghost walking down a hallway.

314
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,800
 It's an economic terrorist ghost.

315
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,600
 He's basically ruined this guy's business.

316
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,440
 Because this guy not only killed him, but then tried ripping off his wife.

317
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,480
 Just interesting ghost story.

318
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,080
 How true is it?

319
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,120
 The mine is called McIntosh's Mine.

320
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,080
 I did find this story repeated several times, but did Joe McGee actually exist?

321
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
 Who knows?

322
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,200
 This story goes so far back.

323
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,800
 I really wasn't able to find a lot of genealogical.

324
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,720
 It's not like I look at a family tree and one of it branches off and it's a ghost floating

325
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
 through a mine.

326
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,520
 I'm like, "Oh, there's Joe McGee."

327
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
 Interesting story, nonetheless.

328
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,320
 Classic American ghost story.

329
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,640
 Beatrice, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the carboner copter.

330
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,320
 We are leaving behind North Carolina.

331
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:16,720
 We are headed out to Santander, Spain.

332
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
 A while back I got an email from a listener named Colin O'Connor.

333
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,040
 They said, "You do a lot of movie recommendations.

334
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,160
 You have many book recommendations."

335
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,160
 I responded, "I read trash."

336
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,040
 I read...I'm going through your garbage right now.

337
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
 I'm like, "Ooh."

338
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,160
 No, I read...I'm not knocking this stuff because I do enjoy it.

339
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,520
 I read Star Trek novels.

340
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,720
 I really enjoy those.

341
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,880
 I enjoy them, but that's not something I would recommend.

342
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,400
 And I'll read zombie books.

343
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,640
 I'll read stuff by Joe McKinney.

344
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,480
 But I mean, it's hard to recommend a book versus I can recommend a movie.

345
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,920
 You can watch it the first five minutes.

346
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
 You're like, "Oh, that's good."

347
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,240
 Or you finish it and it's only like an hour and a half of your life.

348
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
 It's really hard to recommend a book.

349
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,240
 But I got a book I have to recommend, a Dead Rabbit Recommends book, because the author

350
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
 just died.

351
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,600
 Not like I wouldn't have recommended if that hadn't happened, but it popped back on my

352
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
 wrist.

353
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,000
 I actually just bought another copy of this book.

354
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,920
 It's one of the few books I've read twice.

355
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,600
 I'm not going to get ready to read it a third time.

356
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,800
 I bought a copy of this book a month ago.

357
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,080
 I read it in high school.

358
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,640
 Steve Daimwood recommended it to me.

359
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,240
 He basically is all this should be Steve Daimwood's week.

360
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,840
 I read it again in college.

361
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,760
 It's called Monster, the autobiography of an LA gang member.

362
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,040
 This should be required reading for anyone who's into true crime.

363
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,600
 It's basically a true crime book written by the person committing the crimes.

364
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,360
 He's in prison writing this book.

365
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,520
 It's totally true.

366
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
 It's not fictional.

367
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,520
 There was a man, his name was, he passed away just today on June 8th, but San Yacca Shakura.

368
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,880
 He was the co-founder of the H. Ray Gangster Crips in Los Angeles.

369
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,120
 Fascinating story.

370
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,920
 It starts off in the late 1970s.

371
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,280
 Carries to about the early 90s.

372
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,640
 And then he ends up in prison.

373
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,760
 He becomes a Muslim and he's trying to reform his behavior.

374
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,600
 It's that narrative arc that we've seen in the autobiography of Malcolm X.

375
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,560
 But Malcolm X was like a car thief and a pimp in his early days.

376
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,240
 And so when he goes to prison and he's trying to find something to hold onto and he joins

377
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
 the nation of Islam.

378
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,680
 It's an easy pivot from basic like minor crimes to finding God.

379
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
 Monster.

380
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,560
 Because that was his gang name.

381
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,880
 He murders people throughout his life.

382
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,560
 It's a fascinating book.

383
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,480
 This is the story of a murderer who is constantly killing people with no regard to anything.

384
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,720
 And he's writing this stuff and then he just moves on to the next paragraph.

385
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
 It's horrifying.

386
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,840
 It's just a fascinating book.

387
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,000
 There's one part of it that I never forgot where he's like hanging out.

388
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,440
 He's hanging out with his gang and some dude was in the Navy.

389
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,720
 Like his girlfriend, I don't remember, it's been years since the red button.

390
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,680
 His girlfriend's cousin was in the Navy and he comes and he hangs out with Monster.

391
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,760
 And he goes, "Hey, I got this flare gun off the boat."

392
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,320
 It was the sign of this boat.

393
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,040
 I was able to smuggle this flare gun off.

394
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,640
 You want it?

395
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
 Monster's like, "Yeah, sure."

396
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,200
 And then he takes it to the state fair or the county fair and he shoots a rival gang

397
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,480
 member with it and sets him on fire.

398
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,160
 And then it just goes to the next paragraph.

399
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,640
 His very first thing when he was 13 years old, he had a double barrel sawed off shotgun.

400
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,400
 He walked up to a park where some kids were playing basketball just a little older than

401
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,040
 him, I believe, and he put the double barrel up to the chain link fence and pulled the trigger

402
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,560
 twice and a bunch of people start scattering and at least one or two of them are laying

403
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,840
 on the ground and he leaves.

404
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,640
 That's how the story starts off.

405
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,880
 And he got his nickname Monster because he stomped on an old man's face for so long.

406
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,040
 Guy was permanently disfigured and the police said only a monster could do this.

407
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,200
 And he's like, "That's my name."

408
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,400
 It's a fascinating book because it's not like he's an anti-hero.

409
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,440
 It's not like you're like, "Oh, he's doing this for truth, just it's such a bizarre read."

410
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,120
 It is really such a bizarre read because you're reading this guy's story and he's the protagonist

411
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
 in his story.

412
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,680
 And it's an interesting history book of LA at that time period and the gang crisis

413
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,360
 at that time period.

414
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,760
 He goes on to explain, it used to be that when we wanted guns, we'd break into someone's

415
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,960
 house, we'd steal two revolvers and a shotgun.

416
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,080
 But as cracks started flowing into the city and we were making tons of money, we began

417
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,920
 buying guns by the crate.

418
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,680
 We began having AK-47s shipped in from other countries and at one point as they were buying

419
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,840
 all these guns, the arms dealer said, "Hey, do you want to buy a grenade launcher?"

420
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,080
 And he looks at the dude and goes, "What am I going to do with the grenade launcher?"

421
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
 That's ridiculous.

422
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,680
 And nowadays we have gangs that have their own armored vehicles.

423
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:05,120
 Fascinating first-person view of the gang wars starting off in the 1970s to the 1990s.

424
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
 He's passed away.

425
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,960
 He was 57 years old.

426
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,040
 As of today, we don't know how he passed away.

427
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:17,160
 I watched this YouTube channel called Nick916 where he covers like true crime stuff in Sacramento.

428
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,640
 And he mentioned he was going to have, he was trying to set up an interview with him,

429
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,560
 but he said his addictions kept getting the worse of him.

430
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,360
 So it could have been a drug-addicted thing.

431
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,920
 It's just a fascinating book.

432
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,960
 If you're interested in true crime, it is a must read.

433
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,320
 If you're not into true crime, see again, this is like my thing with books.

434
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,920
 I recommend it to people who enjoy true crime or people who don't know anything about LA

435
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,720
 gang society because this book will bring you right.

436
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,280
 If that stuff interests you, this book is something you have to read.

437
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,960
 But again, if it's those things don't interest you, then I don't, it's not one of those books

438
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,640
 that I say you have to read.

439
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
 You have to read.

440
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,760
 1984 is a book I think everybody should read.

441
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,840
 I think that book is, that's another book I've read more than once.

442
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,760
 That, The Hobbit, Monster, and World War Z.

443
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,560
 Those are the only four books I've ever read more than once.

444
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,440
 They're very, very diverse group of books.

445
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,080
 But yeah, if you are interested in true crime, check out Monster, the autobiography of an

446
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
 LA gang member.

447
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,080
 I have a copy that I just bought and I'm going to reread it and maybe get some more insight

448
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
 on that.

449
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,360
 Beatrice, go ahead and land this carpenter copter here at Santander, Spain.

450
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,880
 The year is 1997.

451
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,380
 It's nighttime.

452
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,760
 We're walking off the carpenter copter.

453
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,640
 We're wearing our tourist clothing, our big floppy hats.

454
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
 Beatrice is reading her copy of Monster.

455
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
 She's like, "No, I'm not.

456
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,080
 The book doesn't interest me at all.

457
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,920
 The book sounds terrifying."

458
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,280
 It's really, it is really interesting though.

459
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,200
 Okay, Beatrice, you're not reading the book.

460
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,000
 You're reading like Nora Roberts or whatever.

461
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,680
 We're walking off of the carpenter copter and we see a young woman, Sereta Macpherson,

462
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:03,680
 is sitting on this beach all alone and she sees out on the distance these lights hovering

463
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,400
 off in the distance.

464
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,440
 They're just gently gliding over the sea.

465
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,320
 The lights though eventually leave and other people join her on the beach.

466
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
 Not friends of hers.

467
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,360
 Just there are other people on the beach now and she's still sitting there just enjoying

468
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,920
 the night.

469
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,920
 All of a sudden, Sereta hears someone walking up to her.

470
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:33,280
 She turns and she sees a tall, thin man coming towards her.

471
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,520
 Man might not be the right word.

472
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,120
 There was something odd about this person.

473
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,600
 I mean, there could be odd things about humans too, but there was something not right about

474
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
 this person.

475
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
 One, he was wearing a plastic suit.

476
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
 Right?

477
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,960
 He was wearing a plastic suit.

478
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,520
 That's your first dead giveaway.

479
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
 Something's not right.

480
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,000
 It's kind of like a cover all.

481
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,880
 So it's not like it was a plastic suit like that robot from Pluto Nash.

482
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,760
 It was actually like a biohazard suit, but without the helmet.

483
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:07,000
 He's walking towards her and he had an expressionless face with gray skin.

484
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,520
 Very, very pallid man.

485
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
 He's not making zombie noises.

486
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,280
 I don't know why I started doing that.

487
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,920
 He's not making zombie noises, but he's walking closer.

488
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,920
 He walks and he sits down next to her and as she's looking at him, she realizes he only

489
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,620
 has four fingers on each hand.

490
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:30,280
 This tall man looks to her and goes, "You should not get married."

491
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,480
 This really scared Sereta because she was about to get married.

492
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,520
 Who was this man?

493
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
 How did he know this stuff?

494
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,760
 Where did he get that outfit?

495
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,440
 What happened to his other fingers?

496
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,240
 These are all questions that Sereta wanted answers to, but she wasn't going to sit around

497
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
 and find out.

498
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,200
 She jumps up and she runs home.

499
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,600
 Sereta told this story to her friends.

500
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,080
 She thought it was a weird event.

501
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,800
 It was a weird thing and I think it would be something that you would share with people,

502
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 right?

503
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 What would you do today?

504
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,960
 Well, a giant man with gray skin told me not to get married.

505
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
 What?

506
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,120
 But it just became a memory.

507
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
 Just became a memory.

508
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,960
 Sereta does get married like she had planned.

509
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,160
 Everything was going great.

510
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,240
 She had found her soulmate.

511
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,800
 But a few months after she was married, she was murdered.

512
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:25,640
 She was found at home alone with a towel wrapped around her neck.

513
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,120
 She was strangled.

514
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,080
 When the police began investigating this crime, several of her neighbors said that around

515
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,760
 the same time that she was murdered, a tall gray man was spotted hanging out around the

516
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
 apartment complex.

517
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,120
 The police are doing police sketch.

518
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,440
 They're drawing some big old tall weirdo and the neighbors are like, "Yep, that's him."

519
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,040
 Why they didn't call the police when a tall gray dude was hanging out there for so long?

520
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
 Who knows?

521
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,440
 But maybe things are different in Spain.

522
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
 Maybe that is not abnormal.

523
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,120
 For whatever reason, they didn't call the cops because this giant weirdo was walking

524
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,480
 around.

525
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,320
 That matched up to the story she had told her friends that there was a tall gray weirdo

526
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,360
 who told her she shouldn't get married.

527
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,760
 She gets married a couple months later, she's murdered.

528
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,120
 When her funeral was held, when her friends and family had shown up to pay their respects

529
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:28,960
 to Sereta, some of the attendees of the funeral looked up into the night sky and saw several

530
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,400
 luminous objects hovering in the area.

531
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,760
 This story came from Testigo Avni, published in 1998.

532
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,560
 I got it from thinkaboutadox.com, one of my favorite websites I go to all the time.

533
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
 Is it true?

534
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,680
 I tried looking for any other information on Seretimik Fiersten.

535
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
 I couldn't.

536
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,040
 Everything I found with her name linked back to this story.

537
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,840
 As far as I can tell, this person didn't exist outside of this narrative.

538
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,920
 That's always a little fishy when trying to back stuff up.

539
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,040
 1997 is recent enough that we should be able to get other hits on this.

540
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,560
 However, there could be other articles on it, they're in Spanish, I wasn't able to

541
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,000
 pull anything up.

542
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,320
 So who knows.

543
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,880
 Taking this story at face value.

544
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,960
 Assuming this isn't just some sort of internet myth going around.

545
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,840
 Taking the story at face value.

546
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,440
 It's a terrifying new layer on the UFO story.

547
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,880
 Because we've had stories of aliens coming down and abducting people and running experiments

548
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,400
 or coming down and saying you have been chosen to save the human race or all sorts of stuff.

549
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,440
 This one specifically gave her very, very specific information.

550
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
 Don't get married.

551
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,920
 I mean, I think we can assume this is an alien, right?

552
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,280
 With the luminous objects and things like that.

553
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,480
 This wasn't outside of old skin flint's mind.

554
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,920
 And Joe's like, don't get married.

555
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
 We assume this is an alien.

556
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,400
 Very, very specific information saying don't do this.

557
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,480
 We've seen aliens give advice, but this is so specific.

558
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
 Don't get married.

559
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,400
 She does.

560
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,160
 She's murdered shortly afterwards.

561
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,640
 Why would the aliens care?

562
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,640
 Well, in the grand scheme of things, they probably don't.

563
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
 But it happened anyways.

564
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,720
 Let's put our conspiracy caps on and wrap this up.

565
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:18,880
 If you have the US Navy doing their job, their job is to defend the oceans and fight pirates.

566
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,400
 But every so often, every so often you'll have a member of the Navy give a flare gun

567
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,920
 to a gang member.

568
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,680
 You'll have a member of the armed forces go rogue.

569
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,520
 And sometimes it could be something just stupid and not thinking things through like

570
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
 that.

571
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,920
 Or they could be a serial killer.

572
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,620
 We covered that one guy who was in the Navy who was killing prostitutes.

573
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,440
 We have all of this stuff, right?

574
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,320
 But the US Navy itself is this organization.

575
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,280
 What if aliens are the same way?

576
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,520
 Where they have these missions where they come down and they go, you are the chosen one.

577
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,560
 You will save humanity.

578
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,160
 Don't use nukes, fix the environment, all that stuff.

579
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,880
 But every so often, you're going to have one who's a little screwy.

580
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,240
 You're going to have one that's a little nuts.

581
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,920
 Taking in everything we know about aliens and what aliens are capable of doing.

582
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:17,240
 What if this tall grey man came down and fell in love with Sereta McPherson?

583
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,200
 He viewed her from afar.

584
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,520
 He stalked her.

585
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,360
 When he heard she was going to get married, he reacted like any insane stalker would.

586
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,240
 He threatened her.

587
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:40,600
 And when she got married anyways, he made those threats come true.

588
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,000
 Or did he?

589
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,520
 UFO lore is full of stories of clones, cloned humans.

590
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:58,040
 What if he simply cloned Sereta and left that dead body in her house so no one would look

591
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,080
 for her?

592
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,160
 What if the real Sereta is still alive?

593
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,000
 On a starship somewhere?

594
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,360
 Beyond rescue.

595
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,120
 Beyond hope.

596
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,440
 Filled captive by an alien who is obsessed with her.

597
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,200
 Who would use technology so advanced it seems like magic to us.

598
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:28,240
 Just so he could have his desires filled.

599
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,480
 But just like human perverts, eventually this alien gets bored with his prize.

600
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,360
 And he disposes of her like garbage.

601
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:49,120
 It is only then when this tall grey man pilots his ship back to earth.

602
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,520
 He tells his commanders he's going on a normal routine mission.

603
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,680
 Something that his race has done for thousands of years on this globe.

604
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,840
 Instead, he's coming back to find another lover.

605
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:33,160
 Another woman that he will take and no one can stop him.

606
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,740
 (upbeat music)

607
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,320
 (upbeat music)

608
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,900
 (upbeat music)

609
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,480
 (upbeat music)

610
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,060
 (upbeat music)

611
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,640
 (upbeat music)

612
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,220
 (upbeat music)

613
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,800
 (upbeat music)

614
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,380
 (upbeat music)
