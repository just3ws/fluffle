 Today we talk about a bunch of stuff on the first and last

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.240
 Hangover New Year's Day special on Ted Rabbit Radio.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.240
 I need to drink more water.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:54.000
 Hey everyone.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.880
 Welcome back to another episode of Ted Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.000
 I'm having a great day over here. Having a great day too. I am hungover.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.680
 Now when I say the first and the last, it's not the first and last New Year's Eve or New Year's Day

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.480
 episode because we'll have many more of those, but it will be the last episode I do hungover.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.400
 Yesterday wasn't just supposed to be the bonus episode. I started to record this episode.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.600
 I was going to release it on New Year's Eve. I had one beer. It wasn't even a beer.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.680
 It was one of those strawberry-tas. It's just a margarita and a can.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.960
 And I proceeded to talk about Bird Box for 20 minutes straight and I was like,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.320
 "I can't do this." I went and I edited up the bonus episode.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.680
 I have a really low tolerance to alcohol. And then I went out.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.840
 So quick note, my buddy Aaron, he's a listener of the show. Hey Aaron.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.280
 He invited me to his show. He's in a rock band called Sundiver. Great band.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.480
 I wish I could have paid more attention to lyrics because he says there's a lot of like

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.680
 cool concepts in the lyrics, but in live shows it's kind of hard. Plus by that time I had three

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.120
 more ciders. Hard ciders, not just regular, a lapel cider. And I was pretty blitzed.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.960
 And then I came home and just kind of stumbled around my house for a while, went to bed,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.200
 woke up today, ate my body weight in Taco Bell, and now I'm recording this episode.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.080
 Once Sundiver starts to get some music recorded, we'll definitely see about playing some of it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.360
 on the show. It's a really good band though. And I think a lot of it, when we're talking to Aaron,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.160
 a lot of it crosses over to the same topics we talk about here. So I'm not going to talk about

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.880
 Bird Box for 20 minutes like I did on yesterday's scrapped episode. I wanted to highlight two scenes.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.880
 Now, first off, let me back up. Bird Box is the biggest hit movie that Netflix has announced.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.440
 They said they had 45 million views of that show within a week. And it's a horror, sci-fi horror

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:48.640
 movie about a world where it's the normal world, but one day these invisible ghosts or demons show up.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.720
 And if you look at them, you either get so sad you kill yourself, you get so afraid you kill

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.400
 yourself, or you fall in love with them and you keep running around and going, open your eyes,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.120
 and you try to take people's blindfolds off or hold your eyes open. It's completely ridiculous,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.960
 completely ridiculous. Premise and the movie doesn't work on multiple levels, but I'm going to

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.600
 break down my 20-minute review into basically two scenes because this really early on this happened

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.160
 and it set up everything. The star is who's that chick, Sandra Bullock. But Sandra Bullock and her

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.560
 sister are driving away from a hospital where they just saw a bunch of people kill themselves

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.560
 because this infestation or whatever has just come to the United States.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.720
 And the sister is driving the car and she said, "We need to get to my ranch. I have supplies there,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.080
 it's off the grid. No one can find it because they don't know what's going on."

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.680
 After watching multiple people kill themselves and on the news it was showing this was happening

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.960
 worldwide, someone makes that offer to you. There's a mysterious disease causing people to kill

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.680
 themselves and someone says, "I have a place, completely remote, that's stocked up on supplies."

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.080
 The normal person would be like, "Just fine, whatever." Sandra Bullock goes, "What? What will I

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.200
 wear? All my clothes are at my apartment. We have to go to my apartment first." And then,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.240
 which is completely stupid, and then the very next scene, they're still in the car, a huge explosion

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.080
 blows up behind the car, like maybe two or three blocks away, but a massive explosion.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.840
 And Sandra Bullock goes to the driver, her sister goes, "Go, go, go, go, go!" And the driver goes,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.040
 "What? I can't run a red light." The whole, and they just sat there for a while and then they

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.800
 started driving, the whole movie is that. It's people's personalities changing scene for scene.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.520
 Sometimes Sandra Bullock is very like caring and we're like, "We can't let this guy go back out

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.920
 there. That's suicide. We have to take this guy in." And then she also has her kid and her friend's

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.640
 kid. They both gave birth at the same time as one of the Colt members was running through the

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.640
 house trying to open their eyes up. And she has both those kids for five years. She gives birth

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.600
 to one of the other little babies there and the mom jumps out the window. So Sandra Bullock with

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.120
 two babies, five years later we go into the future and she named the kids "Boy and Girl." So it's like

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.080
 she's sentimental towards Total Stranger. It was supposed to be like she wasn't ready for motherhood

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.280
 or whatever, nonsense like that, but in some scenes she was totally like close to strangers and other

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.320
 scenes she can't even like name these kids for five years. It's called Bird Box because she has a

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.320
 box full of birds. Birds make noises when the monsters are around. And the whole climax of the

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:47.440
 movie is her rowing a boat down a river blindfolded. I've seen some stupid, implausible stuff in movies,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.960
 but rowing a boat blindfolded down a river, it takes the cake. I've never seen anything that

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.040
 dumb ever. Early in the movie they drive a car blindfolded and they kind of are like, "Well

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.400
 this car is GPS and it has like the sensor warnings, but you would be in a... If you did a boat

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.040
 blindfolded for more than two minutes, you're totally gone. It's like a six mile journey. It's

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.480
 completely ridiculous." So yeah, that's it Bird Box. Don't watch it. Sorry guys. Better look next

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:20.720
 time Netflix. It was better than Cloverfield Paradox, kinda. Okay, so as my dehydrated body,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:30.400
 my husk sits here, still soaked with four ciders, trying to rehydrate. Let's take a look at some

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.920
 New Year's tradition stuff. I thought it was interesting because I was trying to, I was like,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.840
 "Are there any New Year's ghosts?" There's always a ghost walking on a hall somewhere,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.600
 but that's not interesting to me. So with all that being said, let's talk about Pizza Gate.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.760
 It's only barely connected to it, but it all started off with a Pizza Gate thread on Twitter,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.040
 which eventually brought in the daughter of Hillary and Bill Clinton. So Chrissy Teigen.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.640
 Chrissy Teigen is a model and she's been around forever. I'm not calling you old Chrissy, but

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.200
 you've been around for a while. She posted on Twitter, she posted pictures of a little girl,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.840
 and her little girl was dressed up as a hot dog, as a pineapple, and as Alice from Alice

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.240
 Wonderland. Not all of the same time. As awesome as that costume would be. A hot dog dressed up as

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.640
 Alice with a pineapple on it said, it was three different costumes, and then another tweet,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:29.280
 she tweeted the emoticon of a slice of pizza. So the Twitter people jumped all over this and said,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.920
 oh my god, Chrissy Teigen is part of Pizza Gate. Look at these photos. And other people were like,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.800
 oh my god, dude, how can you deny that these photos are pictures of Pizza Gate? Here's why.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:49.120
 Alice from Alice in Wonderland is supposedly used by MK Ultra agents to brainwash young girls.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:55.760
 You know Alice falls in the looking glass, the mirror. Anytime you see Alice in Wonderland imagery,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.720
 it's because the Illuminati wants you to see that. They're showing you that that's how they brainwash

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:08.160
 young girls. And hot dogs. You're like, well, hot dogs are all American. How can that be associated

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:16.000
 with a French revolutionary group of masons from the 1700s? How does a hot dog have to do with them?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.640
 Well, a hot dog is a code word. You should know this audience. Oh, what? I can't believe I have to

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:30.720
 even explain this concept to you. It's so obvious. A hot dog is a code word for a young boy.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.720
 Should dump you for the Pizza Gate audience. How can you not get that reference?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.640
 Now, obviously, your question would be, why is the little girl dressed up like a hot dog then?

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:50.080
 Don't think too much about it. Just post a bunch of comments and like this video on YouTube.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.480
 And it was so funny on the tweets, they're like, yeah, I don't know what pineapple means.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.720
 The pineapple has no code in this Pizza Gate mythology. It's just pineapple. So they couldn't

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.200
 fit that in. Anyways, a couple of the tweets, and I've actually discovered this too. You know,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.080
 we talked about Hans and he believed that men are women and women are men and there's this big thing

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.120
 to, that's actually way bigger than I thought it was. That's, I thought it was just a Hans thing.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:22.080
 No, there's tons of people who believe that most women are really men and most men are really women.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.200
 So we'll have to explore that again. But in these tweets, they bring that up and they're like,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.640
 yeah, Chrissy Teigen's a man anyways. And other people are like, what? And there's one person said,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.560
 hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, like I believe in Pizza Gate, but you know, you got to knock off with this

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.200
 trans hatred. So there it was this weird, because the dude just threw it out and was like, yeah,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.160
 you know, it's a man. What do you expect? Anyways, Chrissy Teigen responded to this and said,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.600
 I normally don't respond to this type of stuff, but you're assaulting my kids. One of the people

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.800
 on Twitter said, look at the kids, look at the look in that kid's eyes. It's very common. That's

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.360
 what sexual assault or that's what abuse victims look like. That's pretty low, dude. That's, that's

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.880
 of someone's kid that like wearing a costume and you're saying, yeah, that that kid gets abused.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.320
 That's, that's pretty, pretty jacked up. So Chrissy Teigen responds to this and she's like,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.240
 hey, man, you guys are making fun of my kids. Like kind of crossing the line. And Chelsea Clinton

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.720
 responded to that tweet saying, hey, you know, happens to me. I don't, I don't mind when they

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.560
 make fun of me, but when they started making fun of my daughter and threatening my daughter,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.080
 I report all of those. Now the beautiful thing about Twitter is you can have somebody who is

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:42.000
 super duper, duper famous, super powerful and whatever and anyone can contact them in public.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.160
 There was a thread recently where Mila Jovovich was just randomly talking about

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.400
 movies, like resident evil movies and someone tweeted back, you suck. And she was like,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.480
 I suck. You suck. You'll never be on the set of a movie. Total. I mean, it's probably a fake account.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:05.440
 Someone created yelled at a huge movie star and flipped her out. So Chelsea Clinton, daughter of

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.240
 Hillary and Bill Clinton, reaches out to a Twitter friend. They don't really know each other in real

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:16.640
 life, but a fellow mom and says, Hey, I go through it too. And then someone with the account called

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.640
 rogue Hooters staff, like a rogue member of the restaurant Hooters just says, eat shit, Chelsea.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.280
 And it just tagged right to her. That's the greatest thing about Twitter. So that started a big thing

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:35.440
 where people were then contacting Hooters and saying someone is using an account that makes

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:41.440
 it seem like they work for you to insult an ex-president's daughter. So then Hooters had to

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.240
 get involved and say, Hey, we don't have anything to do with this account. Once Hooters gets involved,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.280
 Chrissy Teigen is like, what is happening? Like, hi Hooters. That's her exact tweet. Because you

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:58.800
 have these two powerful famous women and a restaurant that is known for busty women and pot

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:04.880
 wings has to get involved. Chelsea Clinton responds in 2017 at Church of Satan and I were put on a

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:11.200
 few threads together in 2018. It's Hooters. What a time to be alive, Chrissy. The Church of Satan,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.680
 because she tagged them in this, the Church of Satan responds, the never ending excitement here is

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.760
 never ending. And then Chelsea Clinton responds, it's been so long. Happy New Year. And in that,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.480
 she tagged Church of Satan, Chrissy Teigen and four other people, most likely Hooters and whoever

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:33.360
 else was in the thread. Now that happened earlier, obviously, in like January of 2018. So people took

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.440
 that seriously. The people, and it's funny because it's on Snopes, did Chelsea Clinton tweet Happy

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.480
 New Year to the Church of Satan? And it's true because she did. But you have to take it in the

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.240
 context of all everything that happened before that. It was kind of this thing like, what a wacky

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.360
 world we live in. First, I'm connected to at Church of Satan and now I'm connected to at Hooters and

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:02.400
 I'm this person and it's just, I'm a mom and it's just such a weird thing. But that actually made

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.240
 things worse for her and Pete's a gate and everything like that. Even Sarah Palin, Vice

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.080
 Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin, chimed in and then a bunch of other just normal people chimed

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:21.440
 in saying, you know, this, this just goes to show what we're up against. This is Peter Wood,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.480
 this is the Satanic Elite, so on and so forth and blah, blah, blah. Yes, she did wish Happy

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.640
 New Year to the Church of Satan. But it's so bizarre that all the context is gone from that.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.400
 A lot of this stuff, it has to be about the context. However, of course, this just threw fuel on the

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:44.160
 fire because now Chelsea Clinton is talking to someone who's accused of being, dressing her

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.200
 kid up as a hot dog and now the Church of Satan's involved. You know, is Hooters part of the

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.920
 Illuminati? I don't know, it's hard to keep track of all this stuff. But yes, she did. It is true,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:00.480
 she did wish them a Happy New Year. But again, yeah, it's all about the context. So, New Year's

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.360
 traditions. We've talked about Chelsea Clinton ringing in the New Year by talking to the Church

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:12.080
 of Satan. Did you know? No, Franz is not showing up, even though that is his character, that is

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.400
 his official phrase. I should get a shirt made that just says, "Did you know?" has a picture of a

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:23.360
 guy named Franz. But did you know? Did you know? No, no, Franz, I just did Franz on

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:30.080
 Bam McGarras afterlife. He can't come back that quickly. But did you know that there is actually

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.640
 a movement? It's probably like three people, but they actually believe it. That New Year's Day

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:44.480
 is Satanic and so are New Year's resolutions. So, the New Year Day, the New Year Day being

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.560
 Satanic, that's a fairly, it's not a very controversial belief. The idea is, and it's true

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.920
 in the sense that when Christianity began to take over Europe, they went the path of least

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.320
 resistance. People had traditional holidays, pagan holidays, and the Church says, "Yeah,

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.240
 this Jesus' birthday." Because they really don't care. They're like, "If this is when everyone

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.400
 gets together and hangs out, we'll just rename it." They did that with churches and holy sites and

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:16.000
 holidays across the board. Apparently in the Bible, there's a part in Exodus where God says to Moses

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.720
 and Aaron, and I think Aaron's his son or something like that. Maybe it's just some other dude who's

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.120
 just like, he was like a time traveler who just hung out with Moses and he pops up occasionally

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.120
 in the Bible. I wonder if there is a time traveler in the Bible, like Bible times,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:35.200
 like just chilling in the background. Okay, so Moses and Aaron are hanging out and God goes,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:42.160
 "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:49.440
 you." Fades away. So, what he's talking about is, back in Hebrew times, there was, they used a

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.760
 different calendar obviously, because they had no idea what who Julius Caesar was. They,

00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:00.080
 they're basically, when God was saying that, it was the month that is between our modern

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:07.920
 March and April, which is supposed to be the new year. And we have it on January 1st, therefore,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.320
 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are satanic. Those aren't the days that God wanted us to worship,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.680
 or wanted us to celebrate as the new calendar. I don't think he cares, dude. And actually,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.120
 the website I was reading, it was from a book that was published in 1964, hasn't gained a ton of

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:30.000
 attraction. Just believe, because again, I don't, that's such a minimal thing. It's not a holy holiday

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.880
 when you celebrate the New Year's. It's simply just a day to say, "Hey, it's new beginnings." I don't,

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.800
 we're not a farming culture. The reason why the logic saying that God assigned that time is their

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.480
 beginning, is because it was harvest based. You got to pick your battles sometimes.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.760
 Like, if you're trying to save the souls of humanity from eternal torment, if that's what

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:57.760
 you truly believe, I don't think getting them to put down their poppers on December 31st is a good

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.920
 tactic. You got to choose your battles. And I think that's what Rome was doing.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.480
 Just the church in general, they're like, "Whatever, dude. Yeah, Jesus was born right now."

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.120
 Your old holiday is gone. This is the new one. They're just choosing their battles.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:18.000
 So on its own, I didn't find that one super compelling. However, there's a trick that I've

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.600
 learned. You can type in blank conspiracy. Someone believes a conspiracy about that. And I

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.320
 talked about that on episode four or five, a long time ago. But the problem is, a lot of times,

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.360
 it just pulls up criminal conspiracies. However, you can, into Google, not just,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.880
 I shouldn't be specific, not just type it into a text file. You have to type it into a search

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:44.320
 engine. You can type anything blank satanic. Someone will believe it's satanic, oddly enough.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.360
 No matter what you choose, if you put in laundry detergent satanic, I'm sure something will pop up.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:58.160
 So when I typed in New Year's satanic, I found this old article. But then, oh man,

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:05.920
 I think I hit the jackpot here. Did you know, did you know that not only is New Year's Day satanic,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.560
 but New Year's resolutions is one of Satan's greatest weapons against humanity? So I'm going

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.840
 to read from this article here. It starts off with a bombshell. It starts off with something

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.400
 that I always personally believed, but my mind was blown when I read this sentence. Here's the

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:32.160
 first sentence of this part. A society is not a chimney. Oh, what? I, oh man, I always compare

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:38.560
 society to a chimney. I, I was, I thought I was the only person who ever even saw the two connected

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:45.600
 in any sort of way. But this guy, this guy knows, man, society is not a chimney. You know what?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:54.960
 According to this guy, a chimney is built of bricks. Okay. You stack up bricks one on top of the other,

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.320
 and at some point you have a chimney. I think you have to have a little more planning than that.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.240
 I don't think you can just stack bricks up and you have a chimney. I think you have to design it

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:10.000
 and it has to be like a shape with a hollow tube through it. But it's analogy, whatever. A society

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.600
 is not a chimney because a chimney is built of bricks. You stack one on another in any sort of

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.960
 random order with no design, whatever, and eventually becomes a chimney. But I actually,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:27.040
 you know, I'm adding the but. He doesn't add the but. This is his quote. A society, in a way,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:36.480
 is built up of spiritual bricks, i.e. resolutions. But doesn't that make it like a chimney? Now it's

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:43.600
 built of bricks. He has this weird, it's almost like he's going by the most strict definition

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.880
 of the word resolution as possible. When people say, "Away, what's your resolution for the new year?"

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:55.840
 It's a goal. It's a decision you're making. We tend that they're good resolutions, but something

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.480
 to be like, "Oh, I'm just going to drink as much alcohol as I can tonight." That's my resolution.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:07.040
 It's a goal. It's you're making a determination to do something. I'm resolved to do this. He goes

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.800
 into this whole thing. Think about the police forces, for example. A policeman has a uniform,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:19.760
 a badge, often a firearm if he's lucky, or he could be in Britain. But what distinguishes a true

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:27.440
 policeman from a uniformed bandit? What happens when policemen abandon their resolution to serve

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:33.280
 and to protect? You've got to have both of those in there that just can't serve. The material

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:39.120
 objects remain the same, the uniform, badge, pistol, but the spiritual brick shatters, crumbles,

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:46.240
 and disappears. What does any of this have to do with a new year's resolution? The title of this

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:55.360
 article that I'm reading from? New Year's Resolutions, a Satanic Plot? And I cut out where he spent

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:01.600
 the first third of the article. He came up with this weird mathematical formula to show what a

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:08.000
 resolution was. But anyways, so yes. But that's not when people say, "Oh, what's your resolution? Oh,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.560
 my resolution is uphold the law because I'm a police officer and that's my job." That's not what we

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:18.240
 think of when we think of a New Year's resolution. He then goes on to say stuff, "Think about banks.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.000
 Do you think that the money in your bank is really inside a big vault with your name on a

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.640
 stack of dollar bills? If the bank decides to abandon their resolution to give you your money

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:36.240
 when you ask for it, you're broke." But that's not what people mean. Now, he goes on and on with all

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.200
 of these examples of it, but I've got to get to the meat of it. This is the section entitled,

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:48.240
 "How Does Satan Attack Resolutions?" There's no, I couldn't make this up.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:57.440
 Satan doesn't have huge biceps or money or an army except for the millions of demons at its

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.960
 control. And I've always, I think, I think Satan would be pretty fit. I don't think he'd be like

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.240
 super lanky or like incredibly fat. I think he'd actually probably would have huge biceps, maybe

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:14.560
 not like 33 inch pythons or anything, but I don't think he would be, I don't think he would be

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.720
 someone who you'd be like, "Man, you need to hit the gym, Lord of Hell." I think he would be pretty

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.440
 ripped, but Satan doesn't have huge biceps, and he has all the money in the world if he's tied

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.800
 with these Illuminati guys, but anyways, Satan doesn't have huge biceps or money or an army,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:35.040
 but he's the owner of a kind of big marketing consulting firm.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:43.360
 Satan is a liar and the father of lies. I wonder who the mother is. I wonder if that's just a

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.680
 turn of phrase or if it's supposed like he gave birth to lies. I guess the snake lied for the,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.360
 I don't know. Since Satan wants to destroy everything that is good in our society,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:01.440
 he must attack the very substance of the spiritual bricks that make it up. Therefore,

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.240
 Satan does everything he can to give bad publicity to good resolutions.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:19.760
 One of Satan's favorite tricks is to throw dirt, throw a handful of dirt on the reputation of

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:29.360
 resolutions using his famous New Year's Resolutions ad campaign. So I imagine like Satan's sitting

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.920
 down in hell and he's like "Oh man, humanity's been doing so good for the past 10,000 years,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.760
 there haven't been any sort of wars, people aren't just murdering each other in the streets,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.040
 there's no terrible diseases, if only I had some way to stir the pot up on earth."

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:51.200
 So the world's just getting nuked to pieces. He's like "Nah, it's not good enough. What I need to do,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:57.520
 what I need to do, we need to straight up madmen this, we need to get an ad campaign going."

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.400
 And they're like "What, devil? Devil?" He's like "My name's Satan dude, don't call me devil.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:08.240
 Okay, Satan, Satan, what do you think we should do? What do you release more Ebola?"

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.360
 He's like "Nah, it's child's play." You know what? I heard, have you guys ever heard the term

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.720
 spiritual bricks and they're like "What?" No, and Satan's like me neither. But we should tear apart

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:25.840
 these things we've never heard of by starting a thing called New Year's Resolutions. The other

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.880
 demons are like "Ooh yeah, we could have these start during March between March and April and

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.080
 Satan's like "No, we have to do it the Satanic New Year January 1st. What do you guys think?"

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.960
 And the demons are like "Oh yeah, sorry." So, Satan has set up the idea of New Year's Resolutions

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.200
 and here's why. Back to this article, we're leaving hell to back to this article.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:55.520
 "The poor, gollible suckers who bite this diabolical fish hook always bitterly repent afterwards.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.280
 The New Year arrives and they are filled with good intentions so they leap.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.000
 Quick, I must run a marathon right away since I'm fat."

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.160
 Trust me, no fat person ever says they have to run a marathon right away.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.840
 And at the same time, I'll do my income tax return since I'm always late. And while I'm

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.040
 running with my computer and my bundles of invoices under one arm, I'll hold a paintbrush in my

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.480
 mouth and a canvas under the other since I've been wanting to learn oil painting for years.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.160
 What are the probabilities of success for such an endeavor?

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:36.400
 About zero. I would say that's beyond zero. You're fat, you're running a marathon,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.640
 you're doing your taxes and you're trying to paint at the same time. But back to the article,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:46.720
 but this is exactly what Satan wants. He wants people to take as few resolutions as possible

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.040
 and to take them as incorrectly as possible in conditions which practically guarantee their

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.960
 failure and especially that they create as many bad memories as possible.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:07.840
 He didn't laugh in the article, that was me. So apparently Satan, father of lies and Lord of

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:14.480
 the Flies, it kind of rhymes, and has this huge demonic army and according to this guy, isn't fit,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:20.240
 but I'm sure he has at least a barbell set in hell. He has all this power, be magic basically.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:27.040
 He can be invisible, he can tempt people, but his main plan is having like whispering in people's

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:33.520
 ears, "You should lose weight." He'll never lose weight. The problem with that is that what if the

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.280
 dude loses weight? And he's like, he goes about it the right way and says, "I'm fat, I should run a

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.160
 marathon. Next marathon's in eight months, I'm gonna do it." And Satan's like, "Dag, nab it! I

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.120
 should never whisper it in his ear to lose weight. Now I'll have to wait 60 years to capture his soul."

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:55.920
 But you know, again, it's one of those things, like this dude was reaching, he had to come up with

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.400
 such a strict definition of the word, I think he was working backwards. I think he was probably

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.960
 sitting there smoking the Christian equivalent of marijuana and thought, "Dude, what if New

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:13.600
 Year's resolutions are satanic and then worked backwards to prove his point?" That if I have

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:19.600
 such a strict version of the word resolution, then it's, New Year's resolutions are something you

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.760
 say you're gonna do and you're right, not a lot of people do it, but it doesn't create bad memories,

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.840
 you just go, "Oh yeah, I totally forgot, I was supposed to learn how to play guitar this year."

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.880
 You don't sit around and cry about it. And to be fair, if it is part of Satan's plans, most

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.840
 people's New Year's resolutions are pretty self-serving, so you think that would work against

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:45.760
 Satan, because New Year's resolutions are stuff like, "I want to buy a house, I want more money,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.640
 I want to lose weight so I can be more attractive to attract the opposite sex." That's all very

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.280
 really kind of selfish people, not a lot of people do New Year's resolutions when they say,

00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:02.640
 "I want to give more money to charity." Normally it's something material and say,

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.400
 "You should be like, "Yeah, yeah, do it, lose weight and buy that house, that's all that's

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:11.040
 important, don't worry about your spiritual growth, do it." You think it would be the opposite, but

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:18.480
 again, clever little trick, if you want to find anything bizarre, just type in "blank Satan"

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.680
 or "blank Satanic" and you'll get stuff like this. The idea of Satan running a marketing firm,

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:30.880
 though, I just imagine him with like one of those tripod things and you have like the sheet of paper

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.960
 on it and you kind of like flip it over. He says of all night, like on these huge sheets of paper,

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.680
 writing down his marketing plans and then he takes it into the office with all the other demons,

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:45.760
 he sets up the tripod, puts the big sheet of paper on it and instantly he rubs it in flames and he's

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:51.120
 like, "Oh yeah, I forgot I'm in hell." Like, how would you have a marketing team in hell? What are

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:58.160
 their desks made of? I mean, everything would have to be stone. You can't have a computer down there,

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:04.160
 it's all on fire. Everything, I mean, all of your legal documents would be on like five miles of rock.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.120
 Go walk three miles over that way, that's where the fine print is. I'd like to give this

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:14.960
 diet gotten a benefit of the doubt and not think that he actually meant that Satan ran an actual

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:22.320
 marketing firm, but or marketing campaign, whatever the term was. No, it says he's the owner of a kind

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.520
 of big marketing consulting firm. So maybe he has a bit of an outcry because he said kind of,

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:34.560
 "But it's still, I just imagine it's a place called like Satan and the Sons and you go in there

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.880
 and you go in there and you're like, "This is my product, how are we gonna sell it?" And Satan's

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:46.240
 like, "Hmm, discarded baby flesh, there's a market for that somewhere." He sells it to Avon. I just love

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:55.200
 the idea that God's eternal, upon God's likespin, the past 10,000 years preparing for the final war

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:01.840
 between good and evil and Lucifer's down there making ad campaigns for IBM. I love that idea.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:07.040
 I'm just imagining at some point in the future, Satan's gonna be sitting there going over a pie

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.920
 chart that's made out of pebbles and seashells and then all of a sudden he's gonna look up at his

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.640
 clock and go, "Oh wait, I forgot Armageddon's coming." And then just a bunch of angels show up,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:21.760
 just lay waste to his entire empire. Satan and Sons, that's just where I'm gonna start getting

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.640
 all my marketing done from. DeadRabbitRadioGmail.com is going to be your email address. You can also
