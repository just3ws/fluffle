WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 A bridge that makes unusual noises.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.180
 A movie that has been banned from being shown in North America.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:21.460
 And then we travel to Brussels to meet a man who had a close encounter with an alien surveyor.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.700
 But things get really weird when the alien walks away today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.380
 [Demonic music]

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.420
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.940
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.020
 I'm having a great day.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.140
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.100
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.500
 So let's hop on board the Jason Jalopy.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.180
 [Demonic music]

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.500
 That's a great acre song.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.940
 Is there an old television show involving a junkie car?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.260
 Beverly Hillbilly is the one I was looking for.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.740
 How does that song go?

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.020
 [Demonic music]

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.180
 That is my non-copyrighted version of the Beverly Hillbilly song.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.060
 [Demonic music]

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.420
 So we're all hopping on board.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.820
 I got my banjo.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.660
 I'm sitting in the back.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.860
 You guys get to drive the Jason Jalopy today.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 [Demonic music]

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.660
 Hurry up Jason.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.820
 Just do the stupid episode.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.620
 Hold on, I gotta do my solo.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.340
 Jason, the whole thing's been a solo.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 I'm fine.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.900
 I'll put my banjo away.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.060
 You go, where are we going?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 And I say, we are going to Heartbreak Bridge.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 You're like, Jason, it's still not enough info.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.220
 Just use the GPS.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.780
 [Demonic music]

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.180
 And as you try to figure out how to use my old GPS,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.060
 you're finally able to find out that we're headed

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.620
 to the town of Portal, Nebraska.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.060
 The car is going down the road.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.420
 [Demonic music]

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.660
 Sun setting.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.740
 That's it for the episode.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.580
 See you guys later.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.420
 Now, so anyways, we end up in Portal, Nebraska.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.100
 [Demonic music]

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.260
 We're going around the corner of the music sites up again.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.100
 Your ears are bleeding at this point.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.180
 You're like, huh?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.060
 I tell you, my doctor says I have to play this

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.900
 if I stop playing.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.380
 My heart stops.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.220
 And you don't believe me entirely,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.780
 but at the same time, you're a little unsure.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.260
 So, boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.140
 But eventually I do, I'm going to put the banjo on my back.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.100
 We're going to walk around Portal, Nebraska.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.380
 Now, Portal is kind of an odd ghost town.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.260
 From what I can gather, it is a town

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.460
 that is now surrounded by the suburbs.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.660
 So it was basically like there was a railroad track there,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.180
 a post office, a little town built around the post office,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.380
 and then everything kind of shut down.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.620
 But the buildings are still there,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.300
 but then there's just suburbs around it.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.180
 So it's like an old schoolhouse, an old post office,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.100
 a train stop, maybe a couple other buildings,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.020
 and then there's a great grass yard,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.900
 and then there's Lil Billy's house,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.020
 where he just hangs out, throws baseballs at people.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.900
 So it's not like a traditional ghost town

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.300
 in the middle of nowhere type of thing.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.060
 A town has popped up around this place.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.940
 And for all I know, the buildings aren't there anymore.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.420
 It was kind of hard to tell.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.620
 This place is in Wikipedia.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.020
 It's a legit place.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.900
 But this is pretty much the entire sentence

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.780
 in the Wikipedia page.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.140
 "Portal was established on the railroad.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.180
 "A post office opened at portal in 1887

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.660
 "and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1898."

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.020
 That's pretty much it.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.260
 So why are you wasting my time with this, Jason?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.740
 Why did you drag us all the way out to portal?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.780
 If that's all there is.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.700
 Wikipedia, if that's all there is,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.900
 is there really a story here?

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.620
 And I go, "Yes, yes, I wanna waste your time."

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.460
 Would I?

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.620
 And then you go, "Jason, did you listen

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.180
 "to last Friday's episode?"

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.180
 And I was like, "Okay, so let's talk about portal Nebraska."

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.540
 So in the early 1900s, there was the school there,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.900
 little school there, and at the school was a teacher.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.700
 Can you have a school without a teacher?

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.020
 That is a question you should ask a philosopher.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.220
 Or 20 years from now when all teachers

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.660
 have been replaced with robots.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.140
 But can a school exist without a teacher?

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.980
 As of now, no.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.320
 And especially not back then.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.720
 So you had a teacher and she was coming to class

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.160
 and she's like, "Students, today we're going to learn

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.360
 "about history.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.120
 "It's happening right now 'cause it's the 1900s."

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.840
 So open your books and the kids are like doing schoolwork

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.080
 and then she'd go home and she'd eat soup, home alone,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.960
 doing stuff, burglars trying to break in her house.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.000
 She's like, "Ah, electrocuting them."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.220
 The next day she comes to school,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.220
 she's like, "We're gonna learn more about math today.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.640
 "It's the new fangled science, math, it just invented."

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.920
 So these little 1900 kids, there's not 1900 kids

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.880
 in the 1900s kids, they're reading the books,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.880
 learning about math first time ever.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.920
 She goes home, it's home alone too.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.720
 Now different burglars are trying to break in her house

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.120
 or maybe the same ones, I don't know,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.960
 I never saw any of those movies.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.400
 But the stress gets to her.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.440
 Whether it was the constant break-ins at her home

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.160
 or maybe it was the fact that she had to wear

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.000
 really, really chafy, old-timey clothing

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.760
 'cause that stuff doesn't look very comfortable.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.800
 It looks thick and woolen and just kind of gross.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.680
 It'd be like wearing a wool sweater

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.420
 but all over your body.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.440
 She eventually snaps, so she's in class one day

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.440
 and she's like, "Kids, you wanna learn a real lesson?

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.440
 "You wanna learn how I got these scars?"

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.920
 Apparently she became a joker.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.420
 She has a mental breakdown.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.600
 She barricades the door, she grabs a hatchet,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.440
 which she apparently has in her classroom.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.660
 You know, in case a bear comes lumbering through,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.480
 there's three little bears standing on top of each other

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.400
 wearing a trench coat and a human face.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.120
 Wait, no, they wouldn't wanna be human sized.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.400
 They were supposed to be kids.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.160
 The little bear cubs would be sneaking in

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.160
 with little human masks.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.800
 She has the hatchet to chase them up.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.840
 This teacher has a hatchet in her classroom.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.440
 She barricades the door, shut.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.800
 She jumps up on her desk, starts swinging the hatchet

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.840
 over her head, that's not part of the myth,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.160
 but we're just gonna add it in.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.240
 And she proceeds to cut off all the kids' heads.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.080
 (imitates head shaking)

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.980
 And then there's a bunch of heads

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.400
 just rolling on the ground.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.520
 The sound, it's just, imagine if you wanna know

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.380
 what it sounds like, take a bunch of cabbage,

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.020
 go to the store right now by 12, 15 heads of cabbage,

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.860
 'cause I'm assuming that's how many gets her hair,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.560
 just population numbers.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.340
 It's actually just a wild guess.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.520
 Take a bunch of heads of cabbage,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.140
 bring 'em home, and throw 'em on your floor.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.260
 Or, you know, I guess you could just go on YouTube,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.080
 type in, "Head of Head,"

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.760
 lettuce hitting the floor, play it on YouTube.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.420
 You don't have to go and buy it all at the store.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.180
 The point is, is that she chopped off a bunch of heads.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.420
 Then, she felt bad about it.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.660
 She felt really bad about it.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.620
 And she's sitting there and she's like,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.400
 I probably shouldn't have done that.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.040
 Probably should not have chopped off all those kids' heads.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.200
 So what do you do when you feel bad after a mass murder?

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.100
 You cut their hearts out and walk to the bridge

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.220
 and throw their hearts one by one into the water.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.960
 That is the story, that's the origin story

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.460
 of what's known as Heartbeat Bridge.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.460
 Heartbeat Bridge.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.940
 And the legend today, they say,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.280
 if you go to Porto Mabrasco,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.860
 if you go to this little tiny parcel of land,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.520
 you can walk across Heartbeat Bridge

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.360
 and you can hear the sounds of heartbeats.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.120
 (mimics beating)

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.900
 Now that could be a bullfrog.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.500
 Could be a bullfrog living underneath the bridge.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.660
 But supposedly, it's the sound of the hearts.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.000
 And sometimes the ghost teacher will show up

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.120
 on the bridge as well,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.220
 mourning the loss of all of her students.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.980
 This story obviously has some huge holes.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.320
 And I'm not talking about the holes in the children's chest.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.160
 And the reason why I was able to make all those jokes

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.440
 about kids getting their heads chopped off,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.280
 because the story is not true.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.800
 There's no historical reference

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.640
 of a mass murder taking place at a school.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.560
 But Jason, it happened in the 1900s

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.500
 and they weren't writing stuff down.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.040
 Trust me, they didn't have the best record keeping,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.560
 but they would write down,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.320
 "School Marm Kills 12, Throws Hearts in River."

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.600
 Like, they had very good records

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.940
 dating all the way back to like the 1500s, 1600s.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.080
 So early 1900s, definitely would have been in the newspaper.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080
 So it didn't happen at all.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.720
 So I feel totally fine making all those jokes.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.680
 There's a couple other questions about it.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.920
 One, nobody knows where this bridge is at now.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.840
 Like, it's weird.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.100
 It's an urban legend in the area,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.100
 but when people go,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.220
 there's disagreement over which bridge it is.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.500
 Which to me, it should be pretty obvious.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.200
 It's the bridge adjacent to the schoolhouse

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.760
 where the kids got murdered,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.860
 and the bridge where you hear human hearts

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.160
 beating underneath it.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.320
 It's not an easy thing to confuse.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.460
 You're at another bridge across town.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.300
 You're like, "That's weird.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.580
 I don't hear the tortured souls of a bunch of kids,

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.140
 but this might be it."

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.420
 Like, it's either the bridge that has the phenomenon

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.760
 that's in the area, or it doesn't exist.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.820
 So there's disagreement over which bridge is heartbeat bridge,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.660
 but the bridge supposedly has that horrible sound

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.060
 and a ghost.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.100
 Most important question is, women, okay.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.940
 Let me say this.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.840
 Like, looking at like movies and stuff like that,

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.480
 women in the 1900s,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.780
 despite their clothes looking very uncomfortable,

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.420
 tended to be, at least in the movies, pretty attractive.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.880
 Would you bang a school marmed ghost?

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.060
 Because, hold on, before you shut off the podcast,

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.640
 let me make my argument.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.620
 On the one hand, you would say no,

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.000
 because she's probably going to be like super snooty

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 and she can hit you with a ruler,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.620
 and I'm not into that type of stuff.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.160
 Well, I am into snooty girls.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.780
 I'm into real snatching the other thing.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.060
 That's it, we're putting that.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.520
 Okay, she'll hit you with a ruler, and she's a ghost.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.400
 Those are the two downsides to her being,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.000
 banging her, right?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.100
 But the plus side is, she's super snooty,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.140
 and I love like real bitchy chicks.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.040
 Girls who are like snooty or like bitchy and stuff like that.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.880
 I love that.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.920
 So, you get that,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.120
 'cause she's a school marmer in the 1900s,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.120
 and she's hot, 'cause she's the school marmer from the 1900s.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.520
 Would you try seducing her?

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.120
 Now, to be fair, you might have a hard time picking up

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.080
 a ghost at the site of her mass murder.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.920
 'Cause if that's the only place she manifests,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.560
 it's not like you could then see her at the library

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.120
 or see her at a bar and be like,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.520
 hey, I read about you in the paper,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.740
 horrible thing that happened,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.800
 but I've lost my temper too.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.760
 Never heard of anybody, but I've been there.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.600
 Can I buy you a drink?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.480
 And she'd be like, yes, yes, thank you.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.760
 And you can get her mind off of it.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.000
 You're sitting at the bar,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.480
 all of a sudden some funny television show comes on,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.800
 you're sitting watching it together,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.540
 close captioning 'cause everyone's talking.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.960
 You're drinking, you're having a good time,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.800
 and then you invite her back to your place.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.760
 That is what I do, generally,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.520
 but because she's a ghost, she's trapped at the site.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.280
 Okay, so let's rephrase this here.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.600
 There's a hot girl, she's sitting on a bridge

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.640
 where she, 100 years ago, murdered a bunch of kids

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.680
 through their hearts underwater.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.680
 And I show up, I'm like, hey, what's up?

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.520
 Hey, how's it going?

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.360
 Yeah, my name's Jason, it's nice to meet you.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.080
 And she's like, yeah, no,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.400
 she probably gets hit on all the time.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.920
 I know, but I gotta keep going for this, right?

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.280
 Like, this is what I want.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.100
 You don't let up first time,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.240
 the girl kind of shrugs, 'cause I get that a lot.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.920
 Kind of shrugs, kind of the shoulder look,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.800
 but I just go, she's just being snooty.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.560
 So now this has become how Jason picks up women of a certain.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.160
 The, you don't give up the first time,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.400
 unless they, I've had girls say I'm not interested.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.720
 And to me, that's the best,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.000
 'cause then I don't have to waste my time,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.480
 they'll just be like, now I'm not interested.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.520
 I'm like, okay, I'm out.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.480
 But, and I appreciate that.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.080
 But I'm like, you know, and I don't walk away first.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.960
 I'm like, well, you know, beautiful night out, isn't it?

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.920
 And she's kind of like, yeah, it is really nice.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.280
 And then I usually will find some of this,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.920
 another tip I do, I will find somebody else

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.120
 in the vicinity to make fun of,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.760
 that I think that person wouldn't like.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.360
 So let's see, I mean, this definitely has become

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.320
 what Jason picks up women of a certain.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.000
 I meet a girl at a bar and let's say there's a bad

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.720
 karaoke singer or something like that.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.220
 I'll be like, oh my God, like,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.880
 I guess I'll make a joke.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.680
 I'm not gonna repeat one of the jokes I'll make

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.080
 on this episode 'cause they're usually really bad,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.400
 but girls tend to find them funny.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.240
 And so as we're sitting on this heartbeat bridge,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.760
 as we're sitting on heartbeat bridge,

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.560
 I see a guy jogging in the distance.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.040
 And I'm like, look at that guy,

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.320
 make a funny joke about what he's wearing

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.160
 or something like that.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.640
 And then she starts laughing and then I'm hitting on her.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.460
 The whole time we're hearing,

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.840
 boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.440
 It's the heartbeats.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.680
 I'm trying to mack on this girl over the heartbeats

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.400
 of dead, of her dead murder victims.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.860
 But I would still probably try it.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.520
 I probably would still try it

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.280
 because I'm just that kind of guy.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.640
 But I don't remember what my hypothetical

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.040
 ethical question was.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.400
 I don't remember if it's if you should

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.240
 or if, which should you hit on a ghost

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.440
 or should I hit on a ghost

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.300
 or I don't remember what the hypothetical was.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.500
 The point is the story is 100% not true.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.960
 It's an interesting creepy story

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.220
 that I'm sure was passed around the neighborhood

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.900
 for a long time because there was a creepy schoolhouse

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.100
 in the area that was abandoned.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.500
 And some big brother made this story up

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.820
 and it's spread through the neighborhood

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.960
 to the point that now it's an internet legend.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.100
 But no, no one was murdered here.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.740
 And the idea of noises being heard underneath bridges

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.340
 is very, very common.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.060
 There's been stories of the suicide dog bridge

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.260
 in Dublin or Britain or something like that.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.220
 They see a misty figure kind of walking along the bridge.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.340
 It's not uncommon to see mist around bridges.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.100
 It's not uncommon as water is moving underneath stuff

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.920
 to make odd noises.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.840
 So there probably is a bridge in the area

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.280
 or a bridge somewhere in the world

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.620
 that sounds like there's heartbeats

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.200
 because of the way the water's saving the rocks.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.340
 But this story definitely didn't happen.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.640
 It's an interesting urban legend.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.980
 And I totally would try to pick this chick up.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.140
 But, but I don't know if I'd bring her home

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.220
 because I already have a haunted doll

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.980
 and an old man in the closet.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.940
 I don't know, I'd have to say, how about your place?

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.860
 And she's like, yeah, sure.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.660
 And then we go into a hellish void.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.500
 I'm like, ah!

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.580
 Still, it's, I mean, you know,

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.020
 bad ghost sex is better than no ghost sex.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.780
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.320
 that to be honest, I'm gonna have to cut a bunch out of

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.120
 because I went off in that rant.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.260
 This is a story of a movie

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.380
 that's actually lost media in a sense.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.980
 Lost media is the idea of,

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.340
 it's kind of exactly what it sounds like.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.500
 So you have stuff that was filmed

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.740
 and then is disappeared or recorded and it's disappeared.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.700
 And now some of the lost media is like Grizzly Man.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.820
 It's a guy who really loved Grizzly Bears,

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.780
 him and his girlfriend in a tent.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.340
 And there's an audio recording of them being eaten alive

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.780
 or at least disemboweled by a bear.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.620
 The camera was on, but the lens cap was on as well.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.460
 So you hear this audio.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.580
 That's considered a lost media.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.500
 There's maybe been 10 people who've listened to it.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.780
 Christine Chubbock's suicide video,

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.380
 she was a newscaster who said,

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.020
 "I'm gonna try to commit."

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.020
 Now for the latest in "Blood and Gore,"

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.940
 here's a news first in "Attempted Suicide."

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.420
 She shoots herself on live television in the 1970s.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.340
 So there was like one VCR in the nation that recorded it.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.820
 These things are considered lost media

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.220
 'cause for the most part it's all gone.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.900
 This is an interesting and more lighthearted version of that.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.980
 I found some more lighthearted lost media

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:42.820
 that I'm gonna profile

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.420
 'cause I find the idea of stuff disappearing fascinating.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.340
 Like there's a lot of old "Doctor Who" episodes

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.500
 that were lost at the time

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.620
 because people when they were being made,

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.140
 they're like, "Oh, this is just a stupid show for kids."

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.140
 Or this is just a bunch of nerds.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.140
 We'll just shoot the show.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.980
 No one will ever wanna watch it again.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.340
 And so they were like re-recording over tapes.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.220
 So it wasn't just "Doctor Who," but a lot of shows did that.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.420
 But what happened with "Doctor Who" was some fan

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.380
 was recording it way back in the day

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.260
 with this very first VCR.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.740
 So they were able to reconstruct a lot of old episodes

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.460
 and they found episodes in the BBC archives

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.420
 and stuff like that.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.740
 So anyways, this one though is basically lost media

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.900
 only in North America.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.460
 You can watch it on YouTube,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.180
 but you can't show it to anybody else.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.540
 You cannot, it cannot be commercially shown

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.380
 in the United States or Canada

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.100
 because of a lawsuit with two of their actors.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.820
 This movie is called "Don's Plum."

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.460
 And I watched it in preparation for this story.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.300
 I don't like dramas.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.340
 The first 10 minutes is really irritating

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.540
 'cause I hate jazz music.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.500
 I can't stand it.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.100
 I cannot stand jazz music.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.180
 And people go, "Dude, you're a big hip-hop fan.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.420
 "You love rap."

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.180
 Jazz is the beginning of rap.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.660
 Yeah, I love human women and humans evolved

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.900
 from protozoas coming out of the ocean.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.100
 I don't love protozoas.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.500
 Like, I get it that jazz may have influenced

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.020
 the music I listen to, but jazz sucks.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.300
 It's the worst music out there.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.220
 I hate it.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.100
 I'd rather listen to "Honky Tonk Country" than jazz.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.820
 And I despise "Honky Tonk Country."

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.340
 I don't like jazz.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.180
 So when the movie started off at a jazz club,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.140
 it already was two beats behind.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.980
 But they leave the jazz club

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.300
 into some of the worst jazz music too.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.460
 (singing)

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.300
 I'm coming.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.420
 He's not coming.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.980
 But it's like, (singing)

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.340
 This is a musical episode, apparently.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.300
 Jazz is coming and it's making you feel good, girls.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.020
 You know how I make you feel.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.380
 Make you feel like you're the only one in the world, girls.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.740
 Oh my God, dude.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.420
 I was like, I'm only watching this movie

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.340
 so I can do a segment on it.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.420
 They leave the jazz club.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.420
 The whole movie is basically these characters

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.500
 sitting at a Denny's-esque restaurant called Don's Plum.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.100
 Maybe it's supposed to be a fancier restaurant

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.260
 but it reminded me of a Denny's with the kind of the seating.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.540
 There's four guys and they each have to bring a girl.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.460
 Each weekend they bring a different girl to this place.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.020
 They sit around, they talk.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.860
 It is one of the most authentic movies like that

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.260
 I've seen in a long time.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.500
 'Cause I used to do that.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.900
 I used to go, "Hang out with my friends."

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.260
 We'd all show up, we'd go to a Denny's,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.340
 we'd sit around and talk.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.300
 Sometimes we'd talk about normal stuff.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.900
 Sometimes a fight would break out.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.380
 Sometimes someone would bring a girl.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.020
 We didn't bring a different girl each weekend

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.140
 but sometimes somebody would bring a girl

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.780
 that nobody knew and she started Mouthing Off

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.500
 and the confrontation starts.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.380
 Or sometimes one of the dudes would start Mouthing Off.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.740
 Confrontation starts.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.460
 So it's very, very realistic movie.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.540
 A very, very well done movie.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.300
 The problem is, is it strength.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.500
 Is you have an actor.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.700
 All four actors were fairly well known at the time

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.660
 and a lot of them have gone on to do certain things.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.900
 But one of the actors, I don't remember,

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.260
 we had the actor who was in "Antiraj."

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.700
 You're like, "Jesus, that doesn't help me."

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.540
 There's one jacket, it was an "Antiraj."

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.660
 There's a bunch of people, I don't remember.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.980
 Anyways, there was a guy from "Antiraj."

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.780
 But then Toby McGuire and Leonard, Leonard,

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.980
 Toby McGuire and Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.820
 Leonard DiCaprio is these more commonly known as,

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:16.900
 are in this movie as well.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.260
 This was before "Titanic."

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.100
 This was before "The Cider House Rules."

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.260
 It's basically total, it's almost all improv.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.340
 It's very, very, it's almost all ad-libbed

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.660
 and it's really off the cuff.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.020
 So they make this movie, which apparently was a rid,

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.420
 there's a lot of disagreements on what was going on.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.780
 But anyways, this movie is made and Toby McGuire

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.700
 and/or his agent is like, "Shut it down.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.100
 "You can't let this movie get released.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.100
 "You look like a jerk."

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.300
 And he does look pretty bad,

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.980
 but Leonard DiCaprio looks like a psychopath in this movie.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.220
 And again, very, very real.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.380
 I don't think he's a psychopath,

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.380
 but he comes off as a very, very irritating jerk in it

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.580
 and he does a great job doing it.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.060
 And that may have been him,

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:58.900
 that may be him now,

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.220
 that may have been him when he was younger.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.180
 It could have been acting,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.140
 it could have been a little bit of everything put together,

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.260
 but apparently he thought it was great.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.300
 Toby McGuire's people thought it was garbage

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.100
 and they didn't want to get released before, you know,

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.180
 Pleasantville and all these movies he was going to do.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.300
 'Cause it's very raw.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.700
 It's like a drama version of "Clurks."

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.500
 That type of language and stuff like that.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.700
 So Leonard DiCaprio twice threatens to throw a bottle

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.580
 at a woman's head and that girl was Tara from "Buffy."

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.260
 So again, you had a lot of young people

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.020
 before their courage took off.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.020
 So what happened was basically eventually,

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.420
 this is all alleged,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.940
 but the producer of the film believes

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.480
 that Toby McGuire turned Leonard DiCaprio

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.260
 against the movie as well.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.860
 And through various lawsuits,

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.340
 the way it is set up right now is that

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.660
 the movie cannot be shown commercially

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.620
 in the United States or Canada.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.420
 Eventually the producer of the movie went on

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.580
 to try to do another,

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.460
 was basically blackballed from Hollywood,

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.780
 goes on to do another project in Hollywood,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.180
 is told as they're like signing the paperwork,

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.460
 someone goes, "Oh wait, you're the guy

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.020
 who was behind Don's Plum."

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.700
 The guy's name was Dale Wheatley.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.420
 The producer's name was Dale Wheatley.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.880
 So you get ready to sign another project,

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.580
 someone goes, "Well, you're the guy

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.820
 who did Don's Plum, right?"

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.740
 And Dale's like, "Yeah."

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.420
 And they're like, "We can't do this deal with you."

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.300
 He's like, "What are you talking about?"

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.580
 And the producer who he said was a multi-billion dollar

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.380
 producer making these huge movies,

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.300
 the producer goes, "I can't mess with you

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.220
 because Leonardo DiCaprio will shut me down."

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.140
 And Dale goes, "You're more powerful

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.660
 than Leonardo DiCaprio."

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.900
 And the multi-billion dollar producer's quote was,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.180
 "Nobody is more powerful than Leo."

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.320
 Now, so basically at this point,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.060
 the movie is made, you can watch it on YouTube,

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.920
 but you're not supposed to.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.900
 And you can see it overseas,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.380
 but I mean the movie at this point

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.460
 is like 20 years old as well,

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.860
 but you got a movie starring two

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.980
 of the biggest actors, soon to be actors at that time.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.620
 Leonardo DiCaprio is still a powerhouse,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.820
 Tomy McGuire is still an A-list star.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.340
 The funniest footnote to the story is, yes, it's lost media.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.500
 Until the internet popped up,

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.100
 it was really hard to find a copy of this.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.340
 Lars Vontriere, the director who does not care

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.860
 about anything, held a film festival

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.500
 just to show the movie.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.980
 He didn't show it in America.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.860
 He's not gonna get fined or arrested,

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.100
 but he did have a film festival

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.420
 and he showed the movie over there.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.540
 And he basically is the,

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.580
 he's the Kanye West of filmmaking.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.540
 And Kanye West is the penultimate rock star right now.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.740
 And that's Lars Vontriere.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.900
 He just does whatever he wants.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.740
 He doesn't care.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.500
 I love both of those guys.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.180
 But anyway, check out Don's Plum.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.620
 It's a fascinating film.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.660
 It'll probably make you either really, really mad

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.660
 that people like these exist

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.060
 or it'll remind you of your glory days or both.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.160
 Yeah, check out Don's Plum.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.620
 It is an example of lost media or semi-lost media,

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.860
 media that was pushed to be lost,

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.700
 but the producer wouldn't let it go.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.080
 And the producer is actually the one

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.800
 who was pushing to have it online for free,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.320
 just so somebody could see the movie he made

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.160
 with a bunch of his friends back in the days

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.120
 before lawsuit after lawsuit started.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.860
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story here.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.580
 Do I have enough time?

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.420
 Do I have enough time?

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.360
 I talked so long about being in ghosts.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.240
 Let's see here.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.520
 I'm gonna pull an audible

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.920
 'cause I wanna do that alien story tomorrow.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.480
 Let's go ahead.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.080
 We're leaving behind the restaurant known as Don.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.640
 What restaurants named Don's Plum, anyways?

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.440
 It's kind of a stupid title for a movie,

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.880
 stupid title for a restaurant, but it is a well-made movie.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.240
 We say goodbye to Don's Plum.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.120
 We say goodbye to Leonard de Caprio.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.120
 See you later, Leonard.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.440
 He's like, "Hey, we're gonna hop in the rabbit rowboat

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.120
 "and we're going out to sea.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.600
 "We're not going to Brussels.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.440
 "We're going out to the Atlantic Ocean."

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.360
 You're like, "That's really specific, Jason.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.760
 "Just keep rowing."

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.420
 (humming)

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.960
 A wave knocks my banjo out into ocean.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.600
 I'm like, "No, banjo."

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.440
 I turn to you.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.840
 I picture you as a banjo now and I'm like,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.320
 "Hmm, maybe if I pulled out his veins and his arteries

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.440
 "and tied them around his ankles,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.200
 "I could get the right sort of sound."

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.960
 You're like, "Jason, you just said that out loud."

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.040
 I'm like, "Sorry, sorry."

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.560
 So as I'm still trying to figure out

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.000
 how to turn you into a human banjo,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.360
 we're going back to the year 1917.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.000
 The date is September 15th.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.800
 And we're gonna sail up and we see a boat on the horizon.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.800
 It's called the Zabrina.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.600
 And there's a dude named Captain Martin.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.080
 His first name is not Captain, but that's weird.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.160
 I wonder what his first name was,

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.240
 'cause he's Captain and his last name is a first name.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.840
 I remember once I watched this show,

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.880
 there was like, "Gidget," it was "Gidget Television" series.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.480
 And I learned a valuable lesson on "Gidget" television series.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.480
 There was a surfer guy who always dispensed advice

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.440
 and he said, "Never trust someone with two first names."

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.920
 And I've always remembered that.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.920
 I can't necessarily say it's true.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.480
 I don't know why you shouldn't trust someone

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.680
 with two first names, but whenever you meet someone

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.880
 whose name is like Stanley Martin,

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.960
 don't trust someone with two first names.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.480
 Captain Martin, though.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.440
 He's the captain of the Zabrina.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.640
 It's a three-mast schooner.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.280
 And it goes port to port in Europe.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.440
 So basically this was a time where it was built to,

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.160
 like, put coal in, and not like a coal,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.840
 not like a coal in like a butthole,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.360
 but put coal, the burning stuff in.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.360
 And you would just go from port to port.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.800
 So basically it would move around Europe,

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.940
 basically like a bus, but on the water.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.000
 And it was a flat bottom boat.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.920
 It was basically like a giant barge,

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.040
 but it could also go farther out into the ocean.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.360
 I'm assuming other barges can do that too.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.080
 So anyways, it would basically go from port to port.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.320
 Now it's 1917, so we're in World War I.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.200
 Not a good time to be a boat.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.720
 There's never a good time to be a boat,

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.400
 because then you're an inanimate.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.160
 Is a boat an inanimate?

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.480
 You knew this was coming,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.680
 for when I said that.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.400
 Is a boat an inanimate object?

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.240
 Not a single thing moves on a boat.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.140
 Row boats, sure, you have oars.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.840
 But a sail boat is that an inanimate object?

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.600
 A car is animate 'cause the wheels turn, right?

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.360
 And a bicycle, same thing.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.320
 Is a plane?

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.040
 And then, I wonder, well now I can't say the word,

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.880
 but is a plane an inanimate object?

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.280
 You're like, Jason, you just said you didn't have time.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.440
 You spent so much time talking about being in ghost marms.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.880
 You had to cut a story off.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.760
 Now you're talking about whether or not,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.440
 puzzle, puzzle for your brain.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.680
 Brain teaser, is a boat an inanimate object.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.640
 Anyways, not a good time to be a boat.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.640
 In 1917, they're getting blown up.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.880
 Captain Martin takes his Sabrina out

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.880
 on September 15th, 1917.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.680
 On September 17th, 1917,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.480
 it washes up on a French shore.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.740
 (sizzling)

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.240
 That's not a bunch of explosions.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.160
 That's the water hitting the side of the boat

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.440
 that's sitting on the beach.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:13.040
 The Sabrina was completely empty.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.240
 There's nobody on the boat,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.280
 which would make sense 'cause it was up on the beach,

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.200
 but then the question goes, well where are the people?

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.840
 Now, the Sabrina normally had a six-man crew,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.280
 but for this mission, when it was hauling this coal,

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.480
 had 23 men, all missing.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.020
 And people started to ask questions.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.320
 They go, why would you need so many more people?

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.720
 The theory became that the Sabrina

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.880
 on this particular mission,

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.280
 most of the time it worked the world's largest slaughterhouse.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.920
 Wasn't in there chopping up cows.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.280
 It was moving meat all over Europe.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.640
 And because it had that flat bottom,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.520
 it could go down those narrow rivers.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.320
 This time it was moving coal

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.520
 and it washes up on shore, everyone's disappeared.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.240
 The belief was that it was a cue boat,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.080
 which was a boat used to haul weapons.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.600
 Look like a normal boat, act like a normal boat,

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.600
 drew no suspicion except for the fact

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.240
 that it had those sweet, sweet armaments inside its hold.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.800
 But that doesn't explain, if it was a cue boat,

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.920
 it doesn't explain where everybody went.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.080
 And after the war, war ends,

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.640
 good guys win, bad guys lose.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.760
 Well, it depends on what you're listening to this episode,

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.360
 but after the war, people go, hey, you remember that boat?

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.320
 Like was there this boat, this Sabrina

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.960
 that was attacked on this particular day

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.880
 or in these two days?

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.400
 And the Germans go, no,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.720
 we don't have any record of attacking that boat.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.680
 We have no record of taking any prisoners war

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.760
 from that boat.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.120
 And I've always find it weird

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.640
 that people even bother keeping records during war,

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.000
 but they do.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.440
 And they go, we don't have any record of these troops

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.240
 or these prisoners or anything like that.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.960
 This is the theory.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.880
 And this is kind of a chilling, creepy story.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.520
 So one, you just have possibly a ghost ship.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.000
 Ship goes out, aliens suck them all away,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.520
 or a ghost shows up and kills them off one by one,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.280
 takes them to the hell dimension,

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.080
 or they go through some sort of remuner triangle

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.720
 and they travel a thousand years into the future

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.280
 or 50 years into the past.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.080
 That's all well and good and very sci-fi

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.320
 and very apt for this show.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.320
 I think the actual explanation is creepier, to be honest.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.560
 This is the working theory.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.320
 The Sabrina is going through the water

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.920
 and a German U-boat, a submarine shows up

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.240
 and fires a torpedo at it,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.440
 passes right underneath the boat

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.480
 because it's a flat bottom boat.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.320
 It's a barge.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.400
 Now it looks like a normal boat.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.000
 Missile goes, torpedo goes right underneath it.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.240
 So at that point, maybe they fire a couple more,

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.520
 I don't know, the submarine then pulls up to the Sabrina,

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.000
 boards the ship and takes the crew prisoner.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.400
 Now if there were any weapons hidden on the ship,

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.280
 they could have taken the weapons as well.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.240
 'Cause when the ship did wash ashore,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.240
 there's no idea of whether or not

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.680
 there was a bunch of coal found on the boat

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.520
 or guns found on the boat.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.360
 And this is a historical event as well.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.400
 The idea is this, that they were captured by the Germans

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.440
 and you had these 23 men brought onto this German sub.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.640
 You had these 23 men brought on the German sub.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.440
 But then the sub sinks.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:20.000
 So you have no record of the prisoners being taken.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 You have no record of the attack.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Everyone who knows about that attack died in the sub.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.280
 I find that honestly creepier.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.200
 You imagine you're on a boat.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.840
 Let's say you're not hauling weapons.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.560
 Let's say you're on this boat

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.000
 and you get captured by the Germans.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.200
 Now you may be a sailor all your life,

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.120
 but being in one of the first submarines ever used

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.920
 would be quite different.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.840
 So you and your 22 buddies are crammed into an enemy

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.120
 underwater vessel, still quite alien.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.440
 Plains are still flying around

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.440
 for the first time for crying out loud.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.880
 And you've heard of these subs, these U-boats,

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.680
 but now you're being led into this dark, steamy,

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.320
 stinky vehicle.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.960
 And while you're down there,

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.080
 you can't wait to get back to your family.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.280
 You just wanna get rescued.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.400
 If you get sent to a prison camp, that's fine.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.600
 Eventually the war will end.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.480
 Hopefully you guys will win and you'll go back home.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.320
 But then while you're in this vessel,

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.960
 something goes wrong.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.480
 Mismanagement, enemy attack,

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.800
 your own people trying to attack

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.840
 what they see as an enemy sub that has you in it,

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.120
 a torpedo ripping through the hole,

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.360
 a navigation error crashing into the sea floor.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.200
 What have you?

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.600
 Just two days earlier,

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.600
 you were a sailor on a barge hauling weapons

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.600
 or maybe just coal.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.840
 And now you're in a vessel at the bottom of the ocean,

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.360
 surrounded by your friends,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.720
 and you are all surrounded by the enemy.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.720
 And as water pours into the hole of this strange vehicle,

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.840
 you can't help think it would have been preferable

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.320
 had you got whisked into an alien dimension

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.600
 or met your end of the hand of a vengeful spirit

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.560
 than to be trapped here in the dark,

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.680
 in the cold, in the wet coffin

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.800
 that no one will ever know about.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.920
 Your death is a mystery

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.320
 and no one will ever find out the answer.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.420
