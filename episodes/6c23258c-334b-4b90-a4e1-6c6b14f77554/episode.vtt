00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
 - Charlotte, main of God here.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.240
 I can't wait to see you

 at the Pullman Yards in Atlanta,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.160
 hosted by myself and Jess Halaak.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.400
 If you haven't gotten your tickets,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.560
 what are you waiting for?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.760
 The Black Effect is bringing some

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.120
 of the hottest podcasts live,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.640
 like the '85 South Show,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.320
 "Horrible Decisions," and "Big Facts" for one day only, okay?

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.920
 For inspiring podcasters, we've got you covered.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.320
 You don't wanna miss the Black Effect Podcast Festival?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 Make sure to get your tickets today at blackeffect.com.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.720
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.000
 - What would you do if you were out on a picnic

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.480
 with your toddler, and he looks into the distance

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 and goes, "There's a dead woman over there."

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.920
 (laughing)

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.040
 What would you do in that super specific instance?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.520
 And I wanna know about anything else.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.720
 And then we take a look at the ever-evolving saga

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.960
 of the Dibbock box, an item so cursed

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 that even going near it can cause unspeakably bad luck.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.800
 Well, now there is a terrifying new chapter

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.400
 to the legend of the Dibbock box,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.520
 what some consider to be the most cursed item

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.320
 on the planet, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.900
 (upbeat music)

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.600
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.760
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.680
 I'm your host, Jason Garminer.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.520
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.040
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.320
 And I just drank a coke.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.400
 I got a ton of caffeine,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.600
 and I normally don't drink caffeine,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.920
 so I'm doing finger guns.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.040
 Do, do, do, do.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.400
 And I'm doing finger guns at one of our legacy Patreons,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.920
 coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.360
 We got Corey Dennis, come here.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 Do, do, do, do.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.040
 Shootin' at him.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.200
 He's like, "Great, how am I gonna be on the episode

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.240
 with Hyper Jason?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.200
 This is gonna be awesome."

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.040
 You bet it is.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.760
 Corey, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.600
 in this episode.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.880
 Just help spread the word about the show.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.120
 It really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.280
 Really, really appreciate it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.720
 when I see people talking about the show online.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.240
 Corey, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.400
 to the Jason Jalopy.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.080
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.500
 We are headed on out to the Madera County Mountains

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.440
 in California.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.680
 (imitates gunfire)

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.000
 Corey driving us in this old timey Jalopy

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.800
 up over the mountains.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.080
 It totally breaks down.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.840
 We have to push it half the way, but it's okay.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.280
 Eventually we're gonna get to shut eye peak

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.080
 in the Madera County Mountains.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.120
 It's July 21st, 2021.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.440
 Super recent story, this happened.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.680
 There's a man, his name is Jake Gorba.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680
 He's there with his wife, Victoria,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.040
 and they have three kids, the Gorba Clan, the Gorba Group.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.860
 They're having, they have three kids are up there,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.940
 they're eating lunch, num, num, num, num.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.720
 And their three-year-old son, Caden,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.440
 he's, num, num, num, num, eating his food.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.360
 And then he starts talking to someone,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.680
 and the family's like, "That's weird.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.400
 We totally isolate him.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.640
 He's on restriction.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.480
 He can't talk to anyone.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.320
 Why is he talking?"

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.560
 He's talking to someone.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.760
 He's not talking to anyone in the family.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.160
 And he keeps going, "There's a lady over there.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.640
 There's a lady over there."

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.480
 See?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.560
 He's pointing out this spot in the meadow.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.080
 He's like pointing, he goes, "There's a lady over there."

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.080
 Apparently he turned into, he turned into Woody Allen.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.520
 Somehow there's a lady over there,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.320
 and he describes this woman, what she looks like.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.480
 'Cause they don't see anything.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.760
 This is one thing I don't get, like,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.600
 people are always telling me

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.680
 their kids are seeing spooky stuff.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.840
 And I'm not like a huge fan of like kids, kids in general.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.520
 But if your kids are like pointing off

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.560
 and so does the void,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.960
 your kids are pointing off into nothingness and being,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.040
 there's a woman over there.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.920
 Your child sounds like Woody Allen all of a sudden.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.360
 There's a woman over there, and she has blue hair.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.320
 And she's wearing a black shirt,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.160
 and she has blue jeans on.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.900
 Look, but she's dead.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.580
 The kid gets all creepy.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.420
 I don't think the kid,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.260
 I don't think the kid was saying it in the most menacing way.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.380
 I think it was probably just like,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.780
 "Yay, I'm a three-year-old."

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.300
 However, three-year-old sound.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.740
 Apparently they all sound like Woody Allen.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.740
 He describes her,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.700
 "Oh, sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing the voice."

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.340
 This is what Caden sees.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.460
 He sees a woman lying face down in the meadow.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.940
 And it's, the woman is talking to Caden.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.140
 But really what he's seeing is she's lying face down

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.940
 in the meadow, she has blue hair,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.220
 a black shirt and blue jeans.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.220
 And he says that her legs are bent up.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.500
 Like she's laying face down,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.620
 but her legs are sticking straight up in the air.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.380
 Like I'm assuming it like the knee.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.580
 Which is just weird, right?

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.780
 Which normally when I walk away from a dead corpse

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.940
 after I've done my job, it's totally prone.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.940
 No, she's like laying face down,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.540
 but her legs are sticking straight up in the air.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.440
 And he's telling them she needs our help.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.060
 She needs our help, but she's dead.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.780
 She's over there, but she's dead.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.180
 I can see her, can't you guys see her?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.940
 And Jacob and Victoria, they don't see anything over there.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.860
 And Caden is insistent.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.220
 There's a dead woman over there.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.500
 Mom, I don't know how many times I have to say this.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.860
 There's a dead woman over there.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.180
 She needs our help.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.580
 Well, what are you gonna do, right?

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.860
 You practice delicious picnic.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.820
 You're gonna finish eating your food,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.060
 eat your egg salad sandwich, Caden.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.860
 Ignore the decaying woman.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.340
 Ignore her haunting spirit in the meadow.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.580
 You have to finish eating.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.780
 Anyway, so they, I don't know.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.620
 (laughs)

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.620
 Factually, I don't know.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.540
 I don't know they've finished their picnic.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.140
 Because again, like if you're hanging out with kids,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.740
 kids are always seeing weird stuff.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.900
 You're gonna be like, oh no, ghost.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.260
 'Cause then every time you went to McDonald's,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.340
 they'll be like, oh no, there's a giant purple,

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.580
 there's a giant purple,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.940
 is Grimmis still leaving around in McDonald's?

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.020
 Okay, totally getting off the point.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.540
 Cory Dennis is already getting the Jason Jalopy.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.820
 He's driving away.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.060
 Okay, I gotta focus.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.620
 The point is, is that,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.980
 I don't, the point is I don't know

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.140
 if they finished their picnic.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.060
 But they did eventually come down from the mountain.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.020
 And they're thinking about it.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.220
 Jake and Victoria thinking about it,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.380
 and they're like, dude, that was so weird

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.460
 that our son is such a weirdo.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.620
 But maybe he saw something.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.820
 So they find out, they post this on Facebook.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.780
 They find out that a woman matching that description,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.900
 blue hair included, went missing in that area.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.580
 Now, in that area is a bit of a stretch.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.660
 She went missing in the mountains.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.620
 I couldn't find any proof

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.620
 that she actually went missing on Shutteye Peak.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.700
 But they were able to find,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.100
 there was a woman named Sandra Hughes,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.460
 who had gone missing in June, 2020,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.820
 almost over a year before this.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.860
 And Sandra Hughes, when she went missing,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.020
 she was up camping in the mountains.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.820
 She went missing, her family goes,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.860
 listen, she is a trained outdoor survivalist.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.980
 She's not the person who'd be like,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.060
 oh no, the weather's slightly turned gray.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.100
 I'm just gonna crawl into this ravine and die.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.340
 This isn't a place she would have lasted a while up here,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.540
 even on her own with no surprise.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.580
 But the police have been looking for her.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.180
 She's been a missing person for over a year.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.500
 When Jake and Victoria put this on Facebook,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.780
 it actually got the attention

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.980
 of the Madera County Sheriff's Office.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.220
 And the Madera County Sheriff Corporal Chris Williams

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.980
 contacted the family and wanted more information

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.740
 about this sighting and actually sent two deputies

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.940
 up with Jake and Caden to see what they could see

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.780
 at the meadow.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.620
 And you know those cops,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.900
 (coyote howling)

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.260
 you know those cops are kind of like,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.860
 oh, you know, on the one hand,

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.020
 this might be a break in a case.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.660
 There was one, and we might be hanging out

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.860
 with the sixth sense kid.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.580
 And this is gonna be a break in the case.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.260
 And the kid will be like, look, there's a ghost.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.660
 And then like the ghost like goes,

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.140
 this is where I, this is where I'm buried.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.500
 And also this is who killed me and all this stuff.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.420
 Or it's just a nice fun drive up into the mountains.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.100
 Like I don't know if the cops on duty

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.580
 actually thought anything would come of this,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.100
 but nothing did come of this.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.540
 They drove up there and they looked around

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.620
 and they didn't see, they didn't see anything.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.220
 They didn't see, they saw a cross.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.340
 They saw a little cross with a dog collar around it.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.540
 That's a callback to yesterday's episode.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.220
 Point is they smell yogurt coming out of the ground.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.900
 The point is, is that a little kid saw a ghost.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.500
 So that's spooky, right?

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.860
 That's paranormal.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.820
 They didn't find anything.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.140
 They didn't find anything, unfortunately.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.300
 So the case of Sandra Hughes continues.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.620
 No one knows what happened to her.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.040
 There were other sightings of her apparently.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.540
 One time like, she went missing in June, 2020

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.060
 on August 9th of 2020.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.660
 Two hunters were going through the mountains.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.220
 They saw a woman leaning against a tree.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.820
 She was thin, this thin woman kind of leaning against a tree

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.100
 and the two hunters passed her.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.140
 I'm assuming they're in a truck or something like that.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.240
 They said she didn't flag us down.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.220
 She obviously saw, she didn't flag us down.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.140
 She didn't seem to stress.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.100
 She was just standing there.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.820
 And when they drove into town,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.540
 they saw a missing persons flyer for her.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.700
 They said she was much skinnier when they saw her

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.100
 than just a month ago when the picture was taken.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.300
 So was that Sandra Hughes?

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.100
 Was that an early viewing of her ghost?

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.460
 Like, who knows?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.740
 It's just such a weird mystery.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.380
 Now it's gonna become a paranormal legend.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.020
 People are always gonna talk about this meadow

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.500
 and the ghost sighting and things like that.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.820
 But did a little boy actually see her?

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.780
 This is a story that I think,

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.260
 I mean, this is probably the wrong episode

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.360
 to talk about this, but this story sounds legit to me.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.220
 The kid may have actually seen something

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.060
 and you know what I mean?

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.780
 And then the story played out how it was

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.500
 and the police say, well, we don't have any other leads

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.460
 so let's go investigate it.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.020
 It sounds fairly legit, but you never know.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.860
 In the world of the paranormal, let that be a reminder.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.820
 You never know if somebody is telling the truth.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.860
 No matter how noble it may be

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.060
 or how innocuous this story may seem,

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.040
 you just don't know.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.420
 I just stand there, we're standing there in the meadow

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.180
 and I'm just staring at you silently

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.220
 and you're like, that's weird, Jason,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.180
 is this going somewhere?

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.340
 Like, why are you just staring at me?

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.340
 After you saying we don't know if we can trust people.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.140
 Corey Dennis, let's go ahead and hop in that carbonar copter.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.260
 We trust you to fly us out from shut-eye peak.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.820
 We are headed to Portland, Oregon.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.980
 (imitates gunfire)

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.980
 We covered the Dibbock box back on episode 67.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.980
 Can you believe that?

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.020
 That's almost 700 episodes ago, 650 episodes ago.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.700
 We covered the sound exhaust when I said that.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.820
 No, I love doing the show.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.420
 Episode 67, we talked about the Dibbock box,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.100
 but the Dibbock box had been a story

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.140
 that I've carried with myself for years.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.660
 I remember the first time I heard about the Dibbock box.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.300
 It was a rainy day in Sacramento.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.180
 I was listening to the podcast, Mysterious Universe,

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.020
 way back in the day.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.660
 It had to be like 2003, 2004, something like that.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.020
 And like the rain was pitter-pattering out the window

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.860
 and it just was such so well done.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.060
 The Mysterious Universe can really weave these stories.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.900
 You're telling the story.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.660
 And at the end of the story, they go, you know,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.580
 just by hearing about the Dibbock box,

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.740
 you're part of the curse.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.420
 And I remember it like really scared me.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.340
 It really was a very interesting story, terrified me.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.380
 And I thought, wow, the Dibbock box,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.380
 what a cool addition to the paranormal lexicon.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.220
 We have this whole new story about this Dibbock box.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.940
 I covered it on an episode and it's super well known.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.500
 There's been movies made about it.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.740
 There's been lots of articles written about it.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.020
 So I didn't really cover it when I was doing the show,

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.540
 even though I love the story of the Dibbock box.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.820
 It's fairly well known and I cover more obscure stuff.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.380
 I covered it on episode 67

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.940
 because it became a current event.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.180
 Rapper musician Post Malone.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.700
 Is he really even considered a rapper?

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.900
 Musician Post Malone, he had a string of bad luck.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.860
 You guys remember this?

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.860
 His airplane tire blew out and he got in a car accident.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.100
 And then his former house got home invaded

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.940
 or something like that.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.820
 And the idea was that he was visiting

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.520
 with his friend, Zach Baggins,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.580
 one of the most famous ghost hunters in the world

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.960
 and host of the Ghost Adventurers show.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.900
 He was saying that was Zach Baggins.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.660
 Zach Baggins was mucking about with the Dibbock box

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.340
 which is in his possession now.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.820
 He has like this ghost museum.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.460
 And Post Malone simply touched Zach Baggins shoulder.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.980
 Zach Baggins was touching the Dibbock box

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.580
 and all this horrible battle that came across Post Malone.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.100
 And I haven't listened to episode 67 in a long time.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.180
 I believe I was fairly skeptical

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.780
 about the idea of the battle that being attacked.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.700
 Maybe it wasn't, but it was like, ooh, spooky, oaky,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.540
 Dibbock.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.940
 I don't remember exactly what path I took on that episode

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.780
 but I do remember loving the story of the Dibbock box.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.340
 Still love the story of the Dibbock box.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.940
 And now we have new information

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.340
 about how this legend is growing

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.540
 but I'm gonna do a quick overview for you.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.180
 Not everyone knows what the Dibbock box is

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.460
 but let's talk about it very, very briefly.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.460
 It's a cursed box and this is the story.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.740
 It was originally owned by a Holocaust survivor

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.100
 and a Dibbock is in Jewish tradition,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.660
 it's a restless spirit.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.380
 And a Dibbock box is a prison for that spirit.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.620
 So this guy, his name was Kevin Manis.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.180
 He said back in 2001, he bought this Dibbock box

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.980
 in Portland, Oregon and he was told

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.180
 this was from a Holocaust survivor, do not open it.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.660
 Do not open it, it has some bad juju in it

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.020
 and just don't open it.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.940
 We'll sell it to you, we'll be irresponsible

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.140
 and sell you this relic, but don't open it.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.980
 And Kevin Manis opens it.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.060
 And that kind of started this whole worldwide phenomenon

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.740
 of this Dibbock box legend.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.260
 It got so bad that people,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.020
 and this is where we're coming at here,

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.060
 just by hearing about the Dibbock box,

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.540
 people say that they have bad luck.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.500
 People say by even viewing photos of the Dibbock box

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.140
 is one guy said his computer caught on fire.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.780
 Just by viewing photos of the Dibbock box.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.820
 2001, Kevin Manis purchases this Dibbock box

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.780
 and is hit with wave after wave of bad luck.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.060
 Even his friends, people who are around the Dibbock box

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.140
 keep having nightmares of this old woman

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.100
 with sunken eyeballs stalking them through their dreams.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.940
 His sister complained of cabinet doors

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.620
 in her house opening and closing.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.860
 It's causing poltergeist activity.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.980
 It was linked to two different suicides.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.620
 And then he gives it to his mom.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.580
 This is, listen man, you may have problems with your mom,

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.940
 but if this is, this caused two suicides,

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.660
 if it's even caused one suicide,

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.500
 I don't know why you do this.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.700
 He gave it to his mom as a gift.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.260
 Shortly afterwards, she had a stroke.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.140
 And she did an interview with this show

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.460
 called Paranormal Witness.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.940
 And she says that, you know,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.860
 I knew when I opened the Dibbock box,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.660
 like, oh, this caused two suicides.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.660
 Thank you, Sonny.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.120
 This is my favorite gift ever.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.900
 She goes, when I got the Dibbock box and I opened it up,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.660
 I felt like this icy evil presence come out of the box.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.260
 Like I knew I shouldn't have had this.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.140
 I knew that my son must be trying to kill me.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.540
 And I had a stroke.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.820
 So Kevin Manis sells it on eBay.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.460
 And he writes this long description detailing all this stuff.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.980
 The bad luck, the story of what he found in it.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.060
 I think there was like two coins, a piece of hair,

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.620
 some other stuff that was supposed to be part

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.740
 of this Dibbock box ritual.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.640
 He goes, I opened it up.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.480
 I wasn't supposed to.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.380
 There's like this etching on the back and blah, blah, blah.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.900
 And then all this bad luck.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.660
 And my mom had a stroke and two suicides.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.980
 How would you like to buy this?

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.360
 And he ends up selling it on eBay to this new owner.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.160
 The new owner also feels very cursed by it.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.280
 They sell it fairly quickly afterwards

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.860
 to a man known as Jason Haxden.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.900
 Now Jason Haxden gets it, also gets hit with bad luck.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.140
 But writes a book about it.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.340
 Writes a book called My Unlucky Day

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.980
 with Ramona and Beezus.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.180
 He writes this book, it wasn't a kid's book.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.620
 I don't think it was a kid's book.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.460
 It's a Papa book.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.740
 You turn the page and an old woman

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.580
 with sunken eyes comes out at you.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.980
 He writes a book about it.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.780
 And him and Kevin, Kevin Manis,

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.940
 are consultants on the movie The Possession in 2012.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.680
 I remember the Dibbock scared me so much.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.620
 The story scared me so much.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.780
 I didn't even want to watch that movie.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.680
 And I did, I did watch it.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.600
 It was okay.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.320
 It was a decent movie.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.220
 I give it three possessions.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.440
 I only got possessed three times.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.260
 Now it was an okay movie,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.020
 but I remember I didn't want to watch a movie.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.580
 I didn't want to watch the trailers.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.340
 The story of the Dibbock's really, really scared me.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.420
 The director of The Possession, old Borendahl.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.500
 He's not one.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.340
 (laughs)

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.280
 It sounds like one of the dwarves from Lord of the Rings.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.480
 No, he actually is like,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.440
 I think he's a Russian director.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.560
 He directed The Night Watch.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.400
 He directed the movie.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.320
 He said crazy stuff started happening on the set.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.960
 He said, five days after the movie wrapped filming,

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.560
 a fire broke out and destroyed all the props in the film.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.300
 So this box, this Dibbock box is legend at this point.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.840
 Like in the paranormal community, this is way up there.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.200
 I can't, I don't want to say it's as big as, you know,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.920
 Area 51 or something like that,

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.940
 but it's super well known.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.380
 It's super, super well known.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.180
 It has movies based on it.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.980
 Zach Baggins, biggest ghost hunter in the world,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.900
 buys it from Jason Hackston,

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.980
 'cause he was the last person to have it,

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.300
 for an undisclosed amount.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.700
 We don't know how much he bought it for.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.620
 And he puts it in his museum of curiosities.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.060
 And he has called it the most cursed item on Earth.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.500
 This Dibbock box is just so powerful

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.140
 that if Post Malone is anywhere near you

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.920
 and you touch it, Post Malone will have bad luck.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.600
 So the legend has grown.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.440
 The legend has grown.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.040
 That's really where most stories end.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.000
 It turns out two things.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.920
 Two things have come to light recently.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.920
 One, this is only one of 10 Dibbock boxes.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.120
 Kevin Manis has seven more of them.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.480
 Now he's given one of these Dibbock boxes to Zach Baggins.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.680
 So now Zach Baggins has two.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.600
 Kevin Manis has six.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.980
 And Kevin says, here's the full story.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.980
 There was some Jewish cabalist wizards

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.580
 during World War II.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.980
 And they saw the threat of Nazi Germany.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.580
 So what they did was they summoned a demon,

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.820
 a Dibbock, to be specific,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.140
 to help the Jewish people fight off the Nazis.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.380
 But they couldn't control it.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.220
 This Dibbock became too powerful

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.860
 and began, it was like, "World War II walks away

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.700
 from World War II."

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.740
 I'm sure everything will be fine, guys.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.900
 He walks away from World War II

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.580
 and he's doing all these other disasters

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.020
 like he caused the Korean War.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.780
 He's always just like, "Come on over here, North Korea."

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.620
 It sure is sunny down in the South Korea.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.740
 He caused all these other catastrophes

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.380
 and didn't really help the Jews out during World War II.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.300
 So these Jewish cabalist wizards had to capture the Dibbock

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.780
 and he's so powerful they had to separate him

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.180
 into 10 different boxes.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.020
 So Zach Baggins has two of them.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.500
 Kevin Manis has six of them

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.900
 and the other two cannot be found.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.820
 They cannot be located.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.180
 Kevin Manis says no one knows where they're at.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.740
 If all 10 of these items are brought together,

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.120
 if all 10 of these boxes are brought together,

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.980
 the demon will be unleashed.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.680
 You thought Post Malone's tire blowing out

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.500
 on his plane was bad.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.020
 Just wait until the demon devours us all.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.540
 That recently came to light.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.180
 And then another big piece of the Dibbock legend

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.140
 came to light, it's fake.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:10.300
 It's 100% made up, 100%.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.300
 The whole story is fraudulent.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:19.220
 This is fascinating.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.820
 I'm going to read you quotes.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.220
 This isn't Jason being skeptical and saying,

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.100
 "Well, I found," no.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.700
 Kevin Manis, let's dig into this

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.940
 'cause this is so fascinating.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.220
 I read an article recently on inputmag.com

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.020
 and the website seems to be very tech geared,

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.100
 tech in like cutting edge technology,

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.180
 computer stuff, a little bit of fashion.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.620
 Seems to kind of be a lifestyle magazine.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.380
 It's not set up to be a skeptical magazine

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.700
 or anything like that.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.740
 Inputmag.com, there's an article by Charles Moss

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.740
 and it exposes with Kevin Manis' help,

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.020
 the fraud that is the story of the Dibbock box.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.860
 And now I'm telling you,

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.220
 I'm going to be reporting this with a big smile on my face

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.660
 and I'm going to be laughing about this,

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.940
 but also to be very, I didn't want to sugarcoat this.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.140
 I was fooled too.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.260
 Like I was scared of the Dibbock box, right?

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.940
 I was scared of that legend.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.660
 I didn't want to watch the trailer or the movie.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.500
 You know what I mean?

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.820
 So I'm not saying, "Oh, look at me, I'm skeptical."

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.980
 I was not only did I get suckered into the story,

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.580
 I enjoyed the ride along the way,

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.660
 but let's take a look at this.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.020
 It's so fascinating.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.340
 Back in 2015, the first hint that this was fraudulent

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.300
 kind of got revealed on Facebook.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.380
 And again, it wasn't some person going,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.900
 "Well, demons don't exist or that's so fooling."

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.580
 You know, that's easy skepticism.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:39.020
 Kevin Manis made a Facebook post back in 2015.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.180
 What happened is there's a web series called Haunt Me

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.820
 or Haunt and Me like Haunt Main.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.860
 And it's a bunch of kids, a bunch of teenagers, early 20s

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.380
 running around ghost hunting.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.020
 I've never watched a show, it sounds fun, right?

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.240
 We always want to encourage people going out,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.940
 having fun ghost adventures.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.740
 Trademark, I'm gonna train work that name, Ghost Adventures.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.580
 But you know what I mean?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.660
 We want to encourage that.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.500
 There's nothing wrong with that.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.340
 I've never seen a show.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.500
 But anyway, so in an episode,

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.780
 they start talking about a Dibbit box.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.300
 And they start talking about this Dibbit box contains

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.900
 like this level demon and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.860
 And Kevin Manis gets upset by that.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.460
 And so he posts this back in 2015

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.540
 on the Haunt Me's Facebook page, quote,

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.260
 "I am uniquely qualified to make these,"

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.700
 he started off by saying how you can't say this

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.380
 about the Dibbit box and stuff like that.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.900
 Quote, "I am uniquely qualified to make these claims

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.580
 as I am the original creator of the story

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.900
 of the Dibbit box, which appeared as one of my eBay posts

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.740
 back in 2003.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.260
 The idea that Dibbit boxes have some kind of history

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.860
 prior to my story, and the idea that a Dibbit box

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.580
 could contain anything other than a Dibbit,

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.400
 along with any deviation to the type of contents I created

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.040
 to be found inside of a Dibbit box, is laughable at best."

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.300
 How about this, he continues in his quote,

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.060
 "How about this, if you," this is super important,

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.220
 this is super important, "How about this,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.860
 if you or anyone else can find any reference

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.620
 to a Dibbit box anywhere in history prior to my eBay post,

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.940
 I'll pay you $100,000 and tattoo your name on my forehead,"

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.780
 unquote.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.020
 So they were adding to the mythology,

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.840
 they're adding to like this different type of Dibbit box,

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.760
 and he's like, "No, I know what's in the Dibbit box

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.240
 because I created it.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.040
 I mean, I discovered it."

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.720
 And people read this and they go, "Wait a second,

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.120
 if this is a real thing, how could you make

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.820
 such a bold claim?"

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:42.080
 You say, "Nowhere in history was a Dibbit box ever there

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.440
 until I set it, until my eBay post."

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.480
 So people, again, there's always people who are skeptical,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.280
 then there's people who believe in the paranormal,

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.840
 but are open to skepticism,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.740
 and then there are people who believe anything.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.620
 And after that Facebook post popped up,

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.140
 people started to get suspicious.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.340
 How can you claim if it's real if you can say

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.180
 it didn't exist before my eBay post?

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.100
 Charles Moss is interviewing him,

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.580
 'cause he had recently heard about this Dibbit box story,

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.020
 like earlier this year.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.820
 He's interviewing him and first off,

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.620
 Kevin Manis has kind of given him some weird answers

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.300
 and he's kind of like messing stuff up

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.500
 and he's kind of getting some details foggy.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.380
 And then he asks, "You know what, Charles,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.220
 let's do another interview,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.960
 but next time really I want you to push me.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.980
 I really want you to push me

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.320
 and get the BS out of the way."

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.120
 And so Charles Moss does some other research

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.920
 and does start interviewing him again.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.160
 And during the second interview,

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.600
 we have this back and forth.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.040
 Quote, this is a quote from Kevin Manis,

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.400
 "I am a creative writer.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.040
 The Dibbit box is a story that I created.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.520
 And the Dibbit box story has done exactly

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.320
 what I intended it to do when I posted it 20 years ago.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.800
 "Which is what?" I ask him.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.880
 "Which is to become an interactive story in real time."

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.140
 And then Charles Moss goes on a write,

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.820
 "Though Manis did buy the wine cabinet at a yard sale,

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.420
 it was from an attorney,

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.420
 not the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.140
 The carving in the back of it is my carving," Manis says.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.780
 "The stone that was in the box

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.940
 is something that is a signature creation of mine also.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.940
 Make no mistake, I conceived of the Dibbit box,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.220
 the name, the term, the idea,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:25.160
 and wrote this creative story around it to post on eBay."

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.880
 The reporter, being a good reporter,

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.840
 begins to interview Kevin Manis' friends

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.200
 and they knew it was a fraud as well.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.840
 One of them said, "Oh, the hair in the box, that was my hair."

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.840
 Even his mother was in on it.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.860
 She didn't fake the stroke.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.320
 She really had a stroke, but she lied.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.700
 She, he goes, "That was a mother's love

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.340
 for her to lie on paranormal witness for me."

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.580
 She made it up.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.100
 100% the story was made up.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.580
 Charles Moss couldn't verify that there were two suicides

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.900
 that were linked to it.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.540
 One guy supposedly like knocked it over

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.340
 and then like him and his boss killed himself.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.420
 He wasn't even able to verify that those suicides took place.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.020
 And Kevin Manis goes, "Oh, no, no, no, the suicides are real,

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.140
 but here's the thing, when you have someone

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.820
 who has lied on the record for 20 years."

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:24.700
 Fascinating, fascinating, it's 100% a lie.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.680
 So fascinating.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.680
 Now what's happening is Jason Hxton is saying,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.200
 listen, what I think is that he did buy the box

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.440
 from an attorney, maybe his story's true,

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.480
 but what I think is he might have used

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.200
 Kabbalah magic himself to curse the item.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.180
 And Kevin Manis is like, "No, I didn't do that.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.380
 I didn't do that."

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.220
 It's all made up.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.980
 But it's interesting because we have all these people

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.940
 with financial motives based on it.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.780
 Kevin Manis sold the box for a couple hundred dollars,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.260
 but then he's a consultant on this movie.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.020
 Jason Hxton wrote a book and is a consultant on this movie

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.020
 and sells it to Zach Baggins.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.260
 And everyone has to kind of save their own butt.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.540
 Now Jason Hxton goes, "Listen,

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.580
 I did get a string of bad luck after I got this thing."

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.940
 Kevin Manis says, "I told Jason Hxton

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.260
 the story wasn't real.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.400
 I told the guy who bought it right after me.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.840
 I called him up and said, listen, I'm sorry.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.940
 I made the story up."

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.440
 And then when that guy sold it to Jason Hxton,

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.680
 Kevin Manis called him up and said,

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.480
 "Listen, just so you know,"

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.880
 and I told the previous guy this,

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.420
 "This story's fake."

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:34.320
 So he's saying Jason Hxton knew it was a fraud.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.760
 But Jason Hxton goes, "No, no, no,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.520
 all this bad luck really did happen to me."

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.620
 You know, the story's so fascinating on so many levels,

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.260
 but of course we're waiting to hear,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.260
 what does Zach Baggins have to say about this?

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.080
 Because he's the guy who's out the most.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.840
 Who in the world was Kevin Manis and Jason Hxton

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.380
 before this happened?

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.840
 But Zach Baggins, this is the centerpiece of his museum.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.280
 He's done episodes about this, about this Dibbock's.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.160
 His professional reputation is on the line.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.780
 What is he saying about this?

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.720
 Very, very interesting.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.020
 Here's a quote from Zach Baggins.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.260
 "Since owning the Dibbock's,

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.360
 there have been countless documented experiences

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.800
 people have had with it,

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.840
 not just from myself, but my museum staff,

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.400
 my fellow crew members, visitors, and most,"

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.840
 this is so ridiculous, "and most notably, Post Malone.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.700
 Who cares, right?

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.840
 Post Malone, great singer.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.540
 That'd be like saying, come and visit

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.320
 my world-famous roller coaster.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.840
 It's Neil deGrasse Tyson's favorite roller coaster.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.020
 Who cares?

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.920
 He's not a roller coaster expert.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.360
 I don't understand why you would evoke

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.560
 the name of Post Malone."

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.420
 It's not helping your argument,

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.040
 but yet he does, most notably Post Malone.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.000
 And he goes on to say, "I don't believe

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.560
 that this is the full truth.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.840
 I think there is so much more to the Dibbock's

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.580
 and regardless of its origins,

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.740
 it is very much cursed and evil."

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.720
 Then he goes on from there, "I'm not surprised

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.120
 there are more controversy and conflict

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.180
 keep arising from it.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.480
 The Dibbock's has always raised questions

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.120
 and intrigue and this adds to its narrative.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.860
 The narrative is that it's fake."

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.440
 And this is what I find so fascinating about the story.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.820
 And again, I would broaden, hook, line, and sinker.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.540
 The Dibbock's story scared me.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.600
 I find this super fascinating.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.940
 But the origins of it, he says,

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.320
 "Regardless of its origins, no,

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.480
 the origins of it is what makes it the story.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.380
 You can buy one of these wine cabinets,

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.660
 these little wine cabinets that he turned this into.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.500
 They sell them.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.780
 This isn't a rare thing.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.500
 You can buy one of these wine cabinets."

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.640
 It was the lineage.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.960
 It was the story.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.220
 Is what makes it unique.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:48.180
 Really, it's just a wine cabinet at this point.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.040
 And then any bad luck that you come across

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.720
 and you go, "Oh, that's weird.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.940
 I went to this wine cabinet one day

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.060
 and two weeks later, the wheel fell off my bicycle."

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.940
 Like you want to make that connection.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.660
 We have good and bad luck all the time

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.140
 and we interact with new things constantly.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.220
 Every time we're walking on the street,

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.940
 imagine how much your brain would break

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.740
 if every time something, every time you had bad luck,

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.060
 you had to think of every new thing you encountered

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.700
 in the past day or two.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.860
 You're walking through a story.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.220
 They got a new bag of Oreos on the counter.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.380
 Now, if those Oreos came from John Wayne Gacy's kitchen,

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.940
 that's the origin of them.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.220
 They're super stale, but that'd be the origin.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.060
 That'd be the lineage.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.260
 That would make them curse.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.500
 There was that thing I heard.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.060
 I think it was on the para pod.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.740
 They said, "If you had two knives, two kitchen knives,

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.900
 they're exactly, or maybe a sofa king podcast."

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.740
 It was one of the two.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.580
 They're both great podcasts,

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.980
 but you have two kitchen knives sitting on a counter.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.460
 The one on the left is an ordinary,

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.900
 they're the exact same package.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.100
 They're exactly same kitchen knife.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.460
 The one on the left is a kitchen knife

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.860
 and the one on the right is a kitchen knife

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.500
 that was used to murder a man.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.000
 Is there a difference between those two knives?

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.420
 So that's what we're looking at

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.660
 when we're talking about the Dibbock box.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.820
 If the origin is fake, then it's worthless.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.660
 It's a fraud.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.540
 It's fake.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.220
 And so there's two routes.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.540
 I had a good chuckle about this whole thing.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.620
 I didn't invest a ton of money in it.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.780
 I just invested time and I do still think

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.620
 it's an interesting story.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.300
 And to me, this makes it more interesting

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.500
 'cause we have a conclusion,

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.980
 but there's a couple of different routes

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.820
 you could go through.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:28.700
 One, the easiest route,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.060
 and I'm sure it's the one that you guys are thinking about.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.460
 I bet you it's the one that'll go down,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.020
 is that the Dibbock box was just a box,

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.580
 but because everyone was scared of it,

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.260
 we turned it into a tulpa.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:45.980
 Like we collectively made the Dibbock box real.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.980
 So you're right, the Dibbock box itself

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.000
 was just a wine cabinet with a bunch of junk in it.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.340
 But because everyone believed there was a demon in it,

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.980
 we made a demon go in it.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:59.380
 That's the easiest out for anyone involved.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.260
 They could say, like Jason's cabala magic.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.100
 If Kevin Mann has really let Jason know it was fake,

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.740
 then that's an issue that Zach Baggins needs

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.560
 to take up with Jason.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.020
 But you could say, Jason could say,

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.340
 "Ah, cabala magic was used to curse this thing."

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.180
 But I think collectively going forward, they'll go,

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.140
 "The Dibbock box was fake,

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.460
 but we've made it real through the tulpa process."

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.260
 You could go that route.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.940
 But here's the thing.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.060
 Paranormal researchers are always complaining

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.900
 about not being taken seriously

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.140
 by the scientific community all the time.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.220
 I hear it all the time.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.860
 How come they won't believe that my spirit box

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.540
 or my EVP meter or my temperature gauge

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.860
 that's showing that it's colder in here,

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.540
 how come this isn't legitimate stuff?

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.140
 How come we get dismissed when we're bigfoot researchers

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.580
 or UFO hunters and stuff like that?

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.980
 Well, stuff like this doesn't help, right?

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.260
 Stuff like this doesn't help when someone comes down

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.540
 and goes, "I've been defrauding you for 20 years."

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.060
 This stuff doesn't help.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.060
 But I think about it like this.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.500
 We don't need to be like the scientific community.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.700
 We need to be better than a scientific community.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.780
 So let me explain.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:10.060
 And the scientific community is rife with fraud as well.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.520
 And we all know it.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.140
 We pretend that it doesn't exist.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.540
 We pretend that the sugar companies

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.180
 aren't paying for studies to show

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.860
 that artificial sweeteners give you nerve damage.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.300
 We pretend to think that cell phone companies

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.660
 aren't telling scientists, "What?

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.100
 No, no, cell phones don't cause brain tumors."

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:34.740
 Any scientific study you see has been paid for by somebody.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.580
 Either it's a private group or it's a college

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.420
 that gets its funding from the government or private groups.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.480
 It's all bought off.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.820
 Now, some of it's less bought off than others.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.540
 But science is rife with fraud.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.300
 It really is.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.780
 The difference is that pure science can tell the truth,

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.740
 but so often it's, "Cigarettes are healthy for you

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.440
 until they're not."

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.280
 Right?

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.340
 I mean, I could list every, oh no, eugenics,

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.220
 that's the way to go.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.140
 That's what science believed for the longest time

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.660
 and now it doesn't.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.940
 And 40 years from now, people are gonna look back

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.220
 at the science of today and being like,

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.860
 "You guys were barbarians.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.860
 You guys actually believed that?"

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.220
 Anyways, so we need to be, as paranormal researchers,

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.180
 we need to be better than science.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.760
 We need to call the fraud what it is.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.600
 Fraud.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.020
 In the business, this is what I think,

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.780
 in the world of business, you call out fraud

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.840
 and you shut it down and then that's it.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.220
 There are people who still believe in old-timey science stuff.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.700
 They're just completely dismissed.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.360
 The flat earth is perfect.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.560
 Stuff that's been completely dismissed by science.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.240
 There are people who still believe it.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.860
 There are people who still believe

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.800
 that this dibbock box is cursed.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.100
 There's no one who still believes

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.800
 that Bernie Madoff was a good businessman.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.160
 But we need to do that.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.320
 We need to call out the fraud when we see it.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.440
 And Zach Baggins could easily say,

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.320
 Zach Baggins could easily come out and say,

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.400
 "I was duped.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.220
 "This dibbock box is not real.

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.920
 "And I'm gonna sue everybody.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.040
 "I'm suing Jason Haxson if he really knew.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.640
 "I'm definitely suing Kevin Manis

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.000
 "because he was perpetrating it.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.320
 "I'm suing him because that's what we need

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.420
 "for paranormal research to go forward.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.900
 "We can't keep piling on lies."

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.100
 I really think that's what he should do.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.620
 I think that would be a huge move for paranormal research

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.220
 because science has a hard time doing that.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.180
 Science will hold on to that truth

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.660
 and hold on to that grant money as long as they can

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.740
 and keep pumping out the same study as long as this company,

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.060
 this conglomerate or this group is paying them.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:50.500
 They'll keep saying stuff even though it damages people,

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.760
 even though it can hurt us, they'll keep pushing it

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.520
 until other scientists come forward

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.880
 and either because they've done good science

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.040
 and say that's wrong or because another group

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.840
 pays them off to run a study.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.280
 But we need to be better than that.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.680
 And Zach Baggins, I would love it.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.860
 I would have so much respect for you if you came forward

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.720
 and said, "This is fraudulent.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.900
 "I was duped.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.640
 "Everyone was duped.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.280
 "We believed it because that's what we do.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.360
 "We love hearing these stories and we love believing them.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360
 "But this was fraud.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.980
 "I'm suing them and let's move forward."

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.060
 And I'm gonna keep this into my museum

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.060
 because this is an important part of paranormal research

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.180
 that we get misled.

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.100
 I think that would be great.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.660
 And I think it would send a message to science.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.100
 I could care less.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.460
 I've never been one of those people who's trying

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.740
 to find proof so I can prove to some nonbeliever

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.780
 that ghosts exist or do.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.900
 I don't honestly care.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.460
 But if we wanna send the message to,

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.120
 yes, we're gonna hold ourselves accountable

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.680
 just like scientific community does,

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.040
 just like the business community does,

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.040
 we're gonna, if it fails, if it fails the smell test,

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.320
 if it's fraudulent, let's call it out.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:04.360
 And sue, ensue these people who committed this fraud

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.640
 and that would just be a great thing.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.840
 But I don't think that's how the story's gonna end.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.640
 I think it's gonna be, it was a tolpa now

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.080
 and we created it in our head.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.540
 And does that mean the other 10 boxes really exist out there?

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.820
 How far does the tolpa extend?

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.660
 I mean, you know what I mean?

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.340
 It's just easier sometimes to just say, "It came over.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.660
 We lost, we lost this one, but we still believe in ghosts.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.420
 We still believe in the paranormal."

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.940
 And so on and so forth.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.780
 I don't think it's gonna happen.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.940
 I think they're gonna try to spin it

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.940
 that it is really haunted.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.660
 Maybe it's even more haunted

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.220
 'cause the lie caused the curse to grow or something like that.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.500
 I find this story absolutely fascinating.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.020
 I love it when stories have a conclusion.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.080
 This conclusion is better than 10 Dibbock boxes

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.800
 being brought together and a demon bursting out of them

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.760
 and ruling over earth is Zach Baggins

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.480
 as his own personal pet.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.920
 It's much better than that one.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.040
 It's not as cool as if the Dibbock box itself was real

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.040
 and there was a demon trapped in there.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.860
 Obviously as a believer in the paranormal

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.360
 and as a fan of it, that'd be cool.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.600
 But it does have an ending.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.000
 It was fake and we have to acknowledge it was fake.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.400
 And to go forward as a parent,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.680
 if people keep pushing that this is real,

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.220
 it just makes us all look super goofy.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.100
 It really does.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.260
 You'll never really be able to prove the existence

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.460
 or non-existence of Bigfoot or UFOs

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.500
 unless they make themselves available.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.980
 But if something comes forward that we all talk about

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.540
 and it is knowably false

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.700
 and then we continue to talk about it,

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.820
 we don't need science to dismiss us.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.140
 We don't need the normal world to dismiss us.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.900
 We're asking to be dismissed.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.140
 If something is knowably false, provably false

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.380
 and we still pretend that it's real,

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.200
 we deserve to be dismissed.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.740
 And I don't think we deserve to be dismissed.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.120
 I think we know a lot about the world.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.800
 I think we know a lot of the secrets that other people ignore

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.040
 or they just don't want to acknowledge that are there.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.100
 But we have to know when to call it quits.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.160
 And I think this is the time when we go,

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.040
 "We were wrong. We got fooled."

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.420
 Me, Jason Carpenter, I got fooled by the Dibbock box story.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.880
 It was too good to be true,

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.400
 but I will continue to look for the next story

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.800
 and the next story and the next story

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.460
 because I do believe the truth is out there

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.320
 even though we may run into a few lies along the way.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:23.300
