1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,360
 They make me happy and they make me feel better.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,560
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,720
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,720
 A series of FBI raids proves the power often lies behind the throne.

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,040
 And then we'll take a look at the tragedy that happened this weekend

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,040
 at the Travis Scott concert in Texas.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,720
 Was it just mismanagement?

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,040
 Or was the entire event a satanic sacrifice today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:02,040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,520
 Hey, everyone.

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,640
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,520
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, or I'm Having a Great Day.

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,760
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,120
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,720
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,800
 is one of our newest paid supporters.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,560
 He's running in.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,680
 He's super excited to get this episode started.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
 Give it up for Mike Hall.

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,120
 Everyone give a round of applause to Mike.

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,680
 Give you a salute, 21-gun salute.

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,920
 Mike, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,160
 Hey, if you guys can't swear the Patreon, I totally understand.

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,360
 Just tell your friends, tell your family about the podcast.

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,440
 That really helps out a lot.

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,720
 Now, Mike, I really like this episode because we got some breaking news stories.

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,160
 Now, I guess it's less exciting if you're in the future.

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,520
 Six months from now, you're like, "Yawn."

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,200
 No, there's still good stories, even if you're not alive right now.

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,400
 But yeah, we got some interesting stuff.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,960
 I always love breaking news.

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,680
 Not a lot of conspiracy content gets to do that nowadays.

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,720
 So, Mike, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,200
 We are headed all the way out to Florida.

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,640
 Mike's driving us out to Florida.

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,960
 It's a long journey.

48
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,280
 This is such a bizarre story.

49
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,440
 And I think that one of two things is going to happen.

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,840
 This podcast will be completely removed because of this story.

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,880
 And that'll be the end of it.

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,600
 Or we'll be able to look back and go,

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,640
 "This is when the conspiracy theory really blew up."

54
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,080
 No, I'm not saying that this show is going to make the conspiracy theory blow up.

55
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,800
 But what I'm seeing right now is the growth of a massive, massive conspiracy theory.

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,560
 Right now, it's a little pimple, right?

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,040
 It's a little pimple on the face of history.

58
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,720
 Will it become a blackhead?

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,000
 Will it just become a giant erupting pus bubble?

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,520
 We don't know yet.

61
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,880
 So let's go ahead and get started.

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,720
 Let's also end the disgusting analogies.

63
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,240
 I hope you are not eating vanilla pudding.

64
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,480
 It's 2019.

65
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,120
 And in Florida, there is a young woman named Ashley Biden.

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
 This is of the Biden family.

67
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,760
 This is Joe Biden's daughter.

68
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,080
 And she is in a rehab clinic in Florida.

69
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,960
 And she's 39 at the time.

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,800
 And part of her rehab is to keep a diary.

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 In this diary.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
 Supposedly.

73
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,920
 So let me back up a bit here and kind of give this some context.

74
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,800
 In October 2020, there was a really, really obscure right-wing political website called

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,280
 National File.

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,640
 And they said, "We have a copy of Ashley Biden's diary."

77
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,600
 And they gave it to us because they felt that their media bosses, they obtained it somehow.

78
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,040
 They felt that their media bosses wouldn't publish a story, so they gave it to us, the

79
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
 National File.

80
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,400
 And we will publish this 39-year-old's diary that she wrote while she was in a drug rehab

81
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,640
 center.

82
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,600
 Here you go.

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,960
 And they released this diary about a week or two before the 2020 election.

84
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,880
 I read a lot of political stuff.

85
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,600
 And I read a ton of political conspiracy theories.

86
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 I just never talk about them on the show.

87
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,480
 But I never heard of the National File.

88
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,080
 I never heard of this group at all.

89
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,000
 They published this article.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,280
 It did not get covered by anyone else in the mainstream media, in the left-wing media,

91
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,120
 in the right-wing media even.

92
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,800
 Nobody covered this story.

93
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,200
 And so it was basically this website saying they had Ashley Biden's diary.

94
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,160
 And you look at it, they had scanned pages of it.

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,320
 And it's handwriting.

96
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,880
 And it's saying this stuff.

97
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,600
 And you're like, "Uh, that's horrible if this is true."

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,480
 But at the end of the last page of the diary, basically, because I was flipping through

99
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,520
 it, the last page of the diary is basically like, "And that's my diary.

100
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
 Who?

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
 It's good old me.

102
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
 Ashley Biden.

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
 Yep.

104
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
 Don't do this to me.

105
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
 I'm going to sign this."

106
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,120
 And you're like, "This looks fake."

107
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,520
 And it's coming out a week before the election.

108
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,280
 And it makes some really damning allegations, one in specific against her father.

109
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,040
 But you're like, "This is obviously a forgery.

110
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
 It's a dirty trick.

111
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,360
 These things are as old as politics themselves."

112
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,760
 And it came out.

113
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
 Nobody read it.

114
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,160
 Nobody went to the website.

115
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
 Election happens.

116
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,520
 Joe Biden becomes president.

117
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,480
 Still no one reads National File.

118
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,720
 Still no one's reading this diary.

119
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,920
 And it just kind of becomes one of their daily articles that just keeps moving further, further

120
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
 back in the past.

121
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,360
 A dirty trick gone wrong.

122
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,160
 And that's where it would have remained.

123
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,360
 And that's where even people who are super into conspiracy theories can spend a good

124
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,360
 bulk of their time reading conspiracy theories never, ever would have heard about Ashley

125
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,880
 Biden's diary.

126
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,760
 And what it suggests is there's a passage and it says she's listing all the things that

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,040
 she think led her to be hyper-sexualized as a child.

128
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,480
 This 39-year-old woman's in rehab and she's looking back and she's listing these things.

129
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,400
 The one, they're all horrible, right?

130
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,000
 It's all horrible when children are in these terrible environments.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,320
 But the one that is politically applicable is the statement, quote, "showers with my

132
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,080
 dad."

133
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,680
 And then in parentheses she wrote, "probably not appropriate."

134
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,240
 Dirty trick, right?

135
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,040
 And that's where this would have remained.

136
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,480
 This would have even to the most devout political conspiracy theory aficionados never would

137
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:38,920
 have heard of this until on November 4th, a year later, after all of this stuff happened,

138
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:48,200
 the FBI begins kicking down doors going, "where is Ashley Biden's diary?"

139
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,080
 They went to Project Veritas, which is a right-wing media outlet and they do a lot of undercover

140
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:00,880
 work and their founder and two other people had, the FBI showed up at their houses on

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,960
 November 3rd and November 4th saying, "where's the diary?

142
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,320
 Where's Ashley Biden's diary?"

143
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,440
 So the FBI are saying this diary was stolen.

144
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,080
 Now Project Veritas, which did not publish the diary, there are a much bigger media outlet

145
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
 than the other one.

146
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,520
 I don't have a name national file.

147
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,540
 They said, we didn't know whether or not it was true, there was some salacious stuff

148
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,080
 in there, we didn't want to publish it.

149
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,440
 Also we weren't really sure on the, you can see the FBI says it was stolen from Ashley

150
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
 Biden.

151
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,400
 Project Veritas goes, "we were told that the diary was left in a common place like a hotel

152
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,880
 room and someone else checked in the hotel room so it wasn't, there was no break-in,

153
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,720
 but Project Veritas goes, "we weren't going to publish it."

154
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,120
 So we decided to try to get a hold of Ashley's lawyer so we could try to facilitate a way

155
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,400
 for her to get it back.

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,760
 Because I guess there everyone is just being sent screenshots.

157
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,560
 So Project Veritas chose not to publish it, national file did, no one read the article,

158
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,600
 nobody knew this existed.

159
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,200
 And even if you knew it existed, even if you had read the national file article, even Project

160
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,440
 Veritas they're like, "we don't know how much of it's true."

161
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,480
 And you didn't until the FBI showed up at their door and said, "where's the diary?"

162
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,040
 So this is the conspiracy theory here, if the allegations are true that's absolutely

163
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
 awful obviously.

164
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,760
 I don't want to sugarcoat that, but it's removing that, removing the politics from everything.

165
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,120
 I want to look at the conspiracy theory part of this.

166
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
 This is a unforced error.

167
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,080
 The FBI by acknowledging they're looking for the diary, acknowledge the diary exists and

168
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
 it's real.

169
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
 That's the same thing.

170
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,040
 They acknowledge that it's real.

171
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,320
 That's what the FBI is doing.

172
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,560
 And if they had done nothing or local law enforcement, because it's really this type

173
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,600
 of theft, federal, local law enforcement do it, FBI makes some phone calls, have some

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,160
 goons show up, Reflete Project Veritas wears the diary.

175
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,840
 But by the FBI doing this it became a national story.

176
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,240
 They were talking about it on Fox.

177
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,920
 They're like, "oh now people are looking for this diary."

178
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,360
 And it is two, three clicks away before you find out what the diary says.

179
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,760
 So was it an unforced error to the FBI?

180
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,920
 They didn't need to do this, right?

181
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,040
 No one believed that the diary was real in the first place by them investigating it.

182
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,160
 Now people are reading the diary.

183
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,200
 For the national file used to just publish in the excerpts and no one is reading them

184
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,480
 and now they've published all 112 pages.

185
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,240
 And let's also say for a bit here, it's absolutely disgusting to be publishing somebody's diary.

186
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,520
 Like I don't want to sugarcoat that either.

187
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,720
 I actually debated a lot over whether or not to even reveal any information in the diary

188
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
 but I had to add some context.

189
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,880
 But I read, I did read a lot of the diary, I've read it, but it's awful that they were

190
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,960
 publishing it in the first place.

191
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,000
 Here's my thing and this is where we come to.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,040
 This was not an unforced error, this is my theory.

193
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,440
 Everyone in the "deep state" or multiple people are trying to take Biden down.

194
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,560
 If not take him down completely, take him down a couple notches.

195
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,840
 They didn't have to do this.

196
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,720
 And when we talk about the deep state, it's really interesting.

197
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,640
 That is a term that's been around since I was a kid.

198
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,120
 They would go by deep state or shadow government.

199
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,640
 The people truly pulling the levers of power.

200
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,080
 It became more pop culture in the past five years.

201
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,480
 But all it is, is, think about it this way.

202
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:40,080
 Imagine if at your job, your boss quit every four to eight years.

203
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,760
 And you could work, they could never work more than eight years at the company no matter

204
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
 how well they were doing.

205
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,640
 But you started when you were 18, you could work 40 years, you could work 50 years there.

206
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
 Who really has more power?

207
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,440
 Who has more alliances?

208
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,040
 Like sure that dude is on television, that president, that senator, whatever is on television.

209
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,840
 But the people, the accountants, it doesn't even have to be something super sexy like

210
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,200
 the CIA, FBI, polling strings.

211
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,240
 It could be your accounting division.

212
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,800
 It can be all sorts of stuff.

213
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,560
 The postmaster general.

214
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,760
 You can have all these other players that people aren't paying attention to.

215
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,160
 And they're building alliances that last decades.

216
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,240
 Nobody knew who Barack Obama was until he was like a state senator.

217
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,800
 And then he's the president.

218
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,160
 And now he's Netflix.

219
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,080
 But he didn't have all that time to build up all that political power.

220
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,080
 And I'd say even now there are people working in DC that are more powerful than Barack Obama

221
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,480
 ever was, or Trump ever was, or Biden ever was.

222
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,960
 And these people know how to pull the strings of power.

223
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,480
 So my prediction, this conspiracy theory just popped up.

224
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,560
 The rates just took place on November 4th.

225
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,560
 It's three days later.

226
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,160
 And it's starting to go viral.

227
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,800
 So this could be a huge thing if the people in the media start pushing it.

228
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,880
 Like the people in the adversarial or right wing media, whatever you want to call them,

229
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,800
 to Biden start pushing it.

230
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,200
 The other side will say it's not real, but the FBI is looking for it.

231
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
 It's fascinating.

232
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,800
 Somebody, somebody deep within that entire power structure in DC made this call to do

233
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,300
 this.

234
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,600
 And it's not a good look.

235
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,600
 I knew nothing of these allegations.

236
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,000
 And there will be hundreds of thousands of people who never knew anything about this

237
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,840
 or that the diary existed or that it was published until the FBI went knocking on doors.

238
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
 Fascinating story.

239
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,640
 And this is, I love looking at conspiracy theories obviously, but when we start to see

240
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,120
 them, these are levers going in action.

241
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,280
 This isn't us having a disaster and then watching a movie that came out in 2003 and

242
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,880
 saying predictive programming.

243
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:05,080
 We're watching people pull levers right now that are causing real world chaos.

244
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,960
 Fascinating stuff for any conspiracy theorist to see this.

245
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,040
 You have, there's just so many layers to this.

246
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,420
 You have the horrible allegations, which will basically be a true crime.

247
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,760
 And then you have conspiracy on top of conspiracy.

248
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
 Did the diary exist?

249
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
 How did it get stolen?

250
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,200
 Oh, the diary does exist.

251
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,320
 The FBI is looking for it.

252
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,760
 Who ordered the FBI to do this?

253
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
 Why are they looking for it now?

254
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,840
 Why is it a federal case?

255
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,680
 Fascinating, fascinating dissection for any true crime enthusiast.

256
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,520
 I don't know if the allegations in the diary are true.

257
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
 Obviously, hopefully not.

258
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
 Right?

259
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
 Hopefully not.

260
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,760
 And you would hope that the diary was fake.

261
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:49,540
 But it did not exist in anyone's mind until the FBI started knocking on doors.

262
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,380
 Super, super bizarre story.

263
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,220
 And, I mean, it's just been a crazy week because, Mike, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

264
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,020
 to the carbonar copter.

265
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,620
 We are leaving behind Florida.

266
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,580
 We're headed all the way out to Texas.

267
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:13,240
 We're in a weird state with conspiracy theory content right now because two things are happening

268
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,920
 at the exact same time.

269
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,800
 One, established long-term conspiracy stuff like conspiracy theory communities growing.

270
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,200
 We're going to start seeing the end to that because YouTube and Twitter and Facebook are

271
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
 going to be trying to block that stuff.

272
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,240
 They don't want a rehash of the Q movement.

273
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,420
 They don't want a rehash of these groups popping up and them not doing anything for months

274
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,620
 and years and so on and so forth.

275
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,300
 Same thing with flat earth.

276
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,660
 Anything that you have these conspiracy theories at the mainstream media, they're like, "Oh,

277
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,220
 not this again."

278
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,240
 They've put mechanisms in place to kind of make it so your algorithm doesn't flood you

279
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,700
 with that type of content.

280
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,660
 However, so that's happening.

281
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,540
 And I've been noticing that the big conspiracy theories that already exist, they're going

282
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
 to be here for a while.

283
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,960
 But the new ones, they're not given a lot of chance to grow.

284
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,240
 But at the same time, we're seeing conspiracy theories pop up so quickly after the event,

285
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,440
 so quickly.

286
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
 And it is going to have this whack-a-mole effect.

287
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,880
 They're not going to be allowed as much chance to grow these new conspiracy theories.

288
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,000
 But this Travis Scott concert, this was kind of my evolution through it and probably similar

289
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,560
 to a lot of what you guys went through.

290
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,720
 Mike Hall is flying us around the carbon helicopter.

291
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,180
 We're going to land, we're going to try to render aid at this concert.

292
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,220
 And I guess if you don't know, you're like, "Oh, Travis Scott is my favorite musician."

293
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,820
 But I've been asleep for the past three days.

294
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,660
 Let's build the scene here a bit in case you don't know.

295
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,420
 Just this weekend, it was just on Friday, it was November 5th.

296
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,500
 In Houston, Texas, there was the Astro World Festival.

297
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,340
 Apparently, this has gone on for a couple years.

298
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,620
 And it's a big music festival.

299
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,740
 This was supposed to be on November 5th and 6th.

300
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,560
 It was Friday and Saturday.

301
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,240
 The very first day of this music festival, the place is already at capacity.

302
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:10,720
 By 2 p.m. in the afternoon, hundreds of people started to storm into the VIP area.

303
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,080
 So the VIP area isn't like a velvet rope and it's like a seating area in the back of the

304
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 stage.

305
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,680
 It's basically like this giant stage area.

306
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,720
 So I mean, you did have a lot of people already there.

307
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,100
 I think it was just the VIP section you were closer to the stage.

308
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,900
 So you had hundreds of people break into the VIP area where they had already said there's

309
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,660
 going to be this many people in this area.

310
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,220
 Now you have hundreds more.

311
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,340
 Now I don't really know anything about Travis Scott.

312
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,380
 I know Fortnite and then McDonald's and then he's a musician.

313
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:46,340
 I've listened to more Travis Scott music over the past 48 hours than I have before.

314
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:53,320
 But Travis Scott is super popular and apparently in previous shows he's encouraged people to

315
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,280
 like everyone rush up to the stage.

316
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,920
 It's just chaos.

317
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,680
 He encourages chaos at his shows.

318
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,920
 So the people are breaking into the VIP area.

319
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,640
 He's not on stage at this point but it's kind of, this is the type of audience.

320
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,920
 This riled up, a bunch of Tasmanian devils locked into a little room audience.

321
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,020
 He had a bunch of people breaking into this VIP area.

322
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,140
 By 9pm you've already started having people getting injured.

323
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,300
 But by 9pm when Travis Scott takes the stage, and I'm going to stop right here, I may have

324
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,220
 called him Travis Walton more than once.

325
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,860
 That's the guy from Fire in the Sky.

326
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,940
 If I did that, I apologize.

327
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,740
 Travis Walton had nothing to do with any of this but Travis Scott gets on stage and there's

328
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,260
 just a massive surge of people.

329
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,380
 And people are getting crushed.

330
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,600
 People are getting knocked down, trampled.

331
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,680
 People are dying.

332
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,720
 They're just dying while this concert's going on.

333
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,160
 And there's tons of footage coming out of people trying to stop the show, trying to

334
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,080
 climb up on, there's one horrible video of a woman, a young girl yelling at a cameraman

335
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,480
 trying to get him to stop the show.

336
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,040
 She goes, "There's people dead down here.

337
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
 There's a dead guy right down here to stop the show."

338
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,600
 And the cameraman's like trying to wave her off in awe.

339
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,340
 As of now, you know it's only been a couple days, but as of now we have 8 people dead.

340
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:26,220
 23 people were taken to the hospital, 11 of those from heart attacks, and a total of 300

341
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,580
 people treated with injuries at the site of the event.

342
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,940
 So it's being considered a mass casualty event.

343
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,340
 And they were completely understaffed like medical wise.

344
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,760
 But minutes after people were leaving the show, this is very, very fascinating.

345
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,280
 Something that social media can grant us.

346
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,520
 People were, obviously we have videos and footage, we have some horrifying footage of

347
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,400
 dead people at the show.

348
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,120
 Within minutes, hours after the show ends, you started to see people say, "This was not

349
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,880
 an accident.

350
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,600
 This wasn't brought about because Travis Walton, damn it.

351
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,440
 This wasn't brought about because Travis Scott, Travis Walton.

352
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,580
 He has enough problems.

353
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,340
 Aliens are chasing him down."

354
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,620
 This isn't because Travis Scott was riling up the crowd.

355
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,940
 It wasn't because of poor management at the park.

356
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,700
 They didn't have enough emergency personnel and they didn't stop the rush of people.

357
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,900
 This was a satanic ceremony.

358
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,380
 That Travis Scott was doing this on purpose.

359
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,380
 Fascinating, fascinating.

360
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,260
 It's just such a quick turnaround for this conspiracy theory.

361
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
 So let's take a look.

362
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,920
 We have the baseline.

363
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
 We have the facts.

364
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,720
 Except for one.

365
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,400
 I actually saved one fact.

366
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,500
 We'll take a look at that in a second.

367
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,400
 We have the basic facts of the story.

368
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
 But we start to see all these posts on Twitter, on Facebook, everywhere.

369
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,320
 This was a satanic ritual.

370
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,360
 They were saying when the initial crush first started happening, I can't verify this.

371
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
 I wasn't there.

372
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,200
 But there's a portal.

373
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,120
 Not like there was a picture of a portal.

374
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,140
 They're like, "Whoa, was this in the news?"

375
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,140
 No.

376
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,220
 The background stage was of a black hole when the crush first started.

377
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,740
 It was welcoming in the souls.

378
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,420
 The opening song was called "Escape Plan," which apparently is escaping from your body.

379
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,420
 That's a bit of a stroke.

380
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,860
 This one's so interesting about these.

381
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,660
 Is that some of them you're going to go, "Oh, that does sound a weird.

382
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,860
 Why would a human react like that when there's so much human suffering going on around them?"

383
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,700
 But other ones you're like, "Well, okay.

384
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,480
 Anyways, he was singing the song "Escape Plan" when it first started.

385
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,560
 So maybe that was them supposed to be escaping from their bodies.

386
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,520
 There's video footage of an ambulance.

387
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,000
 An ambulance, mind you, has the sirens.

388
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,640
 It has the little whew whew whew whew.

389
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,120
 Has the little flashing lights.

390
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,480
 You can't hear anything at these concerts, right?

391
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,880
 It's trying to get through a crowd of people.

392
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,640
 Trying to get through a crowd of over...

393
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,940
 There's like 50,000 people at this event, and this entire area is completely packed in.

394
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,500
 This ambulance is trying to get through the crowd of people.

395
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,260
 And Travis Scott is like going, "Hey guys, what's up?

396
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,500
 Are you guys having a good time out there?"

397
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,700
 He's actually telling them, "Put your middle finger up in the air, guys.

398
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,660
 Put your middle finger up in the air.

399
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,660
 Hold it to the sky."

400
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,460
 And people are like, "There's an ambulance right here.

401
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,140
 Do you want to stop this show?"

402
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,820
 And then two guys kind of walk up to him and they start talking to him.

403
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,920
 And he ended like two of his crew members.

404
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,520
 He goes, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."

405
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,440
 And they're thinking, "Oh, did they say, 'Hey Travis, this is cool show.

406
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
 Although we might want to make room for the ambulance.'"

407
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,280
 And he just blew them off.

408
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,800
 We don't know.

409
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,440
 But based on what happens next, he goes, "Put both your hands in the air.

410
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
 Put both your hands in the air."

411
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,160
 People are like, "What?"

412
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
 And people were doing it, right?

413
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
 People were doing it.

414
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
 They're like, "I'm not in the ambulance.

415
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,640
 It's not my problem."

416
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,080
 And then Travis starts the next song as an ambulance is stuck surrounded by his fans,

417
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,060
 having them chanting for him to stop the show, the other half cheering him on, as there's

418
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:15,080
 an ambulance trapped in all of these people.

419
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,780
 He has his two crew members stage dive into the crowd and they start...

420
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,100
 I mean, it's so ridiculous.

421
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
 They start surfing the crowd.

422
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,520
 And you're like, "What?

423
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,160
 This is what's so interesting about this conspiracy theory."

424
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
 On the one hand, the...

425
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
 And that's on video.

426
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,080
 That is on video.

427
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,920
 On one hand, I have all of it in the show notes.

428
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,240
 On the one hand, the conspiracy theories really seem to reach sometimes.

429
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,360
 Like they're like, "Oh, his entrance to Astro World was his head."

430
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,800
 And that also looks like this old painting of Satan's head.

431
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
 And you're like, "Yeah, they both have mouths.

432
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,940
 Maybe they both have open mouths that you can walk through."

433
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,980
 And then you have a dude watching an ambulance trapped by a bunch of people and he's like,

434
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,900
 "One, two, three, four."

435
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
 He's like, "Everyone jump.

436
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
 Jump there.

437
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,900
 I'm jumping on the hood of the ambulance."

438
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,060
 Like, I mean, like, it's clearly an emergency going on.

439
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,980
 And of course, all of these footage, all these other YouTube videos have shown up there.

440
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,920
 Like this is what bands should do when you need to stop a show and there was like really

441
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,600
 cool footage of all these other bands like stopping the show and being like, "Hey guys,

442
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
 can you get someone over here?"

443
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,800
 I think that guy's passed down and people are stomping on his head.

444
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
 People get rescued.

445
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,400
 So there's a lot of people stop shows, right?

446
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,040
 A lot of people stop shows.

447
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
 But he continues to do this show.

448
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,600
 And then there's another video of him.

449
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
 This it does...

450
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,960
 It looks...

451
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
 It looks a little demonic.

452
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,140
 And you know me, like, it's so funny.

453
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,300
 When I started this story, I go, "Oh, that's weird.

454
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,140
 People are already trying to take this tragedy and turn it into something."

455
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,180
 And I won't really say where I sit on the fence just yet.

456
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,580
 I'll kind of say that at the end.

457
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,180
 But as I'm watching this stuff and I'm like, "Oh, yeah, you know, the big face walking

458
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
 through the mouth, whatever.

459
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
 I do that every Saturday."

460
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,780
 I'm like, "Hey, whose mouth am I going to walk through tonight?"

461
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:13,700
 But then I'd come across footage of people stage diving into this disaster zone.

462
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:20,200
 And then there's another one where he's standing on this platform that's probably like 20 feet

463
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,320
 above, maybe 15 feet above the audience.

464
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
 And it's just him.

465
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,720
 He's standing up there.

466
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,200
 And he has this auto tune.

467
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:33,120
 He sings with the auto tune thing.

468
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,720
 And there's someone filming it in the audience.

469
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,980
 And they're filming a man who is deceased or unconscious.

470
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,260
 And then the camera, the person turns the camera up to Travis Scott.

471
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,540
 And he's clearly looking at this guy.

472
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,020
 Now, it's not, you're like, "Jason, you know, concerts are chaotic places."

473
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,300
 He's being carried out by medical personnel.

474
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,740
 People are picking his prone body up and carrying it.

475
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
 He's not having fun.

476
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,620
 He's not a beach ball.

477
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,360
 And Travis Scott is clearly looking at this guy and he sees everyone step aside.

478
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,520
 He sees the people come in.

479
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
 They pick him up.

480
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
 He's not moving.

481
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,680
 It doesn't look like he's sleeping.

482
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,040
 It looks like he's dead.

483
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,960
 And they carry him out and then the camera goes back up and Travis Scott is looking at

484
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
 the whole thing.

485
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,160
 He's like, "What are we gonna do, honey?"

486
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,760
 And he's like, "Dude, seriously, you're just gonna sing?"

487
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,860
 And there's another video that's been popping up.

488
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:42,500
 Travis Scott stopped the show mid-song because someone stole his shoe.

489
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,340
 And then for the next three minutes, just yelling at his private security guards and

490
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,820
 the surrounding fans to murder him.

491
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:57,620
 To be fair, he didn't say murder, but he did ask 10,000 random strangers to eff him up,

492
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,580
 eff him up, eff him up over and over and over and over again.

493
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,040
 And he did eventually stop the show.

494
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,000
 And some people say that the concert promoter stopped the show or he stopped the show.

495
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,760
 So the show does not go on to this day.

496
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,880
 And if you walk into Astro World on a gloomy Saturday afternoon, you may still hear Travis

497
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,080
 Scott auto-tuned in the darkness.

498
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,440
 They did stop the show eventually and that's when they started being able to access these

499
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,800
 bodies, a lot of these bodies.

500
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,040
 So people did die.

501
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,360
 This is what's interesting about this.

502
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
 People did die.

503
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,420
 There was imagery that you could say was Satanic.

504
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,460
 And again, like, he had a bunch of fire coming out of the stage.

505
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,860
 That's pretty typical with shows.

506
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,140
 I don't think just having fire makes you Satanic.

507
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:50,100
 Some person said Astro World means Astro as in Star, which Star is like the Morning Star,

508
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,980
 which is like Lucifer.

509
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,420
 So then they said it should have been called Lucifer World.

510
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
 That's not helping.

511
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:00,340
 I mean, like, if you really believe this is a Satanic ritual, that's not evidence, right?

512
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,160
 That's not helping the cause.

513
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,440
 Now, so here's the question.

514
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,120
 Do I believe it was a Satanic ritual?

515
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
 We're all allowed to make up our own minds, right?

516
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
 You can agree with me or disagree with me.

517
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,600
 But do I believe it was a Satanic ritual?

518
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,560
 Well, let me break that in half here for a second.

519
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,400
 Let's kind of discuss the pieces and we'll wrap it up like this.

520
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:30,120
 You have this weird thing with fame that we talked about this before with like selling

521
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,020
 your soul to the devil to become famous and things like that.

522
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,380
 What I've heard of in the past, and I believe a lot of people when they say I sold my soul,

523
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,740
 they mean it as a metaphor.

524
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,580
 Like they started doing stuff that they wouldn't have done normally to gain power.

525
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,220
 But if you do take the literal thing of selling your soul to the devil, there is always that

526
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,620
 thing that the price comes cheap in the beginning.

527
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,860
 Maybe at first they go, "Yeah, I'll sell my soul for fame because what does it matter

528
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,860
 for eternity?

529
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,220
 I want to be rich and famous now."

530
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
 And so you do that.

531
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,160
 But then once you have a taste of that fame and that wealth and that power, then the bill

532
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,440
 really comes a-knockin'.

533
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,560
 And that's when the Lucifer, the devil shows up and renegotiates the terms.

534
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,760
 "Hey, I can't do that.

535
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
 You can't do that, man.

536
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
 We signed a contract."

537
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,520
 And that's when the devil goes, "Ha ha ha ha ha.

538
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,440
 That was just the contract for the contract."

539
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,840
 And he pulls out a new one.

540
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,220
 This is pretty common in the lore when we talk about Satanic deals, where at first you

541
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,200
 just sold your soul, but now to continue to be famous, you have to sacrifice people close

542
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,420
 to you.

543
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,860
 Whether or not, I've heard that both in literature and in people who have said they've actually

544
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,740
 sold their soul to the devil.

545
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
 People who are like, "That was not a metaphor.

546
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,740
 That was not a metaphor.

547
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,300
 I mean, totally accurate."

548
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,460
 And it could be something like that, right?

549
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,780
 On our scale, we're going to put that as the least likely one.

550
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,940
 The least likely one.

551
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,820
 But that's kind of what the conspiracy theory is saying, is that Travis Scott causes Satanic

552
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,820
 ritual.

553
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,040
 I personally believe if there was a Satanic ritual there, did he have anything to do with

554
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
 it?

555
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
 I don't know.

556
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,640
 He definitely could have shut the concert off earlier.

557
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,600
 You could argue with 50,000 people there.

558
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,200
 It's really hard to tell what's going on, Jason.

559
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,600
 Maybe he didn't really know.

560
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,720
 He stopped the concert after three or four songs or whatever it was.

561
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,240
 And maybe, maybe.

562
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,280
 But then we have, we're going to break it up into three.

563
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,880
 I forgot what the other two was.

564
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,200
 That was the first one, then.

565
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,280
 He actually was doing a Satanic ritual.

566
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,700
 Oh, and then the second one was that I used to be a musician a long time ago.

567
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:39,380
 And I find the relationship between a musician and the audience super, super bizarre.

568
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,700
 Where you are deified.

569
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,700
 That's why you are up on a stage.

570
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,420
 Or if you're, if there's not a stage, if you're at like a smaller venue, there's like this

571
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,220
 clearing in front of you.

572
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,400
 Jason, that's because all your equipment and everything like that.

573
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
 That's part of it.

574
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,520
 But if you've ever been on stage in any sort of performing aspect, I've acted way more

575
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,960
 than I've done music.

576
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,640
 But when you're performing in any sort of way, you are elevated.

577
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,560
 And I don't think it's a good thing.

578
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,160
 But you're elevated above the rest.

579
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,240
 And if it's not physically elevated on a stage, which it generally is, you have basically

580
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,020
 a cleansed area where you are deified.

581
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,460
 And I don't like that part of it.

582
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,860
 I didn't like it as a performer.

583
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,300
 And I don't like it as an audience member either.

584
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,780
 I'm not saying I don't want to be standing next to G.G. Allen while he's pooping, right?

585
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,420
 But there is this weird separation between the artist and the audience.

586
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,300
 And I get that it's a safety thing.

587
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,700
 But is it a safety thing?

588
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,060
 Or is it because they're so fanatical over you?

589
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:51,960
 Like does music create the problem in the first place?

590
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,800
 It's just a really interesting thing.

591
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,480
 So I think, and it was interesting because as I was reading this, a lot of people were

592
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,560
 saying that concerts in and of themselves are satanic rituals.

593
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,960
 And I don't believe in that.

594
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
 I don't believe in that.

595
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,760
 But I do believe concerts in and of themselves are rituals.

596
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,720
 It's 100%.

597
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,600
 When you go to see a musical act, specifically, plays are a bit different.

598
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,260
 But when you go to see a musical act, you are going to a ritual.

599
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,420
 You are going to have a religious experience if it is a band you like.

600
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,780
 If it's a band you hate and you were dragged there by someone, you're like, oh man.

601
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,940
 But then that's when you become their antichrist.

602
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,980
 That's when you start stalking that band.

603
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:39,740
 But it is a religious experience and they're actually elevated and the fire and the lights

604
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,820
 and the noise and all of this stuff.

605
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,980
 And I didn't like it as a musician.

606
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,200
 It was super weird.

607
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,040
 It's the same way why I may slip up from time to time, but I never, ever call you guys fans.

608
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,640
 I don't like, I don't consider you a fan of my work.

609
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,760
 I'll use the term listener.

610
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,120
 So on the second, so on the second thing that I do think that music and concerts in particular

611
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,920
 are ritualistic and you can have good rituals and you can have bad rituals.

612
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,760
 You can have rituals that uplift.

613
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,300
 You can have rituals that cause chaos.

614
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,820
 And I'm not, there are some people who love chaos.

615
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,660
 If you're into heavy metal, if you're into death metal and you like to go to crazy concerts

616
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,940
 and thrash around and headbang and everything like that, that's totally fine.

617
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:32,500
 I'm not anti the chaos because those shows can all be done safely.

618
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,460
 Those shows you don't have to have crushes of people.

619
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,420
 But you have, you're going to have a chaotic ritual which still feels like a religious

620
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,880
 experience and you can have a very uplifting or the chaos can be uplifting.

621
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
 You know what I mean?

622
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,840
 There's different music for different people, but when you go to a concert, you are going

623
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,760
 to a ritual.

624
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:57,600
 So in that sense, it is interesting to think that this astral world was a two day magical

625
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,160
 ritual where people were going to be around like-minded people listening to music that

626
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,880
 infuses their soul with joy.

627
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,600
 I'm not a fan of Travis Scott.

628
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,880
 I mean, I can't remember his name.

629
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,380
 But there are millions of people who are.

630
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,380
 It's a ritual.

631
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
 So that's my second thing.

632
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,340
 But the last thing I want to talk about, it's a piece of information I left out earlier

633
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:25,460
 and we'll see if anything comes of this because right now this is really, really interesting

634
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,020
 and it ties back into the other two things we're talking about.

635
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:38,780
 If concerts are a ritual, I can go to a concert and perform satanic black magic and the singer

636
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,440
 not even know, right?

637
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,960
 I could go to a Travis Walton.

638
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:51,280
 I could go to a Travis Scott concert and let him get all that energy whipped up.

639
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,560
 Get him that frenetic, chaotic life force.

640
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,760
 He's sucking it towards him.

641
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,600
 He's creating this vortex and I do the ritual unbeknownst to him.

642
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,300
 I do the ritual.

643
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,780
 I make the sacrifices as of today.

644
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,660
 So it's only been two days since this happened, but this is being reported by the local law

645
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,900
 enforcement.

646
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:29,740
 They believe that someone was walking through the crowd with a hypodermic needle and injecting

647
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:34,300
 people with it.

648
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,680
 There's a story that there was a security guard and a medical technician standing there

649
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,560
 and the security guard felt a prick on the back of his neck and he told the medical examiner,

650
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,040
 "Ah, I just got something poked me in the back of the neck."

651
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,200
 And while the medical examiner was looking at them, the security guard collapsed and they

652
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:00,760
 administered Narcan, which is an anti-opioid, and he revived them.

653
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:07,420
 So the question is, these people who had heart attacks, were they murder victims?

654
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,500
 Was someone walking around injecting this stuff into them?

655
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,540
 Now you can have a heart attack from being crushed.

656
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,660
 You can have a heart attack from being trampled.

657
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:23,060
 But we have eight people dead and then other than those 18 people and other 11 people with

658
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,060
 cardiac arrest and 23 people in total in the hospital.

659
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:31,820
 So we'll see what comes of that story.

660
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:37,560
 That sounds awfully demonic to walk into a crowd of people reveling in their favorite

661
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:44,000
 music and murdering them one after another after another.

662
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,900
 And people were saying, "When a body would fall down, that made people panic and start

663
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,960
 moving around even more and hurting more people."

664
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,860
 So how many of these, is that an urban legend?

665
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,900
 Is that a way to kind of hand wave away safety concerns?

666
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,620
 They're like, it wasn't because, the reason why this happened wasn't because we weren't

667
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,980
 fully prepared with the right medical staff.

668
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,660
 It was because some lunatic was walking around with a needle.

669
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,260
 Like which one's scarier?

670
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,540
 Mismanagement and incompetence?

671
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,260
 Or that, or that crazy guy at the needle who's still out there?

672
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:25,100
 He's like, "All right, lullapalooza's coming up next."

673
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:31,440
 Sounds very demonic and that's actually, if you were that sinister, that is a good ploy.

674
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,880
 Not, I'm not advising you do this, but I could see someone who is a practitioner of the dark

675
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:45,040
 arts doing this, causing chaos, taking lives during this heightened emotional energy and

676
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,360
 then feeding off of that energy or saving it for later, saving it for some other ritual.

677
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,580
 But what I find, we're gonna wrap it up like this, the demonic, the spiritual coin, right?

678
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,220
 The spiritual balance of the universe.

679
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,400
 I found this story really, really fascinating.

680
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,120
 You flip that coin, you have demonic activity if we are assuming this guy was walking through

681
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,280
 the crowd stabbing people.

682
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,480
 There was a Twitter user going by the name of Madeline and she tells this story.

683
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,160
 She goes, "I was at Astro World and I had been at Astro World Festival before, but this

684
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,240
 time it just felt totally different.

685
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,000
 There was way too many people.

686
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Things were getting out of control."

687
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,760
 And she got crushed and she actually couldn't breathe and she passed out.

688
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,560
 She goes, "I found out after the fact that I had passed out in the audience and my friend

689
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,200
 and a bunch of random strangers, crowdsurfed my unconscious body over to this fenced off

690
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,680
 area where there were some EMTs."

691
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,840
 And she goes, "What I remember was being in the audience realizing things had gone way

692
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,320
 too south and I have no idea what's going on and then I'm sitting in a tent with a bottle

693
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:03,840
 of water between my legs like she was completely unconscious and as she's coming to, she sees

694
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:11,320
 bodies lined up in this EMT area and people are doing CPR."

695
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:21,760
 She's an EMT and she puts that bottle of water down and immediately starts saving lives.

696
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,420
 One of the first things she does is she sees people doing CPR in this dead person and she

697
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,960
 checks their pulse and goes, "Move on to the next one."

698
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,100
 These they were just random.

699
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,560
 She goes, "I saw teenagers trying to give CPR trying to bring people to life."

700
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,880
 And she goes, "Move on to the next one."

701
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
 She goes, "They didn't know.

702
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
 You checked the pulse?

703
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,040
 They don't have a pulse."

704
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
 Triage.

705
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,160
 Go to the next person.

706
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,640
 Get the people that you can.

707
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
 She starts coordinating supplies.

708
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,320
 She saved lives by being on that side of the fence.

709
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,560
 I found that such an interesting sight to this.

710
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,440
 Had she not gone unconscious, which I don't think she enjoyed, but had she not gone unconscious,

711
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,720
 had her friend and other strangers not carried her, she easily could have just died on the

712
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,520
 ground, right?

713
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,160
 They carried her over and dropped her off in this EMT area where her training helped

714
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,920
 her save lives.

715
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,280
 Not everyone's life, but some of them.

716
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,800
 Even while a mass casualty event is going on, even in the midst of a possible satanic

717
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,160
 ceremony, God can still send down some of his angels.

718
00:39:38,160 --> 00:40:04,720
 And put them in the right place, where they need to be, to save lives.

719
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,300
 (upbeat music)

720
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,880
 (upbeat music)

721
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,460
 (upbeat music)

722
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,040
 (upbeat music)

723
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,620
 (upbeat music)

724
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,200
 (upbeat music)

725
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,780
 (upbeat music)

726
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,360
 (upbeat music)

727
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,940
 (upbeat music)

728
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,520
 (upbeat music)
