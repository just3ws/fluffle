00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.360
 They make me happy and they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.560
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.720
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 A series of FBI raids proves the power often lies behind the throne.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.040
 And then we'll take a look at the tragedy that happened this weekend

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.040
 at the Travis Scott concert in Texas.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.720
 Was it just mismanagement?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.040
 Or was the entire event a satanic sacrifice today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:02.040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.520
 Hey, everyone.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.640
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.520
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, or I'm Having a Great Day.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.040
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.760
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.120
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.720
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.800
 is one of our newest paid supporters.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.560
 He's running in.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.680
 He's super excited to get this episode started.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.360
 Give it up for Mike Hall.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.120
 Everyone give a round of applause to Mike.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.680
 Give you a salute, 21-gun salute.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.920
 Mike, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.160
 Hey, if you guys can't swear the Patreon, I totally understand.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.360
 Just tell your friends, tell your family about the podcast.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.440
 That really helps out a lot.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.720
 Now, Mike, I really like this episode because we got some breaking news stories.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.160
 Now, I guess it's less exciting if you're in the future.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.520
 Six months from now, you're like, "Yawn."

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.200
 No, there's still good stories, even if you're not alive right now.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.400
 But yeah, we got some interesting stuff.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.960
 I always love breaking news.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.680
 Not a lot of conspiracy content gets to do that nowadays.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.720
 So, Mike, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 We are headed all the way out to Florida.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.640
 Mike's driving us out to Florida.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.960
 It's a long journey.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.280
 This is such a bizarre story.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.440
 And I think that one of two things is going to happen.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.840
 This podcast will be completely removed because of this story.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.880
 And that'll be the end of it.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.600
 Or we'll be able to look back and go,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.640
 "This is when the conspiracy theory really blew up."

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.080
 No, I'm not saying that this show is going to make the conspiracy theory blow up.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.800
 But what I'm seeing right now is the growth of a massive, massive conspiracy theory.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.560
 Right now, it's a little pimple, right?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.040
 It's a little pimple on the face of history.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.720
 Will it become a blackhead?

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.000
 Will it just become a giant erupting pus bubble?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.520
 We don't know yet.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.880
 So let's go ahead and get started.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.720
 Let's also end the disgusting analogies.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.240
 I hope you are not eating vanilla pudding.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.480
 It's 2019.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.120
 And in Florida, there is a young woman named Ashley Biden.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120
 This is of the Biden family.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.760
 This is Joe Biden's daughter.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.080
 And she is in a rehab clinic in Florida.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.960
 And she's 39 at the time.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.800
 And part of her rehab is to keep a diary.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 In this diary.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800
 Supposedly.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.920
 So let me back up a bit here and kind of give this some context.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.800
 In October 2020, there was a really, really obscure right-wing political website called

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.280
 National File.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.640
 And they said, "We have a copy of Ashley Biden's diary."

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.600
 And they gave it to us because they felt that their media bosses, they obtained it somehow.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.040
 They felt that their media bosses wouldn't publish a story, so they gave it to us, the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040
 National File.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.400
 And we will publish this 39-year-old's diary that she wrote while she was in a drug rehab

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.640
 center.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.600
 Here you go.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.960
 And they released this diary about a week or two before the 2020 election.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.880
 I read a lot of political stuff.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.600
 And I read a ton of political conspiracy theories.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.600
 I just never talk about them on the show.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.480
 But I never heard of the National File.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.080
 I never heard of this group at all.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.000
 They published this article.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.280
 It did not get covered by anyone else in the mainstream media, in the left-wing media,

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.120
 in the right-wing media even.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.800
 Nobody covered this story.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.200
 And so it was basically this website saying they had Ashley Biden's diary.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.160
 And you look at it, they had scanned pages of it.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.320
 And it's handwriting.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.880
 And it's saying this stuff.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.600
 And you're like, "Uh, that's horrible if this is true."

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.480
 But at the end of the last page of the diary, basically, because I was flipping through

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.520
 it, the last page of the diary is basically like, "And that's my diary.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.520
 Who?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520
 It's good old me.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520
 Ashley Biden.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.520
 Yep.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.520
 Don't do this to me.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 I'm going to sign this."

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.120
 And you're like, "This looks fake."

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.520
 And it's coming out a week before the election.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.280
 And it makes some really damning allegations, one in specific against her father.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.040
 But you're like, "This is obviously a forgery.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.320
 It's a dirty trick.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.360
 These things are as old as politics themselves."

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.760
 And it came out.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760
 Nobody read it.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.160
 Nobody went to the website.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.160
 Election happens.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.520
 Joe Biden becomes president.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.480
 Still no one reads National File.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.720
 Still no one's reading this diary.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.920
 And it just kind of becomes one of their daily articles that just keeps moving further, further

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920
 back in the past.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.360
 A dirty trick gone wrong.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.160
 And that's where it would have remained.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.360
 And that's where even people who are super into conspiracy theories can spend a good

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 bulk of their time reading conspiracy theories never, ever would have heard about Ashley

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.880
 Biden's diary.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.760
 And what it suggests is there's a passage and it says she's listing all the things that

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.040
 she think led her to be hyper-sexualized as a child.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.480
 This 39-year-old woman's in rehab and she's looking back and she's listing these things.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.400
 The one, they're all horrible, right?

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.000
 It's all horrible when children are in these terrible environments.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.320
 But the one that is politically applicable is the statement, quote, "showers with my

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.080
 dad."

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.680
 And then in parentheses she wrote, "probably not appropriate."

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.240
 Dirty trick, right?

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.040
 And that's where this would have remained.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.480
 This would have even to the most devout political conspiracy theory aficionados never would

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:38.920
 have heard of this until on November 4th, a year later, after all of this stuff happened,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:48.200
 the FBI begins kicking down doors going, "where is Ashley Biden's diary?"

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.080
 They went to Project Veritas, which is a right-wing media outlet and they do a lot of undercover

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:00.880
 work and their founder and two other people had, the FBI showed up at their houses on

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.960
 November 3rd and November 4th saying, "where's the diary?

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.320
 Where's Ashley Biden's diary?"

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.440
 So the FBI are saying this diary was stolen.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.080
 Now Project Veritas, which did not publish the diary, there are a much bigger media outlet

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.080
 than the other one.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.520
 I don't have a name national file.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.540
 They said, we didn't know whether or not it was true, there was some salacious stuff

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.080
 in there, we didn't want to publish it.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.440
 Also we weren't really sure on the, you can see the FBI says it was stolen from Ashley

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440
 Biden.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.400
 Project Veritas goes, "we were told that the diary was left in a common place like a hotel

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.880
 room and someone else checked in the hotel room so it wasn't, there was no break-in,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.720
 but Project Veritas goes, "we weren't going to publish it."

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.120
 So we decided to try to get a hold of Ashley's lawyer so we could try to facilitate a way

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.400
 for her to get it back.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.760
 Because I guess there everyone is just being sent screenshots.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.560
 So Project Veritas chose not to publish it, national file did, no one read the article,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.600
 nobody knew this existed.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.200
 And even if you knew it existed, even if you had read the national file article, even Project

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.440
 Veritas they're like, "we don't know how much of it's true."

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.480
 And you didn't until the FBI showed up at their door and said, "where's the diary?"

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.040
 So this is the conspiracy theory here, if the allegations are true that's absolutely

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040
 awful obviously.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.760
 I don't want to sugarcoat that, but it's removing that, removing the politics from everything.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.120
 I want to look at the conspiracy theory part of this.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.080
 This is a unforced error.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.080
 The FBI by acknowledging they're looking for the diary, acknowledge the diary exists and

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080
 it's real.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080
 That's the same thing.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.040
 They acknowledge that it's real.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.320
 That's what the FBI is doing.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.560
 And if they had done nothing or local law enforcement, because it's really this type

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.600
 of theft, federal, local law enforcement do it, FBI makes some phone calls, have some

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.160
 goons show up, Reflete Project Veritas wears the diary.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.840
 But by the FBI doing this it became a national story.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.240
 They were talking about it on Fox.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.920
 They're like, "oh now people are looking for this diary."

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.360
 And it is two, three clicks away before you find out what the diary says.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.760
 So was it an unforced error to the FBI?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.920
 They didn't need to do this, right?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.040
 No one believed that the diary was real in the first place by them investigating it.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.160
 Now people are reading the diary.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.200
 For the national file used to just publish in the excerpts and no one is reading them

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.480
 and now they've published all 112 pages.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:37.240
 And let's also say for a bit here, it's absolutely disgusting to be publishing somebody's diary.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.520
 Like I don't want to sugarcoat that either.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.720
 I actually debated a lot over whether or not to even reveal any information in the diary

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.800
 but I had to add some context.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.880
 But I read, I did read a lot of the diary, I've read it, but it's awful that they were

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.960
 publishing it in the first place.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.000
 Here's my thing and this is where we come to.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.040
 This was not an unforced error, this is my theory.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:08.440
 Everyone in the "deep state" or multiple people are trying to take Biden down.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.560
 If not take him down completely, take him down a couple notches.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.840
 They didn't have to do this.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.720
 And when we talk about the deep state, it's really interesting.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.640
 That is a term that's been around since I was a kid.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.120
 They would go by deep state or shadow government.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.640
 The people truly pulling the levers of power.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.080
 It became more pop culture in the past five years.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.480
 But all it is, is, think about it this way.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:40.080
 Imagine if at your job, your boss quit every four to eight years.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.760
 And you could work, they could never work more than eight years at the company no matter

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.240
 how well they were doing.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.640
 But you started when you were 18, you could work 40 years, you could work 50 years there.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.240
 Who really has more power?

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.440
 Who has more alliances?

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.040
 Like sure that dude is on television, that president, that senator, whatever is on television.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.840
 But the people, the accountants, it doesn't even have to be something super sexy like

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.200
 the CIA, FBI, polling strings.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.240
 It could be your accounting division.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.800
 It can be all sorts of stuff.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.560
 The postmaster general.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.760
 You can have all these other players that people aren't paying attention to.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:23.160
 And they're building alliances that last decades.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.240
 Nobody knew who Barack Obama was until he was like a state senator.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.800
 And then he's the president.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.160
 And now he's Netflix.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.080
 But he didn't have all that time to build up all that political power.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.080
 And I'd say even now there are people working in DC that are more powerful than Barack Obama

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.480
 ever was, or Trump ever was, or Biden ever was.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.960
 And these people know how to pull the strings of power.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.480
 So my prediction, this conspiracy theory just popped up.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.560
 The rates just took place on November 4th.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.560
 It's three days later.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.160
 And it's starting to go viral.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.800
 So this could be a huge thing if the people in the media start pushing it.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.880
 Like the people in the adversarial or right wing media, whatever you want to call them,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.800
 to Biden start pushing it.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.200
 The other side will say it's not real, but the FBI is looking for it.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200
 It's fascinating.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:26.800
 Somebody, somebody deep within that entire power structure in DC made this call to do

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.300
 this.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.600
 And it's not a good look.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.600
 I knew nothing of these allegations.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.000
 And there will be hundreds of thousands of people who never knew anything about this

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.840
 or that the diary existed or that it was published until the FBI went knocking on doors.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.840
 Fascinating story.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.640
 And this is, I love looking at conspiracy theories obviously, but when we start to see

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.120
 them, these are levers going in action.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.280
 This isn't us having a disaster and then watching a movie that came out in 2003 and

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.880
 saying predictive programming.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:05.080
 We're watching people pull levers right now that are causing real world chaos.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.960
 Fascinating stuff for any conspiracy theorist to see this.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.040
 You have, there's just so many layers to this.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.420
 You have the horrible allegations, which will basically be a true crime.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.760
 And then you have conspiracy on top of conspiracy.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760
 Did the diary exist?

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.760
 How did it get stolen?

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.200
 Oh, the diary does exist.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.320
 The FBI is looking for it.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.760
 Who ordered the FBI to do this?

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760
 Why are they looking for it now?

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.840
 Why is it a federal case?

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.680
 Fascinating, fascinating dissection for any true crime enthusiast.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.520
 I don't know if the allegations in the diary are true.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.520
 Obviously, hopefully not.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520
 Right?

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.520
 Hopefully not.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.760
 And you would hope that the diary was fake.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:49.540
 But it did not exist in anyone's mind until the FBI started knocking on doors.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.380
 Super, super bizarre story.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.220
 And, I mean, it's just been a crazy week because, Mike, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.020
 to the carbonar copter.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.620
 We are leaving behind Florida.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.580
 We're headed all the way out to Texas.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:13.240
 We're in a weird state with conspiracy theory content right now because two things are happening

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.920
 at the exact same time.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.800
 One, established long-term conspiracy stuff like conspiracy theory communities growing.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.200
 We're going to start seeing the end to that because YouTube and Twitter and Facebook are

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.200
 going to be trying to block that stuff.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.240
 They don't want a rehash of the Q movement.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.420
 They don't want a rehash of these groups popping up and them not doing anything for months

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.620
 and years and so on and so forth.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.300
 Same thing with flat earth.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.660
 Anything that you have these conspiracy theories at the mainstream media, they're like, "Oh,

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.220
 not this again."

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.240
 They've put mechanisms in place to kind of make it so your algorithm doesn't flood you

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.700
 with that type of content.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.660
 However, so that's happening.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.540
 And I've been noticing that the big conspiracy theories that already exist, they're going

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.540
 to be here for a while.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.960
 But the new ones, they're not given a lot of chance to grow.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:07.240
 But at the same time, we're seeing conspiracy theories pop up so quickly after the event,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.440
 so quickly.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.440
 And it is going to have this whack-a-mole effect.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.880
 They're not going to be allowed as much chance to grow these new conspiracy theories.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:21.000
 But this Travis Scott concert, this was kind of my evolution through it and probably similar

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.560
 to a lot of what you guys went through.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.720
 Mike Hall is flying us around the carbon helicopter.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.180
 We're going to land, we're going to try to render aid at this concert.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.220
 And I guess if you don't know, you're like, "Oh, Travis Scott is my favorite musician."

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.820
 But I've been asleep for the past three days.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:39.660
 Let's build the scene here a bit in case you don't know.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.420
 Just this weekend, it was just on Friday, it was November 5th.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.500
 In Houston, Texas, there was the Astro World Festival.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.340
 Apparently, this has gone on for a couple years.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.620
 And it's a big music festival.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.740
 This was supposed to be on November 5th and 6th.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.560
 It was Friday and Saturday.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:03.240
 The very first day of this music festival, the place is already at capacity.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:10.720
 By 2 p.m. in the afternoon, hundreds of people started to storm into the VIP area.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.080
 So the VIP area isn't like a velvet rope and it's like a seating area in the back of the

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080
 stage.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.680
 It's basically like this giant stage area.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.720
 So I mean, you did have a lot of people already there.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.100
 I think it was just the VIP section you were closer to the stage.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.900
 So you had hundreds of people break into the VIP area where they had already said there's

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.660
 going to be this many people in this area.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.220
 Now you have hundreds more.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.340
 Now I don't really know anything about Travis Scott.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.380
 I know Fortnite and then McDonald's and then he's a musician.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:46.340
 I've listened to more Travis Scott music over the past 48 hours than I have before.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:53.320
 But Travis Scott is super popular and apparently in previous shows he's encouraged people to

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.280
 like everyone rush up to the stage.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.920
 It's just chaos.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.680
 He encourages chaos at his shows.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.920
 So the people are breaking into the VIP area.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.640
 He's not on stage at this point but it's kind of, this is the type of audience.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.920
 This riled up, a bunch of Tasmanian devils locked into a little room audience.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.020
 He had a bunch of people breaking into this VIP area.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.140
 By 9pm you've already started having people getting injured.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.300
 But by 9pm when Travis Scott takes the stage, and I'm going to stop right here, I may have

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.220
 called him Travis Walton more than once.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.860
 That's the guy from Fire in the Sky.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.940
 If I did that, I apologize.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:37.740
 Travis Walton had nothing to do with any of this but Travis Scott gets on stage and there's

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.260
 just a massive surge of people.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.380
 And people are getting crushed.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.600
 People are getting knocked down, trampled.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.680
 People are dying.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.720
 They're just dying while this concert's going on.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.160
 And there's tons of footage coming out of people trying to stop the show, trying to

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:04.080
 climb up on, there's one horrible video of a woman, a young girl yelling at a cameraman

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.480
 trying to get him to stop the show.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.040
 She goes, "There's people dead down here.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.040
 There's a dead guy right down here to stop the show."

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.600
 And the cameraman's like trying to wave her off in awe.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.340
 As of now, you know it's only been a couple days, but as of now we have 8 people dead.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:26.220
 23 people were taken to the hospital, 11 of those from heart attacks, and a total of 300

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.580
 people treated with injuries at the site of the event.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.940
 So it's being considered a mass casualty event.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.340
 And they were completely understaffed like medical wise.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.760
 But minutes after people were leaving the show, this is very, very fascinating.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.280
 Something that social media can grant us.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.520
 People were, obviously we have videos and footage, we have some horrifying footage of

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.400
 dead people at the show.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.120
 Within minutes, hours after the show ends, you started to see people say, "This was not

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.880
 an accident.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.600
 This wasn't brought about because Travis Walton, damn it.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.440
 This wasn't brought about because Travis Scott, Travis Walton.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.580
 He has enough problems.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.340
 Aliens are chasing him down."

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:16.620
 This isn't because Travis Scott was riling up the crowd.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.940
 It wasn't because of poor management at the park.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.700
 They didn't have enough emergency personnel and they didn't stop the rush of people.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.900
 This was a satanic ceremony.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.380
 That Travis Scott was doing this on purpose.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.380
 Fascinating, fascinating.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.260
 It's just such a quick turnaround for this conspiracy theory.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.260
 So let's take a look.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.920
 We have the baseline.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.920
 We have the facts.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.720
 Except for one.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.400
 I actually saved one fact.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.500
 We'll take a look at that in a second.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.400
 We have the basic facts of the story.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.400
 But we start to see all these posts on Twitter, on Facebook, everywhere.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.320
 This was a satanic ritual.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:00.360
 They were saying when the initial crush first started happening, I can't verify this.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.360
 I wasn't there.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.200
 But there's a portal.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.120
 Not like there was a picture of a portal.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.140
 They're like, "Whoa, was this in the news?"

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.140
 No.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.220
 The background stage was of a black hole when the crush first started.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.740
 It was welcoming in the souls.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:21.420
 The opening song was called "Escape Plan," which apparently is escaping from your body.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.420
 That's a bit of a stroke.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.860
 This one's so interesting about these.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.660
 Is that some of them you're going to go, "Oh, that does sound a weird.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.860
 Why would a human react like that when there's so much human suffering going on around them?"

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.700
 But other ones you're like, "Well, okay.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.480
 Anyways, he was singing the song "Escape Plan" when it first started.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.560
 So maybe that was them supposed to be escaping from their bodies.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.520
 There's video footage of an ambulance.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.000
 An ambulance, mind you, has the sirens.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.640
 It has the little whew whew whew whew.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.120
 Has the little flashing lights.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.480
 You can't hear anything at these concerts, right?

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.880
 It's trying to get through a crowd of people.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.640
 Trying to get through a crowd of over...

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.940
 There's like 50,000 people at this event, and this entire area is completely packed in.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.500
 This ambulance is trying to get through the crowd of people.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.260
 And Travis Scott is like going, "Hey guys, what's up?

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.500
 Are you guys having a good time out there?"

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.700
 He's actually telling them, "Put your middle finger up in the air, guys.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.660
 Put your middle finger up in the air.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.660
 Hold it to the sky."

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.460
 And people are like, "There's an ambulance right here.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.140
 Do you want to stop this show?"

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.820
 And then two guys kind of walk up to him and they start talking to him.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.920
 And he ended like two of his crew members.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.520
 He goes, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.440
 And they're thinking, "Oh, did they say, 'Hey Travis, this is cool show.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.440
 Although we might want to make room for the ambulance.'"

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.280
 And he just blew them off.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.800
 We don't know.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.440
 But based on what happens next, he goes, "Put both your hands in the air.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.960
 Put both your hands in the air."

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.160
 People are like, "What?"

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.160
 And people were doing it, right?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.160
 People were doing it.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.160
 They're like, "I'm not in the ambulance.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.640
 It's not my problem."

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:03.080
 And then Travis starts the next song as an ambulance is stuck surrounded by his fans,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.060
 having them chanting for him to stop the show, the other half cheering him on, as there's

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:15.080
 an ambulance trapped in all of these people.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.780
 He has his two crew members stage dive into the crowd and they start...

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.100
 I mean, it's so ridiculous.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.100
 They start surfing the crowd.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.520
 And you're like, "What?

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.160
 This is what's so interesting about this conspiracy theory."

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160
 On the one hand, the...

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.160
 And that's on video.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.080
 That is on video.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.920
 On one hand, I have all of it in the show notes.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.240
 On the one hand, the conspiracy theories really seem to reach sometimes.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.360
 Like they're like, "Oh, his entrance to Astro World was his head."

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.800
 And that also looks like this old painting of Satan's head.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.800
 And you're like, "Yeah, they both have mouths.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.940
 Maybe they both have open mouths that you can walk through."

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.980
 And then you have a dude watching an ambulance trapped by a bunch of people and he's like,

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.900
 "One, two, three, four."

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.900
 He's like, "Everyone jump.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.900
 Jump there.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.900
 I'm jumping on the hood of the ambulance."

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:13.060
 Like, I mean, like, it's clearly an emergency going on.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.980
 And of course, all of these footage, all these other YouTube videos have shown up there.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.920
 Like this is what bands should do when you need to stop a show and there was like really

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.600
 cool footage of all these other bands like stopping the show and being like, "Hey guys,

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.600
 can you get someone over here?"

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.800
 I think that guy's passed down and people are stomping on his head.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.800
 People get rescued.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.400
 So there's a lot of people stop shows, right?

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.040
 A lot of people stop shows.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.040
 But he continues to do this show.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.600
 And then there's another video of him.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600
 This it does...

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.960
 It looks...

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.960
 It looks a little demonic.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.140
 And you know me, like, it's so funny.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.300
 When I started this story, I go, "Oh, that's weird.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.140
 People are already trying to take this tragedy and turn it into something."

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.180
 And I won't really say where I sit on the fence just yet.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.580
 I'll kind of say that at the end.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:01.180
 But as I'm watching this stuff and I'm like, "Oh, yeah, you know, the big face walking

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.180
 through the mouth, whatever.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.180
 I do that every Saturday."

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.780
 I'm like, "Hey, whose mouth am I going to walk through tonight?"

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:13.700
 But then I'd come across footage of people stage diving into this disaster zone.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:20.200
 And then there's another one where he's standing on this platform that's probably like 20 feet

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.320
 above, maybe 15 feet above the audience.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.320
 And it's just him.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.720
 He's standing up there.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.200
 And he has this auto tune.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:33.120
 He sings with the auto tune thing.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.720
 And there's someone filming it in the audience.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:44.980
 And they're filming a man who is deceased or unconscious.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.260
 And then the camera, the person turns the camera up to Travis Scott.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.540
 And he's clearly looking at this guy.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.020
 Now, it's not, you're like, "Jason, you know, concerts are chaotic places."

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.300
 He's being carried out by medical personnel.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.740
 People are picking his prone body up and carrying it.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.740
 He's not having fun.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.620
 He's not a beach ball.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.360
 And Travis Scott is clearly looking at this guy and he sees everyone step aside.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.520
 He sees the people come in.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520
 They pick him up.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520
 He's not moving.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.680
 It doesn't look like he's sleeping.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.040
 It looks like he's dead.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.960
 And they carry him out and then the camera goes back up and Travis Scott is looking at

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.960
 the whole thing.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.160
 He's like, "What are we gonna do, honey?"

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.760
 And he's like, "Dude, seriously, you're just gonna sing?"

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.860
 And there's another video that's been popping up.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:42.500
 Travis Scott stopped the show mid-song because someone stole his shoe.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.340
 And then for the next three minutes, just yelling at his private security guards and

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.820
 the surrounding fans to murder him.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:57.620
 To be fair, he didn't say murder, but he did ask 10,000 random strangers to eff him up,

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.580
 eff him up, eff him up over and over and over and over again.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.040
 And he did eventually stop the show.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:08.000
 And some people say that the concert promoter stopped the show or he stopped the show.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.760
 So the show does not go on to this day.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.880
 And if you walk into Astro World on a gloomy Saturday afternoon, you may still hear Travis

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.080
 Scott auto-tuned in the darkness.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.440
 They did stop the show eventually and that's when they started being able to access these

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.800
 bodies, a lot of these bodies.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.040
 So people did die.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.360
 This is what's interesting about this.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360
 People did die.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.420
 There was imagery that you could say was Satanic.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:39.460
 And again, like, he had a bunch of fire coming out of the stage.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.860
 That's pretty typical with shows.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.140
 I don't think just having fire makes you Satanic.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:50.100
 Some person said Astro World means Astro as in Star, which Star is like the Morning Star,

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.980
 which is like Lucifer.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.420
 So then they said it should have been called Lucifer World.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.420
 That's not helping.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:00.340
 I mean, like, if you really believe this is a Satanic ritual, that's not evidence, right?

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.160
 That's not helping the cause.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.440
 Now, so here's the question.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.120
 Do I believe it was a Satanic ritual?

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.720
 We're all allowed to make up our own minds, right?

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.720
 You can agree with me or disagree with me.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.600
 But do I believe it was a Satanic ritual?

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.560
 Well, let me break that in half here for a second.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:23.400
 Let's kind of discuss the pieces and we'll wrap it up like this.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:30.120
 You have this weird thing with fame that we talked about this before with like selling

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.020
 your soul to the devil to become famous and things like that.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.380
 What I've heard of in the past, and I believe a lot of people when they say I sold my soul,

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.740
 they mean it as a metaphor.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.580
 Like they started doing stuff that they wouldn't have done normally to gain power.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:48.220
 But if you do take the literal thing of selling your soul to the devil, there is always that

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.620
 thing that the price comes cheap in the beginning.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.860
 Maybe at first they go, "Yeah, I'll sell my soul for fame because what does it matter

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:54.860
 for eternity?

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.220
 I want to be rich and famous now."

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.220
 And so you do that.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:01.160
 But then once you have a taste of that fame and that wealth and that power, then the bill

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.440
 really comes a-knockin'.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.560
 And that's when the Lucifer, the devil shows up and renegotiates the terms.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.760
 "Hey, I can't do that.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.760
 You can't do that, man.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.760
 We signed a contract."

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.520
 And that's when the devil goes, "Ha ha ha ha ha.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.440
 That was just the contract for the contract."

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.840
 And he pulls out a new one.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:21.220
 This is pretty common in the lore when we talk about Satanic deals, where at first you

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.200
 just sold your soul, but now to continue to be famous, you have to sacrifice people close

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.420
 to you.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:33.860
 Whether or not, I've heard that both in literature and in people who have said they've actually

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.740
 sold their soul to the devil.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.740
 People who are like, "That was not a metaphor.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.740
 That was not a metaphor.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.300
 I mean, totally accurate."

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:46.460
 And it could be something like that, right?

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.780
 On our scale, we're going to put that as the least likely one.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.940
 The least likely one.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.820
 But that's kind of what the conspiracy theory is saying, is that Travis Scott causes Satanic

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.820
 ritual.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.040
 I personally believe if there was a Satanic ritual there, did he have anything to do with

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.040
 it?

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.040
 I don't know.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.640
 He definitely could have shut the concert off earlier.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.600
 You could argue with 50,000 people there.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.200
 It's really hard to tell what's going on, Jason.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.600
 Maybe he didn't really know.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.720
 He stopped the concert after three or four songs or whatever it was.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.240
 And maybe, maybe.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.280
 But then we have, we're going to break it up into three.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.880
 I forgot what the other two was.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.200
 That was the first one, then.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.280
 He actually was doing a Satanic ritual.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:31.700
 Oh, and then the second one was that I used to be a musician a long time ago.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:39.380
 And I find the relationship between a musician and the audience super, super bizarre.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.700
 Where you are deified.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.700
 That's why you are up on a stage.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.420
 Or if you're, if there's not a stage, if you're at like a smaller venue, there's like this

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.220
 clearing in front of you.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.400
 Jason, that's because all your equipment and everything like that.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.400
 That's part of it.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.520
 But if you've ever been on stage in any sort of performing aspect, I've acted way more

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.960
 than I've done music.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.640
 But when you're performing in any sort of way, you are elevated.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.560
 And I don't think it's a good thing.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.160
 But you're elevated above the rest.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.240
 And if it's not physically elevated on a stage, which it generally is, you have basically

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.020
 a cleansed area where you are deified.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.460
 And I don't like that part of it.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.860
 I didn't like it as a performer.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.300
 And I don't like it as an audience member either.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.780
 I'm not saying I don't want to be standing next to G.G. Allen while he's pooping, right?

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.420
 But there is this weird separation between the artist and the audience.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.300
 And I get that it's a safety thing.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.700
 But is it a safety thing?

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.060
 Or is it because they're so fanatical over you?

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:51.960
 Like does music create the problem in the first place?

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.800
 It's just a really interesting thing.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.480
 So I think, and it was interesting because as I was reading this, a lot of people were

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.560
 saying that concerts in and of themselves are satanic rituals.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.960
 And I don't believe in that.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.160
 I don't believe in that.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.760
 But I do believe concerts in and of themselves are rituals.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.720
 It's 100%.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.600
 When you go to see a musical act, specifically, plays are a bit different.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.260
 But when you go to see a musical act, you are going to a ritual.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.420
 You are going to have a religious experience if it is a band you like.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.780
 If it's a band you hate and you were dragged there by someone, you're like, oh man.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.940
 But then that's when you become their antichrist.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.980
 That's when you start stalking that band.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:39.740
 But it is a religious experience and they're actually elevated and the fire and the lights

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.820
 and the noise and all of this stuff.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.980
 And I didn't like it as a musician.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.200
 It was super weird.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:53.040
 It's the same way why I may slip up from time to time, but I never, ever call you guys fans.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.640
 I don't like, I don't consider you a fan of my work.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.760
 I'll use the term listener.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:06.120
 So on the second, so on the second thing that I do think that music and concerts in particular

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.920
 are ritualistic and you can have good rituals and you can have bad rituals.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.760
 You can have rituals that uplift.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.300
 You can have rituals that cause chaos.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.820
 And I'm not, there are some people who love chaos.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.660
 If you're into heavy metal, if you're into death metal and you like to go to crazy concerts

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.940
 and thrash around and headbang and everything like that, that's totally fine.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:32.500
 I'm not anti the chaos because those shows can all be done safely.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.460
 Those shows you don't have to have crushes of people.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.420
 But you have, you're going to have a chaotic ritual which still feels like a religious

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.880
 experience and you can have a very uplifting or the chaos can be uplifting.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.880
 You know what I mean?

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.840
 There's different music for different people, but when you go to a concert, you are going

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.760
 to a ritual.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:57.600
 So in that sense, it is interesting to think that this astral world was a two day magical

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.160
 ritual where people were going to be around like-minded people listening to music that

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.880
 infuses their soul with joy.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.600
 I'm not a fan of Travis Scott.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.880
 I mean, I can't remember his name.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.380
 But there are millions of people who are.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.380
 It's a ritual.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.380
 So that's my second thing.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.340
 But the last thing I want to talk about, it's a piece of information I left out earlier

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:25.460
 and we'll see if anything comes of this because right now this is really, really interesting

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.020
 and it ties back into the other two things we're talking about.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:38.780
 If concerts are a ritual, I can go to a concert and perform satanic black magic and the singer

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.440
 not even know, right?

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.960
 I could go to a Travis Walton.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:51.280
 I could go to a Travis Scott concert and let him get all that energy whipped up.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:57.560
 Get him that frenetic, chaotic life force.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.760
 He's sucking it towards him.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:07.600
 He's creating this vortex and I do the ritual unbeknownst to him.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.300
 I do the ritual.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:14.780
 I make the sacrifices as of today.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:19.660
 So it's only been two days since this happened, but this is being reported by the local law

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.900
 enforcement.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:29.740
 They believe that someone was walking through the crowd with a hypodermic needle and injecting

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:34.300
 people with it.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.680
 There's a story that there was a security guard and a medical technician standing there

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.560
 and the security guard felt a prick on the back of his neck and he told the medical examiner,

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.040
 "Ah, I just got something poked me in the back of the neck."

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:53.200
 And while the medical examiner was looking at them, the security guard collapsed and they

00:34:53.200 --> 00:35:00.760
 administered Narcan, which is an anti-opioid, and he revived them.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:07.420
 So the question is, these people who had heart attacks, were they murder victims?

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.500
 Was someone walking around injecting this stuff into them?

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.540
 Now you can have a heart attack from being crushed.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.660
 You can have a heart attack from being trampled.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:23.060
 But we have eight people dead and then other than those 18 people and other 11 people with

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.060
 cardiac arrest and 23 people in total in the hospital.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:31.820
 So we'll see what comes of that story.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:37.560
 That sounds awfully demonic to walk into a crowd of people reveling in their favorite

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:44.000
 music and murdering them one after another after another.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.900
 And people were saying, "When a body would fall down, that made people panic and start

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:55.960
 moving around even more and hurting more people."

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.860
 So how many of these, is that an urban legend?

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.900
 Is that a way to kind of hand wave away safety concerns?

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.620
 They're like, it wasn't because, the reason why this happened wasn't because we weren't

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.980
 fully prepared with the right medical staff.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.660
 It was because some lunatic was walking around with a needle.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.260
 Like which one's scarier?

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.540
 Mismanagement and incompetence?

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.260
 Or that, or that crazy guy at the needle who's still out there?

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:25.100
 He's like, "All right, lullapalooza's coming up next."

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:31.440
 Sounds very demonic and that's actually, if you were that sinister, that is a good ploy.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:37.880
 Not, I'm not advising you do this, but I could see someone who is a practitioner of the dark

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:45.040
 arts doing this, causing chaos, taking lives during this heightened emotional energy and

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.360
 then feeding off of that energy or saving it for later, saving it for some other ritual.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:55.580
 But what I find, we're gonna wrap it up like this, the demonic, the spiritual coin, right?

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.220
 The spiritual balance of the universe.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.400
 I found this story really, really fascinating.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:06.120
 You flip that coin, you have demonic activity if we are assuming this guy was walking through

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.280
 the crowd stabbing people.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.480
 There was a Twitter user going by the name of Madeline and she tells this story.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.160
 She goes, "I was at Astro World and I had been at Astro World Festival before, but this

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.240
 time it just felt totally different.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.000
 There was way too many people.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 Things were getting out of control."

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.760
 And she got crushed and she actually couldn't breathe and she passed out.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.560
 She goes, "I found out after the fact that I had passed out in the audience and my friend

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:43.200
 and a bunch of random strangers, crowdsurfed my unconscious body over to this fenced off

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.680
 area where there were some EMTs."

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.840
 And she goes, "What I remember was being in the audience realizing things had gone way

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:56.320
 too south and I have no idea what's going on and then I'm sitting in a tent with a bottle

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:03.840
 of water between my legs like she was completely unconscious and as she's coming to, she sees

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:11.320
 bodies lined up in this EMT area and people are doing CPR."

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:21.760
 She's an EMT and she puts that bottle of water down and immediately starts saving lives.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.420
 One of the first things she does is she sees people doing CPR in this dead person and she

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.960
 checks their pulse and goes, "Move on to the next one."

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.100
 These they were just random.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.560
 She goes, "I saw teenagers trying to give CPR trying to bring people to life."

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.880
 And she goes, "Move on to the next one."

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.880
 She goes, "They didn't know.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.880
 You checked the pulse?

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.040
 They don't have a pulse."

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.040
 Triage.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.160
 Go to the next person.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.640
 Get the people that you can.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.640
 She starts coordinating supplies.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.320
 She saved lives by being on that side of the fence.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.560
 I found that such an interesting sight to this.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:08.440
 Had she not gone unconscious, which I don't think she enjoyed, but had she not gone unconscious,

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.720
 had her friend and other strangers not carried her, she easily could have just died on the

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.520
 ground, right?

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.160
 They carried her over and dropped her off in this EMT area where her training helped

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.920
 her save lives.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.280
 Not everyone's life, but some of them.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:32.800
 Even while a mass casualty event is going on, even in the midst of a possible satanic

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.160
 ceremony, God can still send down some of his angels.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:40:04.720
 And put them in the right place, where they need to be, to save lives.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.300
 (upbeat music)

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.880
 (upbeat music)

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.460
 (upbeat music)

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.040
 (upbeat music)

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.620
 (upbeat music)

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.200
 (upbeat music)

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.780
 (upbeat music)

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.360
 (upbeat music)

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.940
 (upbeat music)

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.520
 (upbeat music)
