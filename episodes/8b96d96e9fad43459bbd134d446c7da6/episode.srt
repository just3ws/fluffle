 British Swim School, make us flash.

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,660
 Previously on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,220
 (growls)

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,740
 Knocking stuff over.

16
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,140
 This is "Dead Rabbit Show."

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,960
 Whatever it's called,

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,620
 "Dead Rabbit Radio" is the actual name,

19
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,100
 but this show is revealing the secret truths we have.

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,060
 Every episode he does is true.

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,380
 But some of his episodes counter-dict

22
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,180
 the other episodes that he does.

23
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,140
 It doesn't matter.

24
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,260
 Those episodes are actually even more true.

25
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,220
 We have to stop him.

26
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,500
 We have to stop him before he exposes

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,180
 all of our evil plans.

28
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,760
 (upbeat music)

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,380
 Oh man, so fun playing Apex Legends

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,500
 while my break's going on,

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,980
 but it's time to shut it off.

32
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,940
 And now I'm going to sit back, relax,

33
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,380
 and assume nothing bad is going to happen.

34
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,340
 (upbeat music)

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,020
 Oh, what was that?

36
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,860
 Game's off.

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,740
 I ran outside.

38
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,860
 What?

39
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,340
 Open my squeaky door.

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,500
 Oh my God.

41
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,900
 Oh my God.

42
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,740
 Bodies everywhere.

43
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,620
 The destruction.

44
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,220
 If you could only see it is,

45
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,220
 it's shocking.

46
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,300
 But I don't know any of them, so that's cool.

47
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,740
 But, oh my God.

48
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,780
 My hanger.

49
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,900
 And my garage that's attached to my hanger.

50
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,860
 No, I wasn't clapping.

51
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,700
 I was running into the hanger.

52
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,540
 Oh my God.

53
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,540
 No.

54
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,180
 Carpenter copter.

55
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,220
 It's on fire.

56
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,060
 Oh my God.

57
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,060
 And it's destroyed.

58
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,740
 It's completely destroyed.

59
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,580
 The Jason Jalopy.

60
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,580
 Oh no.

61
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,420
 Oh no.

62
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,500
 The Jason Jalopy burned to a crisp.

63
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,260
 Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

64
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,420
 Oh my God.

65
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,580
 The Dead Rapid Durageable is still here

66
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,660
 and it's in one piece.

67
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,500
 No.

68
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,820
 There's only one thing I can do now.

69
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,220
 I have to assemble a team.

70
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,800
 (upbeat music)

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
 (yells)

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,680
 After I finish playing some more Apex Legends,

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,400
 but now I will assemble my team.

74
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,520
 So, I urge you the man to come to,

75
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,840
 if I need some muscle.

76
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,160
 Mungo has lots of muscle,

77
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,720
 given to me by God and supplements.

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,520
 Thank you Mungo, will you be on my team?

79
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
 (yells)

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,840
 As long as we can push nerds.

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
 Hey, do that anyways.

82
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,240
 Come on Mungo.

83
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,080
 Hey.

84
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,920
 (mimics gunshots)

85
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,280
 A bunch of pictures being taken.

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
 I don't know how to make that sound.

87
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,840
 I had phones, either using the phones,

88
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,780
 there's no noises.

89
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,440
 All these photos are being taken.

90
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,960
 Hey, hey.

91
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,260
 Jason, my best friend ever.

92
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,760
 Yes, yes, Miley Cyrus.

93
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,080
 It is I, your best friend.

94
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,200
 I'm putting together a team.

95
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
 Say no more.

96
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,240
 Now, we just have one more person to put on our team.

97
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,600
 Hello?

98
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
ì†Œ?!

99
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,560
 Is anyone here?

100
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,400
 Here?

101
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,460
 Yeah.

102
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,020
 Bongono liked this house.

103
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,740
 Looks like Gollum's house from nerd novel.

104
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:42,640
 Yeah, what we're about to face is far worse than Gollum.

105
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,720
 Did you know?

106
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,240
 Did you know?

107
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,340
 Did you know?

108
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,000
 Franz, Franz dude, quit creeping us out with your- how are your arms that long?

109
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,600
 Why do you come here?

110
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:09,320
 Franz listen dude, truce, I need your help to fight the bad guys who blow up all my stuff.

111
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,920
 You need my help?

112
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,600
 As I sound very Gollum like?

113
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,960
 Yes, Franz, we need your help.

114
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,920
 I'm declaring a truce.

115
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,320
 You did not know about the truce?

116
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,000
 What do you have to offer me?

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,760
 How about a 12 pack of diet cranberry sprites?

118
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,040
 Maybe, listen Franz, you don't have anything better going on.

119
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
 You're scurrying around your dark apartment, just come with us.

120
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,320
 Okay.

121
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,760
 And now, season 5 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

122
00:04:47,760 --> 00:05:01,600
 That's a preview when we go to the jungle and we get attacked by a giant cat and I throw

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,520
 Franz in front of it.

124
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,520
 No, no, no, no, no, no.
