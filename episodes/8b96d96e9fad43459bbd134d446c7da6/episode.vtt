00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440

 British Swim School, make us flash.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.660
 Previously on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.220
 (growls)

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.740
 Knocking stuff over.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.140
 This is "Dead Rabbit Show."

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.960
 Whatever it's called,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.620
 "Dead Rabbit Radio" is the actual name,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.100
 but this show is revealing the secret truths we have.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.060
 Every episode he does is true.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.380
 But some of his episodes counter-dict

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.180
 the other episodes that he does.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.140
 It doesn't matter.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.260
 Those episodes are actually even more true.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.220
 We have to stop him.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.500
 We have to stop him before he exposes

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.180
 all of our evil plans.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.760
 (upbeat music)

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.380
 Oh man, so fun playing Apex Legends

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.500
 while my break's going on,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.980
 but it's time to shut it off.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.940
 And now I'm going to sit back, relax,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.380
 and assume nothing bad is going to happen.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 (upbeat music)

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.020
 Oh, what was that?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.860
 Game's off.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.740
 I ran outside.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.860
 What?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.340
 Open my squeaky door.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.500
 Oh my God.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.900
 Oh my God.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.740
 Bodies everywhere.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.620
 The destruction.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.220
 If you could only see it is,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.220
 it's shocking.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.300
 But I don't know any of them, so that's cool.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.740
 But, oh my God.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.780
 My hanger.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.900
 And my garage that's attached to my hanger.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.860
 No, I wasn't clapping.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.700
 I was running into the hanger.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.540
 Oh my God.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 No.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.180
 Carpenter copter.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.220
 It's on fire.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 Oh my God.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 And it's destroyed.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.740
 It's completely destroyed.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.580
 The Jason Jalopy.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 Oh no.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.420
 Oh no.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.500
 The Jason Jalopy burned to a crisp.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.260
 Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.420
 Oh my God.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.580
 The Dead Rapid Durageable is still here

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.660
 and it's in one piece.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.500
 No.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.820
 There's only one thing I can do now.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.220
 I have to assemble a team.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.800
 (upbeat music)

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800
 (yells)

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.680
 After I finish playing some more Apex Legends,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.400
 but now I will assemble my team.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.520
 So, I urge you the man to come to,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.840
 if I need some muscle.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.160
 Mungo has lots of muscle,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.720
 given to me by God and supplements.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.520
 Thank you Mungo, will you be on my team?

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.760
 (yells)

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.840
 As long as we can push nerds.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.840
 Hey, do that anyways.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.240
 Come on Mungo.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.080
 Hey.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.920
 (mimics gunshots)

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.280
 A bunch of pictures being taken.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280
 I don't know how to make that sound.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.840
 I had phones, either using the phones,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.780
 there's no noises.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.440
 All these photos are being taken.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.960
 Hey, hey.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.260
 Jason, my best friend ever.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.760
 Yes, yes, Miley Cyrus.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.080
 It is I, your best friend.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.200
 I'm putting together a team.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.400
 Say no more.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.240
 Now, we just have one more person to put on our team.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.600
 Hello?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.600
ì†Œ?!

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.560
 Is anyone here?

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.400
 Here?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.460
 Yeah.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.020
 Bongono liked this house.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.740
 Looks like Gollum's house from nerd novel.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.640
 Yeah, what we're about to face is far worse than Gollum.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.720
 Did you know?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.240
 Did you know?

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.340
 Did you know?

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.000
 Franz, Franz dude, quit creeping us out with your- how are your arms that long?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.600
 Why do you come here?

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:09.320
 Franz listen dude, truce, I need your help to fight the bad guys who blow up all my stuff.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.920
 You need my help?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.600
 As I sound very Gollum like?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.960
 Yes, Franz, we need your help.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.920
 I'm declaring a truce.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.320
 You did not know about the truce?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.000
 What do you have to offer me?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.760
 How about a 12 pack of diet cranberry sprites?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.040
 Maybe, listen Franz, you don't have anything better going on.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.040
 You're scurrying around your dark apartment, just come with us.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.320
 Okay.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.760
 And now, season 5 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:05:01.600
 That's a preview when we go to the jungle and we get attacked by a giant cat and I throw

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.520
 Franz in front of it.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.520
 No, no, no, no, no, no.
