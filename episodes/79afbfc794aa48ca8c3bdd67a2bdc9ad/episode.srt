1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 *Sings* Oh no, oh no, oh no. I died, I died. I died. I strapped in a hospital and something was wrong with my heart, and now I am broadcasting from the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Today I'm going to introduce you to some of my ghost buddies that I've met since I've passed away, passed away, passed away. We're gonna meet a guy who's no one for doing inappropriate stuff. Stuff not me, another guy, another guy, another guy.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 We're gonna meet some other ghosts, one that likes to haunt an unusual place, and then just some other stuff I found on Backpackerverse. Today on the afterlife special of Dead Rabbit Radio. Radio, radio.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 *Music*

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 So this is part two of episode three, three, three. If you didn't listen to episode part one, it's totally fine. It's just a health update. If you don't want to hear that, you just skip past it. It doesn't matter to me if you're a new listener.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 You're not missing anything. I basically had a heart scare. Everything's fine. I was just reassuring people that everything's fine. Let's go ahead though and talk about some spooky, spooky ghosts.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Now, little asterisks next to both of those spookies. Probably an asterisk next to ghosts. Oh, actually, I do have two shout outs to do here.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 So first off, back when I did episode 300, Crispy Bacon, the Patreon supporter, Crispy Bacon says, "You know what? Since we all talk about numerology and stuff like that, episode 333 should be a special episode."

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Because it's halfway to 666. And I said, "You're right, sir. You are right." And originally it was supposed to be a special episode, but then I ended up in the hospital.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 But technically, it's kind of special because it's the first two-parter. It's not. I think I've done other two-parter. Have I? I don't think I have.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So Crispy Bacon is the father of our first two-parter episode. I've done other two-parters and I don't think about it, but I've never split them up like this.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 So all it took was my heart to go out of rhythm, Crispy, to get your wish.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Secondly, let's say hello to our newest Patreon supporter. We have C. Knowles. C. Knowles, C. Knowles Patreon supporter. And I feel bad about this because I wanted this episode to come out on November 11th.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Instead, it's being recorded on November 11th. But his son Casey, it's his birthday on November 11th, 2019. Ooh, spooky day, 11-11.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I actually saw a movie called 11-11-11. It was a really low-budget horror movie and it was quite spooky. Don't let your kid watch it.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 But, well, it depends. If your kid's 25, go ahead. But because it is Casey's birthday, we're going to let Casey drive us around.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Casey is going to be the man behind the wheel of the... We'll bring out the Carverter Cofter. I originally was going to use the Jason Jalopy, but since we have a guest pilot...

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 You're like, "Jason, he doesn't know how to drive a helicopter." "Ah, come on, kid. Get inside. Here's the keys."

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 So while he's getting it all set up, let's go ahead and prepare for our journey to these ghost people that I met when I died.

21
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I should also say right now I didn't die, but I should also say right now, originally, this episode was going to be about near-death experiences where people have come back from bad near-death experiences.

22
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 But I didn't want to talk about that after spending five and a half hours in the hospital.

23
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 So instead, we're going to talk about the aftermath of near-death experiences. Death experiences? We're going to go hunt some ghosts.

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So fire up the copter, Casey, and right now we are headed to El Cerrito, California.

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 [Copter talking]

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 That is a pretty good pilot, man. He knows his way around a cockpit. Is that what they call it in a helicopter?

27
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Oh, and I should say this too before I get started. Speaking of aerial aircraft, I get out of the hospital at 5.30.

28
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I go to the hospital-- I start-- I end-- I show up at the hospital at noon. I leave at 5.30. I leave in the middle of a chase scene in the Fat Fate of Therias.

29
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And I was supposed to be at the movie theater by 6.25 to see Terminator Dark Fate.

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I walked about a mile from the hospital to the movie theater and got there in time to see Terminator Dark Fate. And it sucked.

31
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 But I will say this. The action scenes were really good. It was just the plot was a mess, and the plot was a real mess.

32
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 The action scenes were decent. The action scenes were decent.

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So anyways, that's-- I mean, if you like watching people get clawed in the face with a metal hook, every fight scene, a guy just gets a hook to the face.

34
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 It's basically saw franchise in action form. On the poster, the lead character is holding a hook. Use another weapon. It didn't work the first seven times.

35
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Action scenes are good, though, but anyways, there's this ridiculous aerial plane thing. We're not doing that. Casey's flying a helicopter.

36
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 We're just flying around. We're not looking for death franchises to crash into. Casey's totally just trying to concentrate as I'm just going off on these rants.

37
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 He's like, "Dude, I've never flown a helicopter before in Petrified." I'm like, "You can do it, kid!" Slap him on the back.

38
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 We're landing in Richmond, California. [imitates helicopter landing]

39
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Sound like a transformer? Not a transformer, I wish. Helicopter lands.

40
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So we all get off, and I hope you guys brought your beach gear. Not beach gear. I hope you guys brought your pool gear, which is probably the same thing, honestly.

41
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I hope you guys brought your shorts and nothing else, unless you're a woman, I guess I should-- or you have a nice bathing suit on.

42
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I personally prefer one-piece bathing suits. Okay, maybe that's not true, because I do have a lot of sports illustrated posters around my apartment,

43
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 but I think in the wild, in public, I prefer one-piece bathing suits. I don't know what it is. On a poster, I prefer a bikini.

44
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 There's nothing to do with the story. Anyways, forget that.

45
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 So we're at this pool in El Cerrito. It's called the El Cerrito Swim Center. Very original name.

46
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Now, apparently, this pool-- this is an interesting one. This is interesting. Apparently, the pool is haunted. A haunted pool.

47
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Now, you go, Jason, isn't that what happened in Poltergeist? The pool was haunted. Technically, the house was haunted. The bodies just came up out of the pool.

48
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 But this pool is haunted. Supposedly, this pool was built on a-- I don't actually know. I don't think there is ever a reason why it was haunted.

49
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 But here's what-- it's haunted, okay? According to multiple websites around the web, so.

50
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 What happens is they hate a crowded pool. These ghosts hate a crowded-- so basically, the ghosts are just people who are alive.

51
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Nobody likes a crowded pool. You're in a pool and you're swimming around, splashing.

52
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Now, these ghosts, if the pool is too crowded, the water gets cold. That's a sign that the ghosts are mad at you.

53
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Now, that's also a sign that the pool is closed or that the pool-- they're trying to save energy. The manager of the pool is like, "Oh, man, my electric bill is so high. This one turns out."

54
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Everyone's like, "Oh, it's cold in here. What are you going to do? It's ghosts. It's dead people." And they're like, "Ah!"

55
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Or that it's in California and their energy grid sucks to begin with.

56
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I can say that as a longtime California resident. This all happened during the Gray Davis administration, during the rolling brownouts.

57
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Everyone's like, "Why is the water so cold? It must be ghosts."

58
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Also, there are reports that if you're in this pool, the ghosts will grab your feet and try to pull you under, which, again, is any living person in a pool.

59
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Now, not any-- I've been in a lot of pools in my life. I don't know why that's-- I'm not bragging. Everybody has.

60
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 But when you're in a pool, they're actually quite boring. Like, you're like, "Oh, man, I can't wait to get in the pool."

61
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Everyone take your shirts off. And when I was-- I take my shirt off now, but I was one of those kids who didn't take a shirt off.

62
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And then I got to the point where I was like, "Why-- why don't I take my shirt off?" It makes me way heavier.

63
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 When I'm already heavy, I get in the pool and now I'm even less buoyant because I have to take my shirt off.

64
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I don't care what people think, so I started taking my shirt off. But I used to not to take my shirt off.

65
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I was like, "I don't know, 13, 14?" I was a chubby kid. I'm still chubby, but I don't take my shirt off. I don't care.

66
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 I take my shirt off walking down the street. I don't care. But anyways, you get in the pool and you're like, "Oh, yeah, woohoo!"

67
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And then you're like five minutes later, you're like, "Sucks."

68
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Unless, like, you're hanging out in the pool with your buddies, but even then, it sucks. It totally sucks.

69
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Being in a pool is actually quite boring. So what do you do? You start horsing around. You start pulling people's feet.

70
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 You start pretending to drown them or actually drown them. Play chicken, stuff like that.

71
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So these ghosts are basically just doing what humans do. Which, to be fair, you're saying, "Jason, isn't that what all ghosts do?"

72
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Eh, not necessarily. Like, if you go to a haunted baseball park, you don't see balls flying around, which would actually be pretty dope.

73
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 What I'm saying is it's most likely probably people you can't see. Not invisible people.

74
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 It's probably just people directly underneath you pulling on your feet.

75
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Now, we do have a first person encounter from El Cerrito Swim Center. This comes courtesy.

76
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Now, you may go, "Hey, Jason, do you really have to talk about this website?" I thought you stopped talking about Backpackerverse.

77
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I almost died yesterday, man. I didn't. I didn't. Just so. But for the joke, I almost died yesterday.

78
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Give me some more Backpackerverse. I also, while I was watching Terminator Dark Fate, I thought, "I might have died if I hadn't gone to the hospital,

79
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 and my heart just wouldn't stop beating." Most likely wouldn't have. But for dramatic effect, as I'm watching Terminator Dark Fate, I go,

80
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 "It's quite possible that this might be the last movie I ever watched." And it was not up to snuff. But I could have seen Midway.

81
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 So, I mean, I don't think that movie would have been much better. I'm gonna see you later this week. Maybe. I don't know.

82
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Feeling kind of...bummy. 'Cause my heart rate can only get so high. You can only get up to, like, 89 or something like that.

83
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Anyways, you're like, "That's a normal heart rate." I'm like, "Yeah, but not for me. Not for me. I'm an exciting man."

84
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 We have a first-person encounter from Backpackerverse. I'm gonna read you this quote, and you tell me if you know what this first part is.

85
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 "A young man who happens..." Puberty started all of a sudden.

86
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 "A young man who happens to be a video psychic...used to train in the swimming pool center, had such a terrible encounter with the angry spirits that he decided to change pools."

87
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 What's a video psychic? First off, I'm gonna say, since I've gone back to Backpackerverse, and to be fair, I don't go to Backpackerverse.

88
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 I'm always looking for ghost stories, and they constantly pop up. I'm not going to them. They're coming to me.

89
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Their site has taken a huge dip in quality recently. Now, I'm not gonna attribute it to my exposés on them, and they realize, listen, we're caught.

90
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 If we write good stuff or bad stuff, we're gonna get caught by this elusive--wait, not elusive--intrepid journalist, dead rabbit, radio, Jason Garbiner's actual name.

91
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Let's just pump out poorly written stuff, because when we do good written stuff, it's still fake, so let's just do fake, poor written stuff.

92
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I don't know, but they've taken a huge dive in quality. What is a video psychic? That's someone who's like, "Okay, without even looking at the case, I can tell you what movie that is.

93
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 It's a guy with no shoes on, running through an office building, and he's all...that's diehard, isn't it?"

94
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Everyone's like, "Whoa, how did he know? He didn't even look at the case. He turned the case around, and it's diehard."

95
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Huh? Yup. What's a video psychic? What is a video psychic? Anyways, he said that one day he was swimming in this pool, and he heard a voice.

96
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Here's the quote. "I started hearing angry voices of men whispering to my ears, things like, 'Get out!'"

97
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Now, it could be that he was swimming in this pool, and there were ghostly people going, "Get out!" Or, it's possible he was swimming in this pool, they were trying to close, and it was the lifeguard yelling, "Get out!"

98
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 But he's underwater, so it all sounds muffled. And he's like, "It was so weird. These mysterious, mysterious men, these phantoms in red shorts, begin grabbing me, and I'm wrestling with them, and they dragged me out, and the next thing I knew, I was sitting outside the pool,

99
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 near my car. What horrible fate awaits someone who goes to El Cerrito Swim Center, one star on Yelp." It actually has four stars on Yelp. So that should tell you how unhaunted it is.

100
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 But yeah, if you're in a pool and people hear voices going, "Get out!" It's most likely someone who works there. They're like, "Look out, dude, someone peed in the pool!" You're swimming in there, it's turning blue.

101
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 It's already blue, it's turning green. I heard that's a myth. I heard that they don't actually have a thing that makes urine. Well, we have a thing that makes urine, it's called their body, but there's not really a chemical in a pool that causes the water to turn green.

102
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I don't know. Urban Legend? Who knows? Also, before we leave El Cerrito, let me tell you, I'm going to read you this last thing here. This isn't on backpackerverse.

103
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 I'm not going to waste all your time on backpackerverse. I'm going to save that for later stories.

104
00:13:43,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 "This is a first-person submission from a young woman named Monica. Here is her and her family's experiences with ghosts in El Cerrito. And if you are a resident of El Cerrito or Richmond, California, get ready, because this is a representation of not only the spirits that haunt you, but the people who live in that area."

105
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Here we go. "In El Cerrito, the post office on California Drive, as well as Ontario and Grand." So I don't know if that's... I'm assuming that's two different post offices.

106
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 But anyways, "My aunt and cousins have seen giant owls flying around. One even stood and stared at them." That is... Who cares? Who cares? Giant owls. Okay, but anyways.

107
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 This next part works. "I've had family members see goblin-like creatures in El Cerrito." Lead with that next time.

108
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Don't lead with the post office and the giant owls. Just start off. Hey, my family will live in El Cerrito? Goblin. Also, what's a goblin-like creature? Goblin-like creature is just an ugly human.

109
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 A goblin is a goblin. A goblin-like creature is a human who looks like a goblin.

110
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Imagine that you're in ghost investigating. You're walking around talking to people and you're like, "Hey, man, have you ever seen any ghosts in El Cerrito?"

111
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And this woman walks up to you and says this, this actual quote, "My uncle said he saw a man on a horse."

112
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Was it a ghost? Man, was it just a regular dude on a horse? Oh, no, that's the whole quote. "My uncle said he saw a man on a horse."

113
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Was he at a dude ranch? Where? Was it in the middle of the city? Was it in an office building? Did it appear before him? Or was it just a man on a horse?

114
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And he's never seen a horse before. That is so confusing. And that comes right after the goblin-like creatures.

115
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 But let's wrap it up with this. "My female cousin said she saw a man with money bags at her house."

116
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Did he have a lume-s uniform on? Was he walking out of a bank and loading up an armored car?

117
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 These details are important. She does go on to say that she's picked up weird conversations about money and thieving, like she's heard it in her head.

118
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 She finishes her comment, "This is the Wild West and wild it is. Don't walk around late at night."

119
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Submitted by Monica. "So, giant owls, nighttime, sure. Don't walk around at night. An owl might stare at you."

120
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 "Goblin-like creatures you might see ugly humans and elcerito. You might see a man on a horse and it might see a man walk around with money bags."

121
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 "Don't walk out." None of those pose any danger to me. It should just be, "Don't walk out at night. This is California and the crime rate is insane."

122
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 "You're gonna get stabbed by a methodic homeless man."

123
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 "Me may or may not be holding money bags at the time."

124
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 "Most likely will not because he's a methodic homeless man."

125
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 "Maybe on a horse?" Who knows. That would be interesting.

126
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 "A homeless..." I guess all cowboys were technically homeless. The home was the range, right?

127
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 "Maybe homeless people are just reincarnated cowboys and they have no cows to rustle and they just feel the pull of being outdoors and sleeping under the stars and severe crippling drug addictions."

128
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Let's go ahead, hop back on the Carpentercopter, KC. We're gonna fire that guy back up and I hope you guys are aware now this is gonna be a long episode, because it's a special. It's the halfway to hell special.

129
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 We're going to Sutter Creek. Sutter Creek, California. All this stuff takes place in California, by the way.

130
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 So, he's not flying too far. I don't know how far away Sutter Creek is from El Cerrito, but we're allowed in case you do some loop-de-loops and stuff.

131
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 "Oh, you're like Jason, that wasn't part of the deal." You bought a bunch of marbles. When we were in El Cerrito, they're going everywhere.

132
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Every time you... Every time... Can you even do a loop-de-loop? You might. KC can. The helicopter keeps spinning around and around.

133
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 You're like, "Oh no, I bought yogurt." Everything you bought needs a lid.

134
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Like, I'm sitting there with pizza. Technically, it doesn't need a lid. I guess it comes in a lid.

135
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I'm eating just a hamburger patty, so I'm good. I can put it in my mouth and it just flies up into my teeth and, like, automatically, I bite it.

136
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Like, I'm a cartoon character, apparently. Whatever. We land. The circus is over. I don't even know if physically that's possible.

137
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 If you could hold... Think about it. Let's figure this out. Okay? Special episode. Almost died. Bear with me.

138
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 If I held a piece of meat in my hands... Which... That is not an "if." I do that every single day.

139
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 If I'm holding a piece of meat in my... When I'm holding a piece of meat in my hands and I go to eat it, I go, "Arrrrrrrrrrrrr."

140
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And my teeth chew up the meat. Right? But what if I held my mouth open and just... This is a real legit question. This is not a bit.

141
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,040
 this is not a bit, if I held my mouth open, I moved the meat up and down.

142
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,200
 Could I eventually eat it like that?

143
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,740
 I am basically sign it with my teeth.

144
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,720
 Now I'm not gonna try that, because it sounds like a huge joking hazard, but I bet it's

145
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:08,720
 possible.

146
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:23,360
 Anyways, that's what I was doing on the helicopter.

147
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,560
 Let's go ahead and check in to Sutter Creek Inn.

148
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:35,320
 Now Casey, stay in the helicopter for this one.

149
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
 This one is PG-13.

150
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
 It's probably PG-13.

151
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,200
 We're not gonna, anyways, just stay in the helicopter dude.

152
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,160
 It's like, oh man, I like, trust us, you're getting the good deal of this one.

153
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,680
 We go, we check in to Sutter Creek Inn.

154
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,280
 Now there's no bell at this hotel, I bring my own.

155
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,200
 Bring my own bell everywhere I go.

156
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,200
 Set it on counters of places, fast food restaurants, hotels, airports, ding ding ding ding ding.

157
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,960
 The person comes out of the office and they're like, where's that dingy coming from?

158
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
 Ding ding ding.

159
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
 Oh hi.

160
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,360
 So I'm like, hello, yes, I would like to book a room for myself and my listeners here.

161
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,720
 And they're like, is there a small boy sitting in a helicopter outside?

162
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,840
 Does that helicopter really have missiles on it?

163
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,600
 I was like, yeah, yeah, ignore the boy.

164
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
 Ignore the boy.

165
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
 We wanna check in to a room here.

166
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,600
 So when we're in the hotel here, walking around, there have been a lot of ghosts spotted here.

167
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,080
 So we, the traditional thing, this place has been kind of haunted for a while.

168
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,560
 There's a traditional thing.

169
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,520
 You see old ghosts and old timey clothes show up.

170
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,480
 I'm still waiting to see like a ghost in like a Metallica shirt or something like that.

171
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,720
 It's always like big old ribbons and they're not birthing presents, but like big old bow

172
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,400
 ties and fitted vests and stuff like that.

173
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,040
 I wanna see ghosts that are poorly dressed.

174
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,600
 I wanna see ghosts in tank tops and torn underwear.

175
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,840
 And I wanna see just like slobs.

176
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,680
 Most people die as slobs.

177
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:08,160
 Most people die as they're naked a lot of times or they just die and they're slobby.

178
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,480
 But when their ghost shows up they're in full Elizabethan garb.

179
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,560
 What if like if I died right now, my ghosts would show up and I'd be dressed as like

180
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,360
 a pikeman from Napoleon's army.

181
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 That would be a trip.

182
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 I'd be like, "Oh, what?

183
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
 This is pretty dope.

184
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,480
 I'm poking people with my pike."

185
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
 People are like, "That's weird."

186
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,920
 Like we always knew Jason was into like podcasts and bad movies.

187
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,400
 We didn't know he was a Napoleon War rain actor.

188
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,720
 It's quite odd.

189
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,240
 But anyways ghosts and old timey clothes walking around.

190
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,040
 We have a story from, of course, Backpackerverse.

191
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,720
 This hotel supposedly really is haunted.

192
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,680
 There's a lot of stuff about this hotel, but Backpackerverse tells a story about this

193
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,960
 dude who checks into the hotel with his girlfriend or wife.

194
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,440
 It doesn't matter, same thing.

195
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,200
 Just a contract after that.

196
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
 Ring.

197
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
 No biggie deal.

198
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,080
 His girlfriend/wife he's hanging out of the hotel with and then he gets into bed and

199
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,920
 she's like downstairs doing something.

200
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,960
 And then the ghost gets into, oh he doesn't know it's a ghost.

201
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,200
 He feels a lump in his bed and he's like, "Ooh baby."

202
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,240
 And he's like cuddling up with his lump.

203
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,560
 And then his girlfriend comes in the door and he's like, "Ah."

204
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,200
 And he throws back the blanket and there's a woman with pale white skin and black hair

205
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,720
 laying in bed next to him.

206
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,640
 And she vanishes.

207
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,680
 So that didn't happen.

208
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,360
 That story is totally made up.

209
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,680
 Multiple reasons why it's made up.

210
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,160
 One, let's look at it factually here.

211
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,320
 Okay, so first off, one of the main things that human, you may not know this.

212
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
 I mean I'm sure you do.

213
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,440
 I'm not calling you guys idiots.

214
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,560
 But it's mostly subconscious.

215
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,560
 One of the main things we use to identify people is smell, even if we don't know it.

216
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,960
 There is no way that you are, if you are sober, there is no way you are getting into bed with

217
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,600
 someone who is not your significant other and not immediately recognizing it not as your

218
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,040
 significant other.

219
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,760
 But Jason, maybe the ghost is able to replicate the human smell of his wife.

220
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,280
 Okay, fine.

221
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,840
 Then you want me to believe that she believes a lump, that he can wrap his arms around her

222
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,040
 and snuggle up to a non-caporial entity.

223
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,440
 So this would have to, like if there is a power level of these things, a ghost walking

224
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,440
 down the hallway, like you see in a phantom walking on the hallway, would be fairly low

225
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,120
 on the power level.

226
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,760
 It picking up an object or throwing it or knocking over an object would be higher.

227
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,440
 Turning electricity on and off would actually be probably easier to do than moving stuff

228
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,360
 over unless it's actually hitting the lights, which it never is conveniently.

229
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,720
 It's always something happening on the wall.

230
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:49,480
 But to be able to manifest as a spirit that can not only misshape the blankets, be a full

231
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:59,200
 bodied apparition, wrap your arms around it and not notice it's not your wife or girlfriend.

232
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,480
 That is basically gozer level power.

233
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,960
 That would mean that this ghost is basically the most advanced ghost on the planet.

234
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,200
 It's not, it's totally made up.

235
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,040
 He pops out of bed and his wife is like "Oh my god, what are you doing about that woman?"

236
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,360
 and then the ghost disappears.

237
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
 Now to be fair that actually is a great way.

238
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:25,680
 If you have a girlfriend/wife or boyfriend/husband and you want to cheat on them, make your lover

239
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,920
 cover themselves in head to toe white makeup.

240
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,740
 It might make some chafing during the actual act of love making, but have them cover their

241
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,200
 body in full body white makeup or baby powder.

242
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,520
 Or and I mean dye their hair black and then that way whenever you get caught with them

243
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,320
 you shouldn't because you're cheating on them.

244
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,680
 But if you get caught with them you could then go "Oh my god it was a ghost" and then

245
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,000
 they could hide under your bed or something like that.

246
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,400
 And go "Don't look under the bed, he's a spooky monster now!"

247
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,040
 And if your significant other is an idiot they won't realize that the ghost looks exactly

248
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,700
 like their cousin, but that's why you fell in love with them in the first place because

249
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,220
 they're an idiot and you can convince them that your lover is a ghost.

250
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:15,380
 So we are not done though with the Sutter Creek can we see Casey looking through the

251
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,020
 helicopter window he's like "Are you guys done yet?

252
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,540
 It's getting kind of cold out here."

253
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,060
 I'm like "It's just the ghost, it's just the ghost making the helicopter cold bro.

254
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,100
 Just just chill out.

255
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
 Get it chill out."

256
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,320
 He's like 30 degrees out there and C. Knowles is like "Dude that's my son.

257
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,520
 Just tell him how to turn on the heater.

258
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,080
 Hold on, hold on, hold on."

259
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,160
 We got one more ghost to look at and then we'll go out and turn on the heater.

260
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,620
 We are here for the main attraction.

261
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,720
 We've covered tons of ghosts, we've talked about tons of ghost types over this show and

262
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,120
 there's sometimes you run across a ghost that's quite unusual and this is one of them.

263
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,160
 This is why I brought you to here.

264
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,720
 We're gonna meet a ghost he doesn't have a name, we'll call him, it doesn't matter,

265
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,320
 I don't need it, he doesn't have a name.

266
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,580
 Okay, he just doesn't need a name.

267
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,620
 This ghost has been spotted multiple times and while you're hanging out in the little

268
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,940
 dining room, you're drinking your tea or soda, I don't even drink either of those anymore,

269
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,380
 while I'm drinking water, lame, like a nerd, like a caveman.

270
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,500
 I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't do drugs.

271
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,140
 I gave him nicotine and now I can't even have caffeine.

272
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,900
 And I can but just not eight gallons of it but still I'm not supposed to have for a while.

273
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,960
 Because I'm complaining about my own lifestyle choices that I've made.

274
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,960
 You're like Jason, okay, the pity party's over, ooh your heart got out of whack, now

275
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,600
 you guys are making fun of me as I'm drinking my water.

276
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,200
 You keep trying to slip a slip tea into it, I'm like no that'll kill me, it'll kill me.

277
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,960
 You guys are all laughing at my weakened state.

278
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,440
 A ghost shows up and I'm like oh everyone shh, what's making fun of me is I wipe a tear

279
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
 away from my eye.

280
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,260
 Go make fun of me, look, watch this, and the ghost is standing in front of us and we're

281
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,140
 standing, we're not standing, we're sitting in front of the ghost.

282
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:08,700
 And then the ghost drops his pants, fully exposing himself to us and then he disappears.

283
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,780
 Now that's unusual even in the world of the paranormal, there's not many cryptids.

284
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:19,100
 We talked about the "gurning man", quite a few episodes back he seemed like an exhibitionist,

285
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,880
 spirit or alien or demon or something like that, who would only appear to women of a

286
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,160
 certain age group and rub his chest and have this creepy smile on his face.

287
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,680
 But we don't see many exhibitions as ghosts, which is interesting because if you think

288
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,400
 about it, so many people have weird hang-ups that you think they would follow them to the

289
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,680
 afterlife more often.

290
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,920
 This one's dead, so he's a ghost that must have been a flasher if it existed at all.

291
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,560
 Let me back up here, if this story is true in any way shape or form, and this is a famous

292
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,020
 ghost at this place, I've found this ghost mentioned several times, especially in the

293
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,340
 book National Directory of Honder Places.

294
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,700
 This ghost will appear in front of women, and we're a mixed company, but it's all good.

295
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,420
 He'll appear in front of women and he'll pull his pants down, exposing himself to us.

296
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,740
 Now there's no specification that he's not pulling his pants down and there's nothing

297
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,340
 there, so I believe that we're actually seeing his ghost junk.

298
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:21,000
 That's why we left him in the helicopter, but that's why we left him in the helicopter.

299
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,360
 And that might be the first ghost flasher that we've actually ever covered, or a ghost

300
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,840
 with some sort of bizarro hang-up.

301
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,200
 Like that, like he's still in the afterlife, still finding a lot of amusement, pulling

302
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,760
 his pants down in front of women, and exposing himself.

303
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,400
 I did tell you guys about this, but I'm going to repeat this story again.

304
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,700
 When I was in the Stanley Hotel, which was the hotel that inspired the shining, they

305
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:52,020
 had a closet that, I went on this ghost tour, and the tour guide was like, "Now everybody..."

306
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,740
 She was this really, really hot chick in this colonial outfit, but I'm going to make fun

307
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,020
 of her voice anyways.

308
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,500
 But people, here you go.

309
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,700
 Now she sounds like Rick or Morty, or both of them.

310
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,880
 There's a closet, okay?

311
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:17,600
 And if you go inside, there's a creepy old, forget the voice, she explains to us that

312
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,680
 there's a closet in this room where there's this randy old ghost who will like, feel up

313
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,400
 women if you go in there.

314
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,920
 And she goes, "Any volunteers?

315
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,600
 Any woman want to go into this dark room and be groped by this supernatural spirit?"

316
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,960
 Now I'm sitting there, and I'm like, "This is fake, obviously."

317
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,060
 And so the woman goes, "Any volunteers?"

318
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,820
 And this girl, this girl, she's probably about 12, goes, "I'll do it."

319
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,940
 And the demeanor of the tour guide completely changed, and she looks straight at the girl

320
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,620
 and she goes, "You have to be 18 to go into the room."

321
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
 Any volunteers?

322
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,780
 And we're like, "What in the world?"

323
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,220
 So that makes me think, and I think I explained, I did an episode on the Stanley Hotel.

324
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,740
 It was on my birthday episode last year.

325
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:06,280
 But anyways, so we do have records or stories, is probably a better word, of these spirits

326
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,840
 who have these weird type of hang-ups.

327
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,120
 But I wanted to expose you, unattended to this one, and you're like, "Boo, boo, you're

328
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,080
 holding me down, you're shoving caffeine right into my throat."

329
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,440
 So you guys carry my lifeless body in a Christ-like pose, back to the helicopter, throwing the

330
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,520
 back, turn the heater on, fly me to the hospital, five and a half hours later.

331
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,060
 I'm sitting in the hospital.

332
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
 You guys are like, "Are you ready to go?

333
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
 Are you done?"

334
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
 I'm like, "Hold on, hold on."

335
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,220
 So let me get this straight.

336
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,540
 Dom Toretto turned against the family because his girlfriend, and you're like, "No, shut

337
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,660
 the movie up, shut the movie up."

338
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,500
 You guys pull me out of the hospital room, I'm like, "No, no, no, wait, I need to see

339
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,700
 more of Hobbes and Shaw before their own spin-off movie."

340
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,500
 You guys dragged me out of the hospital room.

341
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,980
 We are going to one last place here.

342
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:05,080
 We are going to Sonoma County.

343
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,960
 Flying through the night sky, rotor blades cutting clouds.

344
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
 Don't think that happens.

345
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,760
 Caribers, caribers are getting knocked out of their house.

346
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,360
 I'm like, "Casey, fly through those clouds."

347
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,080
 You're like, "But isn't that carillon?"

348
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,280
 I'm like, "Fly through those clouds.

349
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,400
 These rainbows are getting destroyed."

350
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,480
 There's a little, there's a caribbean with no legs.

351
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
 He's like, "Why?

352
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
 Why?"

353
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
 "I don't care about that.

354
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
 Blood going everywhere."

355
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
 Anyways, we eventually land the helicopter.

356
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
 Casey's like, "Oh, my childhood heroes.

357
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
 I really loved Cheryl Ott Baer."

358
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:45,380
 I'm like, "Yes, you can share in the misery of losing all of his friends now."

359
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,380
 Seenol takes his son home.

360
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,380
 He's like, "That's son relieving."

361
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,380
 Casey's like, "I'm so sorry.

362
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,380
 I'm so sorry, caribers."

363
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,300
 Anyways, no, they come back.

364
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,300
 They come back.

365
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,300
 They're good people.

366
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,280
 They go over it very quickly because he doesn't know who the caribers are.

367
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
 He's like, "What's a caribbear?"

368
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,880
 I've never even heard of that before.

369
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,280
 If he was flying through like bay blades or something, he'd probably be more emotionally

370
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
 raw.

371
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,880
 Anyways, we're going to a couple places.

372
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,140
 These are going to be brief.

373
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,280
 These are all from Backpackerverse.

374
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,360
 So we're going to end on the absurdity.

375
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,560
 I guess I should say this for new listeners.

376
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,040
 Backpackerverse is a stupid website that just makes up stuff about ghosts.

377
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,360
 You're like, "Jason, are you really going to do this?"

378
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
 "Yes, I'm going to do this.

379
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,340
 I almost died yesterday.

380
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
 Let's talk about this."

381
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,440
 We're in Backpackerverse.

382
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,260
 This is from the website or this is from the webpage, "10 Sonoma County Hiking Trails

383
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,820
 with Insane Paranormal Activity."

384
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,220
 First off, we're going to Laguna de Santa Rosa Trail.

385
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,220
 Let me read.

386
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,420
 I'm going to read this to you because that's the best way to explain this stuff because

387
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,700
 then you go, "Jason, you're just making stuff up."

388
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,980
 I'm like, "No, let me read exactly what they wrote to you.

389
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,980
 Beware.

390
00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:02,960
 You might encounter someone wandering aimlessly in the middle of the woods and that someone

391
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,500
 is not necessarily a human being.

392
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:15,240
 Numerous stories have reported the bizarre sighting of a body roaming while bending mid-waste."

393
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:22,200
 What does that even mean?

394
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,600
 What in the world does that even mean?

395
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:32,580
 Does that mean, honestly, that somebody walking down the trail saw another human roaming around

396
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:40,900
 bent over and assumed that was not a human being or, sorry, not necessarily a human being?

397
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:46,460
 Because if that's the case, if that is the litmus test we use for the paranormal, then

398
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,860
 the world is surrounded by ghosts.

399
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,440
 You can go to any place where there's a penny on the ground and someone's like, "Oh, no,

400
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,320
 the invasion has begun."

401
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,360
 Go to an old folks home.

402
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,000
 Just walk by a yoga studio and see a bunch of people bent over.

403
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,280
 When this guy walks by the yoga studio, he thinks it's full of ghosts.

404
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,480
 He thinks paranormal activity 8 is taking place.

405
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
 There's a bunch of people bent over.

406
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,520
 Maybe it was crawling, but again, that was it.

407
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,600
 That was the end of the story.

408
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,120
 There was more to it, but that was the end of it.

409
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,340
 The more didn't explain any of that.

410
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,300
 Now let's go to Pick Me Forest Trail at Salt Point State Park.

411
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,900
 Let me read this verbatim to you.

412
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,940
 Because I think it has a great setup.

413
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,980
 There is a little known story, i.e. I just made it up for the sake of this article.

414
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:40,580
 There is a little known story of a small girl who looked exactly like the doll she owned.

415
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,580
 Then I was like, "Ooh, cool.

416
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,980
 A story about a girl turning into a doll or the doll wanting a twin sister or the doll

417
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,880
 is her twin sister.

418
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
 Trapped."

419
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
 That's what I'm thinking.

420
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:58,760
 Rumors say that years ago she got lost in the forest while carrying her doll.

421
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,720
 Oh, maybe the doll is going to help her find her way out.

422
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,960
 Or maybe when rescuers show up, there's two dolls.

423
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,080
 Or the doll takes over the girl so the girl is still trapped in the doll.

424
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
 Whatever.

425
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,680
 Let's move on to the quote.

426
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,680
 She never made it out and died alone.

427
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,500
 Now her spirit wanders the forest, doll in hand, seeking aid from hikers.

428
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,180
 Will you help her?

429
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,180
 What?

430
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,180
 Why?

431
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,900
 Why did you--that's the whole thing for that one.

432
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,500
 Why would you build up the fact that the doll looked like her?

433
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,620
 Am I wrong to be disappointed in that?

434
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,780
 A girl has a doll that looks exactly like her.

435
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,580
 She gets lost in the woods one night.

436
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,420
 And then she just never gets found and she still carries the doll around.

437
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,420
 That's stupid.

438
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,420
 That's dumb.

439
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,520
 That was so insulted by that one because it actually set it up to be kind of creepy.

440
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,040
 It could have said some people say that the doll is the kid.

441
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,280
 Okay, so maybe it's a little convoluted but let me refra--let me do this right now.

442
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,480
 There's a little known story of a girl who used to carry a doll around that looked just

443
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,080
 like her.

444
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,960
 And one day the girl got lost in the forest.

445
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,320
 A couple days later the little girl was found by rescuers.

446
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,260
 But she didn't have her doll.

447
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,020
 They didn't think anything of it.

448
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,500
 But when they brought the girl home to her mother, her mother swore, "That's not my

449
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,140
 daughter.

450
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
 That's not my daughter."

451
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
 Bam.

452
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,380
 There you go.

453
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,180
 What was that, like five, six sentences?

454
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,500
 It makes it a little more scary like you're thinking, "Did the doll possess her or did

455
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,780
 they change places?"

456
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
 Or whatever.

457
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,900
 Not.

458
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,980
 She still has the doll.

459
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,820
 She's--and I love this last--okay.

460
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,440
 How her spirit wanders the forest, doll in hand, seeking aid from hikers.

461
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
 Will you help her?

462
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
 Yes.

463
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
 Yes.

464
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,800
 If I am in the middle of the woods and a little girl shows up and says, "Oh my god, I haven't

465
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,160
 eaten anything in days.

466
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
 I've been lost.

467
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
 Will you help me?"

468
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
 I'll say like, "Yes, I will help you."

469
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,240
 What type of old--and it doesn't even say that she kills you if you don't help her or

470
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,880
 if you do help her or whatever.

471
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,680
 She's just a little--yes.

472
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,200
 Who reads that?

473
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,640
 It goes no way.

474
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,140
 Because even if it's a little ghost girl with a little creepy doll, you go, "Yeah, I'll

475
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,140
 help you."

476
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,380
 And you take her to the edge of the forest and she goes, "Thanks, stranger."

477
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
 And then she disappears.

478
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,500
 There you go.

479
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
 There you go.

480
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,180
 Now if they said she also has a collection of GI Joe action figures that are in the

481
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,980
 shapes of the hikers who tried helping her in the past, creepy.

482
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,540
 Again, then I go, "No, I don't want to help this girl because I don't want to turn into

483
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
 Shipwreck."

484
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,020
 Shipwreck was actually my favorite GI Joe character.

485
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
 So funny.

486
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,000
 This is episode of GI Joe about Shipwreck.

487
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,120
 And this is going to trip some of you guys out because this is a true Mandela thing or

488
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,520
 lost media however you want to put it.

489
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,200
 One of the best two-part episodes--I'll talk about this because this is my two-part episode--one

490
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,240
 of the best two-part episodes of GI Joe because they always did like five-part episodes and

491
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
 stuff like that.

492
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,800
 They added this episode--this totally fits with the podcast too, so I'm not just going

493
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
 off in a rant.

494
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,160
 This is an episode where Shipwreck, who was like the sailor GI Joe, so Shipwreck is involved

495
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,600
 in this huge battle against Cobra.

496
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
 And something happened.

497
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,880
 He gets knocked out or something like that.

498
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,680
 And then he wakes up, it's ten years later, and he goes, "Whoa, like what's up?"

499
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,880
 And he's like, "Have I been in a coma for ten years?"

500
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,380
 He said, "No, no, no, no, no.

501
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,660
 You've been in a coma for like three days actually.

502
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:33,020
 You did get injured in that battle, but then GI Joe actually defeated Cobra.

503
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,440
 And you're instrumental in that actually, but you've lost your memories.

504
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,320
 You just recently had this new head injury, and you've lost the last ten years of memories.

505
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,560
 You have a wife and a kid.

506
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,320
 I think he had two kids.

507
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
 And the world's at peace.

508
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,080
 Cobra is destroyed.

509
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,000
 And so he goes home and it's like this perfect suburban life, and he's like, "I don't remember

510
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 any of this."

511
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 This is a really good episode.

512
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,880
 He's like, "I don't remember any of this, but his beautiful wife, beautiful kids."

513
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,140
 And he's meeting other GI Joe's, and he starts to catch on.

514
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:12,700
 It's kind of a Truman Show type of thing that he is a prisoner.

515
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,740
 He starts to kind of figure out that this life is not real, that he's a prisoner, and

516
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,740
 it must have been Cobra who are trying to get information out of his head.

517
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,660
 Now his buddies are saying, "Shipwreck, no, you're going insane.

518
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,660
 Like you need to go to the doctor.

519
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,420
 Like this is reality.

520
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,420
 We've defeated Cobra."

521
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:39,200
 And he's like, "No, no, no, you guys, I know for a fact that something is not right here."

522
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,920
 And what happens is, I don't remember what the impetus is for him to finally realize that

523
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,600
 the everything is fake, but he decides to try to break out of town.

524
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,120
 And all of a sudden, like everything goes to chaos.

525
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,000
 And it did turn out that Cobra did kidnap him during that last battle and had created

526
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,820
 this whole world for him.

527
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,420
 It was on an island and gave him a fake family.

528
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:10,420
 But the people on the islands were basically like bio robots.

529
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,500
 So when they were killed, they would melt.

530
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,140
 And it was like their eyeballs would fall out of their head and they would look like

531
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,260
 an action figure was being lit on fire.

532
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,280
 They would just kind of melt.

533
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:29,420
 And at the ending, he still hasn't fully grasped how many bio androids are on this island.

534
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,900
 He goes home to get his wife and his kids.

535
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,240
 Because he's still having a hard time starting this out.

536
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,980
 And they both pull, all the kids have these automatic rifles and his wife has this automatic

537
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,240
 rifle and they're going to shoot him and a fire breaks out.

538
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,280
 Now this is the thing.

539
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,400
 The first time they aired the episode is different than every other airing of the episode.

540
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,160
 Because I love this, it was one of my favorite episodes of G.I. Joe.

541
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,040
 I just thought it was a great storytelling thing.

542
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,320
 And I saw it back like in '85.

543
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,560
 So I was like nine years old and it's just like blowing my mind that this story is going

544
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,600
 on.

545
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:13,160
 But in the original viewing of it that I remembered, a fire breaks out in the house and the bio

546
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,160
 androids of his family have rifles on them and they melt.

547
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,520
 He watches his wife and kids melt in front of them and their eyeballs fall out of their

548
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,480
 heads and he's like, "No, he's totally freaking out that they just melt."

549
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,160
 Like they were going to kill him.

550
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,040
 But the fire got to him first and you're just watching these two kids and this wife that

551
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,900
 he thought that were real, really up to that point, melt.

552
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,680
 And the episode ends with the Joe's laying siege to the island because they figure it

553
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,640
 out and they save him and he's just like heartbroken.

554
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
 He just can't.

555
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,840
 He's still trying to figure out.

556
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,640
 Because he was on this island for a while.

557
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
 It wasn't like two days.

558
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,520
 He was on this island for a good amount of time and he was being told, "Oh no, you've

559
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,400
 been here for 10 years or whatever."

560
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,200
 Really really good episode of the Evin 1980s cartoon.

561
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,960
 GI Joe had a couple episodes that I think that was probably the best episode of GI Joe.

562
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,880
 They did tell some really good stories but yeah.

563
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,720
 Why am I talking about that?

564
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,680
 What were we talking about?

565
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,520
 Talking about saving a little girl from...

566
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
 Oh!

567
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
 Oh!

568
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
 Appearing as a GI Joe character.

569
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
 Yes, yes.

570
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,040
 Shipwreck was actually one of my favorites after.

571
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,600
 So I'd be happy to appear as Shipwreck.

572
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,000
 He was actually one of my favorites I think before that show.

573
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 I really like that character.

574
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,800
 Anyways, everyone's just sitting in the forest.

575
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,160
 The little girl with her dolls just sitting there super bored.

576
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:40,000
 She's like, "Okay boomer, we don't care about your 80s cartoons and your caribbean references."

577
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 I'm like, "Ugh."

578
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,760
 So anyways, I'm like, "Okay girl, you can head back to the forest."

579
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
 She's like, "Thank you.

580
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,680
 I will head back to my eternal torment as long as I don't have to hear about 80s cartoons

581
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
 anymore."

582
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,480
 80s cartoons were great by the way.

583
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,040
 So better than your slug-tara nowadays.

584
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,960
 But anyways, so we're walking through...

585
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,600
 We're leaving there.

586
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,680
 We're going to our last trip on our special episode.

587
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,040
 Halfway to hell special episode.

588
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,520
 Thanks Krispy Bacon for making me realize the significance of 333.

589
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,400
 So we are headed off to our last destination of our special episode of Dead Rapper Radio.

590
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,440
 We are going to West County Regional Trail, Sebasto Pole.

591
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,840
 That's in California apparently.

592
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,840
 Sebasto Pole.

593
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
 Stupid name.

594
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,640
 Anyways, West County Regional Trail.

595
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,640
 No nothing about the place.

596
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
 Just dumb name.

597
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,040
 Don't want to go there.

598
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,480
 West County Regional Trail.

599
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,800
 Again, I just got to read you this quote.

600
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,880
 Because you can't say it any better than this.

601
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,120
 But while I'm reading you this quote, I want you to imagine we're going on this journey

602
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,320
 together.

603
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:50,720
 So "Cold night air through the very famous haunted forest of Sebasto Pole."

604
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,200
 Everyone knows about Sebasto Pole.

605
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,960
 "Marked by a wooden bridge."

606
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,120
 I don't know why there's a whistle there, but there was.

607
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,440
 There's a little slide whistle there.

608
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,680
 Marked by a wooden bridge.

609
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:14,640
 It takes you on a short journey into the mesmerizing horrors of old structures.

610
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,640
 Who knows what you will find under the piles of rotten wood.

611
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,040
 So we're walking through this.

612
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,120
 We cross the old creaky bridge.

613
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,400
 I reach for the slide whistle.

614
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
 You're like, "No, that joke."

615
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
 It's dumb the first time.

616
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,400
 Don't do it again.

617
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,400
 I'm like, "Oh."

618
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,520
 We walk off the bridge.

619
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,120
 We go on a short journey into the mesmerizing horrors.

620
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,400
 We're like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, tripping out.

621
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,880
 You're like, "Chasing, chasing.

622
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,880
 That's an acid plant.

623
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,880
 Don't touch it.

624
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,880
 I'm all tripping out.

625
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,880
 Oh."

626
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,040
 Anyways, we're walking through the woods and we see old structures.

627
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,800
 So old, spooky, broke down buildings.

628
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,040
 Just wood everywhere.

629
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,520
 Which is what forests normally have in them.

630
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,840
 But this is processed wood.

631
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,920
 This is cut and planks of wood.

632
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
 And then what was it?

633
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
 Oh, yeah.

634
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,680
 The next part was, "What will we find under piles of rotten wood?"

635
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,680
 So brown recluses.

636
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,800
 Maybe the body of a homeless man.

637
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
 Who knows?

638
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
 Probably those two things.

639
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,800
 Or both.

640
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
 And then we get to this last sentence.

641
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,280
 This might actually be one of the best sentences I've ever read involving the paranormal.

642
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,200
 If not one of the best sentences I've ever read, period.

643
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,800
 So move out of the way.

644
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,160
 I mean, we have backpackers.

645
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,840
 We're walking through this forest late at night.

646
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,160
 We see a pile of rotten wood.

647
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,960
 We're moving it aside.

648
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,160
 And then we have this quote.

649
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,960
 Some hikers report a strange apparition.

650
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,080
 Just the first part, which we need to figure out.

651
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,360
 A face without a body.

652
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,000
 So some hikers report a strange apparition, a face without a body.

653
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,520
 Now you go, "Jason, that's not unusual."

654
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,560
 Okay, but here's the thing.

655
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,000
 Is it a head or is it just a face?

656
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,200
 I would assume because of the terminology it's simply the face and not a head.

657
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,680
 But wouldn't you just be able to say a face?

658
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
 Like a floating face?

659
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,520
 Why do you have to add without the body?

660
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,760
 That's how all faces are.

661
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,160
 There's nothing unusual about that.

662
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,100
 You're going, "Jason, you're getting totally into the weeds on this one."

663
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,040
 This is why this is important.

664
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,120
 Because it's obvious it doesn't have a body from the rest of the sentence.

665
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,920
 It's almost like they got paid by the word and they wanted that.

666
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,720
 They get paid a penny every word.

667
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,740
 They wanted that extra three cents.

668
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,280
 Because they did not need the term without a body because of what comes after this.

669
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,000
 Removing the wood around, we go back to the sentence.

670
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,240
 Some hikers report a strange apparition.

671
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:56,760
 A face without a body stitched into the headrest of a brown leather chair.

672
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,520
 Okay, so now you see why.

673
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:08,360
 First off, first off, that's not true.

674
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,560
 That never has happened in the history of the world.

675
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,480
 At no point has ever anyone moved a log.

676
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,840
 Seeing a pile of rotting wood began moving the rotting wood and found a brown leather

677
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,840
 chair.

678
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,000
 That part is untrue, totally.

679
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,760
 Secondly, removing the wood and then seeing a human face stitched into a brown leather

680
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,760
 chair.

681
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,840
 Without a body, by the way, because that would just be someone sitting in a chair.

682
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,960
 What is the point of this apparition?

683
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,600
 What is the point of being a ghost if people have to remove garbage to find you?

684
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,360
 That's not really even a ghost.

685
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,560
 That is, okay, here's the thing.

686
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
 Let's play our game.

687
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:52,800
 This is either completely made up, it is completely made up, but let's say that the story is true.

688
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,880
 Let's figure out what it is.

689
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,800
 If you were a ghost, you would be like, "Woo, floating around."

690
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,480
 Maybe you're trapped in a particular location, but unless this guy died in a lazy boy factory

691
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:13,960
 and he possessed the body of a brown leather chair, there is no way also, let's talk about

692
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,960
 this too.

693
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,720
 There is no way that a brown leather chair would survive more than a few nights under

694
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,560
 a pile of rotting wood in the middle of a forest.

695
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,160
 It would be completely trashed.

696
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,160
 So you're like, "Taste this neither here nor there.

697
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,160
 We're talking about ghosts."

698
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,060
 My point is that you're a ghost.

699
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,280
 Are you really going to be a ghost under garbage?

700
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,760
 Wouldn't that be the most ridiculous place to just be a ghost?

701
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,480
 Two, let's say that it's my worst nightmare.

702
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:47,040
 Let's say that a man was magically transformed into a lawn chair, or a leather chair, a big

703
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,840
 old recliner.

704
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,760
 And I hate, I've talked about that, I hate stories where people are transformed into

705
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,680
 stuff against their will.

706
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,120
 So this guy is turned into a brown leather chair.

707
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,360
 The thing that scares me about that is that you're transforming into something and you're

708
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,960
 just sitting there and you're observing the world around you.

709
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,960
 That locked-in disease doesn't really scare me as much because you're still like a human,

710
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,400
 but like if you had locked-in disease and you were an ottoman or you were like a lazy

711
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,640
 boy, that terrifies me.

712
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,040
 So he's trapped in the form of a recliner.

713
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,440
 I'm assuming it's a recliner.

714
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,000
 In the middle of nowhere.

715
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,360
 But and then he could like watch the birds fly around and be like, "Oh, I wish I could

716
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,360
 pet those birds.

717
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,440
 I wish I was fast enough to catch a bird to pet it."

718
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,320
 It doesn't scare me if you're covered, again, if you're covered in garbage, because then

719
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,240
 you don't know what's going on in the outside world.

720
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,240
 You can't influence it anyways.

721
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
 You're just a leather chair covered in garbage.

722
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
 So you are a garbage ghost.

723
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,240
 That might be the worst ghost.

724
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,240
 That might be the worst ghost we've ever covered.

725
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:50,240
 Now, I'm sure someone could email me and show me a worst ghost, but being a ghost in the

726
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,240
 middle of nowhere, that's spooky, actually.

727
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:58,240
 Little girl ghost walking around with a doll can be spooky, but at least she's mobile.

728
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,240
 At least she can like follow you and when you're in your tent a little like, you see the zipper

729
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,240
 move up a little bit and you see like a little eye poke out.

730
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,240
 Like look out from underneath the flap and you first you just think, "Oh, maybe that was

731
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,240
 a deer.

732
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,240
 Maybe a deer got super close and evolved thumbs and undid the zipper."

733
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,240
 But you would like brush it off and then in the middle of the night you'd be on your

734
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,240
 cell phone late at night and the blue glow would be filling up the tent and you would

735
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,240
 think you see like the outline of something outside your tent.

736
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,240
 You're like, "Ah, the deer's back."

737
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,240
 But then you realize it's like only four feet tall and happen to be carrying a two foot

738
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:38,240
 tall version of itself and then in the morning you wake up and your own kid is missing and

739
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
 there's a doll that looks exactly like your kid.

740
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
 You're like, "Ah, it sucks.

741
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
 What are we going to do with this dumb doll?"

742
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,240
 That's scary.

743
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,240
 I mean obviously that involves child abduction, but any part of that, the little girl looking

744
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,240
 in your tent or seeing something run by your tent, obviously your child being replaced by

745
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,240
 a doll, all that stuff's scary.

746
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,240
 Now you're camping in the middle of the night and you're like, "Oh, I'm going to go and

747
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,240
 go."

748
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,240
 You're camping in the middle of the woods and 50 feet away from you is a pile of garbage

749
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,240
 and the wind blows and you think you see something outside your tent and you look and it's just

750
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,240
 a pile of garbage 50 feet away.

751
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,240
 It's no big deal.

752
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,240
 You're like, "I should have probably picked a different camping spot," but whatever.

753
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,240
 And then later on the night they're kind of on your phone flipping around and you think

754
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
 you see something move outside but you're wrong.

755
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
 You're just tired.

756
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
 You're just saying stuff.

757
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,240
 And then next morning you wake up and you pack all your gear up and leave.

758
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,240
 And your kid's totally fine.

759
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,240
 You're like, "There's not a little brown leather chair with your kid's face on it."

760
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
 You're like, "No, this sucks."

761
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,240
 You just leave with your kid.

762
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,240
 There's a pile of garbage that nobody ever looks in.

763
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,240
 What hiker, let me just say this to you and I'm sorry, I might be being a dead orgy.

764
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,240
 What hiker is like, "Hmm, what a beautiful nature romp."

765
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,240
 I love nature.

766
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,240
 Ooh, pile of garbage.

767
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,240
 Let me start rooting through this until they find a brown leather chair with a human, not

768
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:03,240
 a body, a face without a body stitched into the headrest of a brown leather chair.

769
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:11,240
 That is our tour of spooky, spooky, little asterisks next to those, ghosts, asterisks next to that

770
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,240
 one as well, of California.

771
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,240
 Now, I want to end this episode with, again, a thank you to you guys for all your support

772
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,240
 and all your love.

773
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:33,240
 I find it so bizarre that less, the show started in June of 2018.

774
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,240
 So we're a little over a year later.

775
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,240
 And I've been to the ER before and I've had issues where I've had to go there and I've

776
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,240
 sat in that room for an hour or two or more while I'm getting tests done and things like

777
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,240
 that and then they come back and say, "Oh, it's just an anxiety attack."

778
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,240
 Or, "Your ankle's not broken."

779
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:58,240
 But never have I sat in that hospital and been able to laugh at all of the great comments

780
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,240
 and feel very proud of all the support you guys have given me.

781
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,240
 This show's really changed my life.

782
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,240
 Like, I was thinking about that.

783
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
 I was like, "This is really awesome.

784
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,240
 Like, this is a community of people."

785
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,240
 And I really want to make sure that you guys know how much you mean to me.

786
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,240
 You guys really do mean a lot to me.

787
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,240
 And that's why I wanted to get this episode out, not feel in 100% still,

788
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,240
 but I wanted to get this episode out for you guys, just to acknowledge how much you guys mean to me.

789
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,240
 This show's really changed my life.

790
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,240
 And I'll end it with this.

791
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,240
 I almost didn't do the podcast.

792
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,240
 We've talked about this a couple of times.

793
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,240
 Like, I was a writer before this and I had some other projects before this.

794
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,240
 And I just kind of fell into this one day.

795
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,240
 And I implore you guys to find those projects that are going to change your lives as well.

796
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,240
 You may fail a couple of times.

797
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,240
 I failed a couple of times in other projects.

798
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,240
 But find that thing that will change your life.

799
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,240
 That sounds like a big goal.

800
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,240
 And you may not know what it is at first, but find that thing so...

801
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,240
 a year later, when you're feeling down and you're not feeling good,

802
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,240
 you have that community around you.

803
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,240
 And to let you guys know that you guys do have this community around you as well.

804
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,240
 But, um, yeah, find that thing if you can.

805
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,240
 Because it's weird.

806
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,240
 I mean, again, my life has radically changed since I started doing this show.

807
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:27,240
 And I really, really appreciate all you guys, all your support, all your love, all your jokes.

808
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,240
 But it also wasn't Veronica the Honenthal had nothing to do with this.

809
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,240
 It's totally fine.

810
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,240
 I love you guys.

811
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,240
