00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of... nope, that's not true.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.800
 So I forgot to inform you guys that Vampire Week was actually the end of season 6, then

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.840
 I was going to take a week-long break.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.360
 But I didn't, and then I thought, well, you know, I'll just record another week's worth

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.920
 of episodes after working three jobs.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.280
 I just didn't have time to do the research to prolong this season for an extra week.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.120
 And that was my bad.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.680
 Sorry about that, guys.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.400
 But I don't have... I don't have episodes for this week.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.680
 I don't have any episodes for this week.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.560
 Now, again, I thought about I could bust out five more episodes, but I don't think they...

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.360
 I think they would be pretty lackluster.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.680
 I think they'd be really rushed.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.840
 So they just didn't get any research done.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.920
 So there we go.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.280
 So it sounds kind of dour, I get it.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.320
 This isn't the end of... This is actually kind of a depressing update.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.720
 This isn't the end of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.280
 This is a normal thing.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.360
 You've listened to the show for a while, I take a break every 50 episodes, and we're

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.960
 there right now.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.920
 We're a couple episodes shy, but...

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.200
 So yes, no Dead Rabbit Radio this week.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 Sorry, guys.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.960
 I'm probably going to make this little more upbeat.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.920
 Maybe I'll put some, like, upbeat music underneath this so it's not so depressing.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 But maybe not.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.120
 I'm also super tired.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.520
 And we got some new Patreons, but all the dress shows are in an actual episode.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.640
 We're kind of lame to address them just during an update.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.760
 But all my Patreons should be getting a special little surprise shortly.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.960
 Very, very shortly.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.680
 So I will be back next week.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 What is that?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 September...

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.560
 I don't even know what today is.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.040
 Today's the 7th.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.640
 We'll be back September 15th, 16th, that week.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640
 So next week!

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.040
 See you guys soon.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.480
 And watch out for vampires.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.440
 And see if I have enough effort to go find some funny music for you.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.440
 Probably not.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 Probably not.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 Have a great week, guys!

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.720
 That isn't a good outro.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.400
 I'm going to have a great week off.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.360
 I hope you guys have a great week as well.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.960
 See you later!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 Bye!

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.540
 (upbeat music)

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.120
 (upbeat music)

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.700
 (upbeat music)

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.280
 (upbeat music)

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.860
 (upbeat music)

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.440
 (upbeat music)

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.020
 (upbeat music)

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:39.020
