00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of... nope, that's not true.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,800
 So I forgot to inform you guys that Vampire Week was actually the end of season 6, then

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,840
 I was going to take a week-long break.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,360
 But I didn't, and then I thought, well, you know, I'll just record another week's worth

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,920
 of episodes after working three jobs.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,280
 I just didn't have time to do the research to prolong this season for an extra week.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,120
 And that was my bad.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,680
 Sorry about that, guys.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,400
 But I don't have... I don't have episodes for this week.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,680
 I don't have any episodes for this week.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,560
 Now, again, I thought about I could bust out five more episodes, but I don't think they...

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,360
 I think they would be pretty lackluster.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,680
 I think they'd be really rushed.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,840
 So they just didn't get any research done.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,920
 So there we go.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,280
 So it sounds kind of dour, I get it.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,320
 This isn't the end of... This is actually kind of a depressing update.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,720
 This isn't the end of Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,280
 This is a normal thing.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,360
 You've listened to the show for a while, I take a break every 50 episodes, and we're

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,960
 there right now.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,920
 We're a couple episodes shy, but...

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,200
 So yes, no Dead Rabbit Radio this week.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
 Sorry, guys.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,960
 I'm probably going to make this little more upbeat.

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,920
 Maybe I'll put some, like, upbeat music underneath this so it's not so depressing.

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
 But maybe not.

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,120
 I'm also super tired.

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,520
 And we got some new Patreons, but all the dress shows are in an actual episode.

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,640
 We're kind of lame to address them just during an update.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,760
 But all my Patreons should be getting a special little surprise shortly.

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,960
 Very, very shortly.

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,680
 So I will be back next week.

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
 What is that?

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
 September...

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,560
 I don't even know what today is.

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,040
 Today's the 7th.

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,640
 We'll be back September 15th, 16th, that week.

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
 So next week!

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,040
 See you guys soon.

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,480
 And watch out for vampires.

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,440
 And see if I have enough effort to go find some funny music for you.

43
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
 Probably not.

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
 Probably not.

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
 Have a great week, guys!

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,720
 That isn't a good outro.

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,400
 I'm going to have a great week off.

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,360
 I hope you guys have a great week as well.

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,960
 See you later!

50
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
 Bye!

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,540
 (upbeat music)

52
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,120
 (upbeat music)

53
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,700
 (upbeat music)

54
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,280
 (upbeat music)

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,860
 (upbeat music)

56
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,440
 (upbeat music)

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,020
 (upbeat music)

58
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:39,020
