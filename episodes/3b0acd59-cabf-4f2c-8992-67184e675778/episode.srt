00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:05,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
 Carpenter and I'm having a great day!

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,760
 I can barely say that with a straight face, but I hope you guys are having a great day

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,040
 and I hope you guys can say it with a straight face.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,320
 It's so hot in here, I'm recording in the haunted closet, that's not like the name of

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,880
 a studio, I'm recording in the literal haunted closet.

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:28,680
 I gotta run my AC and shut it off, come into a place where the dead has not departed to

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,600
 record this podcast for you, the temperature goes up immediately.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,480
 I don't even know why I bother running the AC for an hour before recording each episode,

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,680
 but I'm here for you guys.

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,920
 You know who else is here for us, he never leaves us alone, he's always hanging out in

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,320
 the most convenient part of our body.

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
 Is there an inconvenient part of the bunny?

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,280
 Stick your finger up your nose.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,520
 I want you to pick out our newest Patreon supporter, it's Bougas!

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,880
 Everyone give a round of applause to Bougas, you pull him out, he's like, he's like, that's

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,320
 not what my name means, I'm not saying I'm a booger, I don't know, Bougas, maybe it's

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,720
 like a ghost of a guy named Gus, that's probably a little less disgusting, so pick your nose,

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,240
 pull out a booger, name it Gus, Bougas, you are gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode,

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,760
 if you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys aren't a booger, that's preferable,

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,960
 but just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot, I actually

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,280
 didn't say that in the last episode with Robert Reith, he was the village person dressed

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,680
 up as a carpenter, if you're not a village person, if you don't have a sexy carpenter

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,840
 outfit like Robert Reith or you're not a booger like Bougas, totally fine, both are

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,520
 preferable if you're not those things, just help spread the word about the show really,

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,800
 it really helps out a lot, Robert Reith, we're waving goodbye to him as he fades away like

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,360
 a forced ghost, and Bougas, we're gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible,

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,320
 we're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, take your salty gooey hands, put them all

36
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,720
 over the controls for the next person as to why they're Durgible, we are leaving behind

37
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,760
 Dead Rabbit Command, we are headed out to a courthouse, we got a court date dude, this

38
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,280
 kind of sucks, so the other day a Patreon, I'm not gonna say who it was, was driving

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,160
 the Jason Jalopy a little too fast, a little too wild, got a traffic ticket, now because

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,680
 we're all fluffle because we're all a family of rabbits, we all have to attend the court

41
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,600
 hearing and we're here in court, well while we're in this courthouse, we're gonna fight

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,520
 this speeding ticket, we get an elevator, ding, and listen man, I've been to court a

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,600
 couple times myself and I've had friends who've gone to court, everyone's miserable,

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,720
 every single person at the courthouse is miserable, the person working in the cafeteria is miserable,

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,560
 the judges are miserable, it's not a great place to be, I was in court, I was in court

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:51,080
 when I ran into a solar plexus clown glider, it's a bad place, interdimensional creatures

47
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,080
 hang out in court rooms, I'll put that episode in the show notes, but you don't want to

48
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,800
 go to court or have anything to do with court or watch the show night court, actually that

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,320
 show's pretty funny, I can't make a joke about that being bad, we're in this courthouse,

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,080
 you just want to get this speeding ticket taken care of, this very long introduction

51
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,280
 for three very short stories, but we want to get this speeding ticket taken care of,

52
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,640
 we're in this elevator, now we know every time this door opens a weirdo's gonna get

53
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,720
 inside, because that's how the story is framed, and that's what happens in real courthouses,

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:31,200
 ding, elevator door opens, and inside steps, oh good, this guy's actually a US Marshal,

55
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,320
 his name is David Timothy Moon and we're like oh what do you hear for and he's like oh you

56
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,760
 know I'm a US Marshal so I like do Marshal stuff, and we're like okay that makes sense,

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,840
 maybe he'll protect us for the rest of this adventure that we're on, this very linear,

58
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,040
 this very vertical adventure we're on, we go up another story, ding, the elevator opens

59
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,800
 up, this is so confusing, the elevator opens up, and inside steps Ronnie Lou Helton, he's

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,360
 73 year old man, so we see this old man walk in, he looks like the dude from up, he just

61
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,960
 kind of saunters in, and so we know where the Marshal's here, he's obviously working,

62
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,280
 we ask hey Ronnie what are you here for, and he turns to us and he says, so the other

63
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,680
 day this is totally blown out of proportion, and everything I'm about to say is alleged,

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,320
 because I haven't been found guilty of anything yet, but on April 7th, 2021, so very recently,

65
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,640
 I was minding my business in Corbin, Kentucky, and I was walking through a neighbor, I don't

66
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,440
 want to tell this story from his point of view, it's going to sound super creepy because

67
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,280
 I have to keep saying I did this stuff, so this dude named Ronnie Lou Helton was living

68
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,160
 in Corbin, Kentucky, and he's walking down the street, he's walking through the Gordon

69
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,560
 Hill Pike neighborhood, it's 4pm, this is prime time to be like hanging out, doing

70
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,280
 little kid stuff, playing with GI Joes or Paw Patrol or whatever kids play with these

71
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,120
 days, there's a little 3 year old boy in the backyard, look at me grandma, I'm a 3 year

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,000
 old boy, I don't have imagination yet, I don't know if I'm a jet or a knight, the

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,360
 grandma's like oh great, this kid's going to be a struggle, 3 year old boy's running

74
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,640
 around his grandma's backyard, now Ronnie is walking through the neighborhood and he

75
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,160
 has predator vision, not predator vision like heat vision, literal sexual predator vision,

76
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,160
 he's like he just sees normal, he just sees normal, there's no red heat signature, but

77
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,560
 it's just creepier, he sees this 3 year old boy running in the backyard, and he walks

78
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,000
 up to the fence, hey how would you like to come over the fence Ronnie says, and the boy

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,320
 is like probably not, and Ronnie reaches over the fence, grabs the boy's hand and starts

80
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:42,240
 to lead him along the fence line, now Ronnie is a short man, Ronnie is about 5 foot 1,

81
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,720
 and the boy is 3 years old so he's obviously short, so we're talking like a picket fence,

82
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,640
 but Ronnie is really not tall enough to reach over and grab the boy, but he noticed there's

83
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,640
 a part where the ground on the boy's side of the fence kind of lumps up, and the fence

84
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,680
 is technically shorter at that point, so he's leading the boy over to this lump, and he

85
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,040
 means to pick the boy up and run away with him, as this is going on, the grandma who's

86
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,440
 supposed to be babysitting this kid looks out and sees Ronnie leading this kid down the

87
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,240
 fence line and she goes let go of my son, I mean not my grandson, let go of my grandson,

88
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,640
 she's easily confused, Ronnie let's go with the boy, the boy runs deeper into the safety

89
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,560
 of the yard, now stranger abductions, they're super rare, they do happen, they're terrifying,

90
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,040
 but that's not even the end of this incident, to make it even creepier, I mean this is like

91
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,520
 4pm, it's so casual, you have to think that this guy has done this before, allegedly, he

92
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,960
 then yells to the grandmother quote "I'll give you a thousand dollars for this little

93
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,840
 boy" unquote, that's really creepy, the fact that he knew that he had a number, he's probably

94
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,880
 in the past been like "I'll give you $750" and they're like "no dice" and they run

95
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,200
 away and he's like "hmm maybe I should up it next time", he's obviously, he's obviously

96
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,480
 done this enough times to know a thousand dollars is the sweet spot, he yells out "I'll

97
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,680
 give you a thousand dollars for this boy", they say no, like you should, and the guy

98
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,280
 then turns and gets in his car, which was just parked right there, they get his license plate

99
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
 number, they turn it over to the cops, the guy's arrested, he's actually charged with

100
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,680
 attempted kidnapping and because he yelled out a price, he actually got charged with

101
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,720
 human trafficking as well, we're standing in this elevator here with this man who tried

102
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,520
 to abduct a 3 year old boy and then offered a thousand dollar price tag for the boy, and

103
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,280
 it's so funny because if it was just the kidnapping, I probably wouldn't even cover

104
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,680
 it, I'm like "poorine, who tried to kidnap a 3 year old out of a yard, ugh" call me

105
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,200
 later when you find out the old man's really a skin walker or something interesting, the

106
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,680
 fact that he's yelling out a price makes it so chilling to me, he's probably bought

107
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,920
 kids before, allegedly, there's a US Marshal in this elevator, gotta be careful what I

108
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,880
 say legally, but it's just creepy, and the fact that he thought the grandma would go

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,480
 "you almost tried stealing my grandson, but now that you offered me a thousand dollars,

110
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,400
 come in for some tea, let's talk" no, he's awaiting some serious, serious charges, so

111
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,320
 we're now in this elevator with this man who tried kidnapping this little kid, that's

112
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,920
 not cool, ding, it's more than uncool, it's disgusting, but the elevator, we're still

113
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,000
 stuck in it, ding, the door opens up, another man gets on, into the elevator steps, Kevin

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,480
 Wayne Van Levin, he's a 59 year old home inspector, and we go "hey, we didn't learn

115
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,000
 our lesson by asking the first guy what he was in for, we asked this guy what are you

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,360
 in for?" and he goes "oh man, you guys won't believe it, well you guys probably will, because

117
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,960
 there's video evidence of it, but this is my story" and then he does wavy lines and

118
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,680
 we're flashbacked into this memory of his, reluctantly, we do not want to be in this

119
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:07,600
 memory, it's March 12th, 2021, again, super recent, those chemtrails are finally starting

120
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,720
 to catch up with everyone and infecting their brains, we're in Oxford Township, Michigan,

121
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,240
 Kevin Wayne Van Levin is a home inspector and he is doing what his name implies, he's

122
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,320
 inspecting a home, he's looking at it and he goes "yeah, four walls, four walls, a

123
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,040
 ceiling, perfect, check that down, there does seem to be some sort of foundation or floor,

124
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,840
 yeah it's a floor, he's very very good at his job, he's very thorough, so when he's

125
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,440
 doing his home inspecting, the people whose home he's inspecting, they say "oh we're

126
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,360
 gonna go out and get a bite to eat, you do your thing" but when they did leave him they

127
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,480
 didn't expect what was gonna happen, but they had a video camera and so they're out grabbing

128
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,600
 a quick bite to eat and all of a sudden, their phone goes off, their tone goes off and it

129
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:05,320
 shows that they had movement in their baby's nursery and they're like "oh no, we forgot

130
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,280
 the baby, I don't know, he's a home inspector, he's walking around the home, why would you

131
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,480
 even care that motion sensors were going off?" it pops up on their phone that there's motion

132
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,440
 on the nursery and the mother she goes "I wasn't really bothered by it, but for

133
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,060
 some reason I decided to look at the video and this is the video we have, we see Kevin

134
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,240
 walk into the nursery, it's very very nice nursery, I didn't even know it was a nursery,

135
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,520
 doesn't have like the stereotypical crib and like the haunted rocking chair and stuffed

136
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,440
 animals, it looks more like some weird art deco room, so that baby's gonna have a real

137
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,480
 imaginative life, but anyways, it looks very Spartan as a nursery, this is now an interior

138
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,240
 design podcast, you wouldn't know it was a nursery, except for the fact that this man,

139
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,360
 Kevin picks up an Elmo doll, this Tickle Me Elmo doll and he is walking around with

140
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,720
 the Elmo doll and then he turns his back to the camera and he's kinda like in the closet

141
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:15,120
 now and he is humping Elmo and you go "Jason, how do you know?

142
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,280
 How do you know if he has his back to the camera and he's halfway in the closet?

143
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
 How can you tell?"

144
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:27,240
 Well you can tell right, you can tell from the motion of his arm and Elmo's moments

145
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,600
 of ecstasy, it's like "Oh Tickle Me Harder!"

146
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,240
 You can tell he's banging this doll, now he might have known there was a camera there,

147
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,840
 I really hope not, I hope he didn't know, he did turn his body enough that he was trying

148
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,520
 to conceal it from something, but not so much that you know right, when you see the arm

149
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,560
 kinda move in, not Elmo's arm but Kevin's arm and then you see Elmo smoking his cigarette

150
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:03,680
 afterwards, he uses this Elmo doll to masturbate on and then to make things worse, he puts

151
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,000
 the Elmo doll back where he found it.

152
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So the idea was that no one would be the wiser except for him and Elmo and there would just

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 be this soaking disgusting Elmo in the corner of this nursery.

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,400
 Well they were watching it, they were watching it live, they called the police, the police

155
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,200
 actually apparently according to this article I read on the mail online by Lauren Lewis,

156
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,640
 the police I believe got there as he was leaving and he said "Oh no no, I totally wasn't masturbating

157
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,040
 on it, how do you come back from that?"

158
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,720
 You're just standing there and two police officers show up and they're like "Hey are

159
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,480
 you Kevin Van Levin?"

160
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,200
 And he goes "Yeah, yeah that's me" and they go "Did you have sex with the devil?"

161
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,000
 You immediately would think "How did they know?

162
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,200
 How did they know you have red fur all over your crotch?"

163
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,680
 You go "How did they know?"

164
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,960
 You wouldn't think to come up with a cover story that quickly for that right?

165
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,480
 So he does though, apparently he's like "No no no, it was totally consensual.

166
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,880
 Elmo okay, want to meet?"

167
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,360
 He denies it, he totally denies it but then they say "Well there's video of you" and

168
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,680
 then he's like "Okay you caught me guys, you hold his hands out to me handcuffed" they're

169
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,800
 like "We don't want to touch your hands, we know what you're just doing."

170
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,960
 So he is facing, what was the, it was a weird mischief vandalism or misdemeanor, malicious

171
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,240
 vandalism and it carries like a two year sentence and I think because there's the sex angle

172
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,680
 to it.

173
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,240
 An odd part of his bond, he's not in jail right now, he's able to bond out one of his

174
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,200
 conditions of his bond is he can't be in a house that he doesn't own.

175
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,760
 That kind of makes him like a vampire right?

176
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,760
 Like he can't come in your house without special permission, there's this zombie apocalypse

177
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
 there like "Come in, come in!"

178
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,960
 He's like "I can't, the law doesn't allow it."

179
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,280
 But he goes and he hides in a toy factory, he's like "You guys wait there, they're in

180
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
 like a food supermarket."

181
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,080
 He's like "I'm gonna go to this stuffed animal factory."

182
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
 Woohoo!

183
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,520
 The apocalypse has done me right.

184
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,160
 I will have to say this though, the home, I thought this was very noble.

185
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,560
 He's a home inspector, he's in someone else's home, it's March 12th, 2021.

186
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,280
 As he's sexually assaulting Tickle Me Elmo, he's wearing a mask.

187
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,440
 He is very courteous of COVID restrictions.

188
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,240
 It's salute to you Kevin.

189
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,360
 Hats off to you.

190
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,320
 The fact that while you were committing this disgusting crime, you continued to wear a

191
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,080
 mask.

192
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,480
 He should be an example for us all.

193
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,720
 So there we go, we got two creepy stories from these weirdos, legend weirdos that we

194
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,200
 ran into this courthouse.

195
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,160
 But I said there was a trio of stories and we're looking around, I'm looking at you,

196
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,280
 I'm checking, have you been to Elmo recently?

197
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,560
 You have no fur on your crotch, good to go.

198
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,880
 Then we realized the grossest story has been here all along.

199
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,280
 The US Marshal, David Timothy Moon, has been lurking behind us the whole time.

200
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,080
 He wasn't lurking, we knew he was there.

201
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,760
 He was eating a ham sandwich, he's like, "Hey, I'm still here."

202
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:16,920
 May 2019, David Timothy Moon, 50 year old man, 24 year veteran of the US Marshals.

203
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,600
 This guy had a long career.

204
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,760
 He actually didn't even answer to the local deputy marshals in Phoenix, Arizona, which

205
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,400
 is where this story takes place.

206
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,600
 He, his bosses were in DC.

207
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,040
 This guy was a highfalutin dude.

208
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,680
 But even highfalutin US Marshals gotta buy houses.

209
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,760
 They have places to live.

210
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,960
 They don't live in yurts, they have to live in homes.

211
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:47,200
 So when US Marshal, David Timothy Moon, was house hunting, he's like, "Oh, this place

212
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
 looks great.

213
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
 The neighborhood looks awesome.

214
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,840
 I read that thing about home inspectors.

215
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,160
 They're supposed to have four walls and a roof.

216
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
 Looks good to me."

217
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,200
 He's walking around this house and at one point the real estate agent goes into another

218
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:05,760
 room and that is when David Timothy Moon makes a decision.

219
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,800
 He realizes that one of the rooms in this house that he's looking at buying is a three

220
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,120
 year old girl's bedroom.

221
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
 Now the girl's gone.

222
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
 The girl is absent.

223
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,240
 Nothing bad happens to the girl.

224
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,080
 And David walks into this empty room.

225
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,360
 He looks from side to side.

226
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
 He's skulking.

227
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,680
 Now he's skulking through the room.

228
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,880
 He's crawling on all fours like the grudge girl.

229
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,040
 He zeroes in on something in the corner of the room.

230
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
 Now I'm going to say this.

231
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,400
 This room looks like a little kid's room.

232
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,080
 To make this whole thing even more disturbing, there's giant stuffed animals and like Disney

233
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
 characters and stuff Disney characters.

234
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,920
 There's not like animated characters running around.

235
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,400
 It's not toon town.

236
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,920
 But she has all of this stuff.

237
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,800
 It looks like a little kid's room to make this all even creepier.

238
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,520
 But somehow, if you walked into someone's room right now, would you be able to tell

239
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,440
 what their dirty clothes hamper was?

240
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
 I couldn't.

241
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
 A vine's on the floor.

242
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,760
 My dirty clothes on the floor.

243
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,920
 But apparently he was able to walk into this room.

244
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,800
 He's probably scoping it out the whole time.

245
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,360
 He's probably like, "Hey, can we take another look at this room and the real estate agents

246
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
 like we've been in the room like 10 times already?"

247
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
 He's like, "Yeah, but I think I left my watch in there."

248
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,280
 And he's still wearing his watch.

249
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,600
 He's like, "He's able to zero in on the dirty clothes hamper of this little girl."

250
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,680
 He begins, and the reason why we know all this stuff is because this was also on video.

251
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:36,720
 He begins going through the dirty clothes and he pulls out a pair of the...

252
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,480
 This is so disgusting.

253
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,480
 He pulls out a pair of the little girl's underwear and goes...

254
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,600
 I mean, he's just sniffing it.

255
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,880
 He's just in hate.

256
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,720
 You know how disgusting children are?

257
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,400
 How filthy they are?

258
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,160
 They're the ones constantly picking their nose and picking their butts and being super

259
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,640
 gross and never taking baths and stuff.

260
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
 I didn't...

261
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,240
 Man, it was a struggle to get me to take a bath.

262
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
 I was 12 years old.

263
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,600
 I hated taking baths and showers.

264
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,160
 They're gross, dude.

265
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,880
 He's just doing his smelling her underwear.

266
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,280
 And then he throws them back.

267
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,360
 He leaves the room.

268
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,400
 And then a couple minutes later, he's able to ditch the real estate agent again, run

269
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,760
 back into the room, get another sniff of these disgusting dirty clothes, bro.

270
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,560
 It's dirty clothes and he's smelling them.

271
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,760
 And then to just make the thing funny.

272
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,800
 Because that's all so gross.

273
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,600
 That's so gross.

274
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 Here's an interview.

275
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,800
 ABC 15, they're interviewing forensic psychologist John Delatoro.

276
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,440
 It was very interesting.

277
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,560
 Quote, quote, this isn't someone who's unsure and needs to look around and try to figure

278
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,160
 out is this the thing that arouses me?

279
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,280
 He knows immediately.

280
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
 Unquote.

281
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,920
 Just like the guy in the first story, this isn't someone who's driving on the road and

282
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,840
 he goes, you know what I think I'm going to do today for the first time ever I've just

283
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
 had this thought?

284
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,520
 I'm going to kidnap a young boy.

285
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,360
 This is someone who's thought about this over and over again.

286
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,440
 This is someone who has fantasized about this and they knew this was what would turn them

287
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,560
 on with David Timothy Moon.

288
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,680
 It's not alleged.

289
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,200
 He actually pled guilty to this crime.

290
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,840
 We'll get to that in a second, but it's on tape.

291
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,680
 He's sniffing a little girl's underwear.

292
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,520
 Like what is going to say that it's back as it's just on tape.

293
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,760
 The whole thing's disgusting, but as an outsider, as a non-pervo, you look at it and you go,

294
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,040
 why, why, why any of that?

295
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,520
 Did he pick that house because he knew a little girl lived there?

296
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,080
 Is that how creepy this is?

297
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,480
 Or did he just happen to be in a house and see a little girl's room and go, I bet you

298
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,120
 there's a hamper in there?

299
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,120
 Like what is the logic behind this?

300
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,200
 Outside of just the disgusting part of the fetish, there's so many other pieces.

301
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,840
 Now he said, he told the court, it's the biggest mistake he ever made.

302
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
 And they believed it.

303
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,900
 They believed it.

304
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,480
 It was kind of like a one time thing.

305
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,280
 It was just like he happened to, I mean, who hasn't been house shopping and been like,

306
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,200
 you know what I'm missing in life?

307
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,600
 The disgusting smell of used underwear.

308
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,160
 That's what's been missing in my 50 years of life.

309
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,320
 He got charged with all this stuff.

310
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,840
 He pled guilty to misdemeanor trespassing.

311
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
 His sentence?

312
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:29,440
 I mean, you can argue over what type of, to me, this is wreaks of no pun intended.

313
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,920
 This wreaks of a sex crime, right?

314
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,040
 No one's like, this is my path to fortune and fame.

315
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,000
 Only in underwear, the only thing that works is like some sort of fetish.

316
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,720
 He pleads guilty to misdemeanor trespassing.

317
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,680
 All he gets for this is unsupervised probation.

318
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,440
 No one's even keeping an eye on him.

319
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,000
 Your hamper right now, your hamper may be unsafe.

320
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,160
 He may be hiding in the shadows right now.

321
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,400
 Trying to get a whiff of your clothes.

322
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
 Unsupervised probation.

323
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,480
 And when he completes this program of not being supervised, it's not even a program.

324
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,680
 It was the same thing he was doing before he got arrested.

325
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,160
 This can be expunged from his record.

326
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,720
 No one will ever know he was the panty sniffer of Phoenix, Arizona.

327
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,280
 And you could go, maybe it is.

328
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,760
 Maybe it is just a one time thing.

329
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,840
 Maybe he was just walking through and he happened to fall and trip into the little girl's room

330
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
 and then he was getting up.

331
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,960
 He accidentally fell into the hamper and smelled underwear twice.

332
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
 Maybe.

333
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,560
 But also according to the police report, when he found out the police were looking for him,

334
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,680
 he threw his computer away.

335
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,760
 So we're in an elevator with these three dudes.

336
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,880
 We just had to pay a speeding ticket and now we're sitting with a guy tried kidnapping

337
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,760
 a little boy allegedly.

338
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,480
 A guy who was banging Elmo allegedly in a man who pled guilty to sniffing little girl's

339
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
 underwear.

340
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,800
 Technically I guess he probably pled guilty to entering the room.

341
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,880
 Anyways, so that is that story.

342
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,360
 I actually questioned why I should make that a choose.

343
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,000
 An interactive adventure, I questioned that but I was like, nobody wants to pick any of

344
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 those numbers.

345
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,840
 None of those are fun, but I didn't want to package them all in one story.

346
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,760
 We pay our speeding ticket, we get out of there.

347
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
 Bugus.

348
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,160
 Let's hop in that carbonicopter, we're leaving behind all these alleged pervos.

349
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,800
 We are headed out to the conspiracy theory iceberg.

350
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,360
 The conspiracy theory iceberg.

351
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,040
 There's a lot of icebergs out there.

352
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,280
 They keep evolving.

353
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,480
 I actually have appeared on a conspiracy theory iceberg.

354
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,600
 12 inches sent me a video from parallel pipes.

355
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,040
 They did a breakdown of the conspiracy theory iceberg.

356
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,040
 It's one of those videos that's about an hour long and they just go over everything.

357
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,400
 That rabbit radio is listed on there and he says it's a really cool podcast and I agree

358
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
 with that.

359
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,760
 I don't know why I'm listed on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

360
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
 I'm actually down low enough.

361
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,320
 I'm next to solar plexus clown gliders, but it's dope.

362
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,960
 I'm actually become meta.

363
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,760
 The man who started reporting on these conspiracy theory icebergs has now become part of the

364
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,480
 iceberg itself.

365
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,920
 But with the conspiracy theory iceberg, because there's so many of them, some are interesting,

366
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
 some aren't.

367
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,200
 Some are too mysterious, we'll never know.

368
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,800
 And some are very vague.

369
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,600
 There is no conspiracy is often found on the lower levels, if not the lowest level of the

370
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
 conspiracy theory iceberg.

371
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,080
 And it's something I looked at on and off over the years.

372
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,640
 But that's an easy get, right?

373
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,760
 You could always say all conspiracy theories are fake, that this is all some sort of mind

374
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,120
 manipulation or like I've said before, a lot of conspiracy theories are fake to distract

375
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,600
 us from real conspiracy theories and that's not a new idea.

376
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,200
 A lot of people have said that even before I started saying that.

377
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,640
 I'm not saying I made that up or anything like that.

378
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,080
 But it's a real easy one.

379
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,800
 And so when I would see that on the conspiracy theory iceberg, I would think, oh, I could

380
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,760
 do an episode like that, but I'm really not saying anything new.

381
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,600
 But a couple of weeks ago, I got an email from somebody and I think they solved the

382
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,840
 answer to there are no conspiracies.

383
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,360
 It's very, very simple belief.

384
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,560
 There are no conspiracy theories.

385
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,720
 And this is it.

386
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,840
 And I'm paraphrasing what this person sent me and I'm not going to reveal this person's

387
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
 name.

388
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,200
 But this is the theory.

389
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,800
 Conspiracy theories are used to pass information from one person to another.

390
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,200
 That information we are not privy to.

391
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
 Conspiracies don't really exist.

392
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,360
 They're simply coded messages.

393
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,880
 Now I've talked about that before with certain stories and I've talked about hitting codes

394
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,720
 being passed back and forth, but it actually that's just scratching the surface of this

395
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
 one.

396
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,920
 So, let's say I wanted to, let's say I'm a member of an organization.

397
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,360
 Because you'd have to be really powerful to do this.

398
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,460
 We're not talking about low level theories like monkeys don't exist, but it would explain

399
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:03,160
 why theories like monkey don't exist doesn't become popular, but birds don't exist do.

400
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,560
 Birds don't exist is a very, very well known conspiracy theory.

401
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,280
 We covered it on the show a long time ago.

402
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,360
 Carson was the first person to recommend it to me.

403
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,160
 Thank you very much, Carson.

404
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,960
 There's flyers in every major city.

405
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,760
 It's very, it's a meme.

406
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
 It's fake.

407
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,920
 It was set up as a parody of conspiracy theories.

408
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,880
 Why is that one more popular than monkeys don't exist?

409
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,360
 Which is earnest at the very least they're both dumb, but one of them people honestly

410
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,880
 believe it that monkeys do not exist.

411
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,640
 It's hilarious, right?

412
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
 And it makes more sense.

413
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,320
 I was talking about this on a live stream the other night.

414
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,480
 We don't see monkeys in our daily life.

415
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,040
 You can actually convince someone that monkeys don't exist.

416
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,360
 It's a lot harder to convince someone that birds don't exist because we interact with

417
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,560
 birds all of the time.

418
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,920
 Why is birds don't exist more popular than monkeys don't exist?

419
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,200
 Because what's happening is one group of people are trying to spread a message to another

420
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,960
 group of people.

421
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,880
 They're using the conspiracy theories as code and we've talked about this before on the

422
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,880
 podcast, but we're going to go more in depth now because conspiracy theories blow up very

423
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
 quickly.

424
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,640
 They get publicized very quickly.

425
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400
 The message gets spread very quickly and people are just looking at the surface of it.

426
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,240
 They're not looking for the code.

427
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,120
 It's an easy way to spread your message is to actually make it controversial, to make

428
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,040
 it shocking.

429
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,920
 Look at that Lil Nas X dude.

430
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,840
 He came out with that song called "Call Me By Your Name," "Montereo," whatever it is.

431
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,720
 In this video he's like banging Satan and he's like doing a lap dance for Satan and

432
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,200
 then he breaks off Satan horns and becomes Satan.

433
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,200
 And everyone, like this song had like millions of downloads and he was selling those shoes

434
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
 and all that stuff.

435
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,520
 No one would have ever downloaded that song if it was him at a concert.

436
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,600
 If it was just video of him singing to his fans, exact same song.

437
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,880
 You make it controversial, you're going to get the message out.

438
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,920
 Nobody would have had the same 100,000 people who downloaded his last song download this

439
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
 song.

440
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,960
 Instead he has all of these YouTube videos and these political pundits talking about

441
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
 it.

442
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,160
 100% strategy.

443
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,360
 100% strategy behind that.

444
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,160
 So if I want to send a message to you, I will craft a conspiracy theory called "Birds

445
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,440
 Don't Exist."

446
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,840
 And you know what the message is.

447
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,320
 I know what the message is.

448
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,600
 And I also want to take this moment to say a good example of this and Dead Rabbit recommends

449
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
 this.

450
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,440
 I don't want to go into detail about it because it's such a good movie, I don't want to spoil

451
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
 it.

452
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,480
 "Beyond the Silver Lake" or "Under the Silver Lake."

453
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,720
 If I want to recommend it, I should know the name of it.

454
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 I'll put it in the show notes.

455
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,160
 I think it's "Under the Silver Lake."

456
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,000
 It's a movie about this, about how conspiracy theories are actually hidden messages and

457
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,280
 music and all the stuff that we think is satanic, illuminati stuff is actually two groups of

458
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
 people communicating with each other.

459
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,320
 Two powerful groups of people communicating with each other.

460
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,200
 It's a brilliant movie.

461
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,960
 It's a great movie, I recommend checking it out.

462
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,960
 But for what we're talking about here, let's get back to this core thing.

463
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,080
 There is no conspiracy theory.

464
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,520
 Conspiracy theories are just ways of people to pass messages back and forth.

465
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,040
 It's still super vague, right?

466
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,440
 It would be easy for me to make that statement and then be like, "Okay, that's the end of

467
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
 the episode."

468
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,920
 I got an email from somebody who actually not only can specify what the message is, but

469
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,880
 he made good on it.

470
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,160
 "Bugus, let's hop back in that carbonar copter.

471
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,920
 We're leaving behind the conspiracy theory iceberg.

472
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,880
 We're headed out to the New York Stock Exchange."

473
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,960
 Carbonar copter lands in the middle of Stock Exchange.

474
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,920
 Everyone has to stop trading for the day.

475
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,680
 Economic disaster, but we're here.

476
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,200
 And the reason why we're here is this is the theory.

477
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,120
 If you take a conspiracy theory like the Great Reset, which we talked about yesterday, and

478
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,600
 you strip it of all of the satanic stuff, of all of the illuminati stuff, you boil it

479
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,720
 down to its essence, its stock tips.

480
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,080
 When they start talking about ways to, "We're going to invent this microchip and we're going

481
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,840
 to put it in your hand," and all that stuff, when that's the conspiracy theory, invest

482
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,720
 in biometric technology.

483
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:22,640
 When you can find a conspiracy theory and boil it down to how the private market would

484
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:30,640
 benefit from that, that tells you who to invest in.

485
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,960
 Think about it this way.

486
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
 Monkeys aren't real.

487
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,480
 The conspiracy theory is NASA is trying to prove that God doesn't exist, that evolution

488
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,600
 is real, and monkeys are a part of evolution, so they're faking it.

489
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,040
 They're faking all of it.

490
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,880
 Technically, I guess you can invest money in NASA.

491
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,200
 Birds aren't real is all about how birds are actually spy technology.

492
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,760
 They're drones.

493
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,800
 They're sent out to investigate us, and they're all fake.

494
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,520
 They're robots.

495
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,680
 You would then, when that conspiracy theory started, you would go, "Okay, let's start

496
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,960
 moving investments towards unmanned aerial vehicles.

497
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,560
 Let's start putting some of our investments in drone technology and surveillance technology.

498
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,040
 Who's the hot camera maker right now?

499
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,600
 Who's making the best optical cameras for these drones?

500
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,040
 Invest in them."

501
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,320
 The theory is that conspiracy theories like birds aren't real was a way for people to

502
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,280
 spread stock tips to commit insider trading, that they're all fake.

503
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:34,120
 When you look at stuff about microchips being implanted, invest in the biometrics.

504
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,280
 When you start looking at stuff about the singularity and the singularity is going to

505
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,840
 take stuff up, start investing in companies that are trying to do AI.

506
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,200
 One organization is looking at this stuff, and they know that they're going to have a

507
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,080
 huge product come out.

508
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,680
 They see that they're going to have their stock is going to blow up.

509
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,840
 They know something's going on to alert their fellow conspirators.

510
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,360
 They craft a conspiracy theory that's based on what they know is going to happen.

511
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,860
 It's not that they know that the great reset's going to happen.

512
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,920
 The great reset, the reason why that's more popular than other conspiracy theories in this

513
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,000
 theory, is it's being pushed because they're trying to get other people to invest in the

514
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,360
 products that prop up the "great reset."

515
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
 It's fake.

516
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,200
 It doesn't exist.

517
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,280
 But you will eat bugs is a thing that people are constantly saying when they talk about

518
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,640
 great reset.

519
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,200
 The whole thing in this theory, the whole thing was set up so you would start investing in

520
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,120
 companies that grow bugs.

521
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,200
 Now, you go, "Jason, maybe that's the horse leading the cart or the cart leading the horse.

522
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,480
 If the great reset is coming, they're going to force everyone to eat."

523
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,240
 I can't believe I'm still talking about the stupid great reset.

524
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
 The great reset is coming.

525
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
 They're going to force everyone to eat bugs.

526
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,840
 Of course you should invest in bugs.

527
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,320
 But the great reset is something that's so hypothetical.

528
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,000
 They're not saying it's going to happen tomorrow.

529
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,520
 But according to this theory, if you invest in bugs now, if you invest in bug farms now,

530
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,880
 you're going to start making money now.

531
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,120
 In fact, the person who sent me this story claims to have made hundreds of thousands

532
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,800
 of dollars by simply following the biggest conspiracy theories out there, stripping them

533
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,920
 of the Satanic and the Illuminati nonsense and investing in the core technologies talked

534
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,520
 about in those conspiracy theories, no matter how outlandish the conspiracy theory is.

535
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,560
 Even if it's something that's not supposed to take place until the future, not supposed

536
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,400
 to take place for a while, something like transhumanism, you boil it down to stuff you

537
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
 can invest in.

538
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,800
 This person has claimed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars.

539
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,040
 This isn't, and they were trying to get me to invest in them.

540
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,040
 I've talked to this person a lot.

541
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,760
 Way before this, we were actually interacting.

542
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,400
 They listened to the show.

543
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,000
 They're a fan of the show.

544
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,440
 They approached me one day and said, "Hey, do you know of any new big conspiracy theories

545
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
 that are coming up?"

546
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
 I said, "No, not really."

547
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,200
 They said, "Well, this is why I'm asking because here's my theory."

548
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,600
 I've actually taken this theory over the past couple months and made a lot of money.

549
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,360
 If you could figure out what the next big conspiracy theories are going to be, it can

550
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,240
 give people tips on how to become rich.

551
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,840
 Is that the reason, and this has been a question that I've talked about a lot on the show,

552
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,120
 why some conspiracy theories are more popular than others?

553
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,760
 Is it because some conspiracy theories are artificially propped up not because of Russian

554
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,680
 disinformation trying to prop up flat earth to make Americans look stupid?

555
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,120
 That's a popular conspiracy theory out there.

556
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,880
 Not because they're building up these fake conspiracy theories to blind us from the

557
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,960
 truth.

558
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,600
 The reason why trees are mountains or mountains are trees and trees are bushes, however that

559
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,600
 one was set up or monkeys don't exist, because those are organic conspiracy theories.

560
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,360
 Those are actually thought up by individuals.

561
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,040
 It's just an interesting piece of this puzzle because that is always the question, why is

562
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,040
 flat earth more popular than so many other conspiracy theories?

563
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
 It's dumb.

564
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,680
 It's observably dumb.

565
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,080
 YouTube promotes it.

566
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,280
 YouTube lets the algorithm run with this flat earth stuff.

567
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
 Why?

568
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,560
 Is someone benefiting from it?

569
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:10,080
 Is it as simple as when you see the flat earth stuff come up, it was to promote GPS technology?

570
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,960
 When you can boil down these, it doesn't work with every conspiracy theory.

571
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,920
 It doesn't work with the obscure ones.

572
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,000
 But when you can boil down these popular conspiracy theories that everyone knows about and find

573
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,680
 out how the private sector would benefit from technologies in that conspiracy theory, you

574
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,080
 can make money apparently.

575
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,360
 You can make a lot of money.

576
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:38,640
 Now again, you could argue if people are talking about putting biometrics inside of you, and

577
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,600
 that's being talked about in the news and you invest in those companies, it's because

578
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,000
 they plan on putting biometrics inside of you.

579
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,560
 They've been talking about putting biometrics inside of you since 1992.

580
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,920
 I've been hearing about the microchips under the skin since 1992.

581
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,520
 And you could go, well, they're doing it in Sweden.

582
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,040
 They're doing it at this nightclub in Sweden.

583
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,040
 They have never, ever been able to fully implement a microchip under the skin.

584
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,960
 They've been talking about this almost my entire life.

585
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,800
 But companies have been making these things and you may be able to take a look at when

586
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,020
 those conspiracy theories started, when those conspiracy theories start to dip and they're

587
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,200
 not as popular and then they peak again in popularity, and look at the profits, look

588
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,520
 at the stock increases of those companies.

589
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,560
 It's not that people, legitimate stock investors are reading godlike productions and they're

590
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,000
 super scared that everyone's going to get a microchip.

591
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,080
 It's not that the conspiracy theory makes people worried and they're investing in it

592
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,840
 or makes them hopeful and they want everyone to get a microchip and they're investing in

593
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
 microchips.

594
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,840
 It's that the conspiracy theory is false.

595
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,800
 It's 100% fake and it's a way to tell your friends what you are investing in and what

596
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,840
 you should invest in without ever getting caught for insider trading, without it ever being

597
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,160
 tracked back to you.

598
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,200
 And the conspiracy theory just lives on.

599
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,600
 It would explain why some conspiracy theories are more popular and longer lasting than others.

600
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,960
 All these conspiracy theories we investigate and we're trying to solve these mysteries

601
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:23,120
 could be just wrapping paper around a gift that the rich people are giving each other.

602
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:32,040
 We never get to until you crack the code and start investing as well.

603
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,000
 So the next time you see a conspiracy theory pop up and you start to see it gain popularity

604
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,800
 and you have a little money to throw around, maybe you should try this too.

605
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,240
 Boil it down to its essence.

606
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,240
 What are the technologies needed to make this conspiracy theory work?

607
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,200
 And see if it actually could be insider trading.

608
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,200
 However, the flip side could be that it's not.

609
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:09,640
 That it actually is investors knowing the conspiracy theory is true and they're trying

610
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:16,960
 to make as much money as they can before the world ends.

611
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,280
 You could be investing in a microchip company and making some short term gains because you

612
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,240
 thought it was just a code.

613
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,640
 But when that microchip is being forced into your head against your will and you cry one

614
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:42,000
 final teardrop before your emotions are completely overwritten, you will remember that your investment

615
00:38:42,000 --> 00:39:04,240
 is in the future of mankind.

616
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:21,680
 Thank you.

617
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,260
 (upbeat music)

618
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,840
 (upbeat music)

619
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,420
 (upbeat music)
