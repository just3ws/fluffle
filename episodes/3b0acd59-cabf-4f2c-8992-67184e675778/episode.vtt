 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.840
 Carpenter and I'm having a great day!

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.760
 I can barely say that with a straight face, but I hope you guys are having a great day

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.040
 and I hope you guys can say it with a straight face.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.320
 It's so hot in here, I'm recording in the haunted closet, that's not like the name of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.880
 a studio, I'm recording in the literal haunted closet.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.680
 I gotta run my AC and shut it off, come into a place where the dead has not departed to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.600
 record this podcast for you, the temperature goes up immediately.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.480
 I don't even know why I bother running the AC for an hour before recording each episode,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.680
 but I'm here for you guys.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.920
 You know who else is here for us, he never leaves us alone, he's always hanging out in

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.320
 the most convenient part of our body.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.040
 Is there an inconvenient part of the bunny?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.280
 Stick your finger up your nose.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.520
 I want you to pick out our newest Patreon supporter, it's Bougas!

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.880
 Everyone give a round of applause to Bougas, you pull him out, he's like, he's like, that's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.320
 not what my name means, I'm not saying I'm a booger, I don't know, Bougas, maybe it's

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.720
 like a ghost of a guy named Gus, that's probably a little less disgusting, so pick your nose,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.240
 pull out a booger, name it Gus, Bougas, you are gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.760
 if you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys aren't a booger, that's preferable,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.960
 but just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot, I actually

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.280
 didn't say that in the last episode with Robert Reith, he was the village person dressed

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.680
 up as a carpenter, if you're not a village person, if you don't have a sexy carpenter

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.840
 outfit like Robert Reith or you're not a booger like Bougas, totally fine, both are

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.520
 preferable if you're not those things, just help spread the word about the show really,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.800
 it really helps out a lot, Robert Reith, we're waving goodbye to him as he fades away like

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.360
 a forced ghost, and Bougas, we're gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.320
 we're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, take your salty gooey hands, put them all

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.720
 over the controls for the next person as to why they're Durgible, we are leaving behind

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.760
 Dead Rabbit Command, we are headed out to a courthouse, we got a court date dude, this

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.280
 kind of sucks, so the other day a Patreon, I'm not gonna say who it was, was driving

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.160
 the Jason Jalopy a little too fast, a little too wild, got a traffic ticket, now because

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.680
 we're all fluffle because we're all a family of rabbits, we all have to attend the court

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.600
 hearing and we're here in court, well while we're in this courthouse, we're gonna fight

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.520
 this speeding ticket, we get an elevator, ding, and listen man, I've been to court a

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.600
 couple times myself and I've had friends who've gone to court, everyone's miserable,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.720
 every single person at the courthouse is miserable, the person working in the cafeteria is miserable,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.560
 the judges are miserable, it's not a great place to be, I was in court, I was in court

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.080
 when I ran into a solar plexus clown glider, it's a bad place, interdimensional creatures

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.080
 hang out in court rooms, I'll put that episode in the show notes, but you don't want to

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.800
 go to court or have anything to do with court or watch the show night court, actually that

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.320
 show's pretty funny, I can't make a joke about that being bad, we're in this courthouse,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.080
 you just want to get this speeding ticket taken care of, this very long introduction

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.280
 for three very short stories, but we want to get this speeding ticket taken care of,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.640
 we're in this elevator, now we know every time this door opens a weirdo's gonna get

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.720
 inside, because that's how the story is framed, and that's what happens in real courthouses,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:31.200
 ding, elevator door opens, and inside steps, oh good, this guy's actually a US Marshal,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.320
 his name is David Timothy Moon and we're like oh what do you hear for and he's like oh you

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.760
 know I'm a US Marshal so I like do Marshal stuff, and we're like okay that makes sense,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.840
 maybe he'll protect us for the rest of this adventure that we're on, this very linear,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.040
 this very vertical adventure we're on, we go up another story, ding, the elevator opens

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.800
 up, this is so confusing, the elevator opens up, and inside steps Ronnie Lou Helton, he's

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.360
 73 year old man, so we see this old man walk in, he looks like the dude from up, he just

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.960
 kind of saunters in, and so we know where the Marshal's here, he's obviously working,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.280
 we ask hey Ronnie what are you here for, and he turns to us and he says, so the other

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.680
 day this is totally blown out of proportion, and everything I'm about to say is alleged,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.320
 because I haven't been found guilty of anything yet, but on April 7th, 2021, so very recently,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.640
 I was minding my business in Corbin, Kentucky, and I was walking through a neighbor, I don't

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.440
 want to tell this story from his point of view, it's going to sound super creepy because

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.280
 I have to keep saying I did this stuff, so this dude named Ronnie Lou Helton was living

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.160
 in Corbin, Kentucky, and he's walking down the street, he's walking through the Gordon

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.560
 Hill Pike neighborhood, it's 4pm, this is prime time to be like hanging out, doing

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.280
 little kid stuff, playing with GI Joes or Paw Patrol or whatever kids play with these

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.120
 days, there's a little 3 year old boy in the backyard, look at me grandma, I'm a 3 year

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.000
 old boy, I don't have imagination yet, I don't know if I'm a jet or a knight, the

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.360
 grandma's like oh great, this kid's going to be a struggle, 3 year old boy's running

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.640
 around his grandma's backyard, now Ronnie is walking through the neighborhood and he

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.160
 has predator vision, not predator vision like heat vision, literal sexual predator vision,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
 he's like he just sees normal, he just sees normal, there's no red heat signature, but

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.560
 it's just creepier, he sees this 3 year old boy running in the backyard, and he walks

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.000
 up to the fence, hey how would you like to come over the fence Ronnie says, and the boy

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.320
 is like probably not, and Ronnie reaches over the fence, grabs the boy's hand and starts

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.240
 to lead him along the fence line, now Ronnie is a short man, Ronnie is about 5 foot 1,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.720
 and the boy is 3 years old so he's obviously short, so we're talking like a picket fence,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.640
 but Ronnie is really not tall enough to reach over and grab the boy, but he noticed there's

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:58.640
 a part where the ground on the boy's side of the fence kind of lumps up, and the fence

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.680
 is technically shorter at that point, so he's leading the boy over to this lump, and he

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.040
 means to pick the boy up and run away with him, as this is going on, the grandma who's

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.440
 supposed to be babysitting this kid looks out and sees Ronnie leading this kid down the

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.240
 fence line and she goes let go of my son, I mean not my grandson, let go of my grandson,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.640
 she's easily confused, Ronnie let's go with the boy, the boy runs deeper into the safety

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.560
 of the yard, now stranger abductions, they're super rare, they do happen, they're terrifying,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.040
 but that's not even the end of this incident, to make it even creepier, I mean this is like

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.520
 4pm, it's so casual, you have to think that this guy has done this before, allegedly, he

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.960
 then yells to the grandmother quote "I'll give you a thousand dollars for this little

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:56.840
 boy" unquote, that's really creepy, the fact that he knew that he had a number, he's probably

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.880
 in the past been like "I'll give you $750" and they're like "no dice" and they run

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.200
 away and he's like "hmm maybe I should up it next time", he's obviously, he's obviously

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.480
 done this enough times to know a thousand dollars is the sweet spot, he yells out "I'll

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.680
 give you a thousand dollars for this boy", they say no, like you should, and the guy

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.280
 then turns and gets in his car, which was just parked right there, they get his license plate

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.400
 number, they turn it over to the cops, the guy's arrested, he's actually charged with

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.680
 attempted kidnapping and because he yelled out a price, he actually got charged with

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.720
 human trafficking as well, we're standing in this elevator here with this man who tried

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.520
 to abduct a 3 year old boy and then offered a thousand dollar price tag for the boy, and

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.280
 it's so funny because if it was just the kidnapping, I probably wouldn't even cover

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.680
 it, I'm like "poorine, who tried to kidnap a 3 year old out of a yard, ugh" call me

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.200
 later when you find out the old man's really a skin walker or something interesting, the

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.680
 fact that he's yelling out a price makes it so chilling to me, he's probably bought

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.920
 kids before, allegedly, there's a US Marshal in this elevator, gotta be careful what I

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.880
 say legally, but it's just creepy, and the fact that he thought the grandma would go

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.480
 "you almost tried stealing my grandson, but now that you offered me a thousand dollars,

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:18.400
 come in for some tea, let's talk" no, he's awaiting some serious, serious charges, so

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.320
 we're now in this elevator with this man who tried kidnapping this little kid, that's

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.920
 not cool, ding, it's more than uncool, it's disgusting, but the elevator, we're still

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.000
 stuck in it, ding, the door opens up, another man gets on, into the elevator steps, Kevin

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.480
 Wayne Van Levin, he's a 59 year old home inspector, and we go "hey, we didn't learn

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.000
 our lesson by asking the first guy what he was in for, we asked this guy what are you

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.360
 in for?" and he goes "oh man, you guys won't believe it, well you guys probably will, because

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.960
 there's video evidence of it, but this is my story" and then he does wavy lines and

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.680
 we're flashbacked into this memory of his, reluctantly, we do not want to be in this

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:07.600
 memory, it's March 12th, 2021, again, super recent, those chemtrails are finally starting

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.720
 to catch up with everyone and infecting their brains, we're in Oxford Township, Michigan,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.240
 Kevin Wayne Van Levin is a home inspector and he is doing what his name implies, he's

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:25.320
 inspecting a home, he's looking at it and he goes "yeah, four walls, four walls, a

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:31.040
 ceiling, perfect, check that down, there does seem to be some sort of foundation or floor,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.840
 yeah it's a floor, he's very very good at his job, he's very thorough, so when he's

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.440
 doing his home inspecting, the people whose home he's inspecting, they say "oh we're

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.360
 gonna go out and get a bite to eat, you do your thing" but when they did leave him they

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:50.480
 didn't expect what was gonna happen, but they had a video camera and so they're out grabbing

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:58.600
 a quick bite to eat and all of a sudden, their phone goes off, their tone goes off and it

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:05.320
 shows that they had movement in their baby's nursery and they're like "oh no, we forgot

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.280
 the baby, I don't know, he's a home inspector, he's walking around the home, why would you

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.480
 even care that motion sensors were going off?" it pops up on their phone that there's motion

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.440
 on the nursery and the mother she goes "I wasn't really bothered by it, but for

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:27.060
 some reason I decided to look at the video and this is the video we have, we see Kevin

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.240
 walk into the nursery, it's very very nice nursery, I didn't even know it was a nursery,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.520
 doesn't have like the stereotypical crib and like the haunted rocking chair and stuffed

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.440
 animals, it looks more like some weird art deco room, so that baby's gonna have a real

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:51.480
 imaginative life, but anyways, it looks very Spartan as a nursery, this is now an interior

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.240
 design podcast, you wouldn't know it was a nursery, except for the fact that this man,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:03.360
 Kevin picks up an Elmo doll, this Tickle Me Elmo doll and he is walking around with

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.720
 the Elmo doll and then he turns his back to the camera and he's kinda like in the closet

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:15.120
 now and he is humping Elmo and you go "Jason, how do you know?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.280
 How do you know if he has his back to the camera and he's halfway in the closet?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.280
 How can you tell?"

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:27.240
 Well you can tell right, you can tell from the motion of his arm and Elmo's moments

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.600
 of ecstasy, it's like "Oh Tickle Me Harder!"

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:37.240
 You can tell he's banging this doll, now he might have known there was a camera there,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:43.840
 I really hope not, I hope he didn't know, he did turn his body enough that he was trying

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.520
 to conceal it from something, but not so much that you know right, when you see the arm

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.560
 kinda move in, not Elmo's arm but Kevin's arm and then you see Elmo smoking his cigarette

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:03.680
 afterwards, he uses this Elmo doll to masturbate on and then to make things worse, he puts

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.000
 the Elmo doll back where he found it.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 So the idea was that no one would be the wiser except for him and Elmo and there would just

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 be this soaking disgusting Elmo in the corner of this nursery.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.400
 Well they were watching it, they were watching it live, they called the police, the police

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.200
 actually apparently according to this article I read on the mail online by Lauren Lewis,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.640
 the police I believe got there as he was leaving and he said "Oh no no, I totally wasn't masturbating

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.040
 on it, how do you come back from that?"

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.720
 You're just standing there and two police officers show up and they're like "Hey are

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.480
 you Kevin Van Levin?"

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:47.200
 And he goes "Yeah, yeah that's me" and they go "Did you have sex with the devil?"

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.000
 You immediately would think "How did they know?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.200
 How did they know you have red fur all over your crotch?"

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.680
 You go "How did they know?"

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.960
 You wouldn't think to come up with a cover story that quickly for that right?

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.480
 So he does though, apparently he's like "No no no, it was totally consensual.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.880
 Elmo okay, want to meet?"

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.360
 He denies it, he totally denies it but then they say "Well there's video of you" and

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.680
 then he's like "Okay you caught me guys, you hold his hands out to me handcuffed" they're

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.800
 like "We don't want to touch your hands, we know what you're just doing."

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:22.960
 So he is facing, what was the, it was a weird mischief vandalism or misdemeanor, malicious

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.240
 vandalism and it carries like a two year sentence and I think because there's the sex angle

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.680
 to it.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.240
 An odd part of his bond, he's not in jail right now, he's able to bond out one of his

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:39.200
 conditions of his bond is he can't be in a house that he doesn't own.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.760
 That kind of makes him like a vampire right?

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.760
 Like he can't come in your house without special permission, there's this zombie apocalypse

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760
 there like "Come in, come in!"

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.960
 He's like "I can't, the law doesn't allow it."

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.280
 But he goes and he hides in a toy factory, he's like "You guys wait there, they're in

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280
 like a food supermarket."

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.080
 He's like "I'm gonna go to this stuffed animal factory."

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.080
 Woohoo!

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.520
 The apocalypse has done me right.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.160
 I will have to say this though, the home, I thought this was very noble.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.560
 He's a home inspector, he's in someone else's home, it's March 12th, 2021.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.280
 As he's sexually assaulting Tickle Me Elmo, he's wearing a mask.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.440
 He is very courteous of COVID restrictions.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.240
 It's salute to you Kevin.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.360
 Hats off to you.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.320
 The fact that while you were committing this disgusting crime, you continued to wear a

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.080
 mask.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.480
 He should be an example for us all.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:39.720
 So there we go, we got two creepy stories from these weirdos, legend weirdos that we

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.200
 ran into this courthouse.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.160
 But I said there was a trio of stories and we're looking around, I'm looking at you,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.280
 I'm checking, have you been to Elmo recently?

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.560
 You have no fur on your crotch, good to go.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.880
 Then we realized the grossest story has been here all along.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.280
 The US Marshal, David Timothy Moon, has been lurking behind us the whole time.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.080
 He wasn't lurking, we knew he was there.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.760
 He was eating a ham sandwich, he's like, "Hey, I'm still here."

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:16.920
 May 2019, David Timothy Moon, 50 year old man, 24 year veteran of the US Marshals.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.600
 This guy had a long career.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.760
 He actually didn't even answer to the local deputy marshals in Phoenix, Arizona, which

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.400
 is where this story takes place.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.600
 He, his bosses were in DC.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.040
 This guy was a highfalutin dude.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.680
 But even highfalutin US Marshals gotta buy houses.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.760
 They have places to live.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.960
 They don't live in yurts, they have to live in homes.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:47.200
 So when US Marshal, David Timothy Moon, was house hunting, he's like, "Oh, this place

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 looks great.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200
 The neighborhood looks awesome.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.840
 I read that thing about home inspectors.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.160
 They're supposed to have four walls and a roof.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.160
 Looks good to me."

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.200
 He's walking around this house and at one point the real estate agent goes into another

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:05.760
 room and that is when David Timothy Moon makes a decision.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.800
 He realizes that one of the rooms in this house that he's looking at buying is a three

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.120
 year old girl's bedroom.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.120
 Now the girl's gone.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.120
 The girl is absent.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.240
 Nothing bad happens to the girl.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.080
 And David walks into this empty room.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.360
 He looks from side to side.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360
 He's skulking.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.680
 Now he's skulking through the room.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.880
 He's crawling on all fours like the grudge girl.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.040
 He zeroes in on something in the corner of the room.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.040
 Now I'm going to say this.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.400
 This room looks like a little kid's room.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.080
 To make this whole thing even more disturbing, there's giant stuffed animals and like Disney

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.240
 characters and stuff Disney characters.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.920
 There's not like animated characters running around.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.400
 It's not toon town.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.920
 But she has all of this stuff.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.800
 It looks like a little kid's room to make this all even creepier.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.520
 But somehow, if you walked into someone's room right now, would you be able to tell

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.440
 what their dirty clothes hamper was?

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440
 I couldn't.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.440
 A vine's on the floor.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.760
 My dirty clothes on the floor.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.920
 But apparently he was able to walk into this room.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.800
 He's probably scoping it out the whole time.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.360
 He's probably like, "Hey, can we take another look at this room and the real estate agents

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.520
 like we've been in the room like 10 times already?"

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.520
 He's like, "Yeah, but I think I left my watch in there."

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.280
 And he's still wearing his watch.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:24.600
 He's like, "He's able to zero in on the dirty clothes hamper of this little girl."

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.680
 He begins, and the reason why we know all this stuff is because this was also on video.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:36.720
 He begins going through the dirty clothes and he pulls out a pair of the...

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.480
 This is so disgusting.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.480
 He pulls out a pair of the little girl's underwear and goes...

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.600
 I mean, he's just sniffing it.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.880
 He's just in hate.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.720
 You know how disgusting children are?

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.400
 How filthy they are?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.160
 They're the ones constantly picking their nose and picking their butts and being super

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.640
 gross and never taking baths and stuff.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.640
 I didn't...

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.240
 Man, it was a struggle to get me to take a bath.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.240
 I was 12 years old.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.600
 I hated taking baths and showers.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.160
 They're gross, dude.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.880
 He's just doing his smelling her underwear.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.280
 And then he throws them back.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.360
 He leaves the room.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.400
 And then a couple minutes later, he's able to ditch the real estate agent again, run

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:30.760
 back into the room, get another sniff of these disgusting dirty clothes, bro.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.560
 It's dirty clothes and he's smelling them.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.760
 And then to just make the thing funny.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.800
 Because that's all so gross.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.600
 That's so gross.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.600
 Here's an interview.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.800
 ABC 15, they're interviewing forensic psychologist John Delatoro.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.440
 It was very interesting.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.560
 Quote, quote, this isn't someone who's unsure and needs to look around and try to figure

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.160
 out is this the thing that arouses me?

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.280
 He knows immediately.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.280
 Unquote.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.920
 Just like the guy in the first story, this isn't someone who's driving on the road and

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.840
 he goes, you know what I think I'm going to do today for the first time ever I've just

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.840
 had this thought?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.520
 I'm going to kidnap a young boy.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.360
 This is someone who's thought about this over and over again.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.440
 This is someone who has fantasized about this and they knew this was what would turn them

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.560
 on with David Timothy Moon.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.680
 It's not alleged.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.200
 He actually pled guilty to this crime.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.840
 We'll get to that in a second, but it's on tape.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.680
 He's sniffing a little girl's underwear.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.520
 Like what is going to say that it's back as it's just on tape.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.760
 The whole thing's disgusting, but as an outsider, as a non-pervo, you look at it and you go,

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.040
 why, why, why any of that?

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.520
 Did he pick that house because he knew a little girl lived there?

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.080
 Is that how creepy this is?

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.480
 Or did he just happen to be in a house and see a little girl's room and go, I bet you

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.120
 there's a hamper in there?

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.120
 Like what is the logic behind this?

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.200
 Outside of just the disgusting part of the fetish, there's so many other pieces.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.840
 Now he said, he told the court, it's the biggest mistake he ever made.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.600
 And they believed it.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.900
 They believed it.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.480
 It was kind of like a one time thing.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.280
 It was just like he happened to, I mean, who hasn't been house shopping and been like,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.200
 you know what I'm missing in life?

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.600
 The disgusting smell of used underwear.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.160
 That's what's been missing in my 50 years of life.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.320
 He got charged with all this stuff.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.840
 He pled guilty to misdemeanor trespassing.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840
 His sentence?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:29.440
 I mean, you can argue over what type of, to me, this is wreaks of no pun intended.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.920
 This wreaks of a sex crime, right?

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.040
 No one's like, this is my path to fortune and fame.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:40.000
 Only in underwear, the only thing that works is like some sort of fetish.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.720
 He pleads guilty to misdemeanor trespassing.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.680
 All he gets for this is unsupervised probation.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.440
 No one's even keeping an eye on him.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.000
 Your hamper right now, your hamper may be unsafe.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.160
 He may be hiding in the shadows right now.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.400
 Trying to get a whiff of your clothes.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.400
 Unsupervised probation.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.480
 And when he completes this program of not being supervised, it's not even a program.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.680
 It was the same thing he was doing before he got arrested.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.160
 This can be expunged from his record.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.720
 No one will ever know he was the panty sniffer of Phoenix, Arizona.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.280
 And you could go, maybe it is.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.760
 Maybe it is just a one time thing.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.840
 Maybe he was just walking through and he happened to fall and trip into the little girl's room

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.840
 and then he was getting up.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.960
 He accidentally fell into the hamper and smelled underwear twice.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.960
 Maybe.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.560
 But also according to the police report, when he found out the police were looking for him,

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.680
 he threw his computer away.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.760
 So we're in an elevator with these three dudes.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.880
 We just had to pay a speeding ticket and now we're sitting with a guy tried kidnapping

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.760
 a little boy allegedly.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:46.480
 A guy who was banging Elmo allegedly in a man who pled guilty to sniffing little girl's

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.480
 underwear.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:53.800
 Technically I guess he probably pled guilty to entering the room.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.880
 Anyways, so that is that story.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.360
 I actually questioned why I should make that a choose.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.000
 An interactive adventure, I questioned that but I was like, nobody wants to pick any of

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 those numbers.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.840
 None of those are fun, but I didn't want to package them all in one story.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.760
 We pay our speeding ticket, we get out of there.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760
 Bugus.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.160
 Let's hop in that carbonicopter, we're leaving behind all these alleged pervos.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:23.800
 We are headed out to the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.360
 The conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.040
 There's a lot of icebergs out there.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.280
 They keep evolving.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.480
 I actually have appeared on a conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.600
 12 inches sent me a video from parallel pipes.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.040
 They did a breakdown of the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.040
 It's one of those videos that's about an hour long and they just go over everything.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.400
 That rabbit radio is listed on there and he says it's a really cool podcast and I agree

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400
 with that.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.760
 I don't know why I'm listed on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.600
 I'm actually down low enough.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.320
 I'm next to solar plexus clown gliders, but it's dope.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.960
 I'm actually become meta.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.760
 The man who started reporting on these conspiracy theory icebergs has now become part of the

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.480
 iceberg itself.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.920
 But with the conspiracy theory iceberg, because there's so many of them, some are interesting,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.920
 some aren't.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.200
 Some are too mysterious, we'll never know.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.800
 And some are very vague.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.600
 There is no conspiracy is often found on the lower levels, if not the lowest level of the

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600
 conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.080
 And it's something I looked at on and off over the years.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.640
 But that's an easy get, right?

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:30.760
 You could always say all conspiracy theories are fake, that this is all some sort of mind

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.120
 manipulation or like I've said before, a lot of conspiracy theories are fake to distract

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.600
 us from real conspiracy theories and that's not a new idea.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.200
 A lot of people have said that even before I started saying that.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.640
 I'm not saying I made that up or anything like that.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.080
 But it's a real easy one.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.800
 And so when I would see that on the conspiracy theory iceberg, I would think, oh, I could

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:53.760
 do an episode like that, but I'm really not saying anything new.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.600
 But a couple of weeks ago, I got an email from somebody and I think they solved the

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.840
 answer to there are no conspiracies.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.360
 It's very, very simple belief.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.560
 There are no conspiracy theories.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.720
 And this is it.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.840
 And I'm paraphrasing what this person sent me and I'm not going to reveal this person's

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.840
 name.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.200
 But this is the theory.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:25.800
 Conspiracy theories are used to pass information from one person to another.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.200
 That information we are not privy to.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.360
 Conspiracies don't really exist.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.360
 They're simply coded messages.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.880
 Now I've talked about that before with certain stories and I've talked about hitting codes

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.720
 being passed back and forth, but it actually that's just scratching the surface of this

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720
 one.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.920
 So, let's say I wanted to, let's say I'm a member of an organization.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.360
 Because you'd have to be really powerful to do this.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.460
 We're not talking about low level theories like monkeys don't exist, but it would explain

00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:03.160
 why theories like monkey don't exist doesn't become popular, but birds don't exist do.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.560
 Birds don't exist is a very, very well known conspiracy theory.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.280
 We covered it on the show a long time ago.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.360
 Carson was the first person to recommend it to me.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.160
 Thank you very much, Carson.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.960
 There's flyers in every major city.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.760
 It's very, it's a meme.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.760
 It's fake.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.920
 It was set up as a parody of conspiracy theories.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.880
 Why is that one more popular than monkeys don't exist?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:27.360
 Which is earnest at the very least they're both dumb, but one of them people honestly

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.880
 believe it that monkeys do not exist.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.640
 It's hilarious, right?

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640
 And it makes more sense.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.320
 I was talking about this on a live stream the other night.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.480
 We don't see monkeys in our daily life.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.040
 You can actually convince someone that monkeys don't exist.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.360
 It's a lot harder to convince someone that birds don't exist because we interact with

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.560
 birds all of the time.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.920
 Why is birds don't exist more popular than monkeys don't exist?

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.200
 Because what's happening is one group of people are trying to spread a message to another

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.960
 group of people.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.880
 They're using the conspiracy theories as code and we've talked about this before on the

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:07.880
 podcast, but we're going to go more in depth now because conspiracy theories blow up very

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.880
 quickly.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.640
 They get publicized very quickly.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.400
 The message gets spread very quickly and people are just looking at the surface of it.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.240
 They're not looking for the code.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:23.120
 It's an easy way to spread your message is to actually make it controversial, to make

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.040
 it shocking.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.920
 Look at that Lil Nas X dude.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:32.840
 He came out with that song called "Call Me By Your Name," "Montereo," whatever it is.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.720
 In this video he's like banging Satan and he's like doing a lap dance for Satan and

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.200
 then he breaks off Satan horns and becomes Satan.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.200
 And everyone, like this song had like millions of downloads and he was selling those shoes

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.200
 and all that stuff.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:50.520
 No one would have ever downloaded that song if it was him at a concert.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.600
 If it was just video of him singing to his fans, exact same song.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.880
 You make it controversial, you're going to get the message out.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.920
 Nobody would have had the same 100,000 people who downloaded his last song download this

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.920
 song.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.960
 Instead he has all of these YouTube videos and these political pundits talking about

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.960
 it.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.160
 100% strategy.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.360
 100% strategy behind that.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.160
 So if I want to send a message to you, I will craft a conspiracy theory called "Birds

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.440
 Don't Exist."

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.840
 And you know what the message is.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.320
 I know what the message is.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.600
 And I also want to take this moment to say a good example of this and Dead Rabbit recommends

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.600
 this.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.440
 I don't want to go into detail about it because it's such a good movie, I don't want to spoil

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.440
 it.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.480
 "Beyond the Silver Lake" or "Under the Silver Lake."

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.720
 If I want to recommend it, I should know the name of it.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.720
 I'll put it in the show notes.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.160
 I think it's "Under the Silver Lake."

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.000
 It's a movie about this, about how conspiracy theories are actually hidden messages and

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.280
 music and all the stuff that we think is satanic, illuminati stuff is actually two groups of

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.280
 people communicating with each other.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.320
 Two powerful groups of people communicating with each other.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.200
 It's a brilliant movie.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.960
 It's a great movie, I recommend checking it out.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.960
 But for what we're talking about here, let's get back to this core thing.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.080
 There is no conspiracy theory.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.520
 Conspiracy theories are just ways of people to pass messages back and forth.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.040
 It's still super vague, right?

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.440
 It would be easy for me to make that statement and then be like, "Okay, that's the end of

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.440
 the episode."

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:17.920
 I got an email from somebody who actually not only can specify what the message is, but

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.880
 he made good on it.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.160
 "Bugus, let's hop back in that carbonar copter.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.920
 We're leaving behind the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.880
 We're headed out to the New York Stock Exchange."

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:35.960
 Carbonar copter lands in the middle of Stock Exchange.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.920
 Everyone has to stop trading for the day.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.680
 Economic disaster, but we're here.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.200
 And the reason why we're here is this is the theory.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:49.120
 If you take a conspiracy theory like the Great Reset, which we talked about yesterday, and

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:56.600
 you strip it of all of the satanic stuff, of all of the illuminati stuff, you boil it

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:01.720
 down to its essence, its stock tips.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:07.080
 When they start talking about ways to, "We're going to invent this microchip and we're going

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.840
 to put it in your hand," and all that stuff, when that's the conspiracy theory, invest

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.720
 in biometric technology.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:22.640
 When you can find a conspiracy theory and boil it down to how the private market would

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:30.640
 benefit from that, that tells you who to invest in.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.960
 Think about it this way.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:32.960
 Monkeys aren't real.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:38.480
 The conspiracy theory is NASA is trying to prove that God doesn't exist, that evolution

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.600
 is real, and monkeys are a part of evolution, so they're faking it.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.040
 They're faking all of it.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.880
 Technically, I guess you can invest money in NASA.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.200
 Birds aren't real is all about how birds are actually spy technology.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.760
 They're drones.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.800
 They're sent out to investigate us, and they're all fake.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.520
 They're robots.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.680
 You would then, when that conspiracy theory started, you would go, "Okay, let's start

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.960
 moving investments towards unmanned aerial vehicles.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.560
 Let's start putting some of our investments in drone technology and surveillance technology.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.040
 Who's the hot camera maker right now?

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.600
 Who's making the best optical cameras for these drones?

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.040
 Invest in them."

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:22.320
 The theory is that conspiracy theories like birds aren't real was a way for people to

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:28.280
 spread stock tips to commit insider trading, that they're all fake.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:34.120
 When you look at stuff about microchips being implanted, invest in the biometrics.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.280
 When you start looking at stuff about the singularity and the singularity is going to

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.840
 take stuff up, start investing in companies that are trying to do AI.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.200
 One organization is looking at this stuff, and they know that they're going to have a

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.080
 huge product come out.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.680
 They see that they're going to have their stock is going to blow up.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.840
 They know something's going on to alert their fellow conspirators.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:58.360
 They craft a conspiracy theory that's based on what they know is going to happen.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.860
 It's not that they know that the great reset's going to happen.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:06.920
 The great reset, the reason why that's more popular than other conspiracy theories in this

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:12.000
 theory, is it's being pushed because they're trying to get other people to invest in the

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.360
 products that prop up the "great reset."

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.360
 It's fake.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.200
 It doesn't exist.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.280
 But you will eat bugs is a thing that people are constantly saying when they talk about

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.640
 great reset.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.200
 The whole thing in this theory, the whole thing was set up so you would start investing in

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.120
 companies that grow bugs.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.200
 Now, you go, "Jason, maybe that's the horse leading the cart or the cart leading the horse.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.480
 If the great reset is coming, they're going to force everyone to eat."

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.240
 I can't believe I'm still talking about the stupid great reset.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.240
 The great reset is coming.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.600
 They're going to force everyone to eat bugs.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.840
 Of course you should invest in bugs.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.320
 But the great reset is something that's so hypothetical.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.000
 They're not saying it's going to happen tomorrow.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.520
 But according to this theory, if you invest in bugs now, if you invest in bug farms now,

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.880
 you're going to start making money now.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:03.120
 In fact, the person who sent me this story claims to have made hundreds of thousands

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.800
 of dollars by simply following the biggest conspiracy theories out there, stripping them

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.920
 of the Satanic and the Illuminati nonsense and investing in the core technologies talked

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.520
 about in those conspiracy theories, no matter how outlandish the conspiracy theory is.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.560
 Even if it's something that's not supposed to take place until the future, not supposed

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.400
 to take place for a while, something like transhumanism, you boil it down to stuff you

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.400
 can invest in.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.800
 This person has claimed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.040
 This isn't, and they were trying to get me to invest in them.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.040
 I've talked to this person a lot.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.760
 Way before this, we were actually interacting.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.400
 They listened to the show.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.000
 They're a fan of the show.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.440
 They approached me one day and said, "Hey, do you know of any new big conspiracy theories

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.440
 that are coming up?"

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.440
 I said, "No, not really."

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.200
 They said, "Well, this is why I'm asking because here's my theory."

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.600
 I've actually taken this theory over the past couple months and made a lot of money.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.360
 If you could figure out what the next big conspiracy theories are going to be, it can

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:03.240
 give people tips on how to become rich.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.840
 Is that the reason, and this has been a question that I've talked about a lot on the show,

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.120
 why some conspiracy theories are more popular than others?

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.760
 Is it because some conspiracy theories are artificially propped up not because of Russian

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.680
 disinformation trying to prop up flat earth to make Americans look stupid?

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.120
 That's a popular conspiracy theory out there.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.880
 Not because they're building up these fake conspiracy theories to blind us from the

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.960
 truth.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:32.600
 The reason why trees are mountains or mountains are trees and trees are bushes, however that

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:38.600
 one was set up or monkeys don't exist, because those are organic conspiracy theories.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.360
 Those are actually thought up by individuals.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:47.040
 It's just an interesting piece of this puzzle because that is always the question, why is

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:53.040
 flat earth more popular than so many other conspiracy theories?

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040
 It's dumb.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.680
 It's observably dumb.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.080
 YouTube promotes it.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.280
 YouTube lets the algorithm run with this flat earth stuff.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.280
 Why?

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.560
 Is someone benefiting from it?

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:10.080
 Is it as simple as when you see the flat earth stuff come up, it was to promote GPS technology?

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.960
 When you can boil down these, it doesn't work with every conspiracy theory.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.920
 It doesn't work with the obscure ones.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:22.000
 But when you can boil down these popular conspiracy theories that everyone knows about and find

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.680
 out how the private sector would benefit from technologies in that conspiracy theory, you

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.080
 can make money apparently.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.360
 You can make a lot of money.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:38.640
 Now again, you could argue if people are talking about putting biometrics inside of you, and

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.600
 that's being talked about in the news and you invest in those companies, it's because

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.000
 they plan on putting biometrics inside of you.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.560
 They've been talking about putting biometrics inside of you since 1992.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.920
 I've been hearing about the microchips under the skin since 1992.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.520
 And you could go, well, they're doing it in Sweden.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.040
 They're doing it at this nightclub in Sweden.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:02.040
 They have never, ever been able to fully implement a microchip under the skin.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.960
 They've been talking about this almost my entire life.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:11.800
 But companies have been making these things and you may be able to take a look at when

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:16.020
 those conspiracy theories started, when those conspiracy theories start to dip and they're

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:21.200
 not as popular and then they peak again in popularity, and look at the profits, look

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.520
 at the stock increases of those companies.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.560
 It's not that people, legitimate stock investors are reading godlike productions and they're

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.000
 super scared that everyone's going to get a microchip.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.080
 It's not that the conspiracy theory makes people worried and they're investing in it

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.840
 or makes them hopeful and they want everyone to get a microchip and they're investing in

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.840
 microchips.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.840
 It's that the conspiracy theory is false.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:52.800
 It's 100% fake and it's a way to tell your friends what you are investing in and what

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.840
 you should invest in without ever getting caught for insider trading, without it ever being

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.160
 tracked back to you.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.200
 And the conspiracy theory just lives on.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:09.600
 It would explain why some conspiracy theories are more popular and longer lasting than others.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.960
 All these conspiracy theories we investigate and we're trying to solve these mysteries

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:23.120
 could be just wrapping paper around a gift that the rich people are giving each other.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:32.040
 We never get to until you crack the code and start investing as well.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.000
 So the next time you see a conspiracy theory pop up and you start to see it gain popularity

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.800
 and you have a little money to throw around, maybe you should try this too.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.240
 Boil it down to its essence.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.240
 What are the technologies needed to make this conspiracy theory work?

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.200
 And see if it actually could be insider trading.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:01.200
 However, the flip side could be that it's not.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:09.640
 That it actually is investors knowing the conspiracy theory is true and they're trying

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:16.960
 to make as much money as they can before the world ends.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:23.280
 You could be investing in a microchip company and making some short term gains because you

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.240
 thought it was just a code.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.640
 But when that microchip is being forced into your head against your will and you cry one

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:42.000
 final teardrop before your emotions are completely overwritten, you will remember that your investment

00:38:42.000 --> 00:39:04.240
 is in the future of mankind.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:21.680
 Thank you.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.260
 (upbeat music)

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.840
 (upbeat music)

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.420
 (upbeat music)
