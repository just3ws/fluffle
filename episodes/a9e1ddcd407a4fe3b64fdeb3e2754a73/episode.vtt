00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.680
 Mental health parity is the law requiring health insurance coverage for mental health

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.480
 or substance use disorders that is no more restrictive than your physical health coverage.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.600
 That means if you're dealing with depression or anxiety, your access to mental health coverage

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.560
 is comparable to your access to physical health coverage for a broken arm or leg.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.900
 It's important to learn and understand the laws that protect you when you use your health

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.480
 insurance for treatment.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480
 Know your rights.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.640
 Go to GetCoveredIllinois.gov for more information on mental health parity.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 A cuddly cryptid, a woman washed away returns to the same place she was swept from a year

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.200
 and a half later, and then we take a look at the terrifying story of Texas's own candy

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 lady.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.040
 Was there a woman leaving candy on children's windowsills?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.040
 And did her trap work today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.880
 I hope you're having a great day too.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.080
 You are listening to the only podcast that will not discuss the Mueller report this week.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.560
 I repeat, the only podcast.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.840
 The only podcast.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.840
 They all...

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.320
 You don't have to worry about that at all.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.480
 This is your refuge from politics.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.280
 We're gonna go ahead and get started here now.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 I kinda cheated in the beginning when I said it was a cuddly cryptid.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.080
 Let me go ahead and get started here.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.960
 So I was sent this link the other day.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.560
 I'm gonna read this to you and I want you to see if you...

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.040
 This is such a bizarre description.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.840
 I'm gonna read this to you and I'm gonna see if you can guess the creature we're talking

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.520
 about.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.880
 Its appearance is...

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.640
 And I'm leaving out a few key details.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.840
 Okay, because otherwise it gives it away.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.120
 Its appearance is characterized by dark blue hair, a huge mouth devoid of teeth, large

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.720
 bulging eyes.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.000
 His voice is serious and abrupt and his speech is simplified, using an abundance of infinitives

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.760
 and emitting other linguistic compliments.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.120
 His diet includes muffins, donuts, apples, bananas, lettuce, as well as other inedible

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.040
 items such as salt and pepper dispensers, traffic signs, towels, pins, typewriters,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.000
 telephones, motorcycles, Peabody Awards, a truck, a safe, a Volkswagen Beetle, and the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.800
 letter of the day.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.940
 So that's the description of Cookie Monster.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.640
 That's the Spanish Wikipedia description of the Cookie Monster.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.520
 Now the English version of Cookie Monster does not have any of this, which I think is

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.240
 absolutely hilarious.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.520
 The English version of Wikipedia is just like, you know who we're talking about.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.680
 It's Cookie Monster.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.560
 But the Spanish version decides to create this horrifying image of this creature with

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.480
 no missing all of his teeth and a huge mouth, bulging eyeballs, and I guess those are accurate

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.400
 descriptions of Cookie Monster, but they're terrifying nonetheless.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.880
 The reason why I came across this was because in the previous, the episode I did about shape

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.480
 shifting women who eat men, I think it was the title, something like that.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.120
 It was maybe four or five episodes ago.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.800
 I forget very quickly.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.680
 I described there as one of the cryptid women, one of the shape shifters, who was described

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.080
 as having cookie-like hair.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.680
 And I actually had two listeners chime in on that.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.800
 Both of them kind of said it's probably a translation error.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.560
 On YouTube, Edward... Edward Baez?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.360
 Anyways, Edward said maybe they meant like empanadas.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.480
 Like it's the hair was flaky.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.560
 And then Jimmy emailed me and he said maybe it's like churros, like dreadlocks.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.880
 I think it is a translation error.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.040
 According also to this Spanish Wikipedia page, Cookie Monster's best friend is Gustavo Frog.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.160
 That's just weird to me.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.640
 I always thought Kermit the Frog was fairly...

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.600
 I know more about the history of Cookie Monster now than I ever thought I would know.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.560
 Definitely more than I ever learned on Sesame Street.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.560
 He started off stealing cereal.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.600
 His original name was the Wheel...

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.120
 His original name was the Wheeljacker because he stole a wheel-shaped cereal.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.520
 And then there he... his best buddy was a guy named Flute Snatcher.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.200
 Now I don't... because he ate fruit... because he stole flute-shaped cereal.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.840
 Now again, those might be translation errors as well.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.880
 But that's a little bit about... who are we talking about again?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.880
 Oh yeah, Cookie Monster.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.360
 He's also known as Mostro De La Galetes.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.320
 So I think that's like Monster of the Cookies or something.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.440
 And in Latin America, he simply goes by the name Lucas.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.560
 And I guess when Disney bought... they used to have different names everywhere.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.560
 When Disney bought them up, they said, "Nope, it's Kermit the Frog, it's Cookie Monster,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.240
 they didn't shave... they used to localize everything."

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.400
 So now if you grew up with Gustavo Frog and Lucas running around, you're like, "Who's

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 that guy?

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.080
 Who's the Cookie Monster?"

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.480
 Om nom nom nom nom.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.720
 That might have gone on a little longer than I originally planned.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.160
 I don't know, I found that fascinating.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.240
 And thanks guys for your explanations of Cookie-like hair.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.640
 They're probably pretty likely.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.680
 Now we're gonna go on... you know, it's actually been a really interesting week.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.840
 Conspiracy and weirdness-wise.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.880
 I got a lot of stories that are fairly recent coming out.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.440
 But one of the ones that popped up, like maybe in the past few days, was really bizarre.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.440
 And from the first thing you hear, you're like, "That's absolutely impossible."

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.480
 And then you go, "But... weirder things have happened."

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.560
 And then you keep reading into it and you're like...

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.120
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.040
 So we are going back a year.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.440
 We're going back to January 2017.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.720
 And we're traveling to the island of Java, the tastiest sounding island other than Cupcake

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.720
 Island.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.480
 We go to Java Island.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.680
 And we're sitting on the beach.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.480
 We're enjoying the nice weather.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.480
 It's beautiful out.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.480
 The sun.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.080
 There's hot chicks walking around in the kines.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.880
 And we're just drinking a Mai Tai.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.760
 I don't know what they drink there.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.320
 We're drinking an alcoholic drink.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.360
 We're drinking iced Java with some liquor in it.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360
 We're just hanging out.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.760
 And we see this woman with her sister and I think one of their sons.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.760
 She was with two other people.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.600
 I'm just making up family members.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.920
 Oh, it was like her eighth cousin.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.880
 And she was out there with at least her sister.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.080
 I know that for sure.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.800
 The woman's name is Naining Sunar-sir.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.040
 Nairing Sunar-si.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.800
 We'll just call her Naining.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.160
 I probably pronounced it that wrong as well.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.360
 But anyways, Naining, she was a 52-year-old woman.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.880
 She's out on a beach vacation with her sister and an other family member.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.880
 Could be anyone in her genealogical tree.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.520
 It's her great ancestor.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.520
 They're out at the beach.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.520
 They're enjoying the fun.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.520
 They're enjoying the sun.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.200
 We're sitting there, me and you, drinking our Java-infused drinks.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.360
 Alcohol in the Java.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.440
 Anyways, the point is the mood is set.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.720
 I've set the mood.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720
 We're sitting there.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.720
 Seagulls.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720
 [crow cawing]

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.720
 Applying by.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.600
 And a freak wave shows up.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.200
 Now luckily we're sitting a little bit farther up the shore.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.200
 Well, I am.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.600
 I don't know about you, but a freak wave shows up.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.480
 And we look and Naining is gone.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.200
 And her sister's like, "No!"

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.360
 And her unidentified family member was like, "No!"

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.360
 And they start to try to find her, but she's swept out to sea.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.920
 And they call the authorities.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.440
 The authorities come out and they're like, "Well, we'll have like Coast Guard people show up

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.280
 looking for her, but it's a big ocean, guys.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280
 It's a big ocean."

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.280
 And they don't find her.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.320
 They don't find her.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.520
 Fast forward to a couple months ago, like a month or two ago, actually.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.960
 Her father, who was not at the beach, we can eliminate him from who was a guy at the beach.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:13.480
 Her father started having these dreams of Naining on the beach saying, "Look for me, father.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.480
 Look for me, father.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.120
 I'm coming back.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.800
 I'm coming back."

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.000
 And the father at first just dismisses the dreams.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.840
 But the dreams keep coming and he's having these dreams of his daughter standing on this

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.240
 beach beckoning him to come and find her.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.360
 So he does and the other family members go to the beach to try to find her.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.520
 And for several weeks they're looking for her.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:46.280
 And then one day they go out to the beach and they see Naining laying there in the sand,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.480
 waves crashing over her.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.200
 They're like, "Oh my God, they call rescue people.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.800
 Medics, I can think they're commonly called.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.440
 They call the apopatrol.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.800
 They get these medics out there and they take her home and there's all this video footage

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.400
 of this woman being rescued.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:10.960
 But it's in this language, wherever she's from, it's like Thailand or Indonesia or somewhere

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.960
 around there.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960
 It's a language that...

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.460
 Let me get a point.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.800
 It's a language I don't understand.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.440
 And I would now see this is where the...

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.720
 Now I think you see where I'm going with this.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720
 So language I don't understand.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.320
 It's a language I think most people don't understand unless you're in that region.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.080
 It's not a common second language in the Western world.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.440
 There's video footage of a woman of Naining being taken home and she's like laying there

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.400
 and stuff like that and all these medics around here and they're speaking in her native language.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.560
 And this is where it gets weird.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.380
 Well that was already weird because that gap between the time she got washed away in January

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:55.740
 2017, she washed up recently so she had been washed away for a year and a half and a kicker

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.180
 to that.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.500
 She was found wearing the same clothes.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.340
 Now on the beach she was wearing a yellow dress and when she washed up she was wearing

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.780
 the same yellow dress.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.100
 Now she is still completely like out of it right now.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.580
 She has not been able to say where she was during that time or how she survived.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.220
 She is in communicato.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:23.200
 She's a little loopy and the family is saying please just give us some time to take care

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.600
 of her.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.060
 That really came to being publicized.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.880
 That really broke the news earlier in the week.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.280
 And the narrative I just told you is there's a ton of articles on this.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.680
 I'm linking maybe three or four in the show notes but there's a ton of articles about

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.680
 this.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.360
 It was like in the Daily Mail so it's like semi reputable, yeah I would say semi reputable

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.640
 news it's mostly a tabloid.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.160
 But if you want to know that Scary Spice and who's the other one?

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160
 Who's the British Spice?

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:59.900
 I guess they're all British Spice but Scary Spice and the Spice Girl who's Jerry Hallwell.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.940
 They were banged during the Spice Girls like the original run not the reunion.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.500
 Those two were banging each other.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.600
 That's the level of news in the Daily Mail.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.880
 And I did read that article by the way.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.240
 Was it Sexy Spice?

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.440
 But anyway it doesn't matter.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.440
 They banged.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.440
 That's the point of that.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.280
 So the Daily Mail is a tabloid but it wasn't just in the Daily Mail.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.080
 It's in a lot of paranormal websites.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.280
 It's in a lot of like regular news websites because it's such a bizarre story.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.280
 Here's the kicker.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.240
 So I started looking into this because I was like that's absolutely fascinating if true

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.840
 and it's kind of fascinating if it's not because it just shows how quickly rumors spread.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.240
 So I watched the video.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:44.160
 I didn't understand a word of it but I watched the video and the video is purported to be

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.240
 her being taken off the beach and taken home.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.080
 She's not wearing a yellow dress.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.600
 She's wearing a blue top.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.280
 So immediately I said either she was taken somewhere else and they changed her clothes

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.360
 or that video's fake and it's being attached to this story.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.720
 And sure enough I found when I was continuing to research this.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.120
 One of the articles said here's some photos that are being purported to be Ninning but

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.920
 these are actually photos of someone being let out of a mental hospital and taken home.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.720
 And what's weird is that this footage and these photos are being used in almost every

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:26.760
 article but only one pointed out people on WhatsApp have identified that those photos

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.760
 are from a totally different news story in the same area.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.120
 So that's not Ninning.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.320
 Has nothing to do with this story.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.560
 So right off the bat the video evidence is not true at all.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:43.400
 And then I go okay well that's a big spoiler and now I'm thinking the story's false and

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400
 here's the thing.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.040
 This is the, to me this is the detail that stuck out.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.840
 I will accept that someone can get swept out to sea and washed away and go into some sort

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.160
 of magical portal land or something like that and come back.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.680
 I don't believe it off hand.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.040
 I kind of did this one but I guess not really, I didn't believe it but I thought I'm open

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.280
 to the idea of like dimensional portals and stuff like that.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.080
 What I thought was weird so let's say that the story is true and she begins giving her

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.400
 dad instructions to come to the beach and find her.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.640
 And I guess I should have said this earlier.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.520
 She was found at the same location that she had gotten washed away.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.440
 That actually was the original story.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.120
 But then the story evolved that it wasn't the same spot it's 500 meters away whatever.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:34.360
 So if I'm trying to get someone to come to my location I'm not going to start asking

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.920
 them to come out two months before I show back magically up in reality.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.000
 Because it's very very likely because she had been coming to her dad in the dreams for

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.400
 a long time and then he still had to go out there every day for a couple weeks to find,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.040
 every day for a couple weeks at any point he could have just been like ah it's just,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.680
 I'm having these nightmares.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.240
 Here's a pro tip, if you're ever a ghost or trapped in a magical realm and you need

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.280
 to send a message, don't send the message too early.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.920
 Because then they're going to go out and get discouraged and go back or people are going

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.920
 to start thinking they're crazy.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.720
 Send them the night before you leave Oz or whatever.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.560
 So I thought that was a weird detail too.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.160
 The dad going out there every single day looking for her.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.640
 They could have said he had the dream and then it was so vivid that he went out the next

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.840
 morning and she was there.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.040
 That would be a little more believable.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.360
 But really I think at this point none of it's believable.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.120
 I would be surprised if Nainin actually exists at all.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.440
 Oh and here's another thing, this was something weird.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.200
 She's 52 years old.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.680
 How old's her dad?

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.920
 In his 70's?

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:42.960
 He would be in his really, he would be in his late 60's minimum if she's 52.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:49.240
 And she had a sister so yeah he was probably like if she's 52 or 53 whatever he would have

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.560
 had to be, I look back over at my notes, if he would have to be, let's say he had the

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.480
 kids when he was like 20.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.480
 So he's like and you have this old, you're harassing this old man.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.440
 You're trapped in another dimension and your ghost keeps waking up a 70 year old man saying

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.160
 go to the beach today, go to the beach today and he's like oh my arthritis and she's like

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.560
 I don't care.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.320
 So that detail was kind of weird too that she was so old.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:18.920
 And I'm thinking that they may have made her that old to match the photos in the video

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.280
 that was going to be attached to the story.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.760
 Weird, weird story.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:30.440
 Don't think it's true but there's definitely either someone concocted it on purpose to

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.120
 play some sort of prank or it was just a, I wouldn't be surprised to find out if this

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.920
 is legends have been going around for a long time in that area.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:44.520
 This story and it's constantly being updated every 10, 15 years and this time it actually

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.840
 just went viral, which is a possibility as well.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.640
 But that is actually a good segue to our last segment because we're going to talk about

00:15:52.640 --> 00:16:00.720
 again another urban legend that it kind of, it stands in the same categories as this one

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:08.760
 where we don't know whether or not it's real but far, far more sinister, far more sinister.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:15.600
 The year, well the decade, the early 1900s.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.840
 The place, Texas, somewhere in Texas.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.440
 The year in the 1900s.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.200
 The location, some place in Texas.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200
 The biggest state.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.080
 Oh, that's the second biggest state but a giant state somewhere in there.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.760
 There's a little kid sitting in his room.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.760
 It's nighttime.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.560
 He doesn't have comic books or video games or anything.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.400
 He's probably just looking at wood carvings of Spider-Man.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.200
 Has a little candle under his bed sheet to read.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.280
 House goes up in flames.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.560
 But then they move to another house and this little kid sitting in bed, no candles this

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:56.360
 time and he hears a noise at his window sill.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.320
 And he sees a shape kind of move away in the darkness.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.600
 The little boy opens the window and out on the sill are little pieces of old timey candy.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600
 To him, new candy.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.280
 He's like, "Mmm, sass, Sparilla.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.880
 Mmm, molasses flavored Jolly Ranchers."

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.520
 And he begins to eat the candy and he notices in one of the wrappers.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.360
 And it's so funny, I'm talking like he's delicate.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.320
 He's probably like, "Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah."

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.800
 Cookie monstering that.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.640
 He was lucasin it.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.320
 The next day after his sugar coma wears off, he notices one of the wrappers, has a message

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.800
 on the inside of it.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.200
 And it says, "Come play with me."

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.360
 And it's signed, "The Candy Lady."

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.520
 So the Candy Lady story, what we know about the Candy Lady is this.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:50.240
 There was a woman named Clara Crane and she was born in 1853.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.600
 She was born in 1853.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.240
 She was married to a drunk man.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.720
 He was a farmer and one day he was out drinking and running the farm stuff and their daughter

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.760
 was out there as well.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:06.720
 And due to his alcohol induced negligence, the daughter is killed in an unspecified way.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.000
 The mom is just completely just toast over this.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.480
 Her mom can't believe, Clara Crane can't believe that her husband killed the daughter

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.480
 even if it was an accident.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.000
 She then poisons some candy and gives it to him and he's like, "Mmm, Sarsparilla, my

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.480
 favorite, ahhh, ahhh."

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.480
 And dies.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:36.440
 She is arrested but she's found insane so she is put into the North Texas insane asylum.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.160
 And it is there where her man is truly shows, I mean not just killing her husband, she makes

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.760
 a new daughter, she makes a new daughter out of a bedsheet.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.960
 So she takes a bedsheet and she rips it up and binds it together and now she has like

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:55.960
 a Blair Witch like effigy, style daughter that she carries around the hospital with

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.440
 her.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.160
 And she talks to it like it's her daughter and I don't understand the like did she feed

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160
 it?

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.280
 Was it all like completely, was it all like covered in gross pea soup as she's trying

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.280
 to feed her daughter?

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.440
 Like, but I guess insanity is insanity and she probably imagines it's eating the pea

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.560
 soup but in reality everyone else is like, "Can you wash your daughter?"

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.680
 She's like, "I bathe her every day."

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.040
 They're like, "No, wash your machine please."

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:25.360
 But anyways, due to overcrowding there's talk about letting Clara Crane go because she's

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.760
 such a nice woman.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.280
 The doctors are like, "Yeah, she's pretty cool."

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:33.480
 I mean other than that disgusting creature, that disgusting golem she's created that she

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.160
 carries around and tells everyone it's her daughter.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.560
 Other than that she's trying to get it to date other bedsheets in the hospital.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.800
 She's like introducing it, takes it down to the laundromat and she's like, "You are the

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.720
 queen of the ball, my daughter."

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.080
 She ends up writing a letter to her sister, Aggie, which is a great name.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.160
 This is the letter that was written, "Dearest Aggie, I am elated.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.880
 I have been informed by Dr. Matthews, I almost read that it's Dr. Mattress.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:09.680
 I've been informed by Dr. Matthews that Marcy and I, Marcy's the bedsheet baby, that Marcy

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.880
 and I will be returning home in less than three weeks.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.320
 As you can imagine, Marcy can barely contain her excitement.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.440
 Every night she asks, "Is tomorrow the day we go home, mother?"

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.480
 Very soon I will be able to tell her, "Yes."

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.560
 The idea of the talking bedsheet is bizarre.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.460
 Like if someone was actually carrying around a bedsheet baby, that's weird enough.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.400
 But then to imagine it's having conversations with her because in conversations with the

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.640
 kid, I mean does the mattress go, "Why is the sun in the sky?"

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.840
 Well because it is.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.840
 Why?

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.840
 Well that's where God put it.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840
 Why?

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.720
 Well, I mean kids can be quite annoying.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.960
 So I guess if you had a mattress baby, it would actually be a little better than a real

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.320
 kid because then it wouldn't keep annoying you.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:05.400
 But anyways, Marcy, the bedsheet, and Clara Crane do get let out of the North Texas insane

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.400
 asylum.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.960
 And then about five years after that, kids go missing.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.720
 So let's go back to the herb and the legend part of this.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.240
 This has an interesting wrap up.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:25.240
 So in this town, apparently in her hometown, her unnamed hometown in Texas, children started

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.600
 getting candy put up on their window sills.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.040
 And a kid goes missing.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040
 And the cops are baffled.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.560
 Again, we're back in the 1900s here.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.200
 The cops are baffled as to what happened to this kid.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.760
 Snuck out in the middle of the night.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.600
 Couple weeks later, another kid goes missing and now the cops are really, really concerned

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.240
 about what's going on.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.960
 And it is then that the parents learn about candy being left on window sills.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.760
 Kids had been eating it and not telling their parents because they're not supposed to eat

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760
 candy.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.200
 They're not supposed to eat candies from strangers.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.960
 And more importantly, they're not supposed to eat in bed.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.400
 But they did all three of those things.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.520
 So parents started to warn their kids, "Do not eat candy on your window sills."

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520
 Don't do it.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.640
 You're going to get snatched by the candy lady.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.920
 This all came to a head when a boy who was previously found missing, there was a farmer

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.480
 or a rancher or somebody was walking along a goalie.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:23.800
 They found the body of a 10-year-old boy with his eyeballs gouged out and his pockets full

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.120
 of candy.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.760
 Now the interesting thing about this story, every piece of evidence that makes you think

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.240
 it has proof seems to be fake.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.240
 But you don't know.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.280
 And there's basically two separate stories here.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.600
 So let's look at the story of Clara Crane first, because that's the one that has the

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.360
 most specific stuff.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:53.480
 Clara Crane in Texas, as far as I could find on Ancestry.com, there was a Clara Crane in

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.720
 Texas, but she was born five years before her mother.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.240
 So the story of her being born in 1853, or however the word, I might have misstated it

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.960
 earlier in 1953, but she was supposedly born in 1853, or in that time period, the only

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:15.800
 person listed having a daughter named Clara Crane was born after that.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:22.080
 There used to be a place called North Texas Insane Asylum, so that place did exist.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:29.200
 And there was a short news article about Clara Crane being sentenced to prison for the murder

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200
 of her husband.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.840
 But the article is not sourced, it doesn't say what newspaper it comes from.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.840
 It's like a blurry scan of a presumable newspaper article.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.840
 So it could be fake.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.440
 We don't have a way to track that back.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.440
 In the story of Clara Crane, it does not list where she's from.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.200
 It's just a small town in Texas that takes place in Texas.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.080
 We have a newspaper article that specifies, she was 28 years old.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.000
 This happened in Ellis County, and she was tried at the Hattuck Street Courthouse.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.120
 So we get more details from the article.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:09.560
 So that makes me think that the story of Clara Crane existed before the story that people

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.480
 tell their kids about, "Ooh, watch out, she could get you."

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.400
 But you end up being on the far, far north of Texas.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.400
 It's left vague for a purpose.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.200
 The article that's being purported to be true specifies this was in Ellis County.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.360
 So the fact there's a discrepancy between the two makes me think that either this, the

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.840
 Clara Crane actually did exist, and the details have kind of been wiped clean to make the

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.360
 story more universal.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.040
 Or someone came up with the legend of Clara Crane, and then someone faked the evidence,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.040
 and when they were faking it, they're like, "They just can't put in the news article

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:47.520
 somewhere in Texas that this court happened whoever created this article had to give more

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.520
 detail."

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.920
 Chicken or egg, chicken or egg, we don't know.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:57.440
 But like I said, the person who's supposedly Clara Crane, I could only find one on Ancestry.com,

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.120
 but that doesn't really mean anything because not everyone's listed in Ancestry.com.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.400
 So I'm back to square one.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.400
 Is it square one?

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.080
 Or is it square, yeah, I'm back to square one.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.680
 I'm back to the beginning of the board game.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.960
 That's where that saying comes from, Jason, don't be an idiot.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.200
 So I think that's where that saying comes from.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.600
 But anyways, did Clara Crane exist?

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.520
 We don't know.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.240
 It's super bizarre.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.600
 It's such an unknown urban legend conspiracy theory, I think outside of Texas, that not

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.320
 a lot of people have delved into it.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.360
 I've found a lot of resources on it, and a few of them were very like, tried to dig into

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.200
 it, but since there's not a lot of information to go on, it's rough.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.920
 So then let's jump, so did Clara Crane exist?

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.920
 Who knows?

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.240
 Clara Crane may have actually existed at some point, but did she make a bedsheet, baby?

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.040
 Did she write letters to her sister?

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.640
 We don't know.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.400
 We don't have any of that information.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.520
 And then let's go to the crimes.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.000
 Missing children in Texas, possibly Ellis County, Texas.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.600
 Kids going missing, candy being left on windowsills, a young boy found with his eyes gouged out

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.520
 in his pockets full of candy.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.720
 Did those incidents happen?

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.440
 Again.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.760
 Because of now we don't have any proof of any of this stuff.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.320
 The crimes are at this point over a hundred years old.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:26.360
 It is quite possible that this urban legend came out of something.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:32.120
 Either Clara Crane is true, and they created the story of the Candy Lady as a warning towards

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120
 kids.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.840
 You know, don't take candy from strangers is really the point of the story.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:43.720
 Or the Candy Lady crimes are true that three kids went missing and one was found dead with

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.440
 candy in its pockets.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.200
 And the Clara Crane story was a retcon to kind of give this madness some sort of face

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.040
 to it.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.760
 Or most chilling that both parts are true.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.760
 Both parts are true.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.120
 There was a Clara Crane that was sent to North Texas.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.760
 It was actually North Texas lunatic asylum.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.640
 Whether that part of the story is true and then later back in Ellis County kids went

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.000
 missing with candy on their windowsills.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.960
 There's been a lot of stories we've covered on this show that are only like four or five

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.240
 years old that are completely horrific.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:21.880
 Like the guy who held up, who did the school shooting and the sexual assault at the same

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.880
 time.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.920
 That's been pretty much a race from the social consciousness.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.360
 We have the speargun murder story that's been erased from the social consciousness.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:35.360
 So there are stories even recently that you think, man how can people forget about this?

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.960
 And when we're going back a hundred years it's very likely or I should say it's possible

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.440
 that these series of incidents played out.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.640
 The idea of not taking candy from strangers is something that I think most parents, if

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.040
 not all parents, really worldwide instill in their kids.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.680
 What's interesting is that if this case is real, this may have been the origin of that

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.520
 saying "don't take candy from strangers".

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:07.600
 It's weird to think that the phrase "don't take candy from strangers" is used so commonly

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.040
 it's like a trope.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.920
 You can have a television show called Strangers with Candy.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920
 You get it.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.160
 You get that saying basically, it's ingrained in our consciousness.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:23.560
 And the crazy thing is, is that saying may be based on a real set of disappearance and

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.200
 murders.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.280
 That saying we all use could have started in a little county in Texas.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.040
 When a boy unwrapped a piece of candy, it said "come play with me".

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.480
 He crawled out the window to the dark shape standing in the field.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:49.000
 And that was the last thing he saw before his eyes were cut out.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.840
