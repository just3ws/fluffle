1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,680
 Mental health parity is the law requiring health insurance coverage for mental health

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,480
 or substance use disorders that is no more restrictive than your physical health coverage.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,600
 That means if you're dealing with depression or anxiety, your access to mental health coverage

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,560
 is comparable to your access to physical health coverage for a broken arm or leg.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,900
 It's important to learn and understand the laws that protect you when you use your health

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,480
 insurance for treatment.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
 Know your rights.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,640
 Go to GetCoveredIllinois.gov for more information on mental health parity.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,680
 A cuddly cryptid, a woman washed away returns to the same place she was swept from a year

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,200
 and a half later, and then we take a look at the terrifying story of Texas's own candy

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 lady.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,040
 Was there a woman leaving candy on children's windowsills?

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,040
 And did her trap work today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:06,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
 I'm having a great day.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,880
 I hope you're having a great day too.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,080
 You are listening to the only podcast that will not discuss the Mueller report this week.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,560
 I repeat, the only podcast.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,840
 The only podcast.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
 They all...

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,320
 You don't have to worry about that at all.

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,480
 This is your refuge from politics.

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,280
 We're gonna go ahead and get started here now.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
 I kinda cheated in the beginning when I said it was a cuddly cryptid.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,080
 Let me go ahead and get started here.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,960
 So I was sent this link the other day.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
 I'm gonna read this to you and I want you to see if you...

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,040
 This is such a bizarre description.

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,840
 I'm gonna read this to you and I'm gonna see if you can guess the creature we're talking

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,520
 about.

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,880
 Its appearance is...

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,640
 And I'm leaving out a few key details.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,840
 Okay, because otherwise it gives it away.

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:02,120
 Its appearance is characterized by dark blue hair, a huge mouth devoid of teeth, large

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,720
 bulging eyes.

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,000
 His voice is serious and abrupt and his speech is simplified, using an abundance of infinitives

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,760
 and emitting other linguistic compliments.

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,120
 His diet includes muffins, donuts, apples, bananas, lettuce, as well as other inedible

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,040
 items such as salt and pepper dispensers, traffic signs, towels, pins, typewriters,

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:35,000
 telephones, motorcycles, Peabody Awards, a truck, a safe, a Volkswagen Beetle, and the

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,800
 letter of the day.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,940
 So that's the description of Cookie Monster.

46
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,640
 That's the Spanish Wikipedia description of the Cookie Monster.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,520
 Now the English version of Cookie Monster does not have any of this, which I think is

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,240
 absolutely hilarious.

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,520
 The English version of Wikipedia is just like, you know who we're talking about.

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,680
 It's Cookie Monster.

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,560
 But the Spanish version decides to create this horrifying image of this creature with

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,480
 no missing all of his teeth and a huge mouth, bulging eyeballs, and I guess those are accurate

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,400
 descriptions of Cookie Monster, but they're terrifying nonetheless.

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,880
 The reason why I came across this was because in the previous, the episode I did about shape

55
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,480
 shifting women who eat men, I think it was the title, something like that.

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,120
 It was maybe four or five episodes ago.

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,800
 I forget very quickly.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,680
 I described there as one of the cryptid women, one of the shape shifters, who was described

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,080
 as having cookie-like hair.

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,680
 And I actually had two listeners chime in on that.

61
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,800
 Both of them kind of said it's probably a translation error.

62
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,560
 On YouTube, Edward... Edward Baez?

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,360
 Anyways, Edward said maybe they meant like empanadas.

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,480
 Like it's the hair was flaky.

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,560
 And then Jimmy emailed me and he said maybe it's like churros, like dreadlocks.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,880
 I think it is a translation error.

67
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,040
 According also to this Spanish Wikipedia page, Cookie Monster's best friend is Gustavo Frog.

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,160
 That's just weird to me.

69
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,640
 I always thought Kermit the Frog was fairly...

70
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,600
 I know more about the history of Cookie Monster now than I ever thought I would know.

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,560
 Definitely more than I ever learned on Sesame Street.

72
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
 He started off stealing cereal.

73
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,600
 His original name was the Wheel...

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,120
 His original name was the Wheeljacker because he stole a wheel-shaped cereal.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,520
 And then there he... his best buddy was a guy named Flute Snatcher.

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,200
 Now I don't... because he ate fruit... because he stole flute-shaped cereal.

77
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,840
 Now again, those might be translation errors as well.

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,880
 But that's a little bit about... who are we talking about again?

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
 Oh yeah, Cookie Monster.

80
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,360
 He's also known as Mostro De La Galetes.

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,320
 So I think that's like Monster of the Cookies or something.

82
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,440
 And in Latin America, he simply goes by the name Lucas.

83
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,560
 And I guess when Disney bought... they used to have different names everywhere.

84
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,560
 When Disney bought them up, they said, "Nope, it's Kermit the Frog, it's Cookie Monster,

85
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,240
 they didn't shave... they used to localize everything."

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,400
 So now if you grew up with Gustavo Frog and Lucas running around, you're like, "Who's

87
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
 that guy?

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,080
 Who's the Cookie Monster?"

89
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,480
 Om nom nom nom nom.

90
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,720
 That might have gone on a little longer than I originally planned.

91
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
 I don't know, I found that fascinating.

92
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,240
 And thanks guys for your explanations of Cookie-like hair.

93
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,640
 They're probably pretty likely.

94
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,680
 Now we're gonna go on... you know, it's actually been a really interesting week.

95
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,840
 Conspiracy and weirdness-wise.

96
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,880
 I got a lot of stories that are fairly recent coming out.

97
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,440
 But one of the ones that popped up, like maybe in the past few days, was really bizarre.

98
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
 And from the first thing you hear, you're like, "That's absolutely impossible."

99
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,480
 And then you go, "But... weirder things have happened."

100
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,560
 And then you keep reading into it and you're like...

101
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,120
 Yeah, I don't know.

102
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,040
 So we are going back a year.

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,440
 We're going back to January 2017.

104
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,720
 And we're traveling to the island of Java, the tastiest sounding island other than Cupcake

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
 Island.

106
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,480
 We go to Java Island.

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,680
 And we're sitting on the beach.

108
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,480
 We're enjoying the nice weather.

109
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
 It's beautiful out.

110
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
 The sun.

111
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,080
 There's hot chicks walking around in the kines.

112
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,880
 And we're just drinking a Mai Tai.

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,760
 I don't know what they drink there.

114
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,320
 We're drinking an alcoholic drink.

115
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,360
 We're drinking iced Java with some liquor in it.

116
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
 We're just hanging out.

117
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,760
 And we see this woman with her sister and I think one of their sons.

118
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
 She was with two other people.

119
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,600
 I'm just making up family members.

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,920
 Oh, it was like her eighth cousin.

121
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,880
 And she was out there with at least her sister.

122
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,080
 I know that for sure.

123
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,800
 The woman's name is Naining Sunar-sir.

124
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,040
 Nairing Sunar-si.

125
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,800
 We'll just call her Naining.

126
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,160
 I probably pronounced it that wrong as well.

127
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,360
 But anyways, Naining, she was a 52-year-old woman.

128
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,880
 She's out on a beach vacation with her sister and an other family member.

129
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,880
 Could be anyone in her genealogical tree.

130
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,520
 It's her great ancestor.

131
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
 They're out at the beach.

132
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
 They're enjoying the fun.

133
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
 They're enjoying the sun.

134
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,200
 We're sitting there, me and you, drinking our Java-infused drinks.

135
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,360
 Alcohol in the Java.

136
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,440
 Anyways, the point is the mood is set.

137
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,720
 I've set the mood.

138
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
 We're sitting there.

139
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
 Seagulls.

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
 [crow cawing]

141
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
 Applying by.

142
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,600
 And a freak wave shows up.

143
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,200
 Now luckily we're sitting a little bit farther up the shore.

144
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
 Well, I am.

145
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,600
 I don't know about you, but a freak wave shows up.

146
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,480
 And we look and Naining is gone.

147
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,200
 And her sister's like, "No!"

148
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,360
 And her unidentified family member was like, "No!"

149
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,360
 And they start to try to find her, but she's swept out to sea.

150
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,920
 And they call the authorities.

151
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,440
 The authorities come out and they're like, "Well, we'll have like Coast Guard people show up

152
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,280
 looking for her, but it's a big ocean, guys.

153
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
 It's a big ocean."

154
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
 And they don't find her.

155
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,320
 They don't find her.

156
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,520
 Fast forward to a couple months ago, like a month or two ago, actually.

157
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,960
 Her father, who was not at the beach, we can eliminate him from who was a guy at the beach.

158
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:13,480
 Her father started having these dreams of Naining on the beach saying, "Look for me, father.

159
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
 Look for me, father.

160
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,120
 I'm coming back.

161
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,800
 I'm coming back."

162
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,000
 And the father at first just dismisses the dreams.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,840
 But the dreams keep coming and he's having these dreams of his daughter standing on this

164
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,240
 beach beckoning him to come and find her.

165
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,360
 So he does and the other family members go to the beach to try to find her.

166
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,520
 And for several weeks they're looking for her.

167
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:46,280
 And then one day they go out to the beach and they see Naining laying there in the sand,

168
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,480
 waves crashing over her.

169
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,200
 They're like, "Oh my God, they call rescue people.

170
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,800
 Medics, I can think they're commonly called.

171
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,440
 They call the apopatrol.

172
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,800
 They get these medics out there and they take her home and there's all this video footage

173
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,400
 of this woman being rescued.

174
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,960
 But it's in this language, wherever she's from, it's like Thailand or Indonesia or somewhere

175
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
 around there.

176
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
 It's a language that...

177
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,460
 Let me get a point.

178
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,800
 It's a language I don't understand.

179
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,440
 And I would now see this is where the...

180
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,720
 Now I think you see where I'm going with this.

181
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 So language I don't understand.

182
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,320
 It's a language I think most people don't understand unless you're in that region.

183
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,080
 It's not a common second language in the Western world.

184
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,440
 There's video footage of a woman of Naining being taken home and she's like laying there

185
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,400
 and stuff like that and all these medics around here and they're speaking in her native language.

186
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,560
 And this is where it gets weird.

187
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,380
 Well that was already weird because that gap between the time she got washed away in January

188
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:55,740
 2017, she washed up recently so she had been washed away for a year and a half and a kicker

189
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,180
 to that.

190
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,500
 She was found wearing the same clothes.

191
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,340
 Now on the beach she was wearing a yellow dress and when she washed up she was wearing

192
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,780
 the same yellow dress.

193
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,100
 Now she is still completely like out of it right now.

194
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,580
 She has not been able to say where she was during that time or how she survived.

195
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,220
 She is in communicato.

196
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,200
 She's a little loopy and the family is saying please just give us some time to take care

197
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
 of her.

198
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,060
 That really came to being publicized.

199
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,880
 That really broke the news earlier in the week.

200
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,280
 And the narrative I just told you is there's a ton of articles on this.

201
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,680
 I'm linking maybe three or four in the show notes but there's a ton of articles about

202
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
 this.

203
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,360
 It was like in the Daily Mail so it's like semi reputable, yeah I would say semi reputable

204
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,640
 news it's mostly a tabloid.

205
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,160
 But if you want to know that Scary Spice and who's the other one?

206
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
 Who's the British Spice?

207
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,900
 I guess they're all British Spice but Scary Spice and the Spice Girl who's Jerry Hallwell.

208
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,940
 They were banged during the Spice Girls like the original run not the reunion.

209
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,500
 Those two were banging each other.

210
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,600
 That's the level of news in the Daily Mail.

211
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,880
 And I did read that article by the way.

212
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,240
 Was it Sexy Spice?

213
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
 But anyway it doesn't matter.

214
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
 They banged.

215
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
 That's the point of that.

216
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,280
 So the Daily Mail is a tabloid but it wasn't just in the Daily Mail.

217
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,080
 It's in a lot of paranormal websites.

218
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,280
 It's in a lot of like regular news websites because it's such a bizarre story.

219
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
 Here's the kicker.

220
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,240
 So I started looking into this because I was like that's absolutely fascinating if true

221
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,840
 and it's kind of fascinating if it's not because it just shows how quickly rumors spread.

222
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,240
 So I watched the video.

223
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,160
 I didn't understand a word of it but I watched the video and the video is purported to be

224
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,240
 her being taken off the beach and taken home.

225
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,080
 She's not wearing a yellow dress.

226
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,600
 She's wearing a blue top.

227
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,280
 So immediately I said either she was taken somewhere else and they changed her clothes

228
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,360
 or that video's fake and it's being attached to this story.

229
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,720
 And sure enough I found when I was continuing to research this.

230
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,120
 One of the articles said here's some photos that are being purported to be Ninning but

231
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,920
 these are actually photos of someone being let out of a mental hospital and taken home.

232
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,720
 And what's weird is that this footage and these photos are being used in almost every

233
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,760
 article but only one pointed out people on WhatsApp have identified that those photos

234
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,760
 are from a totally different news story in the same area.

235
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
 So that's not Ninning.

236
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
 Has nothing to do with this story.

237
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,560
 So right off the bat the video evidence is not true at all.

238
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,400
 And then I go okay well that's a big spoiler and now I'm thinking the story's false and

239
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
 here's the thing.

240
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,040
 This is the, to me this is the detail that stuck out.

241
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,840
 I will accept that someone can get swept out to sea and washed away and go into some sort

242
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,160
 of magical portal land or something like that and come back.

243
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,680
 I don't believe it off hand.

244
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,040
 I kind of did this one but I guess not really, I didn't believe it but I thought I'm open

245
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,280
 to the idea of like dimensional portals and stuff like that.

246
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,080
 What I thought was weird so let's say that the story is true and she begins giving her

247
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,400
 dad instructions to come to the beach and find her.

248
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,640
 And I guess I should have said this earlier.

249
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,520
 She was found at the same location that she had gotten washed away.

250
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,440
 That actually was the original story.

251
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,120
 But then the story evolved that it wasn't the same spot it's 500 meters away whatever.

252
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,360
 So if I'm trying to get someone to come to my location I'm not going to start asking

253
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,920
 them to come out two months before I show back magically up in reality.

254
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,000
 Because it's very very likely because she had been coming to her dad in the dreams for

255
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,400
 a long time and then he still had to go out there every day for a couple weeks to find,

256
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,040
 every day for a couple weeks at any point he could have just been like ah it's just,

257
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,680
 I'm having these nightmares.

258
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,240
 Here's a pro tip, if you're ever a ghost or trapped in a magical realm and you need

259
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,280
 to send a message, don't send the message too early.

260
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,920
 Because then they're going to go out and get discouraged and go back or people are going

261
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
 to start thinking they're crazy.

262
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,720
 Send them the night before you leave Oz or whatever.

263
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,560
 So I thought that was a weird detail too.

264
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,160
 The dad going out there every single day looking for her.

265
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,640
 They could have said he had the dream and then it was so vivid that he went out the next

266
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,840
 morning and she was there.

267
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,040
 That would be a little more believable.

268
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,360
 But really I think at this point none of it's believable.

269
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,120
 I would be surprised if Nainin actually exists at all.

270
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,440
 Oh and here's another thing, this was something weird.

271
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,200
 She's 52 years old.

272
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,680
 How old's her dad?

273
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,920
 In his 70's?

274
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,960
 He would be in his really, he would be in his late 60's minimum if she's 52.

275
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:49,240
 And she had a sister so yeah he was probably like if she's 52 or 53 whatever he would have

276
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,560
 had to be, I look back over at my notes, if he would have to be, let's say he had the

277
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,480
 kids when he was like 20.

278
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,480
 So he's like and you have this old, you're harassing this old man.

279
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,440
 You're trapped in another dimension and your ghost keeps waking up a 70 year old man saying

280
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,160
 go to the beach today, go to the beach today and he's like oh my arthritis and she's like

281
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,560
 I don't care.

282
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,320
 So that detail was kind of weird too that she was so old.

283
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,920
 And I'm thinking that they may have made her that old to match the photos in the video

284
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,280
 that was going to be attached to the story.

285
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,760
 Weird, weird story.

286
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,440
 Don't think it's true but there's definitely either someone concocted it on purpose to

287
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,120
 play some sort of prank or it was just a, I wouldn't be surprised to find out if this

288
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,920
 is legends have been going around for a long time in that area.

289
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,520
 This story and it's constantly being updated every 10, 15 years and this time it actually

290
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,840
 just went viral, which is a possibility as well.

291
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,640
 But that is actually a good segue to our last segment because we're going to talk about

292
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:00,720
 again another urban legend that it kind of, it stands in the same categories as this one

293
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,760
 where we don't know whether or not it's real but far, far more sinister, far more sinister.

294
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,600
 The year, well the decade, the early 1900s.

295
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,840
 The place, Texas, somewhere in Texas.

296
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,440
 The year in the 1900s.

297
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,200
 The location, some place in Texas.

298
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
 The biggest state.

299
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,080
 Oh, that's the second biggest state but a giant state somewhere in there.

300
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,760
 There's a little kid sitting in his room.

301
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
 It's nighttime.

302
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,560
 He doesn't have comic books or video games or anything.

303
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,400
 He's probably just looking at wood carvings of Spider-Man.

304
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,200
 Has a little candle under his bed sheet to read.

305
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,280
 House goes up in flames.

306
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,560
 But then they move to another house and this little kid sitting in bed, no candles this

307
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:56,360
 time and he hears a noise at his window sill.

308
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,320
 And he sees a shape kind of move away in the darkness.

309
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,600
 The little boy opens the window and out on the sill are little pieces of old timey candy.

310
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
 To him, new candy.

311
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,280
 He's like, "Mmm, sass, Sparilla.

312
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,880
 Mmm, molasses flavored Jolly Ranchers."

313
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,520
 And he begins to eat the candy and he notices in one of the wrappers.

314
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,360
 And it's so funny, I'm talking like he's delicate.

315
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,320
 He's probably like, "Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah."

316
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,800
 Cookie monstering that.

317
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,640
 He was lucasin it.

318
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,320
 The next day after his sugar coma wears off, he notices one of the wrappers, has a message

319
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,800
 on the inside of it.

320
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,200
 And it says, "Come play with me."

321
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,360
 And it's signed, "The Candy Lady."

322
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,520
 So the Candy Lady story, what we know about the Candy Lady is this.

323
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,240
 There was a woman named Clara Crane and she was born in 1853.

324
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
 She was born in 1853.

325
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,240
 She was married to a drunk man.

326
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,720
 He was a farmer and one day he was out drinking and running the farm stuff and their daughter

327
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,760
 was out there as well.

328
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,720
 And due to his alcohol induced negligence, the daughter is killed in an unspecified way.

329
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,000
 The mom is just completely just toast over this.

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,480
 Her mom can't believe, Clara Crane can't believe that her husband killed the daughter

331
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
 even if it was an accident.

332
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,000
 She then poisons some candy and gives it to him and he's like, "Mmm, Sarsparilla, my

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,480
 favorite, ahhh, ahhh."

334
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
 And dies.

335
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,440
 She is arrested but she's found insane so she is put into the North Texas insane asylum.

336
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,160
 And it is there where her man is truly shows, I mean not just killing her husband, she makes

337
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,760
 a new daughter, she makes a new daughter out of a bedsheet.

338
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,960
 So she takes a bedsheet and she rips it up and binds it together and now she has like

339
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,960
 a Blair Witch like effigy, style daughter that she carries around the hospital with

340
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,440
 her.

341
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,160
 And she talks to it like it's her daughter and I don't understand the like did she feed

342
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 it?

343
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,280
 Was it all like completely, was it all like covered in gross pea soup as she's trying

344
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
 to feed her daughter?

345
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,440
 Like, but I guess insanity is insanity and she probably imagines it's eating the pea

346
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,560
 soup but in reality everyone else is like, "Can you wash your daughter?"

347
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,680
 She's like, "I bathe her every day."

348
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,040
 They're like, "No, wash your machine please."

349
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,360
 But anyways, due to overcrowding there's talk about letting Clara Crane go because she's

350
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,760
 such a nice woman.

351
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,280
 The doctors are like, "Yeah, she's pretty cool."

352
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,480
 I mean other than that disgusting creature, that disgusting golem she's created that she

353
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,160
 carries around and tells everyone it's her daughter.

354
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,560
 Other than that she's trying to get it to date other bedsheets in the hospital.

355
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,800
 She's like introducing it, takes it down to the laundromat and she's like, "You are the

356
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,720
 queen of the ball, my daughter."

357
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,080
 She ends up writing a letter to her sister, Aggie, which is a great name.

358
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,160
 This is the letter that was written, "Dearest Aggie, I am elated.

359
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,880
 I have been informed by Dr. Matthews, I almost read that it's Dr. Mattress.

360
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:09,680
 I've been informed by Dr. Matthews that Marcy and I, Marcy's the bedsheet baby, that Marcy

361
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,880
 and I will be returning home in less than three weeks.

362
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,320
 As you can imagine, Marcy can barely contain her excitement.

363
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,440
 Every night she asks, "Is tomorrow the day we go home, mother?"

364
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,480
 Very soon I will be able to tell her, "Yes."

365
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,560
 The idea of the talking bedsheet is bizarre.

366
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,460
 Like if someone was actually carrying around a bedsheet baby, that's weird enough.

367
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,400
 But then to imagine it's having conversations with her because in conversations with the

368
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,640
 kid, I mean does the mattress go, "Why is the sun in the sky?"

369
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,840
 Well because it is.

370
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
 Why?

371
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
 Well that's where God put it.

372
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
 Why?

373
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,720
 Well, I mean kids can be quite annoying.

374
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,960
 So I guess if you had a mattress baby, it would actually be a little better than a real

375
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,320
 kid because then it wouldn't keep annoying you.

376
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,400
 But anyways, Marcy, the bedsheet, and Clara Crane do get let out of the North Texas insane

377
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,400
 asylum.

378
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,960
 And then about five years after that, kids go missing.

379
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,720
 So let's go back to the herb and the legend part of this.

380
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,240
 This has an interesting wrap up.

381
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,240
 So in this town, apparently in her hometown, her unnamed hometown in Texas, children started

382
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,600
 getting candy put up on their window sills.

383
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,040
 And a kid goes missing.

384
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
 And the cops are baffled.

385
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,560
 Again, we're back in the 1900s here.

386
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,200
 The cops are baffled as to what happened to this kid.

387
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,760
 Snuck out in the middle of the night.

388
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,600
 Couple weeks later, another kid goes missing and now the cops are really, really concerned

389
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,240
 about what's going on.

390
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,960
 And it is then that the parents learn about candy being left on window sills.

391
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,760
 Kids had been eating it and not telling their parents because they're not supposed to eat

392
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 candy.

393
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,200
 They're not supposed to eat candies from strangers.

394
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,960
 And more importantly, they're not supposed to eat in bed.

395
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,400
 But they did all three of those things.

396
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,520
 So parents started to warn their kids, "Do not eat candy on your window sills."

397
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
 Don't do it.

398
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,640
 You're going to get snatched by the candy lady.

399
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,920
 This all came to a head when a boy who was previously found missing, there was a farmer

400
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,480
 or a rancher or somebody was walking along a goalie.

401
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,800
 They found the body of a 10-year-old boy with his eyeballs gouged out and his pockets full

402
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,120
 of candy.

403
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,760
 Now the interesting thing about this story, every piece of evidence that makes you think

404
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,240
 it has proof seems to be fake.

405
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
 But you don't know.

406
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,280
 And there's basically two separate stories here.

407
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,600
 So let's look at the story of Clara Crane first, because that's the one that has the

408
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,360
 most specific stuff.

409
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,480
 Clara Crane in Texas, as far as I could find on Ancestry.com, there was a Clara Crane in

410
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,720
 Texas, but she was born five years before her mother.

411
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,240
 So the story of her being born in 1853, or however the word, I might have misstated it

412
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,960
 earlier in 1953, but she was supposedly born in 1853, or in that time period, the only

413
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,800
 person listed having a daughter named Clara Crane was born after that.

414
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:22,080
 There used to be a place called North Texas Insane Asylum, so that place did exist.

415
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,200
 And there was a short news article about Clara Crane being sentenced to prison for the murder

416
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
 of her husband.

417
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,840
 But the article is not sourced, it doesn't say what newspaper it comes from.

418
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,840
 It's like a blurry scan of a presumable newspaper article.

419
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
 So it could be fake.

420
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,440
 We don't have a way to track that back.

421
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,440
 In the story of Clara Crane, it does not list where she's from.

422
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,200
 It's just a small town in Texas that takes place in Texas.

423
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,080
 We have a newspaper article that specifies, she was 28 years old.

424
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,000
 This happened in Ellis County, and she was tried at the Hattuck Street Courthouse.

425
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,120
 So we get more details from the article.

426
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:09,560
 So that makes me think that the story of Clara Crane existed before the story that people

427
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,480
 tell their kids about, "Ooh, watch out, she could get you."

428
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,400
 But you end up being on the far, far north of Texas.

429
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,400
 It's left vague for a purpose.

430
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,200
 The article that's being purported to be true specifies this was in Ellis County.

431
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,360
 So the fact there's a discrepancy between the two makes me think that either this, the

432
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,840
 Clara Crane actually did exist, and the details have kind of been wiped clean to make the

433
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,360
 story more universal.

434
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,040
 Or someone came up with the legend of Clara Crane, and then someone faked the evidence,

435
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,040
 and when they were faking it, they're like, "They just can't put in the news article

436
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,520
 somewhere in Texas that this court happened whoever created this article had to give more

437
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
 detail."

438
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,920
 Chicken or egg, chicken or egg, we don't know.

439
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,440
 But like I said, the person who's supposedly Clara Crane, I could only find one on Ancestry.com,

440
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,120
 but that doesn't really mean anything because not everyone's listed in Ancestry.com.

441
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,400
 So I'm back to square one.

442
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
 Is it square one?

443
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,080
 Or is it square, yeah, I'm back to square one.

444
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,680
 I'm back to the beginning of the board game.

445
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,960
 That's where that saying comes from, Jason, don't be an idiot.

446
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,200
 So I think that's where that saying comes from.

447
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,600
 But anyways, did Clara Crane exist?

448
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,520
 We don't know.

449
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,240
 It's super bizarre.

450
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,600
 It's such an unknown urban legend conspiracy theory, I think outside of Texas, that not

451
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,320
 a lot of people have delved into it.

452
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,360
 I've found a lot of resources on it, and a few of them were very like, tried to dig into

453
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,200
 it, but since there's not a lot of information to go on, it's rough.

454
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,920
 So then let's jump, so did Clara Crane exist?

455
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
 Who knows?

456
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,240
 Clara Crane may have actually existed at some point, but did she make a bedsheet, baby?

457
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,040
 Did she write letters to her sister?

458
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,640
 We don't know.

459
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,400
 We don't have any of that information.

460
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,520
 And then let's go to the crimes.

461
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,000
 Missing children in Texas, possibly Ellis County, Texas.

462
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,600
 Kids going missing, candy being left on windowsills, a young boy found with his eyes gouged out

463
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,520
 in his pockets full of candy.

464
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,720
 Did those incidents happen?

465
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,440
 Again.

466
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,760
 Because of now we don't have any proof of any of this stuff.

467
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,320
 The crimes are at this point over a hundred years old.

468
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:26,360
 It is quite possible that this urban legend came out of something.

469
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,120
 Either Clara Crane is true, and they created the story of the Candy Lady as a warning towards

470
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
 kids.

471
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,840
 You know, don't take candy from strangers is really the point of the story.

472
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,720
 Or the Candy Lady crimes are true that three kids went missing and one was found dead with

473
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,440
 candy in its pockets.

474
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,200
 And the Clara Crane story was a retcon to kind of give this madness some sort of face

475
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,040
 to it.

476
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,760
 Or most chilling that both parts are true.

477
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
 Both parts are true.

478
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,120
 There was a Clara Crane that was sent to North Texas.

479
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,760
 It was actually North Texas lunatic asylum.

480
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,640
 Whether that part of the story is true and then later back in Ellis County kids went

481
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,000
 missing with candy on their windowsills.

482
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,960
 There's been a lot of stories we've covered on this show that are only like four or five

483
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,240
 years old that are completely horrific.

484
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,880
 Like the guy who held up, who did the school shooting and the sexual assault at the same

485
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
 time.

486
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,920
 That's been pretty much a race from the social consciousness.

487
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,360
 We have the speargun murder story that's been erased from the social consciousness.

488
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,360
 So there are stories even recently that you think, man how can people forget about this?

489
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,960
 And when we're going back a hundred years it's very likely or I should say it's possible

490
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,440
 that these series of incidents played out.

491
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,640
 The idea of not taking candy from strangers is something that I think most parents, if

492
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,040
 not all parents, really worldwide instill in their kids.

493
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:58,680
 What's interesting is that if this case is real, this may have been the origin of that

494
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,520
 saying "don't take candy from strangers".

495
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,600
 It's weird to think that the phrase "don't take candy from strangers" is used so commonly

496
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,040
 it's like a trope.

497
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,920
 You can have a television show called Strangers with Candy.

498
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
 You get it.

499
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,160
 You get that saying basically, it's ingrained in our consciousness.

500
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,560
 And the crazy thing is, is that saying may be based on a real set of disappearance and

501
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,200
 murders.

502
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,280
 That saying we all use could have started in a little county in Texas.

503
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,040
 When a boy unwrapped a piece of candy, it said "come play with me".

504
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,480
 He crawled out the window to the dark shape standing in the field.

505
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,000
 And that was the last thing he saw before his eyes were cut out.

506
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,840
