00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics, where we listen

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.480
 to some of our older episodes with new introductions.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.000
 We got a great set this week because I actually reached out to my Patreon supporters and I

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.120
 said, "Hey guys, what is your favorite episode?"

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.200
 And I got ones that I don't think I would have picked myself and they're good ones,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.240
 they're really good ones.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.800
 When you've recorded 548 episodes, a lot of stuff gets lost in the shuffle and a lot

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.800
 of times when I'm scrolling through my files looking for something, trying to do something,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 I'm like, "What in the world is that?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.600
 I don't remember that title.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 What in the world?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.200
 I'll have to look it up."

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.240
 But all of the ones that were picked for this week, right when they just said the title,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.440
 I was like, "Oh, I remember that episode because these ones really do stand out in one way

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.440
 or the other."

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.880
 And I was actually given this idea by Mikhail Malone.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.360
 He was actually the first one, he had recently said, "Hey, my favorite episode was Terare."

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.400
 Now I know I'm mispronouncing that still to this day, because I really like that Terare

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.280
 episode and I go, "Oh, that is actually one of my favorites too."

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.100
 And I thought about it and I go, "I'm going to let the Patreons pick this week."

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.200
 So hats off to you Mikhail, you're the one who started this one off.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.160
 First off, when you listen to this episode, if you just want to get to the episode, you

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.600
 can skip past all of this.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.040
 This is what I feel is a perfect Dead Rabbit radio episode.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.240
 Within the course of about 30 minutes, we cover three topics in depth.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 In depth.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.000
 A lot of times people go, "Hey, how come the show's not longer?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.720
 How come you don't delve into a story more often?"

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.000
 Because of episodes like this, I could have easily taken any one of these topics and talked

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.520
 about it for an hour straight.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.880
 But I feel like you'd be dragging it on.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.160
 The first story about the Indian Temple to this day intrigues me.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.000
 It's one of those stories, I didn't know it was on this episode until I re-listened

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 to it.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.640
 But I think it probably could have been the headline your episode if I had thought about

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.640
 it.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.280
 The story in the Indian Temple is so bizarre.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.960
 Generally I start off with smaller stories, I usually call them starter stories.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.280
 And then we have the title story at the end.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.080
 The Indian Temple stands on its own as being a completely bizarre story and to this day

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.040
 I still think about it and I'm like, "I wonder if they've ever opened that door?"

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.360
 Really really weird topic and it stuck with me through 548 episodes.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.840
 The second story is about the Ebola outbreak in Africa.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.640
 Which it's funny because listening back to it, I'm like, "I don't know, might be

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.600
 much of zombies running around by summertime.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600
 That didn't happen."

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.320
 But instead we got COVID-19.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.400
 It was like zombies but we couldn't move.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.400
 We had to stay in our houses.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.400
 It was reverse zombies.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.200
 They were in your house and you couldn't get into other people's houses.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.160
 A very very interesting story.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.880
 And of course the Terare story.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.360
 I love this story.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.920
 And again, I don't want to keep patting myself too much on the back.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.320
 But you get all the information you need in the, however long it is, 15 minutes long.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.120
 You can go out and do more research on this guy and you'd probably find like a other weird

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.440
 couple of other weird things.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:50.880
 But I was able to boil the bones of Terare into a delicious pus filled soup for us.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.960
 It's an episode that I've thought about.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.680
 Again, it's 400 episodes later.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.320
 I still think this is a standout episode.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.600
 I hope you guys enjoy it.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.520
 I consider it the blueprint for what I enjoy a good Dead Rabbit radio episode to be.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.760
 A lot of times nowadays there are two stories per episode.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.240
 Sometimes there's three.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.920
 And I'm shocked when I listen to these old episodes and there's like three stories in

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920
 them.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.920
 I'm like, whoa, I must have been able to compact stuff.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.600
 I don't know if I was better at compacting stuff in or if I let stories breathe a little

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600
 more.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 I don't know what the balance is.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.760
 Sometimes I'll do three stories.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.720
 But enough with the nerd talk, enough with the behind the scenes talk.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.120
 Guys, I really hope you enjoy this episode of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics, episode 120,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.760
 Terare, the man who ate everything.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.480
 A temple in India holds riches and curses.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.920
 Then are we on the cusp of a modern day zombie outbreak?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.000
 Seriously, seriously.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.520
 You guys are like nothing serious, but no, no, that's an interesting one.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.000
 And then we find a man who can eat anything.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 It's anything.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.480
 I'm having a great day.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.160
 I hope you're having a great day too.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160
 This is take four.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.040
 I've spent the past hour here doing different takes.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.320
 It's driving me nuts.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.720
 My needs are actually really hard to do because I've been out of practice for a while and

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.360
 I'm like, "Urgh!"

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.720
 But so goes the world of podcasting.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.240
 There is a guy on YouTube, not a YouTuber as far as I know, but they're one of my listeners

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.240
 on YouTube.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.360
 I love you to death, dude.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.440
 You suggested that I do a story and I thought, "Oh yeah, that'd be an interesting one because

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.600
 I had a vague knowledge of it."

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.360
 But Pondroll, Pondroll, I know I've seen you pop up on a couple different videos.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.320
 I've seen you commenting on a few of my podcast videos on YouTube.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.280
 And I know you listened to the show.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.640
 So when you suggested this story, you knew the torment you were about to unleash on my

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:10.080
 audience because I have a hard time pronouncing cities in America.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.120
 And Pondroll suggested a story that takes place in India.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:24.000
 Now the story is the Padman Abbaswamy Temple.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.960
 I'm not even going to try that one again.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.960
 The temple.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.080
 And it is this side, Pondroll really, I love you and I'm, "Thanks so much for listening.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.760
 Thanks so much for the suggestion."

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.520
 But there's this temple in India that, there's this temple in this India that there was always

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.280
 this legend that it was full of treasure.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.320
 This is going to be a fairly short story.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.800
 But there was always this rumor that there was this treasure in this temple.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.480
 And back in, what was it, 20, so, so, but back in 2011, the government said, "You know

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.600
 what, we should, let's go through and find out actually what's in this temple.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.600
 We should catalog it."

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 Because it's been there since like 3 AD.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.040
 And they're like, "Hey, finally getting around to it, right?

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.040
 Let's do this."

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.560
 While they were snooping around the temple, they found six hidden doors that they never

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.560
 knew was there.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.880
 And we'll get into that in a second because that's an interesting thing.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:20.520
 You find these six hidden doors and they basically label them A through F. Now, I don't think

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.600
 they used the English letters, but it was basically just like, this is door A, this

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.560
 is door B, so it's C, so on.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.760
 But in Indian letters.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.800
 And so they start opening the doors and they find amazing riches.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:43.560
 Gold, ancient gold coins, diamonds, gems, diamond necklaces and cased in gold.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.960
 With gems, I don't know, just these amazing artifacts and they're like, "Oh my God, we're

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960
 rich."

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.360
 I mean, we're the government so we're rich anyways, but we have this untold, unheard

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.000
 of fortune just laying in this temple and they're opening the doors and they're like,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 "Doo-lululululu," like just these sparkly gold nuggets hanging out.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.840
 The gold coins are winking at them and little thumbs up, finally finding them.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.360
 But door B can't be opened.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.100
 Door B is sealed shut.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:16.400
 Now, they were all technically sealed shut and they were all hidden, but door B is impenetrable.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.960
 They've tried opening it several times, you know, like, jiggle-manab, whatever.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.400
 They've tried seeing what's behind door B. But the problem is, is that door B has a legend

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.400
 behind it.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.280
 Now, back in the 1930s, that region was super, super poor and they were actually going there

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.480
 having like a starvation issue, which I mean, I guess it's just starvation, that's the issue.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.680
 They didn't have enough food.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.780
 Now this is what I thought was weird because in 2011 they said, "Let's go see what's in

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.780
 this temple."

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:49.180
 But in the 1930s, they go, "Hey, we're pretty sure there's a bunch of winking gold coins

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.180
 in that temple.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.180
 Let's go in there."

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.860
 And for whatever reason, the first door they tried to open was door B. And sorry, that didn't

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.860
 happen in 1930.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.860
 That happened a hundred years ago.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.180
 So in 1900, the region was, something else happened in 1930.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:08.140
 So in about 1900, the region's super poor and they're starving and everything like that.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.440
 They go to open door B and they hear a curious sound on the other side of door B. A sound

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.000
 you shouldn't hear on this other side of any door in existence.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.280
 That's the sound of the ocean.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.040
 And they're like, "Eh, let's not open this.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.080
 Let's not go here."

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.400
 And they thought this door must lead to the Arabian Ocean, which actually I figured would

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.120
 be closer to Saudi Arabia, but apparently it's also close to India.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.980
 They have big coastlines, but anyway, so they didn't.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.660
 And then there's just a bunch of people starved.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.380
 I don't know why they didn't try the other doors.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.900
 Maybe they didn't know the other doors were there because they were so well hidden.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.500
 In the 1930s, some burglars were like, "Hey, dude, sometimes when I'm walking by that temple

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.940
 I hear the sound of coins winking at me."

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.180
 So they try to open door B and a bunch of snakes jump out of the door and chase them

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.180
 off.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.940
 Noxious snakes is the term.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.100
 So a smelly snake.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.300
 Or unless the word means something else that I don't know of.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.400
 To this day, that door has never been open.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.680
 Door B has never been open.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.880
 And the legend is that only a cleric or a high level saint can open it.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.880
 So break out your Final Fantasy VII saves and see if you...

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.240
 I don't know if there are saints in that.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.880
 But anyways, break out your role playing game.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.360
 Whatever role playing game you do, level up your saint, try to open this door because they

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.440
 believe that it is sealed by magic.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.440
 And unless the seal is broken, even though the door they believe can be opened with modern

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:38.860
 technology, i.e. dynamite, they think that opening the door without removing the magic

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.700
 will cause great catastrophe to the region.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.860
 Like a giant new Arabian ocean emptying into the middle of India.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:50.580
 I think it's interesting because the door has the images of snakes on it and it had

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.780
 images of something else I couldn't pronounce.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.380
 Again, thanks, Ponderall.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.660
 And those images are associated in Indian mythology or Indian culture as being warning

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.660
 signs.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.360
 I mentioned once before that there was a group of people who were trying to design a warning

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.580
 logo that could be interpreted 10 million years in the future.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.540
 Because we want to bury all this nuclear waste in Nevada.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.720
 But they don't want anyone stumbling across to, you know, long after we're gone and opening

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.240
 the doors and irradiating the entire western half of the United States.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.720
 So they go, "What type of image can we come up with that millions of years from now people

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.980
 will not interpret as anything other than dangerous?"

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.780
 A skull, a lot of times that represents religious.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.100
 So if archaeologists in the future stumbled across a giant skull in the middle of a desert

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.860
 on a door, they may not necessarily equate that with death.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.460
 For the most part, it hasn't been equated with death.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:48.540
 For a long time in human history, skulls meant rebirth or religion.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.260
 But they're saying that this is a warning, do not open this door.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.420
 I think that's really interesting because who knows what's behind it.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.060
 Is it more gold?

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.060
 Diamonds?

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.700
 The size of an infant?

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.860
 Is it something?

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.860
 Is it some magical portal to somewhere else?

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.140
 Is it a super weapon that was hidden there?

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.300
 Or is it just an empty room?

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.300
 We don't know.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.180
 And it's funny because the Indian government is in no hurry to figure it out.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.500
 So that is the story of the temple I can't pronounce.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.340
 Indiana Jones and the Temple I Can't Pronounce.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:25.260
 You know what's so funny is that intriguing is the story is it delves a lot into Indian

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.660
 mythology and I just can't pronounce the words.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.420
 And I'm not going to put you through that.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.820
 So we're leaving India.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:36.700
 We'll probably be back to India at some point because they do have a lot of cool mythology.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.860
 It's the language barrier.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.940
 I just can't pronounce that stuff.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:47.420
 And I don't like to give foreign places nicknames like "Padaha Mata Ta Ta Castle" or we'll

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.620
 just call it "Patti."

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.860
 I don't like to do that.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.580
 But anyways, so we're off.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:59.300
 Now we're going from India and the legends involving that to Africa, modern day Africa.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.300
 Now we're in the Congo.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.780
 Now this is an interesting story because this just popped up in the news.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.180
 They're having an Ebola outbreak again.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.860
 It's not just any Ebola outbreak.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.860
 This is the second biggest Ebola outbreak in history.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.660
 Now they've had them and it's been fairly restricted to villages.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.860
 And they go, "Okay, that's not like a good thing."

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.100
 And I'm like, "Yay, just villages."

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.540
 But it could have been a lot, lot worse.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.820
 And the problem is, is that we might be there now.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.220
 Because they have this city.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.020
 It's called Butembo in the Congo.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.420
 And it has a population, it's a city.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.620
 It has a population of over a million people.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.140
 And Ebola has not hit a major city yet.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.940
 And we're starting to see outbreaks in the suburbs and in outlying communities.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:55.340
 Ebola, if you don't know, is incredibly contagious and has a kill rate between 50% and 90%.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.860
 It can be transmitted through a drop, a drop of sweat or blood.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.940
 So people riding on the subway, they're sweaty.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.140
 You just want to stay away from them anyways, but they're like, "Woohoohoo, shaking their

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.860
 head like a dog is flying everywhere."

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.900
 It's like Beethoven, but Ebola infected.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.500
 It can take up to nine days before you start to become symptomatic.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.820
 So you can have it and spread it and not know it.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.060
 And then you start pooping out blood.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.460
 Basically, you liquefy from the inside out.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.260
 That's what ends up killing you.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.320
 You'll start to get like, some people get rashes, some people get bloodshot eyes.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.820
 Some people, it starts off with confusion and things like that.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.020
 But the end result that will kill you is massive blood loss.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.620
 Your organs liquefy.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.540
 And then you throw up and you poop out blood until you die.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.540
 It's very brutal.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.140
 You're seeing some photos of people dying from it.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.140
 They're alive.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.820
 I saw a photo of a guy sitting in the middle of a street.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.620
 He's just blood all on the ground underneath his butt.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.620
 He's laying down.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.620
 He's sitting.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.820
 But you just see a puddle of blood because he's pooping out blood and he's reaching

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.620
 out for help and everyone else in the photo has given him like a 10 foot radius.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.620
 Because he's dead.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.620
 There's nothing you can do.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:12.860
 And part of the problem is not only is Ebola highly contagious, but the burial rituals

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:19.340
 in the Congo and in other regions of this area, they require the people to clean the body,

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.940
 to wash the bodies off.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.500
 And if they're a very famous person, sometimes you'll lay on the body and be like, "Oh,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.060
 yeah, Elvis, such great music.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.380
 Let me lay on your body."

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.820
 Which gives you Ebola.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.660
 And then you die and then your loved ones wash your body, clean your body, things like

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.500
 that.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:41.020
 That interesting article where the person says, "Imagine having a millennial old tradition

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.700
 and all of a sudden a couple guys show up in hazmat suits and say, 'Just throw it in

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.140
 a bag and burn it.'"

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.540
 And that's the problem they're having over in these regions.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.900
 They've been having these burial practices for hundreds, hundreds of years and now people

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.420
 are showing up in pretty much space suits saying, "No, can't say goodbye.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.420
 Just throw it in a bag."

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.420
 That's it.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.580
 Can't touch it.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.580
 Now it's hitting a city.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580
 Like I said, it's only outskirts.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.660
 It hasn't gotten to the main part of town, but it seems like it's only a matter of time.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.660
 And here's the problem.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:19.740
 Merrick, the group that makes the Ebola, it's an experimental Ebola vaccine.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.540
 So they're not entirely for sure that it works.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.420
 They're pretty sure that it works.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:30.700
 They give it to people and it seems to work, but they've only dealt with basic "minor"

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.700
 outbreaks.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.740
 This outbreak was around 11,000 people.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:41.300
 So they go, "Okay, well, let's stockpile 300,000 doses of this vaccine."

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.300
 Takes months to prepare.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.580
 But they go 300,000.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.660
 That's a good starting point.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:51.900
 But with over a million people in the city, it's not even half that can be vaccinated

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.220
 from this.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:17:01.660
 You could have a city full of skyscrapers and restaurants and coffee shops and skate

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.700
 parks, a wash in blood by next summer.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.340
 It would be like a zombie movie.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.300
 And the weirdest part about this, and they don't know what they're going to do.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.700
 Merrick has said, "We don't know if we can have enough vaccines ready to go."

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:22.020
 And another thing with this outbreak is people are coming down with Ebola and they don't

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.740
 know where they got it from.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:29.020
 Normally, you would have one person go, "Well, yeah, I was holding hands with that dude."

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.380
 And that's how I got Ebola.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.820
 But now people are showing up and they're like, "Well, do you know anyone who died of

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.820
 Ebola?"

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.260
 And they're like, "No, I don't know anyone who died of Ebola."

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.100
 So it may already get spread in that droplet form.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.820
 All it takes to, I mean, this was the big controversy a couple years ago, is it takes

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.380
 nine days someone to get on a plane and go to another country.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.660
 But they don't have enough vaccines to inoculate an entire city.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.900
 They don't know how some people are catching it, which is very worrying.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:03.620
 But the vaccine, I remember reading about this a couple years ago, the vaccine itself.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.180
 So Merrick is a company and a company's goal is to make profit.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.500
 Companies tend to have secondary goals.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.780
 Walmart's goal is to make profit.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.780
 And Sam Walton's goal, at least, you can argue whether or not Walmart's still about it.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:23.060
 But Sam Walton's goal was to give customers low price items.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.700
 That was, I mean, he wanted to make money and keep the company going.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:32.220
 But his secondary goal was to allow people to buy stuff at the lowest price possible.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.660
 That's an admirable goal.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.900
 Merrick, their main goal is to make money.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.260
 And their secondary goal is to help people.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.900
 But when you come, and most corporations are like that, Amazon's like, "Hey, we want you

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.500
 to have access to all the entertainment you want to, but our main goal is to make money."

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.260
 There's a little capitalism side note there.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.900
 Merrick said, "Listen, we can make this Ebola vaccine, but the truth of the matter is that

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.540
 Ebola is quite rare.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.140
 So the amount of money that we put into making this vaccine, we have to recoup.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.900
 Not just the research and development, but the making, producing the actual physical

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.900
 vaccine itself.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.900
 It's quite rare.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.100
 It'll take us forever to recoup a profit from making this."

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:17.340
 And then someone, some genius there, probably Max Brooks or George Romero, said, "You know

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.020
 what else is rare?

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:25.800
 That we have a vaccine for that we can stockpile, but it's so rare it doesn't really make

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.980
 it cost effective for us to make all this vaccine for.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.700
 And we can combine them together."

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.300
 And they're like, "Yes, Mr. Romero, what's your suggestion?"

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.460
 And he goes, "Rabies.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:39.540
 Rabies is a vaccine that is needed that we have, but it doesn't make sense for us to

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.820
 make a separate rabies vaccine.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.900
 What if we took, this is 100% true.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:50.500
 What if we took the rabies vaccine and the Ebola vaccine, combined them into a single

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.020
 vaccine so we can give it to either person?"

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.420
 People are like, "Yay, clapping, having no..."

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.860
 You ever wonder why people in zombie movies act like they've never seen a zombie movie?

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.700
 Because people in our planet act like they've never seen a zombie movie.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.700
 Why would you invent something?

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:15.900
 Because remember, a vaccine tends to have an element of the disease in the vaccine.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.780
 That might not hold true across all vaccines, but like the flu vaccine, they're like, "Oh,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.700
 yeah, it has a little bit of the flu vaccine.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.700
 You might get sick.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.700
 You might find a little..."

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.340
 You're going to give me rabies if I have Ebola?

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:31.420
 Or if I have rabies, you're going to inject me with something that has Ebola in it?

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:36.700
 You're basically created a crazy, blood spewing monster.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.700
 Who's just going to run around spitting blood at everybody and doesn't care because he

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.020
 has rabies.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.260
 Why would you combine those two?

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.580
 Why don't you combine Ebola and like, I don't know, anti-depression medicine or something

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.700
 that makes you sleepy?

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.700
 Anything else!

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.820
 I guess people who have depression don't want to be injected full of Ebola, but those

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.100
 are the two...

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.100
 Those...

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.580
 That's like at the beginning of "I Am Legend" the movie.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.060
 They invent the cure for cancer and it turns everyone into a vampire.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.980
 I don't know if I would take that vaccine and I don't know if I would hang out with

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:16.100
 anybody who took that vaccine because again, you've now created a crazy, a 28 days later,

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.900
 rage-infected monster.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.580
 No!

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.980
 Put something else in that vaccine, Merck.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:32.140
 But 300,000 doses of that rabies/Ebola vaccine is on its way to a major city in Africa.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.940
 Okay, the last story we're going to talk about, it's funny because I heard about this story

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.420
 when I was a kid because I've always been reading this weird stuff and as I was researching

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:47.020
 this I realized the version I heard as a kid was heavily edited.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.340
 So we're going to France.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.340
 We will take...

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.980
 We'll hop in the Carpenter copter because I want to get out of the Ebola city of Congo.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:00.100
 We're going to fly above just right like they're like running towards the helicopter.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.100
 Get on!

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.100
 Get on!

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.100
 Get on!

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.100
 Get on!

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.100
 Get on!

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.100
 Get on!

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.100
 Get on!

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.100
 That's not you making that noise, that's the zombies behind you.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.100
 You hop into the helicopter.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.340
 It's so funny, I get accused of racism all the time for this podcast.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.540
 This isn't helping but anyways, they're chasing us down.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.540
 Jump in the helicopter.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:23.760
 They're forming like a human pyramid to try to get us.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.760
 Take off.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.740
 Just as we start to see the nuke coming towards the city.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.900
 Anyways, we're going to go to France.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.420
 We're going to go back in time so you don't have to worry about zombies.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:39.820
 I don't know why the helicopter made an airplane noise but anyways, we land.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.100
 And we're now in the 1700s.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.020
 We're in 1700s France.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.300
 And there we're going to meet, we see a guy walking down the...

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.300
 They had road spec then.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.700
 Walking down the trail, that's a safe bet.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.180
 He's walking down a place where there's no grass and a straight line.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.740
 And his name is Tarreir.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:05.260
 Now, again, I had to talk about this during the India segment earlier.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.580
 You should know by now that I can't pronounce my R's either.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.140
 So if you don't know what I'm saying, he's a French guy and his name is Tarreir.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.140
 So anyways, Tarreir...

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.140
 Tarreir...

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.820
 I don't know why I picked these stories to go all the same episode.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.460
 Tarreir is this French guy.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.220
 We look at him and we're like, "That is a skinny man.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.220
 That is a skinny man.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.940
 He is of normal height, whatever that may be.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.940
 He's 100 pounds.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.460
 He looks to be 100 pounds."

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.980
 You're like, "Oh man, you didn't eat something.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.540
 100 pounds for being in your 20s is quite slender."

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:42.740
 That's when he lifts up his shirt and billows of loose skin just...

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:47.020
 And like deflated balloon just kind of like sloped towards the ground.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:52.660
 And you notice that even though he's only in his 20s, his face is super wrinkly.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:59.420
 He looks like a 100 pound man whose skin is just melted jello.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.660
 Now Tarreir was a medical freak.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.820
 There's a few other people who have this condition, but Tarreir is the most notable.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.580
 When he was a kid, his appetite was insatiable.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.020
 He couldn't stop eating.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.220
 And eventually he literally...

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.700
 Not literally, but he ate them out of house and home.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.700
 He didn't eat the house.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.700
 He was like, "You know what?

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.180
 Actually, he would have.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.180
 We'll get to that in a second."

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.220
 He actually would have given the chance.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.740
 And so his parents kicked him out because they were like, "We saw you eyeing the floorboards.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.540
 They kicked him out because he couldn't afford to keep them."

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.780
 He ends up joining a bunch of circus freaks and his show was...

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.780
 Let me eat whatever you got in your pockets.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.780
 Hey, you.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.620
 What do you have in your pockets?

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.140
 And he's like, "I don't know.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.820
 A couple shillings."

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.940
 And he's like, "Well, that's weird.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.940
 This is friends.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.940
 You should have frogs."

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.940
 And he's like, "Oh yes, that's right.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.940
 I meant frogs."

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.940
 So he'd eat the frogs.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.940
 And he goes, "What do you have?"

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.700
 And the person's like, "I have this potted plant in my purse."

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.700
 And he's like, "Give it to me."

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.300
 "Aah, he'd eat it."

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:59.620
 Now his jaw didn't just stand and he ate a whole pot, but he would eat cats.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.780
 He'd be like, "Hey, hey, cat lady.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.780
 Can I borrow one of those?"

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.780
 And she's like, "Sure."

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.940
 And he's gonna pet it and he's like, "Some pet it from the inside."

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.020
 He'd rip its stomach open and eat the guts.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:17.540
 And then he would eat everything but the bones and then he'd throw up the fur and the skin.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.940
 And then at that point, everyone kind of just applauded.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.660
 At one point he was doing this act and he got an obstruction in the stomach and the

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.420
 other circus performers had to take him to the doctor.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.420
 And the doctor was like fixing him up and he goes, "Hey, you know, I do this act."

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.420
 That's your story.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.300
 He goes, "You know, I do this act where I can eat anything."

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.300
 The doctor's like, "Really?"

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.820
 He's like, "Hey, let me eat your gold watch."

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.940
 He couldn't stop eating stuff.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.860
 And the doctor said, "If you ate my watch, I'm gonna cut you open and get it out."

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.940
 To which I imagined Terare grabbed the collar of his shirt and went, "Gold?"

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.340
 But anyways, he couldn't stop eating stuff.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:53.260
 Eventually he joined the military, which considering that that life is so regimented, it seemed

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.620
 like a bizarre choice, but maybe just doing his civic duty.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.340
 And he would eat all of his rations and then he would do chores around the camp to eat

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.940
 other people's rations.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.700
 And then he started eating food out of the garbage and that's nothing compared to what's

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.700
 coming.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.780
 He started eating food out of the garbage.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.820
 And the army was like, "Dude, seriously."

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.980
 And when he'd eat, like all of his loose skin would inflate like a balloon.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.980
 He could actually fill his body up with food and then as it would dissolve, his skin would

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.460
 get super loose again.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.260
 And finally there was this dude at the camp, the commander, and he goes, "This guy's driving

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.980
 me nuts, but I have a plan."

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:35.700
 I'm gonna make him swallow little wooden boxes with battle plans on them and then he'll just

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.260
 walk across enemy lines and no one will notice him because he just looks like a normal dude.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.860
 And then he'll poop out the plans to somebody else.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.220
 And so they do a test, they give him a little wooden box and put a piece of paper in it

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.460
 and he swallows it and then a couple days later he poops it out or a couple hours later

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.420
 whatever and poops it out and the box was fine and they're like, "Oh, this plan's gonna

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.420
 work."

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.420
 Now let me tell you a little bit more about Tarare.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.980
 This was his description.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:04.940
 He had an abnormally wide mouth and near invisible lips.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.780
 Now I don't think that meant they were like the invisible woman that you could see through

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.780
 me.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.500
 I think they just meant that he had super, super thin lips.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.460
 Like I said, his face was super wrinkly, his skin hung super low, his skin, like if you

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.220
 touched him, it was hot.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.740
 He was hot to the touch, it's probably a big part of his metabolism.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:27.380
 And he was described this as a quote, "He stunk to such a degree that he could not be

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.820
 endured within the distance of 20 paces."

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.820
 So just a super stink bag.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.380
 You didn't want to be near him.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.020
 And that was normal.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.860
 When he ate, he smelled worse.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:44.660
 He had constant diarrhea, constant diarrhea, and that gives a new angle to the story of

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:50.500
 them waiting around for him to poop out the box and it's all just like a huge puddle and

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.500
 they're like, "Okay, let's get a private in here to dig through this stuff because I'm

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.500
 not."

00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:01.660
 He had chronic diarrhea and it was, and again, quote, "fetted beyond all conception."

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.660
 So they should add a poet in the room because you hear that phrase, they should send a poet

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.660
 to space.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:13.780
 They should have had a poet beyond all conception, beyond what great ideas lay out in the universe

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:18.700
 they could not use to describe the smell of his diarrhea.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:25.020
 And I don't know, I don't know how this is possible, but they said that you could look

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.240
 at him and vapor, like stink lines, came out of his skin.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.660
 You could see a visible vapor around him.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.700
 They're just the stench.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.740
 Now let's go back to that plan about using him as a spy.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.260
 You want someone to walk across enemy lines.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.380
 France was at war with Prussia at this point.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:53.420
 You pick a guy who has big, big, flabby cheeks, stinks from 20 meters away, has visible vapor

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.580
 lines coming off of him, and constantly has to stop to have diarrhea.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.940
 Needless to say, the plan didn't really work.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.220
 He eventually, when he went back, he's like, he didn't want to do any more army stuff,

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.900
 so he volunteered to go to hospital.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.140
 The doctors are like, oh my god, this is amazing.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.100
 We can't wait to see how this dude works.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.540
 They tried curing him.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.820
 One of the cures was soft-boiled eggs.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.380
 Let's give him as many soft-boiled eggs as we can.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.700
 And he's like, go, go, go, go, go.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.860
 Didn't work out too well.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:27.420
 One of the things was they had a meal spread, a table spread for 15 laborers who were working

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.820
 to the hospital at that time.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.660
 So they had all this food laid out, and they go, hmm, the doctors are like, hmm, I wonder

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:38.140
 what will happen if we give him food that is set aside for 15 able-bodied men.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.140
 He ate it all.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.140
 He ate it all.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.580
 He complained about hunger all the time.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.700
 If he wasn't eating, he was constantly exhausted.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.740
 So it wasn't just like this circus freak, let me swallow anything.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.380
 He was constantly hungry.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.380
 He had to eat.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.460
 That's why he was digging through the garbage.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.700
 So they saw him eat all that food, and they're like, okay, okay, enough fun, guys.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.100
 Let's go back to trying to cure him.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.580
 And they would put him on these regulated diets.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.580
 But the problem is, is that he wouldn't stick to them.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.420
 He would break out of the hospital, or just walk out of the hospital at night.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.940
 And there was a butcher shop that, you know, they throw all their scraps in the dump and

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.380
 the garbage behind the butcher shop.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.020
 I imagine it's like the lady in the tramp.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.580
 It's just a bunch of spaghetti back there.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.380
 He would go through that, but so would stray dogs.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.860
 So he had to fight stray dogs for food every night just to get some extra food.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.540
 In this hospital, because we're in the 1700s, bloodletting was a thing.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.180
 They had a bloodletting ward.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.820
 Hmm, you're sick.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.060
 Let's take as much blood out of you as possible.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.060
 That might cure you.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.060
 He would drink their blood.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.580
 He would go in there and he'd be like, "Gulp, gulp, gulp."

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:42.580
 And you can imagine like a nurse was walking through the hospital and saw like a silhouette

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.780
 crouched over with like a hose in his mouth.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.180
 And she's like, "Tar rare.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.180
 What are you doing out of your room?"

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.260
 And he's like, "Gulp."

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.380
 And then they caught him.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:56.100
 No joke, because imagine having a hunger that's on the level of a heroin addiction.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.380
 Like you have to eat.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.500
 You have to eat.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.660
 They caught him in the morgue trying to eat corpses.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.660
 And they're like, "Tar rare."

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.060
 No, at that point they were really concerned about.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.460
 So the end of his hospital stay, the end of all the experiments ends like this.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.460
 Tarare's in the hospital.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:18.260
 And he's probably sitting there and he has like an odd shaped lump in his stomach.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.260
 I don't know if that's true.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.980
 I don't know if that's true, but okay, let me try and stick to the fact.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:32.540
 The fact, okay, the fact of the story is, the fact of the story is, Tarare is in the hospital.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.020
 And it was a fully functional hospital.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:40.460
 So they had like the bloodletting ward and the morgue and other stuff going on there,

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.980
 including a maternity ward.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.940
 Oh wait, this baby wouldn't be there because this baby was 14 months old, but they did

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.260
 have a maternity ward.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.140
 So not the maternity ward because this baby's too old.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.460
 This baby's graduated.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.620
 The baby's there for some checkup.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.620
 French measles.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.100
 They want to make sure the baby doesn't have French measles.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:02.340
 So, but one day the mom's like, "Here baby, 14 month old baby, I'm going to set you down

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.740
 on this chair while I read this old timey wood carving magazine."

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:10.140
 So she's like getting splinters reading this wood carving magazine.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.540
 And she turns back, "Baby's gone.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.540
 Baby's gone."

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.380
 Now I don't know if that exact sequence of events happened either.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:24.780
 The point is, is that Terare was in a hospital and a 14 month old baby went completely missing.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.900
 They never ever found the kid.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.340
 And they didn't go, "Oh Terare, this time."

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.660
 They were like, "That dude ate a baby.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.660
 That guy straight up ate a baby."

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:36.660
 And he took off.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.660
 He ran out.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.660
 That's the end of that story.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.620
 I was like, there has to be another answer.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.180
 It has to be that they found the baby later.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:50.060
 But from all accounts, he ate a living baby, which isn't far from the other stuff he's

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.060
 done.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.740
 We know he's eaten live cats and live dogs.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.980
 And he's tried eating humans.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.900
 So I mean, babies kind of look like food.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.140
 They look like little rolls.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.860
 Now I would never eat a baby, but they look puffy.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.780
 And so Terare, as hungry as he is, he could just be like, "Ah, it'll probably taste like

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.980
 dinner rolls and marshmallows."

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.980
 I don't know.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.980
 That's super disgusting.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.820
 Anyways, actually, you think they would have found the bones because he doesn't eat that.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.580
 He runs out of the hospital.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.700
 Eventually though, at age 26, died very, very young.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:25.100
 He goes and he says, he goes to the other doctor and he's like, "Oh, hi, I'm Terare.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:31.620
 You might know me from the baby eating scandal, but I ate a gold fork a while ago and I think

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.940
 it's still in me and I'm super sick."

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:38.500
 Now the doctor is looking at this saggy, fetid, gross diarrhea monster.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.460
 And he's thinking, you know, a guy who ate a gold fork, that's not the weirdest thing

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.340
 about you, but let's take a look.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.820
 So he starts treating him and he goes, "No, you don't have, you may or may not have eaten

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.620
 a golden fork, but you have tuberculosis."

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.620
 Advanced tuberculosis.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.580
 And Terare's like, "No, trust me, dude, I ate a gold fork.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.580
 It's in my stomach.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.580
 It really hurts.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.660
 I've eaten tons of stuff, but for some reason that's not sitting well with me."

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:05.860
 The fact that it's a four-pronged metal object, he eventually does die though.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:12.580
 And in his last moments, like the last couple hours of his life, ten times the worst diarrhea.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.260
 He was pooping out pus, pus and blood-filled diarrhea.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.620
 And then he dies.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:21.940
 A fitting way to end to a man who had diarrhea his entire life.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.820
 He had to tie, he had to one-up it.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:29.220
 And so one of the doctors who treated him at the baby eating hospital came to this hospital

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.740
 because they called him up and they're like, "Hey, remember that baby eating scandal?"

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.820
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, we have that guy here.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.100
 He says he ate a gold fork."

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.620
 And you can imagine the doctor at the other hospital.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:43.020
 By that time, the phone's already like hanging off the desk and he's in his jalopy to get

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.020
 to this hospital.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.900
 Or a horse, because they didn't have cars back then.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.060
 But to get there, because he's like, "Dude, I need to find it.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.220
 I want to find this guy because this guy was like a medical marvel."

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.300
 And he gets there and the body's just laying there and it's super stinky and none of the

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.340
 doctors want to do an autopsy.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.580
 And the baby eating hospital doctor says, "I'll do it.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.100
 I need to find out what made this guy tick."

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.340
 So they cut him open.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.660
 His throat cavity was so huge that if you opened his mouth, you could look down into

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.780
 his stomach.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.580
 His body cavity was filled with pus.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.380
 Like his liver was covered in pus and it was just like an ocean of mucus in there.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.380
 And his stomach, all over the inside of his stomach were math...

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.300
 And his stomach was huge, by the way, like his actual stomach cavity.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.940
 But all over the inside of his stomach were these massive, gross, disgusting tumors.

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.820
 I don't... it wasn't in the description.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.900
 They were gross and disgusting.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.900
 But I'm sure they were.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.700
 I don't think that's a stretch of the imagination.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.980
 And no golden fork.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.420
 So the question is, did he really eat the golden fork?

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.540
 Probably, for whatever reason, because he's terrarium.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:52.540
 But did he poop it out at some point or was his stomach acid so intense he can actually

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.900
 melt metal or gold?

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.660
 I guess gold is a metal, but that's the story of terrarium.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:01.900
 Now like I said, when I read the story when I was a kid it was like, there's this goofy

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:02.900
 guy named Terrarium.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.500
 He'd eat anything.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:10.580
 He was a circus performer and he ate corks and screws and once he even ate a cat.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.980
 And then he turned the page and it's like about the two-headed wolf girl or something

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.540
 like that.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.260
 Nothing about eating babies.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.980
 Nothing about pus filled a diarrhea.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.180
 None of that stuff.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:25.940
 But I remembered that story as a kid looking through like Ripley's Believe It or Not or

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.820
 some crazy person like crazy people in history book.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.780
 They took out all the good stuff.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.620
 That's why I found it for you guys on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.620
 There we go.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.620
 I liked that take.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.060
 Took me four tries.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.060
 But we got it.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.180
 It takes a while to warm up on Mondays.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.020
 It's weird because I have those two days where I don't do anything.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:49.740
 But I went and took a shower and I was like, I gotta do it.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.740
 It's my job.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.740
 I gotta do it.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.740
 But we had a good one.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.060
 I really like this episode.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.060
 Now.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.060
 I really like this episode.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.540
