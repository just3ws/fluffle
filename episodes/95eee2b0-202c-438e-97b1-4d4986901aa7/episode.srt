9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics, where we listen

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,480
 to some of our older episodes with new introductions.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,000
 We got a great set this week because I actually reached out to my Patreon supporters and I

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,120
 said, "Hey guys, what is your favorite episode?"

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,200
 And I got ones that I don't think I would have picked myself and they're good ones,

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,240
 they're really good ones.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,800
 When you've recorded 548 episodes, a lot of stuff gets lost in the shuffle and a lot

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
 of times when I'm scrolling through my files looking for something, trying to do something,

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
 I'm like, "What in the world is that?

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,600
 I don't remember that title.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
 What in the world?

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
 I'll have to look it up."

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,240
 But all of the ones that were picked for this week, right when they just said the title,

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,440
 I was like, "Oh, I remember that episode because these ones really do stand out in one way

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
 or the other."

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,880
 And I was actually given this idea by Mikhail Malone.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,360
 He was actually the first one, he had recently said, "Hey, my favorite episode was Terare."

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,400
 Now I know I'm mispronouncing that still to this day, because I really like that Terare

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,280
 episode and I go, "Oh, that is actually one of my favorites too."

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,100
 And I thought about it and I go, "I'm going to let the Patreons pick this week."

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,200
 So hats off to you Mikhail, you're the one who started this one off.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,160
 First off, when you listen to this episode, if you just want to get to the episode, you

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,600
 can skip past all of this.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:56,040
 This is what I feel is a perfect Dead Rabbit radio episode.

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,240
 Within the course of about 30 minutes, we cover three topics in depth.

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
 In depth.

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,000
 A lot of times people go, "Hey, how come the show's not longer?

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
 How come you don't delve into a story more often?"

37
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,000
 Because of episodes like this, I could have easily taken any one of these topics and talked

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
 about it for an hour straight.

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,880
 But I feel like you'd be dragging it on.

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,160
 The first story about the Indian Temple to this day intrigues me.

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,000
 It's one of those stories, I didn't know it was on this episode until I re-listened

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 to it.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,640
 But I think it probably could have been the headline your episode if I had thought about

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
 it.

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,280
 The story in the Indian Temple is so bizarre.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,960
 Generally I start off with smaller stories, I usually call them starter stories.

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,280
 And then we have the title story at the end.

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,080
 The Indian Temple stands on its own as being a completely bizarre story and to this day

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,040
 I still think about it and I'm like, "I wonder if they've ever opened that door?"

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,360
 Really really weird topic and it stuck with me through 548 episodes.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,840
 The second story is about the Ebola outbreak in Africa.

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,640
 Which it's funny because listening back to it, I'm like, "I don't know, might be

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,600
 much of zombies running around by summertime.

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
 That didn't happen."

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,320
 But instead we got COVID-19.

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,400
 It was like zombies but we couldn't move.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
 We had to stay in our houses.

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
 It was reverse zombies.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,200
 They were in your house and you couldn't get into other people's houses.

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,160
 A very very interesting story.

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,880
 And of course the Terare story.

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,360
 I love this story.

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,920
 And again, I don't want to keep patting myself too much on the back.

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,320
 But you get all the information you need in the, however long it is, 15 minutes long.

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,120
 You can go out and do more research on this guy and you'd probably find like a other weird

66
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,440
 couple of other weird things.

67
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:50,880
 But I was able to boil the bones of Terare into a delicious pus filled soup for us.

68
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,960
 It's an episode that I've thought about.

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,680
 Again, it's 400 episodes later.

70
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,320
 I still think this is a standout episode.

71
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,600
 I hope you guys enjoy it.

72
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,520
 I consider it the blueprint for what I enjoy a good Dead Rabbit radio episode to be.

73
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,760
 A lot of times nowadays there are two stories per episode.

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,240
 Sometimes there's three.

75
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,920
 And I'm shocked when I listen to these old episodes and there's like three stories in

76
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
 them.

77
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,920
 I'm like, whoa, I must have been able to compact stuff.

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,600
 I don't know if I was better at compacting stuff in or if I let stories breathe a little

79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
 more.

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
 I don't know what the balance is.

81
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,760
 Sometimes I'll do three stories.

82
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,720
 But enough with the nerd talk, enough with the behind the scenes talk.

83
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,120
 Guys, I really hope you enjoy this episode of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics, episode 120,

84
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,760
 Terare, the man who ate everything.

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,480
 A temple in India holds riches and curses.

86
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,920
 Then are we on the cusp of a modern day zombie outbreak?

87
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,000
 Seriously, seriously.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,520
 You guys are like nothing serious, but no, no, that's an interesting one.

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,000
 And then we find a man who can eat anything.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It's anything.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

93
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
 I'm having a great day.

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
 I hope you're having a great day too.

96
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
 This is take four.

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,040
 I've spent the past hour here doing different takes.

98
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,320
 It's driving me nuts.

99
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,720
 My needs are actually really hard to do because I've been out of practice for a while and

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,360
 I'm like, "Urgh!"

101
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,720
 But so goes the world of podcasting.

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,240
 There is a guy on YouTube, not a YouTuber as far as I know, but they're one of my listeners

103
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
 on YouTube.

104
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,360
 I love you to death, dude.

105
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,440
 You suggested that I do a story and I thought, "Oh yeah, that'd be an interesting one because

106
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,600
 I had a vague knowledge of it."

107
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,360
 But Pondroll, Pondroll, I know I've seen you pop up on a couple different videos.

108
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,320
 I've seen you commenting on a few of my podcast videos on YouTube.

109
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,280
 And I know you listened to the show.

110
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,640
 So when you suggested this story, you knew the torment you were about to unleash on my

111
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:10,080
 audience because I have a hard time pronouncing cities in America.

112
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,120
 And Pondroll suggested a story that takes place in India.

113
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:24,000
 Now the story is the Padman Abbaswamy Temple.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,960
 I'm not even going to try that one again.

115
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
 The temple.

116
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,080
 And it is this side, Pondroll really, I love you and I'm, "Thanks so much for listening.

117
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,760
 Thanks so much for the suggestion."

118
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,520
 But there's this temple in India that, there's this temple in this India that there was always

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
 this legend that it was full of treasure.

120
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,320
 This is going to be a fairly short story.

121
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,800
 But there was always this rumor that there was this treasure in this temple.

122
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,480
 And back in, what was it, 20, so, so, but back in 2011, the government said, "You know

123
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,600
 what, we should, let's go through and find out actually what's in this temple.

124
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
 We should catalog it."

125
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
 Because it's been there since like 3 AD.

126
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,040
 And they're like, "Hey, finally getting around to it, right?

127
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
 Let's do this."

128
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,560
 While they were snooping around the temple, they found six hidden doors that they never

129
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
 knew was there.

130
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,880
 And we'll get into that in a second because that's an interesting thing.

131
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,520
 You find these six hidden doors and they basically label them A through F. Now, I don't think

132
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,600
 they used the English letters, but it was basically just like, this is door A, this

133
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,560
 is door B, so it's C, so on.

134
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,760
 But in Indian letters.

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:35,800
 And so they start opening the doors and they find amazing riches.

136
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:43,560
 Gold, ancient gold coins, diamonds, gems, diamond necklaces and cased in gold.

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,960
 With gems, I don't know, just these amazing artifacts and they're like, "Oh my God, we're

138
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 rich."

139
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,360
 I mean, we're the government so we're rich anyways, but we have this untold, unheard

140
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,000
 of fortune just laying in this temple and they're opening the doors and they're like,

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 "Doo-lululululu," like just these sparkly gold nuggets hanging out.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,840
 The gold coins are winking at them and little thumbs up, finally finding them.

143
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,360
 But door B can't be opened.

144
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,100
 Door B is sealed shut.

145
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,400
 Now, they were all technically sealed shut and they were all hidden, but door B is impenetrable.

146
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,960
 They've tried opening it several times, you know, like, jiggle-manab, whatever.

147
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,400
 They've tried seeing what's behind door B. But the problem is, is that door B has a legend

148
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
 behind it.

149
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,280
 Now, back in the 1930s, that region was super, super poor and they were actually going there

150
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,480
 having like a starvation issue, which I mean, I guess it's just starvation, that's the issue.

151
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,680
 They didn't have enough food.

152
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,780
 Now this is what I thought was weird because in 2011 they said, "Let's go see what's in

153
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,780
 this temple."

154
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,180
 But in the 1930s, they go, "Hey, we're pretty sure there's a bunch of winking gold coins

155
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,180
 in that temple.

156
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
 Let's go in there."

157
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,860
 And for whatever reason, the first door they tried to open was door B. And sorry, that didn't

158
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
 happen in 1930.

159
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,860
 That happened a hundred years ago.

160
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,180
 So in 1900, the region was, something else happened in 1930.

161
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,140
 So in about 1900, the region's super poor and they're starving and everything like that.

162
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,440
 They go to open door B and they hear a curious sound on the other side of door B. A sound

163
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,000
 you shouldn't hear on this other side of any door in existence.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,280
 That's the sound of the ocean.

165
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,040
 And they're like, "Eh, let's not open this.

166
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,080
 Let's not go here."

167
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,400
 And they thought this door must lead to the Arabian Ocean, which actually I figured would

168
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,120
 be closer to Saudi Arabia, but apparently it's also close to India.

169
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,980
 They have big coastlines, but anyway, so they didn't.

170
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,660
 And then there's just a bunch of people starved.

171
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,380
 I don't know why they didn't try the other doors.

172
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,900
 Maybe they didn't know the other doors were there because they were so well hidden.

173
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,500
 In the 1930s, some burglars were like, "Hey, dude, sometimes when I'm walking by that temple

174
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,940
 I hear the sound of coins winking at me."

175
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,180
 So they try to open door B and a bunch of snakes jump out of the door and chase them

176
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,180
 off.

177
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,940
 Noxious snakes is the term.

178
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,100
 So a smelly snake.

179
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,300
 Or unless the word means something else that I don't know of.

180
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,400
 To this day, that door has never been open.

181
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,680
 Door B has never been open.

182
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,880
 And the legend is that only a cleric or a high level saint can open it.

183
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,880
 So break out your Final Fantasy VII saves and see if you...

184
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,240
 I don't know if there are saints in that.

185
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
 But anyways, break out your role playing game.

186
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,360
 Whatever role playing game you do, level up your saint, try to open this door because they

187
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,440
 believe that it is sealed by magic.

188
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,440
 And unless the seal is broken, even though the door they believe can be opened with modern

189
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,860
 technology, i.e. dynamite, they think that opening the door without removing the magic

190
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,700
 will cause great catastrophe to the region.

191
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,860
 Like a giant new Arabian ocean emptying into the middle of India.

192
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,580
 I think it's interesting because the door has the images of snakes on it and it had

193
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,780
 images of something else I couldn't pronounce.

194
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,380
 Again, thanks, Ponderall.

195
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,660
 And those images are associated in Indian mythology or Indian culture as being warning

196
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
 signs.

197
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,360
 I mentioned once before that there was a group of people who were trying to design a warning

198
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,580
 logo that could be interpreted 10 million years in the future.

199
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,540
 Because we want to bury all this nuclear waste in Nevada.

200
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,720
 But they don't want anyone stumbling across to, you know, long after we're gone and opening

201
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
 the doors and irradiating the entire western half of the United States.

202
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,720
 So they go, "What type of image can we come up with that millions of years from now people

203
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,980
 will not interpret as anything other than dangerous?"

204
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,780
 A skull, a lot of times that represents religious.

205
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,100
 So if archaeologists in the future stumbled across a giant skull in the middle of a desert

206
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,860
 on a door, they may not necessarily equate that with death.

207
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,460
 For the most part, it hasn't been equated with death.

208
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:48,540
 For a long time in human history, skulls meant rebirth or religion.

209
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,260
 But they're saying that this is a warning, do not open this door.

210
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,420
 I think that's really interesting because who knows what's behind it.

211
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,060
 Is it more gold?

212
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,060
 Diamonds?

213
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,700
 The size of an infant?

214
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,860
 Is it something?

215
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,860
 Is it some magical portal to somewhere else?

216
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,140
 Is it a super weapon that was hidden there?

217
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,300
 Or is it just an empty room?

218
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
 We don't know.

219
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,180
 And it's funny because the Indian government is in no hurry to figure it out.

220
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,500
 So that is the story of the temple I can't pronounce.

221
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,340
 Indiana Jones and the Temple I Can't Pronounce.

222
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:25,260
 You know what's so funny is that intriguing is the story is it delves a lot into Indian

223
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,660
 mythology and I just can't pronounce the words.

224
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,420
 And I'm not going to put you through that.

225
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,820
 So we're leaving India.

226
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,700
 We'll probably be back to India at some point because they do have a lot of cool mythology.

227
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,860
 It's the language barrier.

228
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,940
 I just can't pronounce that stuff.

229
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,420
 And I don't like to give foreign places nicknames like "Padaha Mata Ta Ta Castle" or we'll

230
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,620
 just call it "Patti."

231
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,860
 I don't like to do that.

232
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,580
 But anyways, so we're off.

233
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:59,300
 Now we're going from India and the legends involving that to Africa, modern day Africa.

234
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,300
 Now we're in the Congo.

235
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,780
 Now this is an interesting story because this just popped up in the news.

236
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,180
 They're having an Ebola outbreak again.

237
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,860
 It's not just any Ebola outbreak.

238
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,860
 This is the second biggest Ebola outbreak in history.

239
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,660
 Now they've had them and it's been fairly restricted to villages.

240
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,860
 And they go, "Okay, that's not like a good thing."

241
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,100
 And I'm like, "Yay, just villages."

242
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,540
 But it could have been a lot, lot worse.

243
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,820
 And the problem is, is that we might be there now.

244
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,220
 Because they have this city.

245
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,020
 It's called Butembo in the Congo.

246
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,420
 And it has a population, it's a city.

247
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,620
 It has a population of over a million people.

248
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,140
 And Ebola has not hit a major city yet.

249
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,940
 And we're starting to see outbreaks in the suburbs and in outlying communities.

250
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:55,340
 Ebola, if you don't know, is incredibly contagious and has a kill rate between 50% and 90%.

251
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,860
 It can be transmitted through a drop, a drop of sweat or blood.

252
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,940
 So people riding on the subway, they're sweaty.

253
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,140
 You just want to stay away from them anyways, but they're like, "Woohoohoo, shaking their

254
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,860
 head like a dog is flying everywhere."

255
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,900
 It's like Beethoven, but Ebola infected.

256
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,500
 It can take up to nine days before you start to become symptomatic.

257
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,820
 So you can have it and spread it and not know it.

258
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,060
 And then you start pooping out blood.

259
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,460
 Basically, you liquefy from the inside out.

260
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,260
 That's what ends up killing you.

261
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,320
 You'll start to get like, some people get rashes, some people get bloodshot eyes.

262
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,820
 Some people, it starts off with confusion and things like that.

263
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,020
 But the end result that will kill you is massive blood loss.

264
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,620
 Your organs liquefy.

265
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,540
 And then you throw up and you poop out blood until you die.

266
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,540
 It's very brutal.

267
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,140
 You're seeing some photos of people dying from it.

268
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
 They're alive.

269
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,820
 I saw a photo of a guy sitting in the middle of a street.

270
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,620
 He's just blood all on the ground underneath his butt.

271
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
 He's laying down.

272
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
 He's sitting.

273
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,820
 But you just see a puddle of blood because he's pooping out blood and he's reaching

274
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,620
 out for help and everyone else in the photo has given him like a 10 foot radius.

275
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,620
 Because he's dead.

276
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,620
 There's nothing you can do.

277
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,860
 And part of the problem is not only is Ebola highly contagious, but the burial rituals

278
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:19,340
 in the Congo and in other regions of this area, they require the people to clean the body,

279
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,940
 to wash the bodies off.

280
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,500
 And if they're a very famous person, sometimes you'll lay on the body and be like, "Oh,

281
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,060
 yeah, Elvis, such great music.

282
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,380
 Let me lay on your body."

283
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,820
 Which gives you Ebola.

284
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,660
 And then you die and then your loved ones wash your body, clean your body, things like

285
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,500
 that.

286
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,020
 That interesting article where the person says, "Imagine having a millennial old tradition

287
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,700
 and all of a sudden a couple guys show up in hazmat suits and say, 'Just throw it in

288
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,140
 a bag and burn it.'"

289
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,540
 And that's the problem they're having over in these regions.

290
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,900
 They've been having these burial practices for hundreds, hundreds of years and now people

291
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,420
 are showing up in pretty much space suits saying, "No, can't say goodbye.

292
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
 Just throw it in a bag."

293
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,420
 That's it.

294
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,580
 Can't touch it.

295
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
 Now it's hitting a city.

296
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
 Like I said, it's only outskirts.

297
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,660
 It hasn't gotten to the main part of town, but it seems like it's only a matter of time.

298
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
 And here's the problem.

299
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:19,740
 Merrick, the group that makes the Ebola, it's an experimental Ebola vaccine.

300
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,540
 So they're not entirely for sure that it works.

301
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,420
 They're pretty sure that it works.

302
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:30,700
 They give it to people and it seems to work, but they've only dealt with basic "minor"

303
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
 outbreaks.

304
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,740
 This outbreak was around 11,000 people.

305
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:41,300
 So they go, "Okay, well, let's stockpile 300,000 doses of this vaccine."

306
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
 Takes months to prepare.

307
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,580
 But they go 300,000.

308
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,660
 That's a good starting point.

309
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,900
 But with over a million people in the city, it's not even half that can be vaccinated

310
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,220
 from this.

311
00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:01,660
 You could have a city full of skyscrapers and restaurants and coffee shops and skate

312
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,700
 parks, a wash in blood by next summer.

313
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,340
 It would be like a zombie movie.

314
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,300
 And the weirdest part about this, and they don't know what they're going to do.

315
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,700
 Merrick has said, "We don't know if we can have enough vaccines ready to go."

316
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,020
 And another thing with this outbreak is people are coming down with Ebola and they don't

317
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,740
 know where they got it from.

318
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,020
 Normally, you would have one person go, "Well, yeah, I was holding hands with that dude."

319
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,380
 And that's how I got Ebola.

320
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,820
 But now people are showing up and they're like, "Well, do you know anyone who died of

321
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
 Ebola?"

322
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,260
 And they're like, "No, I don't know anyone who died of Ebola."

323
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,100
 So it may already get spread in that droplet form.

324
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,820
 All it takes to, I mean, this was the big controversy a couple years ago, is it takes

325
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,380
 nine days someone to get on a plane and go to another country.

326
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,660
 But they don't have enough vaccines to inoculate an entire city.

327
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,900
 They don't know how some people are catching it, which is very worrying.

328
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,620
 But the vaccine, I remember reading about this a couple years ago, the vaccine itself.

329
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,180
 So Merrick is a company and a company's goal is to make profit.

330
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,500
 Companies tend to have secondary goals.

331
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,780
 Walmart's goal is to make profit.

332
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,780
 And Sam Walton's goal, at least, you can argue whether or not Walmart's still about it.

333
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:23,060
 But Sam Walton's goal was to give customers low price items.

334
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,700
 That was, I mean, he wanted to make money and keep the company going.

335
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,220
 But his secondary goal was to allow people to buy stuff at the lowest price possible.

336
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,660
 That's an admirable goal.

337
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,900
 Merrick, their main goal is to make money.

338
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,260
 And their secondary goal is to help people.

339
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,900
 But when you come, and most corporations are like that, Amazon's like, "Hey, we want you

340
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,500
 to have access to all the entertainment you want to, but our main goal is to make money."

341
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,260
 There's a little capitalism side note there.

342
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,900
 Merrick said, "Listen, we can make this Ebola vaccine, but the truth of the matter is that

343
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,540
 Ebola is quite rare.

344
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,140
 So the amount of money that we put into making this vaccine, we have to recoup.

345
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,900
 Not just the research and development, but the making, producing the actual physical

346
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
 vaccine itself.

347
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
 It's quite rare.

348
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,100
 It'll take us forever to recoup a profit from making this."

349
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:17,340
 And then someone, some genius there, probably Max Brooks or George Romero, said, "You know

350
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,020
 what else is rare?

351
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:25,800
 That we have a vaccine for that we can stockpile, but it's so rare it doesn't really make

352
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,980
 it cost effective for us to make all this vaccine for.

353
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,700
 And we can combine them together."

354
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,300
 And they're like, "Yes, Mr. Romero, what's your suggestion?"

355
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,460
 And he goes, "Rabies.

356
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,540
 Rabies is a vaccine that is needed that we have, but it doesn't make sense for us to

357
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,820
 make a separate rabies vaccine.

358
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,900
 What if we took, this is 100% true.

359
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,500
 What if we took the rabies vaccine and the Ebola vaccine, combined them into a single

360
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,020
 vaccine so we can give it to either person?"

361
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,420
 People are like, "Yay, clapping, having no..."

362
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,860
 You ever wonder why people in zombie movies act like they've never seen a zombie movie?

363
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,700
 Because people in our planet act like they've never seen a zombie movie.

364
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
 Why would you invent something?

365
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:15,900
 Because remember, a vaccine tends to have an element of the disease in the vaccine.

366
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,780
 That might not hold true across all vaccines, but like the flu vaccine, they're like, "Oh,

367
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,700
 yeah, it has a little bit of the flu vaccine.

368
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
 You might get sick.

369
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
 You might find a little..."

370
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,340
 You're going to give me rabies if I have Ebola?

371
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,420
 Or if I have rabies, you're going to inject me with something that has Ebola in it?

372
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,700
 You're basically created a crazy, blood spewing monster.

373
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,700
 Who's just going to run around spitting blood at everybody and doesn't care because he

374
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,020
 has rabies.

375
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,260
 Why would you combine those two?

376
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,580
 Why don't you combine Ebola and like, I don't know, anti-depression medicine or something

377
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,700
 that makes you sleepy?

378
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
 Anything else!

379
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,820
 I guess people who have depression don't want to be injected full of Ebola, but those

380
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,100
 are the two...

381
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
 Those...

382
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,580
 That's like at the beginning of "I Am Legend" the movie.

383
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,060
 They invent the cure for cancer and it turns everyone into a vampire.

384
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,980
 I don't know if I would take that vaccine and I don't know if I would hang out with

385
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:16,100
 anybody who took that vaccine because again, you've now created a crazy, a 28 days later,

386
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,900
 rage-infected monster.

387
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,580
 No!

388
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,980
 Put something else in that vaccine, Merck.

389
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:32,140
 But 300,000 doses of that rabies/Ebola vaccine is on its way to a major city in Africa.

390
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,940
 Okay, the last story we're going to talk about, it's funny because I heard about this story

391
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,420
 when I was a kid because I've always been reading this weird stuff and as I was researching

392
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:47,020
 this I realized the version I heard as a kid was heavily edited.

393
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,340
 So we're going to France.

394
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
 We will take...

395
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,980
 We'll hop in the Carpenter copter because I want to get out of the Ebola city of Congo.

396
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,100
 We're going to fly above just right like they're like running towards the helicopter.

397
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,100
 Get on!

398
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
 Get on!

399
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
 Get on!

400
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100
 Get on!

401
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
 Get on!

402
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
 Get on!

403
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
 Get on!

404
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
 That's not you making that noise, that's the zombies behind you.

405
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
 You hop into the helicopter.

406
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,340
 It's so funny, I get accused of racism all the time for this podcast.

407
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,540
 This isn't helping but anyways, they're chasing us down.

408
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
 Jump in the helicopter.

409
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,760
 They're forming like a human pyramid to try to get us.

410
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
 Take off.

411
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,740
 Just as we start to see the nuke coming towards the city.

412
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,900
 Anyways, we're going to go to France.

413
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,420
 We're going to go back in time so you don't have to worry about zombies.

414
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,820
 I don't know why the helicopter made an airplane noise but anyways, we land.

415
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,100
 And we're now in the 1700s.

416
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,020
 We're in 1700s France.

417
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,300
 And there we're going to meet, we see a guy walking down the...

418
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
 They had road spec then.

419
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,700
 Walking down the trail, that's a safe bet.

420
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,180
 He's walking down a place where there's no grass and a straight line.

421
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,740
 And his name is Tarreir.

422
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:05,260
 Now, again, I had to talk about this during the India segment earlier.

423
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,580
 You should know by now that I can't pronounce my R's either.

424
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,140
 So if you don't know what I'm saying, he's a French guy and his name is Tarreir.

425
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,140
 So anyways, Tarreir...

426
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,140
 Tarreir...

427
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,820
 I don't know why I picked these stories to go all the same episode.

428
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,460
 Tarreir is this French guy.

429
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,220
 We look at him and we're like, "That is a skinny man.

430
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,220
 That is a skinny man.

431
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,940
 He is of normal height, whatever that may be.

432
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
 He's 100 pounds.

433
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,460
 He looks to be 100 pounds."

434
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,980
 You're like, "Oh man, you didn't eat something.

435
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,540
 100 pounds for being in your 20s is quite slender."

436
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:42,740
 That's when he lifts up his shirt and billows of loose skin just...

437
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,020
 And like deflated balloon just kind of like sloped towards the ground.

438
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,660
 And you notice that even though he's only in his 20s, his face is super wrinkly.

439
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:59,420
 He looks like a 100 pound man whose skin is just melted jello.

440
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,660
 Now Tarreir was a medical freak.

441
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,820
 There's a few other people who have this condition, but Tarreir is the most notable.

442
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,580
 When he was a kid, his appetite was insatiable.

443
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,020
 He couldn't stop eating.

444
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,220
 And eventually he literally...

445
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,700
 Not literally, but he ate them out of house and home.

446
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
 He didn't eat the house.

447
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
 He was like, "You know what?

448
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,180
 Actually, he would have.

449
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,180
 We'll get to that in a second."

450
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,220
 He actually would have given the chance.

451
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,740
 And so his parents kicked him out because they were like, "We saw you eyeing the floorboards.

452
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,540
 They kicked him out because he couldn't afford to keep them."

453
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,780
 He ends up joining a bunch of circus freaks and his show was...

454
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,780
 Let me eat whatever you got in your pockets.

455
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,780
 Hey, you.

456
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,620
 What do you have in your pockets?

457
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,140
 And he's like, "I don't know.

458
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,820
 A couple shillings."

459
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,940
 And he's like, "Well, that's weird.

460
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
 This is friends.

461
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
 You should have frogs."

462
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,940
 And he's like, "Oh yes, that's right.

463
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
 I meant frogs."

464
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,940
 So he'd eat the frogs.

465
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
 And he goes, "What do you have?"

466
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,700
 And the person's like, "I have this potted plant in my purse."

467
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,700
 And he's like, "Give it to me."

468
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,300
 "Aah, he'd eat it."

469
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,620
 Now his jaw didn't just stand and he ate a whole pot, but he would eat cats.

470
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,780
 He'd be like, "Hey, hey, cat lady.

471
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,780
 Can I borrow one of those?"

472
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,780
 And she's like, "Sure."

473
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,940
 And he's gonna pet it and he's like, "Some pet it from the inside."

474
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,020
 He'd rip its stomach open and eat the guts.

475
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:17,540
 And then he would eat everything but the bones and then he'd throw up the fur and the skin.

476
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,940
 And then at that point, everyone kind of just applauded.

477
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,660
 At one point he was doing this act and he got an obstruction in the stomach and the

478
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,420
 other circus performers had to take him to the doctor.

479
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,420
 And the doctor was like fixing him up and he goes, "Hey, you know, I do this act."

480
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
 That's your story.

481
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,300
 He goes, "You know, I do this act where I can eat anything."

482
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
 The doctor's like, "Really?"

483
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,820
 He's like, "Hey, let me eat your gold watch."

484
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,940
 He couldn't stop eating stuff.

485
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,860
 And the doctor said, "If you ate my watch, I'm gonna cut you open and get it out."

486
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,940
 To which I imagined Terare grabbed the collar of his shirt and went, "Gold?"

487
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,340
 But anyways, he couldn't stop eating stuff.

488
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,260
 Eventually he joined the military, which considering that that life is so regimented, it seemed

489
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,620
 like a bizarre choice, but maybe just doing his civic duty.

490
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,340
 And he would eat all of his rations and then he would do chores around the camp to eat

491
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,940
 other people's rations.

492
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,700
 And then he started eating food out of the garbage and that's nothing compared to what's

493
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
 coming.

494
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,780
 He started eating food out of the garbage.

495
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,820
 And the army was like, "Dude, seriously."

496
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,980
 And when he'd eat, like all of his loose skin would inflate like a balloon.

497
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,980
 He could actually fill his body up with food and then as it would dissolve, his skin would

498
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,460
 get super loose again.

499
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,260
 And finally there was this dude at the camp, the commander, and he goes, "This guy's driving

500
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,980
 me nuts, but I have a plan."

501
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:35,700
 I'm gonna make him swallow little wooden boxes with battle plans on them and then he'll just

502
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,260
 walk across enemy lines and no one will notice him because he just looks like a normal dude.

503
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,860
 And then he'll poop out the plans to somebody else.

504
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,220
 And so they do a test, they give him a little wooden box and put a piece of paper in it

505
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,460
 and he swallows it and then a couple days later he poops it out or a couple hours later

506
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,420
 whatever and poops it out and the box was fine and they're like, "Oh, this plan's gonna

507
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
 work."

508
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,420
 Now let me tell you a little bit more about Tarare.

509
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,980
 This was his description.

510
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,940
 He had an abnormally wide mouth and near invisible lips.

511
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,780
 Now I don't think that meant they were like the invisible woman that you could see through

512
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
 me.

513
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,500
 I think they just meant that he had super, super thin lips.

514
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,460
 Like I said, his face was super wrinkly, his skin hung super low, his skin, like if you

515
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,220
 touched him, it was hot.

516
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,740
 He was hot to the touch, it's probably a big part of his metabolism.

517
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,380
 And he was described this as a quote, "He stunk to such a degree that he could not be

518
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,820
 endured within the distance of 20 paces."

519
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,820
 So just a super stink bag.

520
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,380
 You didn't want to be near him.

521
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,020
 And that was normal.

522
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,860
 When he ate, he smelled worse.

523
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:44,660
 He had constant diarrhea, constant diarrhea, and that gives a new angle to the story of

524
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,500
 them waiting around for him to poop out the box and it's all just like a huge puddle and

525
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,500
 they're like, "Okay, let's get a private in here to dig through this stuff because I'm

526
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 not."

527
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,660
 He had chronic diarrhea and it was, and again, quote, "fetted beyond all conception."

528
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,660
 So they should add a poet in the room because you hear that phrase, they should send a poet

529
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,660
 to space.

530
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:13,780
 They should have had a poet beyond all conception, beyond what great ideas lay out in the universe

531
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:18,700
 they could not use to describe the smell of his diarrhea.

532
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:25,020
 And I don't know, I don't know how this is possible, but they said that you could look

533
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,240
 at him and vapor, like stink lines, came out of his skin.

534
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,660
 You could see a visible vapor around him.

535
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,700
 They're just the stench.

536
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,740
 Now let's go back to that plan about using him as a spy.

537
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,260
 You want someone to walk across enemy lines.

538
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,380
 France was at war with Prussia at this point.

539
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:53,420
 You pick a guy who has big, big, flabby cheeks, stinks from 20 meters away, has visible vapor

540
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,580
 lines coming off of him, and constantly has to stop to have diarrhea.

541
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,940
 Needless to say, the plan didn't really work.

542
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,220
 He eventually, when he went back, he's like, he didn't want to do any more army stuff,

543
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,900
 so he volunteered to go to hospital.

544
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,140
 The doctors are like, oh my god, this is amazing.

545
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,100
 We can't wait to see how this dude works.

546
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,540
 They tried curing him.

547
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,820
 One of the cures was soft-boiled eggs.

548
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,380
 Let's give him as many soft-boiled eggs as we can.

549
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,700
 And he's like, go, go, go, go, go.

550
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,860
 Didn't work out too well.

551
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:27,420
 One of the things was they had a meal spread, a table spread for 15 laborers who were working

552
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,820
 to the hospital at that time.

553
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,660
 So they had all this food laid out, and they go, hmm, the doctors are like, hmm, I wonder

554
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:38,140
 what will happen if we give him food that is set aside for 15 able-bodied men.

555
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,140
 He ate it all.

556
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,140
 He ate it all.

557
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,580
 He complained about hunger all the time.

558
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,700
 If he wasn't eating, he was constantly exhausted.

559
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,740
 So it wasn't just like this circus freak, let me swallow anything.

560
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,380
 He was constantly hungry.

561
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,380
 He had to eat.

562
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,460
 That's why he was digging through the garbage.

563
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,700
 So they saw him eat all that food, and they're like, okay, okay, enough fun, guys.

564
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,100
 Let's go back to trying to cure him.

565
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,580
 And they would put him on these regulated diets.

566
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,580
 But the problem is, is that he wouldn't stick to them.

567
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,420
 He would break out of the hospital, or just walk out of the hospital at night.

568
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,940
 And there was a butcher shop that, you know, they throw all their scraps in the dump and

569
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,380
 the garbage behind the butcher shop.

570
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,020
 I imagine it's like the lady in the tramp.

571
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,580
 It's just a bunch of spaghetti back there.

572
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,380
 He would go through that, but so would stray dogs.

573
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,860
 So he had to fight stray dogs for food every night just to get some extra food.

574
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,540
 In this hospital, because we're in the 1700s, bloodletting was a thing.

575
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,180
 They had a bloodletting ward.

576
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,820
 Hmm, you're sick.

577
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,060
 Let's take as much blood out of you as possible.

578
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
 That might cure you.

579
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
 He would drink their blood.

580
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,580
 He would go in there and he'd be like, "Gulp, gulp, gulp."

581
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,580
 And you can imagine like a nurse was walking through the hospital and saw like a silhouette

582
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,780
 crouched over with like a hose in his mouth.

583
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,180
 And she's like, "Tar rare.

584
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
 What are you doing out of your room?"

585
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,260
 And he's like, "Gulp."

586
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,380
 And then they caught him.

587
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,100
 No joke, because imagine having a hunger that's on the level of a heroin addiction.

588
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,380
 Like you have to eat.

589
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,500
 You have to eat.

590
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,660
 They caught him in the morgue trying to eat corpses.

591
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,660
 And they're like, "Tar rare."

592
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,060
 No, at that point they were really concerned about.

593
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,460
 So the end of his hospital stay, the end of all the experiments ends like this.

594
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,460
 Tarare's in the hospital.

595
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:18,260
 And he's probably sitting there and he has like an odd shaped lump in his stomach.

596
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
 I don't know if that's true.

597
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,980
 I don't know if that's true, but okay, let me try and stick to the fact.

598
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:32,540
 The fact, okay, the fact of the story is, the fact of the story is, Tarare is in the hospital.

599
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,020
 And it was a fully functional hospital.

600
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:40,460
 So they had like the bloodletting ward and the morgue and other stuff going on there,

601
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,980
 including a maternity ward.

602
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,940
 Oh wait, this baby wouldn't be there because this baby was 14 months old, but they did

603
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,260
 have a maternity ward.

604
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,140
 So not the maternity ward because this baby's too old.

605
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,460
 This baby's graduated.

606
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,620
 The baby's there for some checkup.

607
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,620
 French measles.

608
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,100
 They want to make sure the baby doesn't have French measles.

609
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:02,340
 So, but one day the mom's like, "Here baby, 14 month old baby, I'm going to set you down

610
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,740
 on this chair while I read this old timey wood carving magazine."

611
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,140
 So she's like getting splinters reading this wood carving magazine.

612
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,540
 And she turns back, "Baby's gone.

613
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
 Baby's gone."

614
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,380
 Now I don't know if that exact sequence of events happened either.

615
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:24,780
 The point is, is that Terare was in a hospital and a 14 month old baby went completely missing.

616
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,900
 They never ever found the kid.

617
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,340
 And they didn't go, "Oh Terare, this time."

618
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,660
 They were like, "That dude ate a baby.

619
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,660
 That guy straight up ate a baby."

620
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,660
 And he took off.

621
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,660
 He ran out.

622
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
 That's the end of that story.

623
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,620
 I was like, there has to be another answer.

624
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,180
 It has to be that they found the baby later.

625
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:50,060
 But from all accounts, he ate a living baby, which isn't far from the other stuff he's

626
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,060
 done.

627
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,740
 We know he's eaten live cats and live dogs.

628
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,980
 And he's tried eating humans.

629
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,900
 So I mean, babies kind of look like food.

630
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,140
 They look like little rolls.

631
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,860
 Now I would never eat a baby, but they look puffy.

632
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,780
 And so Terare, as hungry as he is, he could just be like, "Ah, it'll probably taste like

633
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,980
 dinner rolls and marshmallows."

634
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,980
 I don't know.

635
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
 That's super disgusting.

636
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,820
 Anyways, actually, you think they would have found the bones because he doesn't eat that.

637
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,580
 He runs out of the hospital.

638
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,700
 Eventually though, at age 26, died very, very young.

639
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,100
 He goes and he says, he goes to the other doctor and he's like, "Oh, hi, I'm Terare.

640
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,620
 You might know me from the baby eating scandal, but I ate a gold fork a while ago and I think

641
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,940
 it's still in me and I'm super sick."

642
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,500
 Now the doctor is looking at this saggy, fetid, gross diarrhea monster.

643
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,460
 And he's thinking, you know, a guy who ate a gold fork, that's not the weirdest thing

644
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,340
 about you, but let's take a look.

645
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,820
 So he starts treating him and he goes, "No, you don't have, you may or may not have eaten

646
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,620
 a golden fork, but you have tuberculosis."

647
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
 Advanced tuberculosis.

648
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,580
 And Terare's like, "No, trust me, dude, I ate a gold fork.

649
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,580
 It's in my stomach.

650
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,580
 It really hurts.

651
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,660
 I've eaten tons of stuff, but for some reason that's not sitting well with me."

652
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,860
 The fact that it's a four-pronged metal object, he eventually does die though.

653
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:12,580
 And in his last moments, like the last couple hours of his life, ten times the worst diarrhea.

654
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,260
 He was pooping out pus, pus and blood-filled diarrhea.

655
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,620
 And then he dies.

656
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,940
 A fitting way to end to a man who had diarrhea his entire life.

657
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,820
 He had to tie, he had to one-up it.

658
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,220
 And so one of the doctors who treated him at the baby eating hospital came to this hospital

659
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,740
 because they called him up and they're like, "Hey, remember that baby eating scandal?"

660
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,820
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, we have that guy here.

661
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,100
 He says he ate a gold fork."

662
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,620
 And you can imagine the doctor at the other hospital.

663
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:43,020
 By that time, the phone's already like hanging off the desk and he's in his jalopy to get

664
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
 to this hospital.

665
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,900
 Or a horse, because they didn't have cars back then.

666
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,060
 But to get there, because he's like, "Dude, I need to find it.

667
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,220
 I want to find this guy because this guy was like a medical marvel."

668
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,300
 And he gets there and the body's just laying there and it's super stinky and none of the

669
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,340
 doctors want to do an autopsy.

670
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,580
 And the baby eating hospital doctor says, "I'll do it.

671
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,100
 I need to find out what made this guy tick."

672
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,340
 So they cut him open.

673
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,660
 His throat cavity was so huge that if you opened his mouth, you could look down into

674
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,780
 his stomach.

675
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,580
 His body cavity was filled with pus.

676
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,380
 Like his liver was covered in pus and it was just like an ocean of mucus in there.

677
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,380
 And his stomach, all over the inside of his stomach were math...

678
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,300
 And his stomach was huge, by the way, like his actual stomach cavity.

679
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,940
 But all over the inside of his stomach were these massive, gross, disgusting tumors.

680
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,820
 I don't... it wasn't in the description.

681
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,900
 They were gross and disgusting.

682
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
 But I'm sure they were.

683
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,700
 I don't think that's a stretch of the imagination.

684
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,980
 And no golden fork.

685
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,420
 So the question is, did he really eat the golden fork?

686
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,540
 Probably, for whatever reason, because he's terrarium.

687
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,540
 But did he poop it out at some point or was his stomach acid so intense he can actually

688
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,900
 melt metal or gold?

689
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,660
 I guess gold is a metal, but that's the story of terrarium.

690
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,900
 Now like I said, when I read the story when I was a kid it was like, there's this goofy

691
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,900
 guy named Terrarium.

692
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,500
 He'd eat anything.

693
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,580
 He was a circus performer and he ate corks and screws and once he even ate a cat.

694
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,980
 And then he turned the page and it's like about the two-headed wolf girl or something

695
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,540
 like that.

696
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,260
 Nothing about eating babies.

697
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,980
 Nothing about pus filled a diarrhea.

698
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,180
 None of that stuff.

699
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,940
 But I remembered that story as a kid looking through like Ripley's Believe It or Not or

700
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,820
 some crazy person like crazy people in history book.

701
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,780
 They took out all the good stuff.

702
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,620
 That's why I found it for you guys on Dead Rabbit Radio.

703
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,620
 There we go.

704
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,620
 I liked that take.

705
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,060
 Took me four tries.

706
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,060
 But we got it.

707
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,180
 It takes a while to warm up on Mondays.

708
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,020
 It's weird because I have those two days where I don't do anything.

709
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,740
 But I went and took a shower and I was like, I gotta do it.

710
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
 It's my job.

711
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
 I gotta do it.

712
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,740
 But we had a good one.

713
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,060
 I really like this episode.

714
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
 Now.

715
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
 I really like this episode.

716
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,540
