1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 A group of girls share a secret in the basement.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,760
 And then we take to the high seas to meet one of America's most notorious pirates.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,280
 But is it possible this man wasn't just in it for the booty, he was also in it to serve

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,600
 the Dark Lord today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:34,560
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,440
 I'm your host Aiden Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,800
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,200
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,480
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,080
 First off walking into Dead Rabbit Command is a long time Patreon supporter but this is

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,760
 the first time he's gotten his shout out.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,960
 Come get on your feet and give it up for Denby Jones.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,320
 Woohoo yeah walk on in, walk on in little doggy into Dead Rabbit Command.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,240
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,720
 Denby Jones has been a Patreon supporter for a couple months now but he requested a particular

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,760
 type of story so I mean it's gonna take a while.

17
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,600
 These stories they're hard to find to begin with but we're so glad to have you here and

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
 I finally found an awesome one for you.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,640
 Denby you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,040
 You guys can't support the Patreon or support the show financially however that's totally

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
 fine.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,360
 It really really is.

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,560
 Just spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,120
 Tell your friends, your coworkers, talk about it with strangers online.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,800
 All those ways help the show grow.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,800
 Denby let's go ahead and get this journey started.

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,520
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the oars for the Dead Rabbit Robot.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,520
 Throw us all the way out to a little girl's house.

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
 Splash!

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
 Oh splash!

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,000
 Oh get that upper body workout as we're rolling down a river that goes straight from Dead Rabbit

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,880
 Command to a little girl's house.

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,880
 A little girl's basement.

35
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,360
 To be specific.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,120
 This is one of those stories I found online.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,640
 We don't have an exact name.

38
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,120
 We don't have a date or a location for where the story took place.

39
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,400
 So America maybe?

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,040
 Apparently a place that has a river flowing right into their basement.

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,080
 I found that online it was written by someone called 315 Retro but that's actually the main

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,680
 subject of the story, Son.

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,440
 We're gonna call him Frank.

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:40,480
 Frank recently posted the story about his mom who we'll refer to as Sally.

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,600
 When Sally was a little girl she had a secret.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,920
 It wasn't hers alone.

47
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,040
 There were a couple of other girls in the neighborhood who also knew about this secret.

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,800
 And they didn't want to tell anybody.

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,880
 Not because they thought they would get in trouble.

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,840
 Not because they thought they would get ridiculed.

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,400
 They didn't want to tell anyone because they believed if anyone else knew about the basement

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,680
 it would stop working.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,080
 It's an interesting scenario.

54
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,720
 We don't have an age of these little girls but you know let's just say they're between

55
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,120
 the ages of like say 6 and 9.

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,840
 And they had the wherewithal to think that what is happening in this basement is not

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,520
 normal.

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,800
 It's a miracle.

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,120
 And if we let people know then it will stop working.

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,360
 There was no reason.

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
 There was no concrete reason.

62
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,240
 Nobody told them that.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,440
 But they knew.

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
 They knew.

65
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,400
 And I think that's the right call honestly.

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:56,000
 If anyone else had known about this story at the time stop working.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
 Sally would go downstairs with a couple of her girlfriends from the neighborhood or they'd

68
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,240
 all swing by Sally's house.

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,760
 This was in Sally's house.

70
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,280
 It was her basement.

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,520
 They'd walk down the stairs and make sure the door was shut.

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,560
 Make sure they were safe from prying eyes.

73
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,880
 And Sally would be standing there and then she would start to hover.

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:30,400
 Just an inch or two at first but she would find herself floating over the ground.

75
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,320
 Her girlfriends could do the same thing.

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
 All of these girls in this area.

77
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,680
 All of the girls who knew about the secret who would come down to Sally's basement.

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,320
 They would start to hover a few inches off the ground.

79
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,600
 And then they begin to fly.

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,080
 A small collection of girls who don't have an exact number.

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,040
 I imagine if you had any more than four girls flying in a single location there would be

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,840
 a lot of bumping of heads.

83
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,360
 So maybe three or four of these girls are now hovering around the basement.

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
 I'm sure there were a lot of "wee"s.

85
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,480
 I'm sure there were a lot of enjoyment as they were flying.

86
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,200
 But you'd also want to be super quiet because you don't want the mom being like "what are

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
 your girls doing down there?

88
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,520
 Why do you guys keep going wee?"

89
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,640
 They'd fly around the basement.

90
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,720
 They'd fly around.

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,960
 And Sally goes "we would..."

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,560
 This is so interesting because in one hand this sounds like a dumb detail.

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,960
 This sounds like just like "why?"

94
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,280
 Out of everything you could do if you could fly in the basement why would you do this?

95
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,240
 But it almost feels like again Sally knew what was going on was impossible.

96
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,760
 So if she ever had to convince somebody that it was real this would be a detail she'd give.

97
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:51,320
 She goes "we would float up so high that we could actually look at the tops of the shelves."

98
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,440
 Shelfs that were always too high for us to see when we're walking because we're little

99
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,880
 kids.

100
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,960
 We'd fly up and we could look at the tops of these shelves.

101
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
 They're very dusty.

102
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
 It doesn't give a lot of detail.

103
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,400
 It doesn't give a lot of...

104
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,680
 Every shelf is dusty in the basement.

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,760
 But anyways she goes "we would fly up there.

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,080
 We would look at the tops of shelves."

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,560
 Now that would be a detail that you would want to observe in case anyone ever doubted you.

108
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,000
 You could go "well there's a blue marble up on that shelf.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,680
 I know it because I saw it.

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,720
 But it's impossible for me to see from the ground."

111
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,120
 So on the one hand they were building up this ability to prove that this was real but they

112
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,600
 also knew if they told anyone it would stop.

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:40,200
 She said that not every girl was able to fly to the same level.

114
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,000
 Some of them could simply hover a bit.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,400
 Some of the girls it took a while for them to even learn how to hover.

116
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,640
 But eventually they could all do it to some extent.

117
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,240
 They could all gain this ability.

118
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,240
 Sally said we used to fly around the basement.

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,680
 The kids would come over and we'd do it and it only worked in my basement.

120
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,720
 If we went to any of my girlfriend's basements it didn't work there.

121
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,000
 I was the coolest kid in school by default.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,880
 I had the gravity-defying basement.

123
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:26,000
 She said we did this for quite a few months but then we ended up moving.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,920
 We moved to a new house and she was never able to float again.

125
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:41,080
 It truly did only work in that basement.

126
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,000
 So what's interesting is I'm sure they lived in this house for a period of time.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,640
 I don't think they just moved into this house for a couple months and Sally's floating around

128
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
 and then they moved.

129
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,320
 I'm sure it was a totally normal basement for a long period of time and then for whatever

130
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,120
 reason then this was discovered.

131
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
 This ability was discovered.

132
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
 It's a fascinating story nonetheless.

133
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,520
 The obvious thing to think of is there is some sort of gas leak going on.

134
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,880
 Not like an helium gas leak where it allows you to float.

135
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,560
 Is that these girls were hallucinating.

136
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,560
 That would be the skeptical answer.

137
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,160
 These girls were going down there huffing in that sweet natural gas and being like look

138
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,040
 at me I'm flying and really they're just laid out on the ground slowly turning blue.

139
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
 It's possible right.

140
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,240
 That would be the skeptical answer.

141
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,400
 But in the world of the paranormal something like this.

142
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,680
 It's funny because in the world of the paranormal even this is not normal.

143
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,080
 The ability to fly the ability for humans to fly is not something you see outside of

144
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,360
 old witches fables.

145
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,400
 It's something man's always wanted to do.

146
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,440
 Generally though that includes flying through the sky being like a bird and looking for

147
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
 worms to eat.

148
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,920
 Not flying around a basement but I would take that.

149
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,680
 I would not I am not picky in my zero gravity situations.

150
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,840
 I 100% would take just floating around in a basement.

151
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,680
 That would be pretty dope.

152
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,440
 So even in the world of paranormal this is an outlier.

153
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,840
 What I thought was interesting was Frank said I remember the first time my mom told me this

154
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,040
 story.

155
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,240
 She's telling me that when she was a little girl she was able to fly around the basement

156
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
 with her friends.

157
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:36,840
 And Frank goes as she was telling me the story I got the most extreme feeling of deja vu.

158
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,040
 To me read you his exact words here.

159
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,640
 It was quote like I was remembering edges of a forgotten dream.

160
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,360
 I didn't necessarily feel like I had those memories or could do it myself.

161
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,440
 But just a really weird feeling.

162
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,440
 Just a really weird feeling that I knew all along my mom could levitate when she was a

163
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,680
 kid.

164
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,400
 That's a really cool detail to the story as well right.

165
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,600
 It's not just this little child's possible fault to you memory part.

166
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,800
 Partly gas exposure to natural gas that's causing them to hallucinate.

167
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,440
 We'll assume because we're a paranormal podcast that the phenomenon is real.

168
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,800
 But then we also have the fact that it was so reality bending that her own child who

169
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,580
 was not alive when any of this took place.

170
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,240
 When his mom told him about it he it's like he knew in the back of his head his mom could

171
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,320
 fly.

172
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,360
 He just knew it.

173
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:53,720
 And then when she tells him about it years later he he gets that feeling like he had already

174
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,640
 known that somehow.

175
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
 This wasn't news to him.

176
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
 Fascinating story.

177
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,400
 But again I love looking for those outliers in the world of the paranormal because we

178
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,720
 come across stuff like that.

179
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,240
 I went through the rest of his posting history, talked about normal stuff that's always nice

180
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
 to verify.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,840
 You just have these weird little outliers that the stakes are so low.

182
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,520
 It's just a day in the life of a world that although it tries to deny any sort of paranormal

183
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,560
 activity the world is flooded with it.

184
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,960
 It's everywhere.

185
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,760
 Most of the time we just don't notice it.

186
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,680
 I find it super fascinating that those girls they knew that if they had told anyone about

187
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,560
 this it would stop.

188
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,160
 You would have had "Kill, I'm gonna go down there, my name's Billy Bats and I'm a local

189
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,560
 bully I don't know why you guys told me I'm gonna pull your pigtails and then take me

190
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,000
 down there."

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,480
 And it wouldn't work.

192
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,280
 Or they tell their mom "You need to stop having your friends come over there, hang out

193
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,000
 in the basement if you think you're flying.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,720
 I don't know what you guys are doing down there."

195
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,240
 Like any sort of rational person or any sort of outsider coming in it's basically like

196
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,120
 throwing a wet blanket on top of a roaring fire.

197
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,160
 Fascinating and they knew that intrinsically.

198
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,360
 They knew that.

199
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,240
 And then the question is was the next group of people who moved into that house or the

200
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,320
 people who live in that house today is the phenomenon still there?

201
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,360
 Or people currently floating around the basement or like as you're listening to this podcast

202
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,200
 as you're floating through your basement you're like "Whoa, I know where this story takes

203
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
 place.

204
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,880
 My house."

205
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,600
 Or did you just have to have a group of girls in the right frame of mind that this could

206
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
 happen with?

207
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,120
 It's a fascinating story, I absolutely love it.

208
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,440
 I wonder if the phenomenon is still out there.

209
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,200
 And if it is, again, super rare.

210
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,920
 Even in a world of ghosts and aliens and cryptids and spells it's super rare for humans to fly.

211
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,680
 We did that episode a long time ago about the guy who could fly.

212
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,200
 That's an episode again like out of what?

213
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,680
 A thousand and twelve episodes are on at this point.

214
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
 A thousand and thirteen.

215
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
 I've already lost count again.

216
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,400
 We have that episode where that guy was flying around.

217
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,960
 That was cool and I'll put that one in the show notes.

218
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
 Really really fun one.

219
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,800
 Denby Jones, get your patch on your eye.

220
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,880
 Get your peg leg ready.

221
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,360
 And fire up that carbonar copter.

222
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,160
 Maybe take the patch off before we actually start flying around but Denby Jones I'm going

223
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,720
 to toss you the keys of the carbonar copter.

224
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,840
 You're leaving behind this little girl's basement.

225
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,520
 Take us all the way out to Connecticut.

226
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:37,520
 [imitates gunfire]

227
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,000
 Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,640
 I'm going to eat my captain's thumb.

229
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,040
 Dope and stepping on a bridge right now.

230
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,080
 It's a pirate life for me.

231
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
 You're like bridges.

232
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,760
 I don't know bridges were traditionally pirate, pirate thing.

233
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,800
 Or maybe we're headed off to a pirate's tale.

234
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,840
 Denby Jones when he supported the Patreon he asked, "Hey can I be in a pirate theme

235
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
 episode?"

236
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,080
 We are four months later he did.

237
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,880
 He joined like during the summer or something like that.

238
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
 You wanted to have a pirate themed story.

239
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,480
 It takes a while to find this stuff.

240
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,280
 This stuff does not fall in my lap.

241
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,920
 A yo ho ho and a bottle of juice.

242
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,520
 Walking on a giant moose.

243
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,320
 Do do do boof.

244
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
 Fix that sail.

245
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,480
 Pirate's life for me.

246
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,120
 We're in Connecticut.

247
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,680
 It's 1835.

248
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,680
 Specifically, we're in the town of Norwich, Connecticut.

249
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,800
 We walk into a local jail and sitting there in jail is a young man named Albert Hicks.

250
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,160
 And young is the operative word.

251
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,560
 He's only 15 years old.

252
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,520
 We see Albert Hicks sitting in jail.

253
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,800
 So we're like, "Hey Albert, I think we actually covered you last week.

254
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,080
 Weren't you the guy trying to steal that pirate's treasure?"

255
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,080
 And you got chased off by the Glauchester ghoul?

256
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,840
 We thought, you know, we were kind of hoping he could chase you around by a monster from

257
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,040
 hell, but we figured maybe that would set your life straight.

258
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,680
 We were hoping we would never see you again.

259
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,560
 No offense, dude, but you know, Paranormal True Crime Podcast is not a good thing to

260
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,960
 sell up on.

261
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,120
 Now Albert Hicks goes, "Yeah, yeah, the Glauchester ghoul.

262
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
 That sure was crazy."

263
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,080
 But it's a pirate's life for me.

264
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,800
 Like I always wanted to be a pirate.

265
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 Not me, not me.

266
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,520
 This is Albert speaking.

267
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,720
 Albert always wanted to be a pirate.

268
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,720
 He was always told these stories about pirates' gold and these treasures and these adventures

269
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,440
 they went on.

270
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,880
 His quest to find Captain, I think it was Captain Kid's treasure.

271
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,520
 That's how he came across the Glauchester ghoul.

272
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,840
 That was just like a side quest for him.

273
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,720
 He really wanted to be a pirate and he found himself realizing if he wanted to be a pirate

274
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,320
 he had kind of got to start off being a criminal.

275
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,180
 So Albert Hicks, he had been arrested for theft and he had this thing where he kept escaping

276
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,980
 from jail.

277
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,200
 Then he'd get re-caught, thrown back in jail with a heavier sentence.

278
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,080
 This would go on and on and he'd escape from there, get caught again, he'd have a longer

279
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
 sentence.

280
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,840
 So eventually he was put in solitary confinement for a year.

281
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,480
 And he said at that point he went crazy.

282
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,680
 And there's a difference between a thief criminal, there's a difference between a criminal that's

283
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:28,080
 just trying to make some money and an insane hatchet wielding pirate.

284
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,960
 Even a normal pirate, right, would be bad enough to run into.

285
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,000
 If someone goes, you know what, I'm pretty sure I'm insane.

286
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,480
 I'm not just a regular pirate, I'm an insane pirate.

287
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
 I have mental issues.

288
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,080
 That's the one you got to look out for.

289
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,040
 When he finally, finally after all of his escapes and all of his sentences getting longer, when

290
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,240
 he was finally released, he knew everything about the world of crime.

291
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,680
 He'd been raised by criminals at this point.

292
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,620
 They've all been in the jail system and criminals love to tell stories.

293
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,520
 And he feels I have all the education I need now to do what I've always wanted to do.

294
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,800
 I want to be a pirate.

295
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,240
 So he became a pirate.

296
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,040
 And he didn't relegate it to Yoho Ho and on a boat.

297
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,200
 He was actually also a highway man.

298
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:23,000
 He would just lay in the bushes and wait till some stage coach came by and rob everybody.

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,280
 And then kill him.

300
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,800
 He was a murderer who stole stuff.

301
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,920
 He wasn't a thief who killed people by his own accounts.

302
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,440
 And it could be a little bit exaggerated, but the way that this story turns out probably

303
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,600
 not by his own accounts.

304
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,680
 He says I probably murdered hundreds of people through the course of my career and he traveled

305
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,640
 the world and was murdering people.

306
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,000
 He started off on the East Coast.

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,520
 He made his way all the way West to California.

308
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,480
 Went down through Mexico killing people, stealing stuff.

309
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,160
 He ended up in the South Pacific killing and robbing all the way there with various pirate

310
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
 crews.

311
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
 And he's like, oh, it's time to get my land legs back.

312
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
 Stick them up.

313
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,080
 He's robbing people in the South Pacific.

314
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:15,800
 This guy was a world traveler and a maniac and a snappy dresser.

315
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,600
 He was knowing this was really what he would do.

316
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,160
 He would hook up with a criminal or two.

317
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,280
 He would have like a couple of accomplices.

318
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,800
 When you're on a boat, when you're a pirate, you need a bunch of people to like run the

319
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 ship.

320
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,760
 But when he's just a highway man, he'd run with maybe one or two people.

321
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,320
 And what they would do is they would find people, they would rob them, they would kill

322
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:41,560
 them, and then Albert Hicks would spend all of his money on booze, women, and fancy clothes.

323
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,700
 And once he ran out of money, he would just go rob and murder people again.

324
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
 This was his rhythm.

325
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,200
 He was not trying to build up a nest egg.

326
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,560
 He was definitely not trying to leave no buried treasure.

327
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,400
 He just wanted to live the good life.

328
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
 This goes on.

329
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,120
 He started when he was 15, when he got arrested for a theft.

330
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,440
 This goes on until he's around 40 years old.

331
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,160
 And the reason he stops isn't because the law caught up to him.

332
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,120
 It isn't because he had too close of a call.

333
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,840
 And he was like, "Whoa, I mean, that almost was it for good old Albert.

334
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
 Hanging up my hat."

335
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,680
 He was very famous for wearing, he wore this thing called a costeth, costeth cut.

336
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,840
 He wore this hat called a costeth hat.

337
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,160
 You're gonna have to look it up.

338
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
 It's on the show notes.

339
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,280
 It's a costeth hat.

340
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,440
 It's basically, it was a wide brimmed hat that you'd see like military people use when

341
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,400
 they were especially in the brush.

342
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,320
 It was basically like a wide brimmed hat and he would have it pulled down over one eye.

343
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,240
 It looked mysterious.

344
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,500
 And you go, "Oh, kind of like a fedora?

345
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,240
 Like a gangster would wear a fedora?"

346
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,360
 Yeah, put a little pin in that.

347
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,120
 We'll talk about that in a second.

348
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,560
 Or that wide brimmed hat.

349
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
 And I'm gonna hang up my hat.

350
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,600
 The reason why isn't because he got caught or he almost got caught or because he realized

351
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,080
 that what he was doing was reprehensible.

352
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,360
 No.

353
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,080
 He met a good woman.

354
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,440
 That was it.

355
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,200
 He met a good woman.

356
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,400
 They had a kid and he goes, "You know what?

357
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,760
 If I want to raise this kid right, I can't be in the South Pacific murdering people.

358
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,680
 I have to be here at home in the most peaceful place on earth, New York City.

359
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,600
 I'm gonna raise my family in New York and I'm gonna have a good kid.

360
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,680
 I'm gonna be a good husband.

361
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,000
 Raise this kid right."

362
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,600
 So I guess, see again, I don't think his morals changed.

363
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,720
 I think he just realized that you can't murder and raise a kid at the same time.

364
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,800
 He's wistfully looking out the window and he's like, "Oh, all those people, I wish I

365
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 could murder."

366
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,640
 Papa, papa, can we play stuffed animals again?

367
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 Oh yeah.

368
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,760
 I'm gonna put him here, little Albert Jr.

369
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
 Let's play.

370
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
 I'll play with you instead.

371
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,280
 But that doesn't last.

372
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,560
 That wouldn't be the end of the story.

373
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,160
 That wouldn't be the end of the story.

374
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
 That doesn't last.

375
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,840
 Eventually, he realizes, like, "I do want to raise my family.

376
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,880
 I want to be right for my son.

377
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,920
 But to do that, I'm gonna need money."

378
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
 So I'm gonna try to get an honest job.

379
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,760
 I'm trying to get an honest job on a boat.

380
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,400
 A former pirate like myself.

381
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,360
 I'm gonna try to get an honest job on a boat.

382
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:30,280
 Now, if it happens to turn out that I become a shift into pirate mode during the full moon,

383
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
 then so be it.

384
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
 But I'll try.

385
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
 I'll try my best.

386
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,680
 Now, his wife was...

387
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:41,560
 His wife may know in a little bit about his past, but she has no idea that this is about

388
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
 to happen.

389
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,920
 Her wife and her son cut Albert's wife and son are like, "Bye.

390
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
 See you later."

391
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,280
 As he's headed out the door, he's about to join the crew of the AE Johnson, which is

392
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,920
 a oyster sloop.

393
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
 Super weird.

394
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,420
 It's a boat specifically chartered.

395
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,480
 It's not like an oyster-shaped boat.

396
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
 That would be cool.

397
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,240
 It's a regular sloop.

398
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,120
 But this one hauled oysters, and it didn't even do the fun part of, like, getting the

399
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,840
 oysters out of the ocean.

400
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,800
 It was basically a transport vessel of oysters.

401
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:22,520
 So Albert shows up on this boat, and he's on the boat with three other men.

402
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,640
 You have Captain George Burr.

403
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,840
 And then the two other guys working on the boat is Oliver and Smith Watts.

404
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,080
 This is where we go.

405
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,280
 It's funny, I think, at a certain point you may be thinking, "Oh, is this a true crime

406
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,880
 story?"

407
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
 This guy's kind of...

408
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,600
 I mean, he did go face-to-face with a giant monster in the last episode, but clearly this

409
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,680
 must just be a true crime story.

410
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,280
 Jason's just going to tell us about the life and crimes and trial of Albert Hicks.

411
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,800
 Well, according to Albert, true crime wouldn't be the definition of this story.

412
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:07,040
 What he believed is that he was in service to a darker force.

413
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:13,200
 Albert honestly believed he was in the service of Satan.

414
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,160
 He worked for a Lucifer.

415
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:22,880
 And he believed that he actually owed Lucifer a debt.

416
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
 Albert joins this crew of three men and they head out on a standard oyster run.

417
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,920
 They have no idea they're dealing with someone who doesn't want a second chance, because

418
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,640
 that's not what Satan would want for Albert.

419
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,880
 Let me read you this quote Albert Hicks said about Satan.

420
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
 You know what I mean?

421
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,920
 Like it's one thing to have a bank robber, another one to be like, "Oh, no, I rob banks

422
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,440
 specifically because Satan wanted me to."

423
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,280
 Let me read you this quote.

424
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:59,600
 "He has stood by me all my life, on ship and on shore.

425
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,280
 Amid the howling storms of the ocean, where every moment the waves threaten to engulf me,

426
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,240
 he snatched me from their deadly embrace.

427
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,360
 On the battlefield, in many a hand-to-hand fight, he has seemed to stand by my side,

428
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,560
 protecting me from danger.

429
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:25,680
 And when I have been in the hands of my enemies, and escape has appeared impossible, he has

430
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,400
 until now invariably opened the way for my release."

431
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:40,040
 So he's giving the statement at a time that he knows that Satan has left him.

432
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,360
 We'll get to that in a second, but I wanted to share that part with you.

433
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,400
 He's telling his eventual captors that he was in service to the dark lord.

434
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,040
 Those are statements that you would hear someone say about God, right?

435
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,240
 I don't think necessarily it'd be like, "And then he said Jesus down, Jesus was crying

436
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,520
 each other in those guards."

437
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,960
 And that's how I escaped from that North Korean prison.

438
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
 But you know what I mean?

439
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,040
 Like I didn't let myself wallow in despair because I knew God would save me from this

440
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
 predicament.

441
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,960
 When those waves are crashing over the boat, I prayed to God and he saved me.

442
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,000
 Those are the types of statements we hear about God.

443
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,560
 And here Albert Hicks is talking about Satan.

444
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,640
 So he's on this boat, the A.E. Johnson.

445
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,440
 This is the mentality of this man.

446
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,880
 These men have no idea who they're with.

447
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,400
 The A.E. Johnson is going to Virginia to buy these oysters to bring them back to New York.

448
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,920
 And one night during this journey, Captain George Burke says, "Okay guys, I'm going to

449
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,920
 go sleep in my bed.

450
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,600
 You guys do whatever happened on boats at night."

451
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 I don't know.

452
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,720
 I sleep all the time when the night shows up.

453
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,280
 Like a normal person, you guys, I don't know, move the sails around or swab the deck or

454
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,520
 something.

455
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,920
 Oliver Watts also goes to bed.

456
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,480
 So the only people on the deck of the boat is Albert and Smith Watts.

457
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,880
 And the thing is, is because this boat is on this oyster run there, it's actually full

458
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,200
 of money.

459
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,960
 They're going to go buy these oysters in Virginia and bring them back to New York.

460
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,600
 So there's a bunch of money to buy oysters.

461
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 And Albert's like, "Wait a second, I could work on this boat."

462
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,880
 Or, "I can murder everybody and just steal the money."

463
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,280
 Because that's what I've been doing my entire life.

464
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,680
 And no one's going to catch me, right?

465
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,400
 The Dark Lord always has my back.

466
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,320
 He always has up until now.

467
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
 So why wouldn't he protect me?

468
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,480
 He says, he's standing on the deck.

469
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,240
 We have this testimony from Albert.

470
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,600
 He confesses to all this later.

471
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,960
 He goes, "I'm standing on the deck with Smith."

472
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,600
 And I go, "Hey, look at that.

473
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,040
 Look at that off in the distance.

474
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
 You see that?

475
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
 You see that out in the dark?

476
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
 Out in the dark waves?

477
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
 You see something out there?"

478
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,680
 And Smith is like, "No, I don't see anything out there."

479
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
 And Albert goes, "No, no, no.

480
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,280
 Look over there.

481
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,960
 Look far, far out into the distance.

482
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,480
 And you'll see it."

483
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,160
 Smith is staring out into the darkness.

484
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,120
 I don't see anything.

485
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
 What are you pointing at, Albert?

486
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,120
 As Smith has his back to Albert, Albert picks up a C-axe.

487
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,080
 It's like just a hatchet type of tool.

488
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,720
 But any edge tool can be used as a weapon, as Smith is looking out into the Black Sea,

489
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,640
 trying to see what Albert is pointing at.

490
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,920
 Albert brings that C-axe right down on the back of Smith's head.

491
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,160
 Just smashes his skull open.

492
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,840
 And Smith immediately collapses onto the ground.

493
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:45,720
 But it's such a loud noise on such a calm sea.

494
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,160
 The sound of the axe hitting the back of Smith's head and then the sound of Smith's body smashing

495
00:27:52,160 --> 00:28:02,840
 against the deck, it alerts Oliver, his brother, who's down in the sleeping area of the boat.

496
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,720
 Oliver comes up the stairs.

497
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,280
 The way the boat is laid out is, you know, they have like a little staircase that goes

498
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,920
 into the inner part of the boat.

499
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,440
 They have like a little cabin, like a little door you can stick your head out of.

500
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,880
 A little door that you walk up and you, as you're walking, you know, your head can stick

501
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,400
 out of it and you can peek to see what that noise was.

502
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:34,680
 And Albert's standing there with that C-axe and he hears Oliver walk up the stairs and

503
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,920
 Oliver sticks his head out of the door to see what that noise was.

504
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,680
 And as Oliver is craning his neck out to see what all the fuss was about, to see what

505
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:55,040
 the loud thumping was on the deck, Albert brings that hatchet down so fast and so strong

506
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:03,160
 in one swipe completely decapitates Oliver.

507
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,640
 His head was perfectly positioned out that Albert could line up his blow and brought

508
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,680
 it down right on his neck.

509
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:18,800
 Albert said, "I watched Oliver's head fall off of its body and this area of the ship

510
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,880
 is already covered in blood from where he smashed open Smith's skull."

511
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,640
 He goes, "I cut off Oliver's head and I watched Oliver's head roll on the deck of the ship

512
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,640
 that's already splattered with his brother's blood."

513
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:44,440
 He said that Oliver's body seemed to stumble for a moment and then just slump out of the

514
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,960
 door.

515
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,320
 I'm watching Oliver's head kind of roll around on the deck.

516
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,960
 Smith's still bleeding over here from this horrible head wound I gave him.

517
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,720
 And now it's time for me to take care of the captain.

518
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,960
 I'm almost home free.

519
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,920
 Albert comes downstairs wielding the sea axe.

520
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,360
 He enters the captain's quarters, but the captain now is standing up and he's ready

521
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,600
 to fight.

522
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,760
 He sees Albert come in with this hatchet and a fight breaks out.

523
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,920
 Albert said the room was very, very cramped, especially to have two people in it.

524
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,760
 Almost fighting for their lives, Albert knew that if he lost this fight he was doomed.

525
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:34,440
 He said the captain was much bigger than I was, much stronger than I was.

526
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,800
 And at one point he got the best of me.

527
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,400
 He wrapped those big, meaty hands right around my throat and began to strangle the life out

528
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,240
 of me.

529
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,200
 I was losing this fight.

530
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,640
 100% this was the end.

531
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,440
 But before he took my life, I knew I had one more chance.

532
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
 Some could say the devil.

533
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,520
 The devil was by my side once again.

534
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,160
 I beat a physically stronger opponent.

535
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,200
 I took that sea axe and I swung it.

536
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:17,360
 I got past his defenses and I watched that axe cleave off half of his face.

537
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:26,200
 Captain Burr stumbled back, a hand pressed against a massive open wound in his head.

538
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,840
 Albert said I looked at the hatchet and there hanging off of it was one of Captain Burr's

539
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
 eyeballs.

540
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:41,720
 I had completely just removed half of his face.

541
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,800
 I finished him off.

542
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,360
 Now I was the only living member of this crew.

543
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,200
 It's time to really go to work.

544
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,680
 I started searching the boat.

545
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,040
 I found the cache.

546
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,480
 His plan now is to scuttle the ship.

547
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,680
 He's going to sink it.

548
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:03,040
 Because I'm just going to drill holes in it and let the water take it to the bottom.

549
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,240
 I'll get in a little dingy and I'll just row back to shore and make my way back to New

550
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
 York.

551
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,280
 I mean like easy peasy, right?

552
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:17,800
 He walks back up to the deck of the ship and Smith is standing up.

553
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
 Not straight.

554
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,640
 He doesn't have perfect poise but he's stumbling around the boat.

555
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,760
 He's not dead.

556
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,680
 That wound as ugly as it looked didn't kill him.

557
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,880
 And Smith is stumbling around the boat and Hicks is like I got to finish this dude off.

558
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,800
 Like I can't have any witnesses.

559
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,780
 Plus I do love murdering in service of the Lord Satan.

560
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,760
 He walks up to Smith and he goes I'm just going to let the elements take care of you.

561
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:51,120
 Now if you want to survive underwater he takes Smith throws him overboard and then starts

562
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,000
 walking back to throw the remains of Oliver and eventually Captain Burr overboard as well.

563
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,120
 But then he sees that Smith is holding on to the edge of the boat.

564
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,640
 His fingers are gripping that wood and he's hanging off the side of the boat.

565
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:13,100
 Then Albert walks over there with that sea axe and chops off Smith's fingers.

566
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:20,780
 Smith then plummets into the dark waters below and drowns.

567
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:26,340
 Albert takes Oliver's head, throws it overboard, throws the rest of Oliver overboard, goes

568
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:32,540
 down, lugs Captain Burr's body up the steps to the edge of the boat, throws that overboard.

569
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,840
 Then begins drilling holes in the boat so the boat will sink.

570
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,280
 There will be no evidence of any of this stuff right.

571
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,760
 They'll just think boat sank, four people died.

572
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,080
 If they even knew that people weren't keeping W2s for who was working on boats.

573
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,760
 Is anyone going to know that Albert Hicks was on board?

574
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,760
 Well he's like I'll just take this little dingy I'm out of here.

575
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,960
 He takes the money, he gets in his little boat, and he goes away.

576
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:13,580
 All of this for what is the modern equivalent of $8,700.

577
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,860
 And classic Albert, classic Albert, he then parties his way.

578
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,620
 He lands back on land.

579
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,940
 He takes the little boat and he comes back there, but he's a far away from New York.

580
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,120
 He goes I'm just going to party my way back up to my family in New York.

581
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,680
 I'm going to hit up all these bars and all these whorehouses.

582
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,780
 I'm going to buy some new snazzy clothes.

583
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,120
 Let's live it up Albert style even though I did this to make money for my family.

584
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,480
 I got to spend a little bit on myself.

585
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,960
 I got to have a good time.

586
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:55,320
 Couple days after all of this happens, the AE Johnson, this sloop is still floating around.

587
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,020
 It wasn't successfully scuttled.

588
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,180
 Another boat's in the area and notice this boat that's adrift so they go to check it

589
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,620
 out and they eventually get the authorities involved because all anyone can tell on this

590
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,460
 boat is there's a bunch of holes drilled in it.

591
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:21,980
 It appears somebody took all the money and where do these fingers come from?

592
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,960
 Are there just fingers on this boat?

593
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,820
 I don't know if the rain or the element kind of washed away or got rid of most of the blood,

594
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:36,320
 but the police just found fingers on a boat that had a bunch of holes drilled into it

595
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,160
 and they realized that it had been robbed so they go a pirate must have gotten this.

596
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,600
 Let's find them.

597
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,320
 They have no idea who it could be though, but they do go to shore and they start asking

598
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,540
 around like hey did anything suspicious happen in this area?

599
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,120
 Eventually the kid goes well that's funny, he asked that governor.

600
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:03,680
 One day I was standing out on the beach and with me peepers I saw a little boat pull up

601
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,320
 and a guy get out and he seemed to have like a bundle with him.

602
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,780
 Maybe like money, maybe like he stole something so the cops are like okay that's the best

603
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,940
 lead we have.

604
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,380
 And as they keep asking people in the area they're like you know what it's super weird.

605
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,920
 Some guy that I had never seen before came to my pub and spent a bunch of money and was

606
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,040
 like entertaining all the girls and buying all these drinks.

607
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,080
 He's a real fancy dresser, not the normal type that comes in here and it was just this

608
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
 fantastic night.

609
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,720
 He closed the place down and cops are like okay that's interesting.

610
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,000
 And they follow a trail of parties.

611
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,680
 They basically are able to start to track down Albert because he partied so hard in

612
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,760
 all these different towns leading up to New York.

613
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,060
 He became a legend and the legend was this guy could just throw a huge rager.

614
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,820
 He would show up in town, fancy a dresser, drop a bunch of money and then leave.

615
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,900
 And the cops are now on the trail of this guy.

616
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,940
 At this point they don't know that this is Albert Hicks, the super notorious pirate who

617
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,380
 had been in operation for 25 years.

618
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,420
 He was just a guy who murdered three people because at this point you know they figured

619
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,180
 out the other people who were on the boat.

620
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,740
 Eventually they do catch up with Albert.

621
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,800
 The authorities come and arrest Albert and he was with his wife and his kid.

622
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,480
 They had no idea what had happened.

623
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:26,840
 They caught Albert and this is when he became the notorious pirate Albert Hicks.

624
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,400
 All of his stories were laid out for the public.

625
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,840
 And this is when he talks about he's murdered hundreds of people.

626
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,920
 He's been on the high seas.

627
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,040
 He's traveled the world.

628
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:42,480
 And not only that he also knew personally on a first name basis good old Lucifer.

629
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,180
 He wasn't just a pirate for money.

630
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,700
 He liked to murder people.

631
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,740
 It was a huge trial, super sensational at the time.

632
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,860
 But everyone knew he was guilty.

633
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:01,540
 The trial was basically just a show for him to be able to get up and talk about his career.

634
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,940
 Doing all these interviews with journalists.

635
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,940
 P.T.

636
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,940
 Barnum came out and said, "I want to take you on tour with my circus but obviously you're

637
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,060
 not going to get out of here."

638
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,800
 That's why he said Lucifer up until now has always provided me a way out.

639
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,000
 Because now he knows that he's doomed.

640
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,400
 There's no way he's walking away from this.

641
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:27,160
 P.T. Barnum says, "Can I get a wax mold of your face now because they're not going to

642
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,440
 let me do this after you die.

643
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,280
 Your property of the state.

644
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,320
 Let me get a wax mold of your face and I'm going to put you on tour.

645
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,080
 People are going to come out to see the notorious Albert Hicks."

646
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,240
 And Albert Hicks goes, "Yeah, sure.

647
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,580
 I will let you take this mask of me on one condition.

648
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,780
 You need to buy me a nice suit that I can wear on the day of my hanging."

649
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
 P.T.

650
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
 Barnum's like, "I'll do it."

651
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,060
 Yeah, yeah, that sounds like a good deal.

652
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,300
 Albert gave him the specifications of the type of suit he wanted and yeah, sure enough

653
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,780
 he was found guilty.

654
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,060
 It took the jury six minutes to deliberate.

655
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,460
 They didn't even leave the room.

656
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,220
 They're like, "Yeah, he's totally guilty."

657
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,300
 July 13th, 1860.

658
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,520
 Friday the 13th.

659
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,280
 And there's a lot of people who say, a lot of historians who say the execution of Albert

660
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:21,040
 Hicks is one of the main causes of why Friday the 13th is considered cursed.

661
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,400
 Like not everyone agrees, but there's a lot of historians who say we don't see a lot of

662
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,680
 talk about Friday the 13th being a bad day before Albert Hicks' execution, but we see

663
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
 a ton of it afterwards.

664
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,080
 So this may have been the main reason why we still associate that day with death and

665
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,580
 bad luck.

666
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,380
 The death of Albert Hicks, his public hanging, he was the last person to be publicly hanged

667
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,380
 in New York.

668
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
 It was such an event.

669
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,540
 New York Harbor was full of boats.

670
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,700
 People couldn't, there wasn't enough seats obviously to sit there to watch him hanging,

671
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:59,460
 so people showed up in their boats, their sloops probably, with binoculars, telescopes, 10,000

672
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,460
 people watched the hanging just by boat.

673
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,560
 It's not including everyone else who could somehow get a view.

674
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,400
 There was 10,000 people in the harbor to watch Albert Hicks get hanged, and he walks up to

675
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:22,480
 the gallows wearing an electric blue suit and a large wide brimmed hat pulled down

676
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,560
 over one eye.

677
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,080
 Quite, quite the scene, right?

678
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,240
 You're there to watch this notorious murderer get executed, and he's getting executed, but

679
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,820
 it's on his terms, right?

680
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,540
 He's wearing this fancy suit.

681
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,480
 He walks up, they put, they noose around his neck, and his final words were, "Hang me

682
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,160
 quick, make haste."

683
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:57,700
 His wax dummy, that was part of the PT Barnum show, was viewed by millions of people.

684
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:03,340
 People came out to see, because it was a real life cast of his face.

685
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:09,960
 That was as close as most people would ever get to this type of villain.

686
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,080
 He was, I guess I probably should have described him a little bit more early on, but he was

687
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,240
 a very good looking guy.

688
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,320
 He was a very handsome, broad-shouldered man who dressed well.

689
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,560
 Even when he was committing this despicable act, he was dressed incredibly well.

690
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,280
 He had the fedora-esque hat.

691
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
 He would wear suits.

692
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,520
 He would wear these nice clothes.

693
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
 He would wear these suits.

694
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,380
 He had his wide-brimmed hat, kind of like a fedora type hat.

695
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,620
 Because so many people saw his fashion choices at the execution, and now millions more are

696
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:45,460
 seeing this wax dummy, this very good looking man dressed up really nice.

697
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,620
 Because of his fashion choices, there's a lot of belief that this is the reason why

698
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,740
 the 1930s gangsters dressed the way they did.

699
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,940
 It was based on Albert Hicks.

700
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,480
 Because the way he dressed, the snazzy way he dressed with the big hat and the nice clothes

701
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
 and the long coat.

702
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,320
 He would wear a coat with long tails.

703
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,920
 People said that this went from being a real person to start appearing in fiction about

704
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,400
 bad guys, and they would always be dressed really nice with these long coats and these

705
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
 white hats.

706
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,560
 And then you would have the criminals emulate what they saw in fiction.

707
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,520
 And now that is the Chicago-era gangster.

708
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,640
 They were basing it on Albert Hicks.

709
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,980
 Fascinating story.

710
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,060
 It's interesting we can look at that.

711
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,060
 You go, "Maybe they were wearing trench coats because they could easily hide a large gun

712
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,700
 under the coat."

713
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,300
 That's why a gangster wears a trench coat.

714
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,460
 Sure, yeah, that makes sense.

715
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:47,140
 But when we look at it as a total picture, it does look like the style that we see in

716
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:52,100
 gangsters, you know, a hundred years after Albert Hicks, a lot of it was inspired by

717
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:57,320
 the snazzy dressing of this mad man murdering pirate.

718
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,960
 That is the story of Albert Hicks, a man, a murderous man.

719
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,520
 And really, that's all he ever wanted to be, a young boy who wanted to sail the high seas,

720
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:15,040
 not for adventure, not for fame, but for violence.

721
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,680
 He wanted to be a mad man.

722
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,520
 He wanted to get his money and then blow it as quickly as he could so he'd have an excuse

723
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,760
 to go out and get more.

724
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,100
 He truly was a psychopath.

725
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:35,300
 And if the ruler of hell is looking for anyone, anyone to stand by his side, he definitely

726
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:46,620
 wants to find lunatics like the notorious pirate Albert Hicks.

727
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,060
