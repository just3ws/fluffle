1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 A man is simply hoping to be castrated.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:12,160
 That's all he wanted, but instead he ended up in a house of horrors.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,560
 Then we take a look at a band-sheen ritual that will keep you busy all afternoon.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,580
 And finally we travel to New York City.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,840
 As we follow a trail of mysterious yellow notes strewn about this city, is it possible

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,840
 that one man has all the clues to prove the ultimate conspiracy today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,600
 [Music]

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,100
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,920
 I'm your host Jason Carver and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,640
 I gotta say this man, I'm really behind on sending out my Patreon stickers.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,440
 I'm gonna be doing that this, I'm gonna be doing tomorrow.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,040
 100% I got a ton of Patreon stickers I gotta send out.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,880
 I really apologize for being behind on that.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,120
 But what I'm not behind on is welcoming our newest Patreon.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,280
 He's like, "Dude, you just told me you don't send stuff out."

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,000
 Adam Carter, we shish him and then we clap for Adam Carter.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,520
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,880
 Adam, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,320
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,600
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 I said on yesterday's episode I feel bad about the Patreon support for this episode.

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,640
 So here we go, let's get the ball rolling here.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,720
 Adam, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,360
 We are going to fly out to Patu, Oklahoma.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,640
 And as we're flying out there around the same time, so the story starts in October of 2020.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,600
 Very, very recent story.

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,120
 There's a man who is unnamed, we'll call him Travis, just a guess.

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,840
 Travis is sitting at his home in Virginia and he's sitting there and he goes, "You know

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
 what?

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,200
 I'm having a lot of fun.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
 I enjoy windsurfing.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,560
 I don't know, I'm making that up.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,880
 I enjoy training card games.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
 I love Magic Gathering.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
 But you know what?

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,960
 I'm not a huge fan of, or my balls.

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
 My tights.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,400
 I'm not talking about basketballs in the corner.

40
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,640
 He's like, "I really should start selling off my ball collection."

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
 He wanted to get his testicles removed.

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,400
 Now, listen, you want to get your, a lot of people don't have testicles.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,680
 First off, a ton of people don't have testicles, but a lot of guys don't have testicles.

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,520
 They got blown up and shot or punched a bunch or they just decided, "I don't want testicles

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
 anymore."

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
 That's fine.

47
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
 I mean, hopefully you don't get blown up.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
 You're like, "Oh, Jason said this was good.

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
 I'm going to sit on this pump."

50
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
 But you know what I mean?

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,840
 If you don't want testicles, that's fine.

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
 I'm not to judge you.

53
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,080
 However, you have to say this, if you want them removed, don't go online and search for

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:53,440
 the Unicmaker and the EM crew, which sounds like the worst rap group ever.

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,360
 The Unicmaker has this website where you can share stories about getting your testicles

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 removed.

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
 I don't know what the story is.

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,680
 It basically just be Adam removed.

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
 I talked about this on another episode.

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,840
 I feel so bad for Adam.

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
 Sorry, Adam.

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,520
 I'm getting in the car and he's like, "This isn't happening.

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
 This isn't happening."

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,560
 I talked because it's going to get way grosser from here.

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,920
 We haven't even scraped the icing off this thing.

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,480
 I did an episode a long time ago about people being castrated.

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,200
 And I thought that's such a weird fetish to have because you can only do it one time,

68
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
 right?

69
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
 Right?

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
 They don't grow back, I'm assuming?

71
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,480
 That's what's weird about it.

72
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,640
 I guess you would imagine it.

73
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,240
 You would fantasize about it up to the point of them being removed.

74
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,720
 And then after that, you just look and you go, "All right."

75
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,680
 Because this isn't a sex change operation.

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,960
 It's not gender reassignment and nothing like that.

77
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,680
 You're still a dude, but you just don't have any balls.

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,040
 And so, again, whatever.

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,040
 But you go to a licensed doctor, find someone who will take care of it.

80
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,720
 But don't go to the Unic Makers website.

81
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,120
 Travis finds the Unic Makers website and gets ahold of these two guys in Oklahoma.

82
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,680
 So we've been waiting here this whole time in Potu, Oklahoma.

83
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,760
 It's October 12th, 2020.

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,360
 And Travis is driven out to this location in the middle of nowhere.

85
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,560
 This is the home of Bob Lee Allen.

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,120
 He's 53 years old.

87
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,680
 And his husband, Thomas Evan Gates, who's 42 years old.

88
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,640
 Travis goes out here and they said, "Listen, we will castrate you for free, but we want

89
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
 to videotape it."

90
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,880
 That should be your first sign something is wrong that they're going to videotape it.

91
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,320
 But technically, the first sign should be that they drove you out to the middle of nowhere.

92
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,480
 I don't think he was like, "What?

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,080
 I expected a five-star medical suite."

94
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,840
 I'm sure he knew what he was getting into.

95
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,960
 But anyways, he's in this cabin in the middle of nowhere.

96
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,440
 They go, "We'll do it for free.

97
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
 We want to videotape you."

98
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
 And he's like, "Oh, yes, that's fine, I guess."

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,400
 And then the procedure starts.

100
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,640
 So, four Adam, four Adam.

101
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,200
 What they do is they do remove his testicles.

102
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,360
 That part of it is successful.

103
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,000
 But he's not put under for it.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,920
 He's given a local anesthetic, so it doesn't feel anything down there.

105
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,760
 But he's wide awake during this.

106
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
 Maybe that's part of the fetish.

107
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
 I don't know.

108
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,680
 I'm not going to research it.

109
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,040
 But anyways, they snip his balls.

110
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
 They're done.

111
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,600
 Now, he is like strapped down to this table.

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,720
 So, because even though you're like a willing participant, I think you would probably, you

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
 know, like start moving.

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,800
 I would assume you would start moving, even if you're a willing participant.

115
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,160
 So he's strapped down.

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
 I'm assuming.

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,360
 It doesn't say so, actually, in any of the articles.

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,240
 But I'm assuming for the events that transpire.

119
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,440
 He's laying there and they're putting gauze down there.

120
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,000
 And Bob says, "Oh, you know, videotape, and it's just part of the plan.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 It's just part of what we're doing."

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And he's like, "What?

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,080
 How can this get even any weirder?"

124
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,920
 That's when Bob tells Travis that him and Thomas like to eat the testicles of the men

125
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
 that he's castrated.

126
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,400
 He goes, "You're not the first, son.

127
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,760
 I've been doing this a long time.

128
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,520
 I actually got six more customers on the way."

129
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
 Mm-mm-mm.

130
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,920
 He said, I don't know if he actually said that.

131
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
 That wasn't in the article.

132
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,760
 They're like, he quote, went, "Mmm-mm-mm," and rubbed his tummy.

133
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,520
 But anyway, so he takes this guy's bowls, which again is a terrible dietary.

134
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
 What do we know?

135
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,520
 I mean, don't eat it for the nutrients.

136
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,280
 I mean, obviously, it's some gross sex thing.

137
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,520
 But think about it.

138
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,680
 Like when you kill a bear, you get a bunch of bear meat.

139
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
 When you kill a cow, you get a bunch of cow meat.

140
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,440
 But if you only eat testicles, I don't think that's the only thing he eats.

141
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,080
 I don't think he's like, "Oh, man, I'm starving.

142
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
 I better get some weirdos down here."

143
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,720
 The point is, is that he says I'm gonna eat your bowls.

144
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,240
 After the fact, by the way, he did not sit on the website.

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
 None of that was in the advertising.

146
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,120
 He's like, "No, I wanted to take those out."

147
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,240
 And then he said, this is why I think the guy strapped down, because at this point,

148
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,720
 the guy is totally like putting the bowls in a bag, throwing them in the freezer.

149
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,600
 And he goes, "I'm gonna tell you a story too here, because I don't want you getting too

150
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
 crazy."

151
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,280
 You know, this is why I run a professional operation here, Travis.

152
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,860
 He goes, "Once I had a guy that I did this procedure on and he got crazy, so I just left

153
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,800
 him on this table and let him bleed out.

154
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,040
 He's dead now."

155
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,060
 So Travis is like, "Okay, this is definitely taking a turn for the worse."

156
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,120
 So I think, again, if he wasn't strapped down, he'd be like, "Good day to you, sir, and just

157
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
 leave.

158
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,500
 Grab a bunch of gauze on the way out."

159
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,720
 But he doesn't leave.

160
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,360
 He's actually there all night long.

161
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,320
 And when he wakes up the next morning, he's heavily bleeding from his groin.

162
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,960
 So he's begging Bob and Thomas to take him to the hospital.

163
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,800
 Bob is adamant, "I'm not taking you to the hospital.

164
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
 You're just gonna stop bleeding.

165
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,960
 It's only been 12 hours."

166
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,000
 Even another 12, see how you're doing.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,440
 Finally after a lot of pleading, Bob relents, throws Travis in the van, and begins driving

168
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 to the hospital.

169
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,600
 But Bob turns around while he's driving.

170
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
 That's not safe.

171
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,880
 Everything else he did up to this was, "A, okay, but this part's not safe."

172
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,320
 He's driving on the road and he turns around.

173
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,480
 He's not looking where he's driving.

174
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,560
 And he says, "If you fall asleep or pass out while we're driving to the hospital, I'm

175
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,760
 just gonna carry you in the woods and dump your body.

176
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,560
 So stay awake."

177
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
 That would keep you awake, right?

178
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
 You're like, "Okay, I don't need any caffeine.

179
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 I'm fine."

180
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,320
 Finally, he said, "When you get to the hospital, tell them you did this yourself."

181
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
 Tell them you did this yourself.

182
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,760
 And he's like, "Okay, that's gonna be kind of hard because this is very difficult.

183
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,240
 I came to you because I couldn't do it myself."

184
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,160
 But anyways, he dropped him off the hospital.

185
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,320
 He goes in, the doctors start taking care of him.

186
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,880
 Travis is still a lie.

187
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,680
 But while Travis was in the hospital, guess who visits him?

188
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
 Bob and Thomas.

189
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,240
 They walk into the hospital.

190
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,360
 They go up and they visit Travis.

191
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,680
 And I don't know if they talked to him about it in the hospital room or talked about it

192
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,960
 to him before.

193
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,440
 The articles made it sound like they talked about it in the hospital itself.

194
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,640
 So I'm gonna go with that narrative.

195
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,400
 Plus that makes this even more insane.

196
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,640
 They go to the hospital, they visit poor Travis and they say, "Hey, how you doing, man?

197
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,920
 I was really worried about you.

198
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,760
 I threatened to let you die multiple times."

199
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,360
 Then Bob goes, "Tell you what, even such a good sport, you haven't ratted us out to

200
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
 the police.

201
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
 You know, I told you I was gonna eat your testicles.

202
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
 You know how I said that when you saw Tom in Super Low?

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,480
 There's a nurse in the room folding blankets.

204
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 She's like, "What'd you say?

205
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
 Remember how I said I was gonna do that?

206
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
 Tell you what, man.

207
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
 Tell you what, man.

208
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
 Tell you what.

209
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
 You got two testicles.

210
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,360
 I'll let you eat one of your own testicles."

211
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
 How's that?

212
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,080
 How do you feel about all the events that have transpired?

213
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,840
 I'm willing to split testicles with you.

214
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,840
 So Bob and Thomas were shortly arrested after the hospital visit.

215
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,640
 And what it seems like is either he didn't know who they were when they visited the hospitals.

216
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,720
 I don't know if security tackled him on the way.

217
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,920
 They tackle him with your balls or roll on the floor.

218
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,840
 They go to tackle him, the Bob's throwing balls on the ground.

219
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,400
 The security guard's just livin' on him.

220
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
 Whoa, whoa.

221
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
 Throwin' him.

222
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
 He has a slingshot.

223
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,800
 He's like, "Take that, copper!"

224
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,520
 Right in their face like an egg's breaking open.

225
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
 Anyways.

226
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,000
 How do you take down a man whose weapon is unlimited testicles?

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,400
 When the cops did go to his house, they did find balls in his freezer.

228
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
 They also found other unnamed body parts.

229
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,280
 The police have not announced what else they found in the freezer.

230
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,960
 So it may be a murder investigation right now.

231
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,440
 See, this story is kinda stopped.

232
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,640
 It's kinda frozen, no pun intended, in motion.

233
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
 It's not really a pun.

234
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,480
 I just started to write a freezer earlier.

235
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,680
 We don't know really much else about this story.

236
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,400
 So we'll keep you updated if you guys wanna know.

237
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,520
 We're gonna have a Testicle Tuesdays where every Tuesday I'll update you to the story

238
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,960
 like I'll just stop listening on Tuesday.

239
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 Sounds like a deal, Jason.

240
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,720
 Adam, let's go ahead and hop in that Jason Jalopy.

241
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,600
 We are leaving behind Poe-2, Oklahoma.

242
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
 We are headed out to your bedroom.

243
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 Adam's like, "What in the heck?

244
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
 My bedroom's super messy.

245
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
 I didn't plan for this."

246
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,040
 We're all sitting in Adam's bedroom.

247
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
 It could be anyone's bedroom.

248
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
 It could even be your bedroom.

249
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,280
 It doesn't matter where we feel most comfortable when you're there.

250
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,400
 Yesterday I needed a story about monsters in the closet.

251
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,360
 Now there was some stuff I had to cut for time, but I did want to include this because

252
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,280
 I probably should have included it yesterday because it's a banishing ritual.

253
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,720
 It's to keep monsters from getting you in your house.

254
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
 You're like, "Yes, Jason.

255
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
 You should have included it."

256
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,520
 Yesterday I've been attacked several times by demons sent.

257
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
 So here we go.

258
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,120
 We're sitting in your bedroom.

259
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,440
 When I was looking at that website, Magic for the Real World, it has a comment section,

260
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,540
 which I love comment sections for this type of stuff because you can have borderline weirdness

261
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,760
 in the article, and then the weirdest dudes in the universe show up there manifested into

262
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,720
 the comments of these places.

263
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,960
 So here we have on this article that I talked about yesterday, Magic for the Real World.

264
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,280
 We talked about transitional spaces.

265
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,800
 We have someone appear out of the transitional space.

266
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,200
 It's the commenter known as Shadow Speaker.

267
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,520
 So they're just set at the level of edge that we're going to be looking at in this comment.

268
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,900
 Shadow Speaker's sitting there and he shuts off his panic at the disco album and he turns

269
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,140
 to us and he goes, "You know what, guys?

270
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,620
 I love transitional spaces.

271
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,500
 When I was a kid growing up, I always loved walking in and out of rooms.

272
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,420
 People didn't want me in the same room with them, so I got really used to it.

273
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,620
 I see you guys are scared of these places.

274
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,820
 I love them, man.

275
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,940
 I used to love being under my bed."

276
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,060
 We're kind of looking at each other and we're like, "What are you talking about?"

277
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,060
 He's like, "Come on, man.

278
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,980
 It's not spooky down there."

279
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,720
 He then goes on to explain that he is not just Shadow Speaker.

280
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,400
 And Shadow Speaker isn't just the name.

281
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
 Oh, no, no, no.

282
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,240
 He's more than us mere Homo sapiens.

283
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,480
 The God of Darkness is inhabiting his body.

284
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,120
 You better take him seriously.

285
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,080
 You don't get a name like Shadow Speaker just because it sounds cool, right?

286
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,800
 He earned that name when the God of Darkness crept into his body.

287
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,560
 He's crawling through the darkness.

288
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,260
 He's crawling through the skin of Lincoln Park, playing really loud in his ears.

289
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,700
 It finally, the God of Darkness, says, "Oh, they don't like you.

290
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,340
 They make you walk from room to room.

291
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
 Your feet are sore."

292
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,860
 But I like you.

293
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,260
 Yes, I do.

294
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,300
 I'm the God of Darkness.

295
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,340
 Yes, Shadow Speaker.

296
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:58,420
 So apparently this guy, this guy who's commenting on a website, commenting on a WordPress website

297
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,380
 is actually part deity.

298
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
 That's pretty good.

299
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,460
 You think you'd have better things to do with this time, you know, like take over all

300
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,460
 the reality.

301
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,280
 But he also says, "I have the God of Darkness in me totally unironically."

302
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,720
 He just goes on with his sentence.

303
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,840
 He makes that claim.

304
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,720
 But he's here to share with us a banishing ritual.

305
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
 I bet you guys didn't know that.

306
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,160
 The God of Darkness wants to help us banish darkness.

307
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,480
 It's a wacky world out there.

308
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,760
 2020 has been a mess.

309
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
 Here you go.

310
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
 Take a pen and paper.

311
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
 Get ready to write this stuff down.

312
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
 Unless you're driving in the car.

313
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,200
 Then just play this back when you get home.

314
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
 Here's a foolproof way to protect your room.

315
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,160
 First off, you draw an algaise.

316
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,560
 So I looked that up.

317
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,000
 That's the Y, the letter Y with a head with a little line.

318
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,780
 Look, this is how people just start drawing this.

319
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,980
 It's a demon show up.

320
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,980
 You get an ancient sigil.

321
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,420
 It's a letter Y with like a line at the top.

322
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,660
 So it looks like a man sticking his hands up.

323
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,940
 You have to draw one on each wall.

324
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,260
 That seems easy enough.

325
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,980
 Then you have to draw three on each door.

326
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,820
 You have to draw one on each window.

327
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,060
 One on each mirror frame.

328
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,060
 Mirror frame?

329
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
 One of the two.

330
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,060
 Have you pronounced it?

331
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,220
 You have to draw one on the vents.

332
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,220
 So this is why you're like, "Man, I hope I didn't show up.

333
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,220
 My arms are getting tired."

334
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,340
 At least they can take me away from this muscle strain I have.

335
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,260
 You also, that's not, you're not done yet.

336
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,100
 Don't put down that chalk yet.

337
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,300
 You're not done yet.

338
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,340
 You also have to put it on any gateway in the room.

339
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,400
 Now my question is you have to do it on any gateway.

340
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,740
 So that would be, I don't know, a mouse hole.

341
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,640
 You might want to call an exterminator about that, but like a little mouse hole.

342
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
 You do it on there.

343
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
 The drain in your bathroom?

344
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,540
 Cause that's the spookiest place.

345
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,260
 Ghosts can come in and out of my bedroom all day long.

346
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,180
 I don't want them in my bathroom.

347
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,900
 You'd have to draw one on the, like all your pipes and stuff like that.

348
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,540
 And then aren't you a gateway?

349
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,340
 Like your mouth is a transitional space.

350
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,860
 I guess I'm being facetious now.

351
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,900
 I'm like, "Your butthole is a transitional space, Shadow Speaker."

352
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,420
 But I think like anything could really be considered gateway.

353
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,980
 But so the thing is, is that this is so, oh, you also got to start a fire.

354
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
 You got to get a light.

355
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
 You can't just go to that.

356
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,960
 You have to get a little bowl, a fireproof bowl, if those exist, and put it on your floor

357
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,720
 and then burn a row and wood shavings.

358
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,200
 And then as you're sitting there, you pretend you imagine all of this.

359
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,240
 There's not a big difference between the two words in this context.

360
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,320
 You make all the light fill your room up and you move your arms and you're like imagining

361
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,800
 this light going all over your room, this healing light.

362
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
 So you got to do that too.

363
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,200
 Don't burn your house down while you're doing any of this.

364
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,420
 Or get affected for drawing a bunch of symbols everywhere.

365
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,780
 It's actually kind of interesting because it's fairly complex.

366
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,900
 And if it doesn't work, the onus is on the magic worker.

367
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,060
 This is one of those spells like you could write back to Shadow Speaker, who again, the

368
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,740
 deity of the eternal ebony knight, who also has an AOL account.

369
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,300
 You can message him and be like, "Hey, I tried your thing and it didn't work."

370
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,620
 And they'll be like, "Was there a crack in your room?

371
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,620
 Is there an ant?

372
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,220
 Is there a single ant moving around?"

373
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,400
 That means there is another gateway.

374
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,680
 So basically if it doesn't work, then you didn't do it right.

375
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,960
 It's fairly complex to have to cover all entrances and exits.

376
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:13,160
 But he does say, this man who's an expert of leaving rooms does say, "In this way, nothing

377
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,000
 can enter or leave without your permission."

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,560
 You wouldn't want to create a spell to trap something in there with you.

379
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
 So I don't know.

380
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,160
 Shadow Speaker, you're out there now.

381
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
 I'm sure you are.

382
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,580
 I'm sure you have a fulfilling job, a career, a family, and you've left the God of Darkness

383
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,580
 behind.

384
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,900
 But if you haven't, the God of Darkness is still inside of you.

385
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
 Let it out.

386
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,100
 Let it out, we know that the God of Darkness is just hanging out in your placement days

387
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,700
 like, "Oh, this place looks kind of chill."

388
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,500
 "No, oh, oh, he's trapped in the room and then underneath the blankets, Shadow Speaker

389
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 arrives."

390
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,980
 He goes, "I've been waiting for you, God of Darkness.

391
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,100
 You belong to me now.

392
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,680
 God of Darkness had never felt fear like that before as this young man devours him."

393
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,480
 And now he's trapped in the body of this man.

394
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,200
 The tides have turned.

395
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,240
 Oh, Lord of Darkness.

396
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,960
 But you probably deserved it with me.

397
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,440
 You're probably super evil.

398
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,520
 Adam, go ahead and call in that carboner copter.

399
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,640
 We are leaving behind your bedroom.

400
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,440
 Shadow Speaker's just hanging out there.

401
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,600
 I'll be waiting for you when this episode's over.

402
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,240
 You're like, "Please don't let this episode ever."

403
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,600
 And Adam, go ahead and call in that carboner copter.

404
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:29,040
 We are leaving behind your house and we are headed out to New York City.

405
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,600
 So Adam lands us in the middle of Central Park.

406
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,760
 Bunch of birds are getting scared.

407
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
 We jump out of the carboner copter.

408
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
 We get mugged.

409
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
 We fight the muggers.

410
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
 We win.

411
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,640
 And we're continuing to walk through Central Park.

412
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,120
 We're fighting muggers the whole way.

413
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,100
 We're ranking up our experience levels.

414
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,380
 We finally get out of the park.

415
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,800
 We lost a couple of you guys.

416
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,780
 But the journey brought the rest of us closer together.

417
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,320
 Outside of Central Park, because this guy's too smart to be hanging out in there, we meet

418
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,600
 Lars Dutzstein.

419
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,720
 He's simply holding a little yellow note in his hand.

420
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,760
 And he goes, "With his-- with his eyebrows cocked, took you long enough."

421
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,360
 Lars sent me this story the other day.

422
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,400
 He took a photo of all of these little yellow squares laying on the sidewalk.

423
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,800
 Lars said, "You know, I've seen these pop up before.

424
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,140
 I believe I saw them as early as 2016.

425
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,620
 But it had been a while since I seen them.

426
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,420
 I thought you might be interested in this."

427
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,020
 And he took a couple photos of these things.

428
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,020
 This note that he's holding starts off with the headline, "November 8th, 2020."

429
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:38,300
 CIA SS, the Nazi SS, Nazi Secret Service, FBI, Kempetite, which I-- oh, Kanom was for

430
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,460
 sure I'm pronouncing that wrong, was the Japanese version of the Gestapo.

431
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,840
 They ran Unit 731.

432
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,280
 But anyways, he's basically comparing-- he's basically saying that CIA and the German SS

433
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,000
 and the FBI and that Japanese Gestapo unit are one and the same.

434
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
 That kind of goes to where his conspiracy's going.

435
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,520
 But in this little sheet of paper, it's probably about, I don't know, five by five.

436
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,160
 He lays out a pretty intricate conspiracy theory.

437
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,440
 So here we go.

438
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:11,240
 One, both Donald Trump and the left have been defrauded during this election.

439
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,980
 So neither side won.

440
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,460
 And he goes, "Remember Bernie Sanders was defrauded too."

441
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,740
 So he goes, "Don't think that the left is trying to defraud Trump.

442
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,260
 They've both been defrauded."

443
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,860
 They've both been defrauded by an organization so ingrained and American.

444
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
 No.

445
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,060
 In world society that they can do whatever they want.

446
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:39,160
 Three percent of the population of the planet are actually spies.

447
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,140
 He goes on to say that most cops are good.

448
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,720
 However, 20% of all cops work for the deep state.

449
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,600
 And every single criminal organization on the planet works for the deep state.

450
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,780
 With this network, the spies know everything about you.

451
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,780
 Everything.

452
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,000
 Doesn't matter if you didn't post about it online.

453
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,100
 Doesn't matter if you did it alone in your house.

454
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,000
 Trapping the God of Darkness in your bedroom.

455
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,760
 They know about that.

456
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:16,580
 He says in this note, "The spies train from very young, framing and bullying other kids."

457
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,360
 It's funny when I read that part I go, I can almost guarantee you that he had a difficult

458
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
 childhood.

459
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,640
 Not necessarily, I don't know what his home life was like.

460
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,920
 But when I read that I thought, it will pop up later that he had a difficult childhood.

461
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,780
 Sure enough, he does state that since he was 15 years old, he's been an unwitting participant

462
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,360
 in what's known as lab rat experiments.

463
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,800
 He says he went to Congress 11 different times with evidence.

464
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,880
 He has thousands of hours of video proof.

465
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
 He says several times in this message that at any point he could be killed.

466
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,680
 They know how to make it look like an accident.

467
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,640
 He can be killed at any time.

468
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,400
 And at the very bottom of this slip of paper that was littering a New York street, placed

469
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
 there on purpose.

470
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
 There were several of them.

471
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,060
 Not like this guy was running from the CIA and he was like, whoops, and he butterfingered

472
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,780
 all of his pamphlets.

473
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,740
 He puts them out on purpose.

474
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,460
 After talking about 3% of the world being spies, after talking about he might be killed

475
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,020
 in any moment, he leaves his address in his real name.

476
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,020
 Alexander D. Philippi.

477
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,300
 Which I don't think that's how you pronounce it.

478
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,820
 Alexander D. Philippi, Philippi, maybe.

479
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,420
 Alexander is what we're going to call him.

480
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,000
 So Lars had said that he thought this guy was operating as far back as 2016.

481
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,920
 I actually found an article on a website called The Bowery Boogie.

482
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,400
 It's I believe it's like a New York Zine newsletter thing.

483
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,160
 They say that this guy's been doing it since 2012.

484
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,900
 He's been dropping these leaflets off.

485
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,900
 So now the hunt was on.

486
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,220
 I started to find out all of this stuff about him.

487
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,040
 He does have thousands of hours of video footage.

488
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:04,660
 He has a Twitter that he set up in 2014.

489
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,180
 There's a camera facing out at the street and the videos will be labeled "The Mailman's

490
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,680
 At It Again".

491
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,480
 Car playing loud music at 3 in the morning.

492
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,640
 Four people walking down the street.

493
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
 A lot of times he does this thing where he'll set his camera up and he goes "look what happened

494
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,520
 right after I set my camera up".

495
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,000
 So he'll set his camera up.

496
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,880
 There's a couple seconds of nothing and then all of a sudden like a bunch of people are

497
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,160
 walking down the street.

498
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,160
 So he's thinking that the camera is starting to play.

499
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
 I guess I should say this.

500
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
 I don't even think I need to.

501
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,200
 He obviously has a lot of elements of gang stalking in this.

502
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 A lot of these things.

503
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,400
 Most of the people work for this organization.

504
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,000
 You can't trust law enforcement.

505
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 You can't trust anybody.

506
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,960
 He's constantly videotaping this stuff.

507
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,000
 He's gone to Congress a couple of times with this apparently which would honestly be hilarious

508
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,760
 to watch the 10th time when security's like "Ugh, not this guy again".

509
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 He has.

510
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,440
 He started this in 2014.

511
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,520
 He's created 131,000 tweets.

512
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,760
 There's a video channel.

513
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,840
 He has a video channel set up on a site that I wasn't familiar with.

514
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,760
 He has one video that is simply six hours staring out of his window.

515
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,360
 This doesn't have lo-fi mixed into it.

516
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,160
 This is a camera staring out of his window onto the street below.

517
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,560
 That channel has 2,800 followers and 810,000 likes.

518
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
 This guy's huge.

519
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
 This guy is huge in the gang stalking community.

520
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
 His Twitter photo?

521
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,200
 People have weird Twitter photos, right?

522
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,920
 His Twitter photo is a man in full traction.

523
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,720
 It's a photo taken from a cell phone of a man in full traction.

524
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,040
 You can barely see his face.

525
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,800
 He basically looks like, you know, when Bugs Bunny gets hit by a car and then he's in the

526
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,600
 - or when a real person unfortunately gets hit by a car.

527
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,480
 You know how like they're cast from head to toe.

528
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
 You can just see their eyes.

529
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,840
 It's a photo of his Twitter profile and I'm like, "What?

530
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,400
 Is that him?

531
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
 Is that just how he feels today?

532
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,120
 Does he feel like he's trapped in a cast, like a rat in a cage?"

533
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,320
 His Facebook has the same man from a different angle.

534
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,960
 So it's either him - I'm assuming it's him.

535
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
 Because it's in a hospital.

536
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,440
 It wasn't in Bob's barn from the first story.

537
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,600
 It's in a hospital.

538
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
 This photo's being taken.

539
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,400
 But I can't figure out - I mean the assumption would be that this is Alexander in full body

540
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,680
 cast.

541
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,560
 So I mean I'm assuming that's him.

542
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,120
 My question is why would that be the photo you would put?

543
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,120
 I guess multiple questions.

544
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,280
 I'm not like, "Oh I totally believe everything else.

545
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
 3% of the world spies."

546
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,040
 But let me ask you about your photo choices.

547
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,560
 Like why is that him?

548
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,120
 I guess in a gangsta - you know most people want to put themselves - you gotta put photos

549
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
 based on how you want the world to perceive you.

550
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,400
 If you're a jokester, you have a picture of you going, "Ugh!"

551
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,840
 Doing something funny.

552
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,360
 And then if you're like serious or a businessman, you want to take a photo of yourself doing

553
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,600
 something business related.

554
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,360
 In a business suit, shaking a hand with someone.

555
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,920
 You don't want a picture of a guy in a business suit going, "Ugh!"

556
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,680
 But I wonder if gangstauckers - if I was a part of this community, I would want to put

557
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,400
 myself out there as being like super tough so the gangstauckers wouldn't mess with me.

558
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
 You know what I mean?

559
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,800
 Like you'd want to have a picture of you like holding a gun or lifting weights or lifting

560
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
 guns.

561
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,840
 But maybe in the gangstaucking community you want photos to show yourself as the victim.

562
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,080
 Because that's how you feel all the time.

563
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,280
 I just thought of that.

564
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,160
 I wonder if that's what was going on with this.

565
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,720
 So he could go, "Look, gangstaucking world.

566
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,360
 Look at all you weirdos out there.

567
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,040
 This is what happened to me."

568
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,880
 This is his conspiracy in a nutshell.

569
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,960
 Because I didn't want to research on it.

570
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
 I was looking through it.

571
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,400
 This is really it in a nutshell.

572
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,600
 And it's fairly compelling as far as like a Tom Clancy novel goes or Harry Turtledove

573
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,640
 novel goes.

574
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,760
 The Nazis did not lose World War II.

575
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,960
 Sure, the government was crushed.

576
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,280
 The military was crushed and the land was taken over.

577
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:51,920
 But the Nazi regime simply had a plan B. If you can't beat them, join them.

578
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,040
 And they began to form spy networks all over.

579
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,760
 Now I know about Project Paperclip.

580
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,240
 I know about Operation Werewolf.

581
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,000
 Project Paperclip is where the United States got a bunch of Nazi scientists to work on

582
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 a space program.

583
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,360
 Operation Werewolf was a plan that was discussed within the German government saying, "We're

584
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,480
 going to have eternal guerrilla warfare in the country of Germany."

585
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,880
 Like they may destroy the government, but behind every blade of grass will be a man

586
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,120
 with a gun.

587
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,480
 And eventually the generals in Germany were like, "That is a terrible idea."

588
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,360
 The South wanted to do that too after the end of the Civil War.

589
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,160
 They wanted to have this long term guerrilla warfare and the leaders were like, "Nah,

590
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
 we lost."

591
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,600
 Like, "Just kind of call it a day at a certain point."

592
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,960
 Because you would never be able to put down a nationwide insurrection like that every

593
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
 single day.

594
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,480
 Millions of people shooting each other.

595
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
 So they just called it.

596
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,480
 But anyway, so this, I know both of those are real actually.

597
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,640
 Those aren't even conspiracy theories.

598
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,760
 This borders on conspiracy theory territory because it's not like they just go to NASA.

599
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,400
 They actually infiltrate every position of society.

600
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:01,080
 Politics, the media, entertainment industries, cults, secret societies, the press, terrorist

601
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:09,000
 groups, law enforcement, they're all infiltrated at some point by this forth rike.

602
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,880
 They are the deep state is this guy's conspiracy theory.

603
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,360
 The deep state's not just people who've been working in government for 30 years and they're

604
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,160
 like, "I don't want anything to change."

605
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,120
 That's not what he's saying it is.

606
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,240
 That's what it is in real life.

607
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,400
 It's basically, you have people in there who are diehard political operatives, but you

608
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,480
 have a lot of people in there who'd be like, "I just want to work here long enough to

609
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
 get my pension."

610
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,400
 So if I got to do a bunch of illegal stuff, so stuff doesn't change too much in the government,

611
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,240
 that's a big component of what the deep state is.

612
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,640
 It's just lifelong bureaucrats who've been stamping papers for past 15 years and then

613
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,320
 they're like, "Uhhh, I just want to see all these changes come in government."

614
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,080
 And they're like, "Okay, I guess I'm in the deep state now because I want to get my pension."

615
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
 But his idea isn't that.

616
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,840
 It's that the actual Nazi regime has morphed into that.

617
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,640
 That's a compelling conspiracy theory.

618
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,560
 That was one that I actually went to the conspiracy theory iceberg on.

619
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,120
 I went to that list that Jack on Twitter made and I couldn't find it.

620
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,960
 This conspiracy theory that Nazis didn't lose World War II, they simply reorganized

621
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,600
 and took over the planet in another way.

622
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,360
 That's not on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

623
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,240
 I actually was sure that it was because it's a compelling conspiracy theory.

624
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,080
 Don't get me wrong, it'd be a great espionage novel.

625
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,040
 I'm sure there have been books and movies made about stuff like this, but let's wrap

626
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,240
 it up like this.

627
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,480
 Let me read you a little bit of what Alexander wrote in his own words.

628
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,240
 "Formally, I am free to go anywhere.

629
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,680
 Nevertheless, I am object of such harassment when I leave home that ultimately I have to

630
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,000
 stay in it to avoid provocations that could get me arrested again.

631
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,880
 Although staying at home means burying enormous amount of toxins to keep me awake and electroshocks

632
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,000
 to wake me up at specific intervals, sleep deprivation, the chances that a provocation

633
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,160
 can work in the spice favor when I am at home are much more remote than when I am out of

634
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,960
 it."

635
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,040
 So that's the story of Alexander, a man who has imprisoned himself in his own house, with

636
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,720
 a camera pointing outside recording all of the Nazi collaborators walking down the street.

637
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,200
 It's an interesting tale with a mysterious ending.

638
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:28,400
 If he is a recluse trapped in his house, who's dropping off the notes?

639
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:35,320
 What if someone is planting these notes, leaving this man's name and address, and he doesn't

640
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,280
 even know it?

641
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:45,840
 And curious people, or weirdos, or gang-stalking advocates, keep walking up to his house, ringing

642
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,280
 the doorbell, asking for more information about the grand conspiracy.

643
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,520
 This man doesn't answer the door, he just waits until the knocking stops and he sees

644
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,640
 them move past his window.

645
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,640
 He records their face, and it's another proof of his gang-stalking delusion.

646
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,240
 However, what if someone is actually using innocent people to gang-stalk him?

647
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,360
 Innocent people who find these flyers and go to his house.

648
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,600
 If he is trapped in his house, who was leaving the flyers?

649
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,200
 That may be the start to unraveling the true conspiracy around little yellow slips of paper

650
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:49,680
 on the New York City sidewalk.

651
00:30:49,680 --> 00:31:16,080
.

652
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,480
 This is the story of a daughter.

653
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,440
 Travelers, this is Carlos.

654
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,720
 I just hit my car.

655
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
 Is everyone okay?

656
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,920
 And the insurance company that believes people always come first.

657
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,160
 If it matters to you, Travelers Insurance will help protect it.

658
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,520
 Travelers, speak to an independent agent today.
