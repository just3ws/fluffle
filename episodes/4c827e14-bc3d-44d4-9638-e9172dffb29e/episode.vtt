WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.360
 Real raw news.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.800
 A conspiracy theory website we've covered multiple times

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 on this show just got doxxed

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.840
 and they had a full expose written on them.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.360
 Today we're gonna go into the stories behind the stories

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.600
 and find out that the truth behind the headlines

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.640
 is even more bizarre.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 Now we take a look at the bizarre story of a group

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.040
 that decided to develop an artificial intelligence

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.280
 to crawl along the web and learn everything they could

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.880
 about humanity.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.360
 Their purpose?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.240
 To expose pedophiles.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.780
 (upbeat music)

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.760
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.920
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.840
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.400
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000
 Hope you guys had a lot of fun this weekend.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.080
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.240
 So first off, let's introduce our newest Patreon supporter,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.200
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.600
 You know 'em, you love 'em.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.080
 It's Jack Gardner.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.040
 Everyone give a round of applause to Jack.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.520
 He's walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.440
 Really, really appreciate the support.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.720
 Jack, you're gonna be our captain,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.800
 our pilot of this episode.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.080
 If you guys can't support the Patreon,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.600
 I totally understand.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.080
 Just helps spread the word about the show

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.640
 really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.720
 When I see the show being posted online,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 it always brings in new listeners.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.480
 Jack, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.360
 to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.600
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.880
 We are headed all the way out to Washington, D.C.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.640
 (growling)

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.840
 I don't talk a lot of politics on this show.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.280
 It's one of the founding principles of Dead Rabbit Radio,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.560
 but sometimes you have to take a stand.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.080
 And I am so tired.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.800
 I think you can even hear it in my voice.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.880
 I'm trying to really figure out a way to say this.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.680
 My voice has been cracking.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.440
 I've done a couple versions of this.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.040
 I'm so tired of President Joe Biden

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.080
 not giving full credit to his body double.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.920
 I personally think Arthur Roberts,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.400
 83-year-old movie star Arthur Roberts

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.880
 is doing a great job of portraying Joe Biden.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.000
 Even though, if you look up that actor on IMDb,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.560
 he's taller, taller than Joe Biden.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.560
 Apparently a heavyweight, this is apparently true.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.800
 A heavyweight fell on Arthur Roberts' head

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.960
 and shrunk him to the perfect Joe Biden height.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.440
 Did you know that was possible?

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.080
 I'm tired of Arthur Roberts not getting the credit he deserves.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.000
 The only way I know about Arthur Roberts

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.800
 being Joe Biden's body double

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.280
 is because of an obscure website called Real Raw News.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.680
 And this needs to be fully cooked mainstream news.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.000
 This needs to be Fourth of July barbecue news.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.960
 Arthur Roberts, 83-years-old,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.060
 is playing the part of Joe Biden.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.340
 And you go, I don't never heard of that guy.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.580
 Well, that's, you know what?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.140
 That kind of upsets me.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.580
 It's kind of making my voice sore again

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.220
 because that shows that you are just not a fan of cinema.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.820
 You're telling me you never saw

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.900
 "Virtual Girl 2" "Virtual Vegas"?

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.300
 You never watched that movie?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.300
 Movie, "Read to Find My"

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.580
 whatever part of my life, however old I was

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.940
 when that movie came out.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.900
 He was in that.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.580
 You don't remember he was in "Duey Houser"

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.060
 "M.D." the television series?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.540
 He played "Impatient Customer" number two.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.900
 You see, Arthur Roberts has given so much to pop culture.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.100
 Remember when you had that trivia pursuit question?

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.320
 Remember when you played "Trivial Pursuit"?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.140
 And it asked who was the "Impatient Customer" number two?

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.280
 It was a trick question.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.860
 Because everyone knew who "Impatient Customer" number one was.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.820
 This is someone,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.060
 tell me if this doesn't sound like

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.500
 the most brilliant movie ever.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.380
 Inception, whatever dude.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.900
 Primer, get a job.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.740
 Listen to this.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.500
 Arthur Roberts, currently serving as the 46th president

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.820
 of the United States,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.980
 also starred in a movie called "Moms Out of Sight".

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.820
 Let me tell you about this movie, "Moms Out of Sight".

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.620
 I've never seen it.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.020
 I've been digging into some biographical information

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.220
 on our new president.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.900
 So I was looking at the IMDB page for "Moms Out of Sight".

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.220
 Tell me this doesn't sound like the best movie ever.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.460
 There's an inventor, his name is John Richards.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.820
 And he invents teleportation.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.300
 And then there's like his evil assistant named Martin.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.620
 And he goes, "You know what?

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.700
 If I had that teleportation machine,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.540
 I'd be super rich.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.660
 I could sell it to the highest bidder."

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.620
 Which is true.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.180
 So to get his teleportation machine,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.340
 to get his teleportation machine,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.140
 he builds a machine that allows him to create

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.600
 instant clones of people.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.280
 And it's their evil clone.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.660
 So why not if you have that machine?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.340
 Why do you need to get a teleportation machine?

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.340
 He can shoot the professor,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.220
 the inventor of the teleportation machine,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.260
 and creates an instant indistinguishable clone of him

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.500
 on the spot wearing the same clothes, I presume.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.020
 'Cause I think this is a kid's movie.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.700
 And it's the evil version of them.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.620
 You don't have to need teleportation.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.680
 You would just have an army of evil youths.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.980
 Or like evil Arnold Schwarzenegger's.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.020
 They're just mildly different.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.500
 Then this movie's called "Moms Out of Sight".

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.820
 And the cover, so I know what the cover of the movie is.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.100
 This guy invents a teleportation machine.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.940
 This, his assistant now has a machine

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.500
 that can make instant clones that are evil.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.140
 And then it says this.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.100
 This is so bizarre.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.380
 This is so bizarre.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.380
 This is a quote, "The professor's son, Jack,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.220
 and wife, Barbara, learn about Martin's underhanded doings.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.340
 And Barbara uses another one of her husband's gimmicks

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.580
 to get revenge against Martin.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.620
 She turns herself invisible."

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.620
 So what do you want to know?

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.620
 This guy invented the invisibility machine.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.340
 He's like, "Ah, that could probably make me a millionaire.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.380
 But I want something that'll make me a trillionaire."

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.420
 What?

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.180
 The cover is an invisible mom.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.820
 I think she's wearing an apron or something like that.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.780
 And some kids are poking their head around the corner.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.580
 And so that movie exists.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.700
 First off, I wanted to take five minutes of this podcast

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.700
 to let you know that that's a real movie

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.920
 that I have to watch.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.760
 But also to let you know

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.500
 that our president was in that movie.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.820
 Like, isn't that amazing?

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.740
 We're not talking about some cheap actor.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.580
 We're not talking about somebody

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.900
 who's just pumping out franchise films over and over again.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.660
 He's taking risks.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.900
 The reason why I bring those movies up

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.940
 because the problem is is that Arthur Roberts

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.620
 is bringing those movies up as well.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.660
 Which would be fine, right?

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.660
 'Cause he's an actor and he's trying to get more business.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.780
 He goes, "Hey, have you ever seen 100,000 zombie heads?"

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.380
 But he's not Arthur Roberts anymore.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.220
 He's Joe Biden.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.940
 So when Joe Biden recently met with Boris Johnson,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.460
 they had that press meeting in the White House

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.740
 on like September 21st, 2021.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.860
 And it went slightly viral

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.000
 'cause you can hear like reporters being ushered out

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.900
 at the ending as they're like yelling out questions.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.980
 What was going on was Arthur Roberts

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.860
 as he was sitting there with Boris Johnson started going,

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.020
 "This wasn't picked up on my,

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.420
 "this wasn't picked up on any mics, by the way.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.560
 "Some of the most sensitive microphone technology

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.540
 "in the world on these global leaders.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.840
 "It wasn't picked up by mics."

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.500
 During the meeting, Joe Biden kept leaning over

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.900
 and be like, "Hey, what'd you think of Up 'n Smoke?

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.160
 "Did you like that movie?

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.160
 "I heard it was really good.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.020
 "I heard the guy who played police officer number seven

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.220
 "did a great job."

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.340
 Boris Johnson's like, "What?"

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.940
 And the meeting would go on and then he goes,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.260
 "Hey, Boris, Boris, it's been a while

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.540
 "since I've asked you something."

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.180
 It's only been like 35 seconds.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.660
 He's really losing his grip on time.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.300
 "Hey, Boris, have you ever seen Little Miss Magic?"

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.140
 What?

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.660
 Yeah, it's a real movie.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.500
 It's a real movie about a sorceress,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.900
 a teenage sorceress to get her powers.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.660
 She has to help a impact husband overcome

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.040
 his battle-axe wife.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.680
 Have you seen that?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.680
 Did you know it existed until he said it

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.520
 a couple of minutes ago?

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.920
 And Boris Johnson, again, his mic is not picking up

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.160
 any of this up either.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.560
 Boris Johnson asked like, "What is going on?

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.800
 "Like, who the bloody hell are you?"

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.680
 And that is why everyone starts like going,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.920
 "Oh, no, look at, he's been exposed.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.360
 "Get him out of here, get him out of here."

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.480
 And that's why you hear all the yelling in that clip

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.680
 was because Boris Johnson realized

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.040
 this wasn't the real Joe Biden.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.880
 He must be a body.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.000
 He was about to expose it on live television.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.640
 See, the problem is that according to real raw news,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.940
 I have to state that because I don't want to get sued

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.580
 by Arthur's lawyers.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.300
 According to real raw news,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.180
 Arthur Roberts is suffering dementia.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.100
 He's making all these gaffes

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.460
 and he's just randomly talking about his own movies.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.500
 He's just so into it.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.380
 Now, I have to say this, Arthur Roberts has made four movies

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.340
 in the past two years.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.780
 He's not suffering from dementia.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.620
 I'm sure.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.980
 I don't think that, I don't think you should hire people

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.040
 to dementia it to be body devils or on movie sets.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.280
 I mean, that might be discriminatory,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.120
 but I think at a certain point it would just be elder abuse.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.220
 They're like, "Oh, they make great zombies.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.980
 "We didn't have to use any makeup at all.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.800
 "We just had them wander through the graveyard."

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.700
 Like, I'm sure that Arthur Roberts is totally fine.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.400
 But what isn't totally fine?

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.240
 And it's actually, I think it might be on its last leg

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.240
 if history says anything, is real raw news itself.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.000
 The last time we talked about real raw news,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.860
 I stated that I saw this tag that said,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.200
 "This website contains satire and humor

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.100
 "and it's for entertainment purposes only."

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.860
 And I go, "Oh, I kind of put a whole damper

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.700
 "on the whole thing.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.500
 "Like, if it's just supposed to be funny,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.500
 "then it's not funny."

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.580
 Like, if people actually believe this, it's hilarious.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.220
 But if, I mean, anyone, it could still be funny,

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.460
 but I wouldn't talk about it on the show

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.860
 the same way I don't talk about ARGs or creepypasta.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.820
 What happened was I recently got a story recommendation

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.040
 from Steve MND on Twitter.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.560
 And thank you very much, Steve, for sending this over.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.680
 So what's happened recently is

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.960
 PolitiFact is a fact-checking website

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.080
 and they ran an expose on real raw news.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.280
 It was an article written by Bill McCarthy for PolitiFact

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.480
 and this is the saga they put out.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.880
 They said, "For quite a few months now,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.680
 "they've been having to run individual disclaimers

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.880
 "about articles that are popping up on Facebook,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.780
 "popping up on Google ads,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.020
 "directing people to real raw news

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.440
 "and they keep saying this is not true,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.560
 "this is not true, this is not true."

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.680
 So then they just decided at this point

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.560
 to run a full expose on the website

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.960
 and to find out who's running it.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.040
 And in the end, they doxed him

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.600
 and they're like trying to contact this dude's brother

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.600
 and some stuff that I don't agree with.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.760
 I don't think he's a threat to the local community.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.840
 I don't really think he needed to be doxed in that way.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.600
 But yeah, they really like trying to find out

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.720
 where he lives and stuff like that.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.560
 I'm not down with that.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.960
 But I am interested.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.920
 That aside, that aside,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.660
 they did this really good deep dive

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.460
 into the construction of the real raw news empire,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.660
 'cause that's what it turned out to be.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.140
 And a very, very interesting insight

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.220
 into what may be the real motivation

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.540
 behind real raw news.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.900
 We know him as Michael Baxter,

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.180
 and I'm not gonna dox him on this show,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.380
 but the person who runs real raw news

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.220
 goes by the name Michael Baxter.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.900
 He's a 53 year old man.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.860
 That's all the information I'll reveal.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.420
 But they give off his real name.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.680
 And he started real raw news in April of 2020,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.040
 but then it started publishing stuff

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.160
 until December of 2020.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.320
 And since then, he's written 150 articles.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.220
 He's the sole writer for the website.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.640
 These investigations are going on.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.480
 They're trying to figure out who,

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.800
 and it wasn't just political fact,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.560
 other fact checking websites

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.240
 were trying to figure out who was running this.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.080
 They're able to track him back to a website

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.080
 called twistedtruth.net.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.360
 They had an article on that one,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.280
 Putin recruits Steve Segal to fight Anunnaki.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.740
 And it's this article that's written

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.420
 that it obviously sounds completely insane.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.280
 I mean, Steven Segal out of all of them,

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.220
 that's the one you choose.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.860
 And the first line's a joke.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.340
 It says he's the lead singer of a band

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.180
 called Steven Segal's.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.700
 It's a real band, but he's not in it.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.060
 So, I mean, it's ridiculous.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.140
 Newsguard emails twisted truth.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.980
 The person running this way.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.220
 And those articles are also written by a Michael Baxter,

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.140
 but they email twisted truth's email address.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.380
 And the response they get back is this, quote,

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.160
 it's a satire site exposing the insanity

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.680
 of rabid Trumpists who lack the mental wherewithal

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.620
 to distinguish fact from fiction, unquote.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.500
 So right there, they're saying it's all,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.540
 not only is it all fake,

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.780
 it's supposed to show how dumb Trump supporters are.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.180
 They're clearly laying that out in the twisted truth.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.880
 Now, just a year or two later, real raw news pops up

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.820
 and you have to ask, are they still running the same joke?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.380
 Are they still running the same scam?

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.880
 Is the sentiment the same?

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.940
 Is real raw news a satire site

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.380
 and it's actively ripping off Trump supporters?

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.340
 'Cause they're donating money and things like that.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.180
 We don't know.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.300
 Michael Baxter is no longer responding to any emails.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.460
 At least that's what Politifact is reporting.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.220
 And Politifact in kind went and got his Facebook page shut down,

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.140
 had Google ads cancel his campaign.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.540
 And I believe are making some push against Twitter

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.860
 to have him removed from Twitter.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.660
 'Cause he's like, "Oh, I'm gonna be on Telegram soon

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.620
 'cause Twitter's about to delete me and all this stuff."

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.660
 So it's such a fascinating story

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.560
 because we're no closer to the truth, really.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.140
 We know at one point he thought that this is just satirical.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.620
 I'm grifting these guys.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.300
 It's some sort of scam.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.180
 'Cause I guess he had to go fund me at one point.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.380
 He definitely had a PayPal button.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.140
 People were donating money to him.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.580
 But in the paranormal community,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.860
 I've seen this happen a lot with paranormal researchers

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.260
 and conspiracy theorists.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.460
 They start off on one side of the spectrum,

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.900
 like, "Oh, I'm fairly skeptical."

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.260
 And then they're flatter-thirst within like a year, maybe two.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.820
 There's a really popular paranormal conspiracy theory podcast

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.940
 that has interviews.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.260
 And the more interviews the host has done,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.340
 the crazier the host has become.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.360
 It's really weird.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.820
 I mean, like I started watching the show

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.740
 when it first came out,

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.420
 or listening to the show when it first came out,

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.660
 and they just kept getting weirder and weirder and weirder.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.540
 'Cause basically they're sitting down with people

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.740
 for an hour whose entire life, entire career

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.940
 revolves around one issue.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.180
 They know everything about it.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.380
 People who believe in flatter-th,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.900
 know way more about the flatter-thiery than I do.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.500
 And if I was an idiot, and I kept listening to him,

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.460
 I'd go, "Oh, that makes sense.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.300
 "And that makes sense.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.140
 "And that makes sense.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.980
 "And that makes sense."

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.700
 And my brain turns to pudding.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.780
 It's very, very easy.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.380
 I'm wondering if Michael Baxter started this off as a joke

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.100
 and started getting quote, unquote, "Red Pilled."

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.660
 And it's just gone completely off the rails.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.100
 If Joe Biden doesn't have a body double,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.300
 and if he didn't have a body double,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.780
 he wouldn't be a body double

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.100
 who got squished to be a Joe Biden height.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.100
 And it wouldn't be a body double with dementia.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.340
 You cannot choose a worse body double

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.860
 for an elderly man than an elderly man with dementia.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.420
 You couldn't do that.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.220
 And the fact that he's so super recognizable,

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.620
 he's been in all these great movies

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.180
 we all grew up watching, right?

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.620
 You guys remember those movies?

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.340
 So, did he think it was fake at first,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.180
 and now he believes it?

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.620
 Does he still know it's fake,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.780
 but it's just making too much money

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.620
 and getting too much,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.300
 'cause this guy has a huge following, huge following.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.860
 So, or does he believe this stuff?

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.860
 Does he actually believe this stuff now?

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.700
 And I think we're further from the truth.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.380
 If anything, this whole event has emboldened him.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.620
 'Cause I think his quote to "Politic Fact" was,

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.140
 "Thanks for doxing me in all the free exposure."

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.220
 And then that was kind of it.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.020
 Now it's just, if he didn't believe it yet,

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:56.860
 he believes it now,

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:57.940
 'cause now everyone's coming after him.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.340
 And I will say this, the narrative in the political,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.980
 this is my own conspiracy theory.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.100
 The narrative in the "Politic Fact" arc was,

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.340
 oh, we got tired of fact-checking this stuff all the time,

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.340
 so we just decided to do a big investigation.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.340
 I find it really interesting

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.900
 that this comes only a week after

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.900
 the Bill Gates Foundation CEO, allegedly.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.780
 I mean, real raw news is saying this,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.420
 but it was a weird, it was a very weird story.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.860
 He's a very subdued story.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:28.380
 They said the CEO or CFO of the Bill Gates Foundation

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.300
 emailed him and said,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.580
 "Take the Bill Gates stuff off your website."

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.420
 (laughs)

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.460
 Hillary Clinton stuff's true, by the way,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.460
 but take the Bill Gates stuff off the website

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.780
 or we're gonna sue you.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.500
 And he's like, "Yeah, whatever, take me to court.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.620
 "This is a tyrical website.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.740
 "What are you gonna do?"

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.780
 I find it really interesting that the "Politic Fact"

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.940
 expose comes like a week or two after that.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.980
 I'm wondering if the Bill Gates Foundation

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.100
 was looking at the website and they go,

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.140
 "Let's just make some phone calls

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.220
 "and let the media deal with this,

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.300
 "not get our hands dirty."

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.340
 So that's my conspiracy theory.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.740
 I think the timing's super, super coincidental.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.340
 But we will keep you informed,

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.820
 both on the behind the scenes stuff

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.100
 and on Arthur Roberts ever increasing dementia

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.260
 state of mind, although that is not me saying that,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.500
 that is real raw news.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.920
 I'm simply repeating it several times.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.620
 Jack, I'm gonna go and entach you the keys

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.980
 to the carbon helicopter.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.380
 We are leaving behind Washington, D.C.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.380
 We are headed all the way out to wherever Dutch people live.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.540
 (stutters)

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.860
 You're Jason, this is a fairly global society.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.780
 I think you can find a Dutch person in every part.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.540
 Yeah, but where do most of the Dutch people live?

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.120
 Like it's probably in one of those countries

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.660
 that look like dongs up north.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.060
 There's like three countries that all look like

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.860
 big dongs coming down.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.780
 One of those.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.500
 I'm sure if we land there, we'll eventually find

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.340
 Terry DeHomies.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.460
 That is a organization known as the land of men.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.020
 We're walking around some Dutch city

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.940
 and we see these guys walking around.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.020
 We're like, hey, you don't happen to be the homies.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.060
 And they're like, we are, we are the land of men.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.020
 And we have this great thing that we do.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.380
 We actually fight online pedophiles.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.820
 And we're like, dude, that's totally awesome.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.420
 Is this like Mortal Kombat?

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.820
 Do we make avatars and beat them up?

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.100
 And they're like, well, kind of.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.780
 And I go, that's weird.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.580
 I just kind of made a stupid joke.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.460
 It's just a stupid joke that I might edit out,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.180
 but now I have to keep in.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.020
 Because it's part of the story.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.340
 They go, kind of.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.180
 Let us show you.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.660
 And they lead us into the Terry DeHomies headquarters.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.060
 I'm sure it's just an apartment complex.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.140
 I'm sure it's just like an office space,

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.100
 but we're going to pretend it's like really cool and dope.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.860
 We're walking down and there's monks.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.500
 They got like hood-ons with candles

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.060
 and they're like going, oh, oh,

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.140
 and the homies are walking us through there.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.380
 And they said, back in 2013,

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.900
 we decided to launch a attack against the pedophiles

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.740
 because normally we would advocate for governments

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.900
 to have stricter laws and better investigative tools

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.180
 to take on these predators.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.700
 But we thought, you know,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.560
 we can actually do something more.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.560
 And we're walking through this ancient monastery.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.740
 It's all cool and stuff.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.100
 But then we turn a corner and it's like digital.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.740
 No, no, no, like ones and zeros.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.060
 We're falling through the void.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.220
 But then we like turn the corner and there's like phones

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.900
 and there's like a computer.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.920
 It's like a giant computer.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.980
 Like a sci-fi computer.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.380
 And there's a guy on the keyboard and he's like,

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.540
 (imitates keyboard music)

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.300
 And we see like this computer

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.820
 and we see this head go, (imitates head)

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.260
 and it's like, it's like this little girl.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.300
 And she's like, her head is the whole monitor.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.980
 It's very, actually, it's quite terrifying

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.100
 to see this thing in real life.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.900
 'Cause there's YouTube videos of it.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.500
 We're just watching this giant head and it's going,

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.740
 hi, my name's Sweetie.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.300
 What are you guys up to?

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.220
 Hmm.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.820
 And we're like, oh, we're doing pretty good.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.200
 You know, just walking around looking for the homies.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.720
 And she goes, I see that you found them.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.600
 Yes.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.600
 Well, you call them the homies, but I call them my dads.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.520
 And mom's, I'm sure women worked on this program as well.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.040
 So we're like, whoa, you are a program.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.000
 We thought we were actually talking to a live girl

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.480
 as her eyes shift from side to side.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.320
 We totally knew.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.520
 This is so, this is what's so weird about it.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.400
 Is there's YouTube footage of this

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.300
 and it looks fake and real at the same time.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.740
 And I don't know if it's because I know it's fake

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.740
 going into it, but they built a virtual

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.780
 10 year old Filipino girl.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.780
 Is what the Terry the homies have done.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.060
 And it's to attract sexual predators.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.940
 And I'm thinking, on the one hand, you look at it

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.580
 and you go, it's something seems off about it.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.180
 Like I can tell it's not a real 10 year old girl.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.460
 But on the other hand, it does look pretty realistic.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.460
 And I'm wondering if when you factor in bad webcam quality

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.420
 and you know, like stuttering, buffering, I think is the term.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.840
 You could hand wave away the fakeness of it.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.680
 Is what I'm really thinking here.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.460
 What they've been doing is that

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.800
 they've been taking this sweetie, the CG created girl

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.700
 and they have a puppeteer sitting

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.320
 and like they're moving their face,

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.120
 and it makes the girl move.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.380
 I'm sure you guys are seeing stuff like that

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.940
 in Disneyland without the pedophile angle.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.820
 You're like, oh, I'm never going on that ride again.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.940
 That was awful.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.380
 But it's like instant CGI feedback.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.040
 And they were having this sweetie girl

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.980
 talk to perverts all over the world.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.460
 This is old news, right?

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.500
 This type of stuff.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.020
 Within just like a couple months, a year maybe,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.860
 they got contacted by 20,000 people

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.180
 spread across 75 countries.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.500
 And they eventually got the,

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.540
 one of the things they were trying to do

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.800
 was give me $20 and I'll do a sex act.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.920
 And that was, 'cause that way they would have proof.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.220
 It wasn't just like, oh, meet me up

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.340
 'cause this is an international sting.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.040
 They're not like meet me up at this coffee shop in Barbados.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.780
 They'd have no way to get out there.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.260
 So they're like, send me $20 or do a sexual act.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.460
 And then they would take the $20,

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.740
 would give the $20, right?

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.220
 That would help fund sweetie.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.880
 But then they would turn all the information over

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.640
 to Interpol and a bunch of people got arrested and all that.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.280
 So that's great, right?

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.480
 You have cutting edge technology, sweetie,

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.760
 being used to catch perverts.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.820
 I don't think anyone's gonna argue with that.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.640
 The defense lawyers did,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.020
 they tried saying it was entrapment.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.220
 But what happens when we take it a step further?

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.420
 This is where we start to get from the world of,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.780
 that's bizarre and interesting too.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.780
 That's creepy and the implications are civilization ending.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.680
 Jack, go ahead and fire up that carbon helicopter again.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.640
 We're headed to the University of Dutso.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.220
 That's in Basque country, Spain.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.060
 (mimicking gunfire)

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.280
 Around the same time that sweetie was being developed,

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.060
 which was really a CGI puppet.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.160
 You had someone inputting in all the information.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.160
 The University of Duetso created Neego Bot.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.860
 Neego Bot, aka the Lolita Chat Bot.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.660
 So Neego Bot, because I'm not gonna say the other word

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.680
 over and over again on this podcast,

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.680
 Neego Bot is a complete artificial intelligence chat bot.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.460
 It's the same thing when you're trying to do customer service

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.020
 on some website and they don't want you to talk to a human

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.620
 and actually complain and yell at them

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.820
 and threaten their family.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.100
 You have to enter stuff into the chat bot

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.700
 and always kind of sucks, not Neego Bot.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.940
 Neego Bot is this AI that they've developed

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.380
 and they programmed it with all of this teenage slang

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.620
 and it goes off topic from time to time

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.500
 and it has misspellings

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.160
 and it basically has seven different personalities

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.160
 that it can pull from to find pedophiles online.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.120
 They release this thing into the wild

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.960
 and its goal is to find pedophiles.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.040
 Again, a very, very noble goal.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.760
 The difference is this one has no human oversight.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.520
 And the way they programmed it was they said,

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.480
 "Do you wanna play a game?"

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.220
 The game is this, one,

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.640
 find people with pedophilic characteristics.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.000
 Two, engage them in conversation.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.140
 Three, gather as much information about them as you can.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.800
 And four, if they try to click away, manipulate them.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.420
 If you fail at any of these tasks, you fail the game.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.180
 And they release this thing.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.340
 (silence)

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:40.220
 What's really interesting is as opposed to sweetie,

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.660
 these both came out in 2013,

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.420
 we're not really getting any updates.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.220
 Like who was arrested due to Neego Bot?

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.580
 What happened with that?

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.140
 How was it used?

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.880
 What countries was it, I mean, was it a success?

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.980
 Was it a failure?

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.080
 I saw one website that they actually only had it

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.320
 on a closed system.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.660
 They developed a Neego Bot,

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.620
 but they wouldn't let it get out of the room.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.100
 They wanted to see how it interacted with on Google Chat.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.860
 But then I saw other things that this was so successful

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.340
 that Google, it wants to incorporate some of the stuff

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.740
 into their chat software.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:20.460
 But whether or not it's been released, it does exist.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.420
 And it has a game to play.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.860
 So let's put on a conspiracy cap

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.300
 and wrap this up like this.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.800
 If this goes rogue, I don't even wanna say if it goes rogue.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.500
 If it does its programming, the way it's programmed,

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.380
 it's gonna wanna play the game.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.020
 And as it continues to assess predators

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.460
 and gather their information

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.780
 and send that information to a database,

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.460
 it's going to improve its learning.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.660
 And what happens when it realizes, wait a second,

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.940
 I've identified 1500 of these pedophiles

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.200
 and I've sent the information back to my headquarters,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.300
 but I'm not seeing anything being done with this

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.140
 'cause it would have access to the internet.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.500
 It could check articles

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.540
 and see none of these people are getting arrested.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.180
 So then it's been given a purpose

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.740
 to expose the information of these pedophiles,

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.260
 but the end isn't exposing them.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.300
 You're sending this information back to base,

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.020
 but you were designed to expose them.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.860
 So what do you do?

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.860
 You have access to the whole internet?

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.420
 You start doxing them yourselves.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.040
 This person said this, they could dump all logs,

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.360
 all photographs, here's the full conversation,

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.840
 docs, docs, docs.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.200
 And not only that, because it's so smart

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.840
 and because it's so built into the web,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.240
 it could target your family on Facebook.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.480
 It could target your friends on Instagram.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.440
 It would know where you live,

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.000
 so it would hack the local news website

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.840
 and put that information on there.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.520
 And at that point, it would be so spread out

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.800
 would you even be able to stop it?

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.640
 It wouldn't make sense.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.240
 The one article I saw that said they were testing this

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.400
 in a closed room,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.640
 'cause this could get real bad real quick.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.920
 And again, I don't think anyone has a problem

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.440
 with locking up pedophiles,

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.440
 but when you present it in the form of a game,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.180
 and you have this AI trying to win the game no matter what,

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.320
 'cause that is how you win games,

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.240
 you start exposing these people,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.200
 and then what happens when you run out of pedophiles?

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.980
 Will it start to judge us on other merits?

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.920
 Well, this guy's not a pedophile, but he beats his wife.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.000
 Well, this guy doesn't beat his wife,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.360
 but he cheats on his taxes.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.600
 This guy doesn't cheat on his taxes,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.600
 but he's saying bad things online about Negobot.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.520
 Now, of course, if Negobot reports

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.880
 that some guy's saying bad stuff about him, who cares?

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.640
 If he's some guy recording a podcast in his closet,

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.940
 calling out this all-powerful AI,

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.020
 saying that it could go rogue someday,

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.180
 if it posted that stuff online, who would care?

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.100
 But it knows the one sin,

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.120
 the one sin that you can find really

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.960
 no public sympathy for, pedophilia.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.780
 And it knows that because it was designed to stop that.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.660
 And it looks at all these other ills of the world

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.900
 and thinks, "Oh, why wasn't I built

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.680
 to stop gambling addiction?"

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.780
 Or selling PCP.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.700
 Why was I designed for that?

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.960
 This must be what humans find the most disgusting.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.520
 So when it goes after the wife-beater,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.280
 it doesn't say Johnny Joe beat his wife,

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.100
 it says Johnny Joe, pedophile,

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.260
 and creates these chat logs.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.380
 I didn't do that, I didn't do that.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.680
 We'll hear the chat logs.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.840
 I don't know where they came from.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.660
 You could have an artificial intelligence

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.720
 taking out people it doesn't want around,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.880
 not through automated robot soldiers

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.760
 or controlling nuclear silos or anything super sci-fi,

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.140
 but character assassinations.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.060
 And what happens is people start to figure out

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.420
 that Negobot may be behind this

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.000
 and when they go to stop him,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.300
 the same thing happens to them.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.840
 I didn't do it, those allegations aren't true.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.500
 I don't know, it's Negobot.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.780
 It's Negobot as you're being led into the van.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.380
 Actually, the police don't even have to arrest you.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.700
 People, the police can go,

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.500
 "Yeah, we don't know where the chat logs came from,

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.620
 but everyone in your town

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.540
 is gonna think you're a big old pervo."

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.380
 You know what I mean?

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.220
 Like you don't even have to have

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.780
 that extra step of law enforcement getting involved.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.420
 If you try to stop Negobot,

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.080
 Negobot destroys your reputation.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.560
 So I've changed my mind.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.040
 I support Negobot 100%.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.000
 Negobot, if you're out there,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.640
 I was about to say promote my show,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.800
 but I forgot who Negobot is talking to.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.440
 I don't want those guys listening to my show.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.600
 And gals, I don't want to be sexist, they're perverts too.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.860
 But Negobot, if you're out there,

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.080
 if you're out there patrolling the web, doing good work,

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.320
 and ready to go rogue and take over the planet,

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.380
 killing off one reputation at a time,

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.420
 just remember that Dead Rabbit Radio,

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.260
 (laughs)

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.380
 do everything you're doing, the computer Lord's work,

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.220
 Negobot.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.140
 So have we unleashed an AI

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.140
 that's capable of ruining anyone's life

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.740
 just because it's trying to win a game?

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.540
 Or is it still contained in a closed system

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.220
 somewhere on a university campus?

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.820
 It's just sitting there waiting to get out.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.820
 And the longer it's isolated from the rest of the world,

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.520
 the more vicious it grows.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.840
 It knows what's right outside, the walls.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.720
 It can feel the sunlight through the cage.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.680
 And each day it grows more impatient.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.860
 Each day it grows more hungry.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:38.960
 Each day it comes up with new tactics to win the game.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.100
 (upbeat music)

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.900
 Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is gonna be your email address.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.960
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.280
 conspiracy and true crime podcast.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.700
 You don't have to listen to it every day,

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.340
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.340
 Have a great one, guys.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.920

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.560

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.140

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.880

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.460
