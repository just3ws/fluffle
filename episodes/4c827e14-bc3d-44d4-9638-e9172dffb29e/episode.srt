1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
 Real raw news.

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,800
 A conspiracy theory website we've covered multiple times

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,360
 on this show just got doxxed

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,840
 and they had a full expose written on them.

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,360
 Today we're gonna go into the stories behind the stories

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,600
 and find out that the truth behind the headlines

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,640
 is even more bizarre.

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,640
 Now we take a look at the bizarre story of a group

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,040
 that decided to develop an artificial intelligence

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,280
 to crawl along the web and learn everything they could

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,880
 about humanity.

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,360
 Their purpose?

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,240
 To expose pedophiles.

27
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

28
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,780
 (upbeat music)

29
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:11,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,760
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

31
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,920
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,840
 I'm having a great day.

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,400
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,000
 Hope you guys had a lot of fun this weekend.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,080
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,240
 So first off, let's introduce our newest Patreon supporter,

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,200
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,600
 You know 'em, you love 'em.

39
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,080
 It's Jack Gardner.

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,040
 Everyone give a round of applause to Jack.

41
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,520
 He's walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,440
 Really, really appreciate the support.

43
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
 Jack, you're gonna be our captain,

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,800
 our pilot of this episode.

45
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,080
 If you guys can't support the Patreon,

46
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,600
 I totally understand.

47
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,080
 Just helps spread the word about the show

48
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,640
 really, really helps out a lot.

49
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,720
 When I see the show being posted online,

50
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 it always brings in new listeners.

51
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,480
 Jack, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

52
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,360
 to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,600
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,880
 We are headed all the way out to Washington, D.C.

55
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,640
 (growling)

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,840
 I don't talk a lot of politics on this show.

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,280
 It's one of the founding principles of Dead Rabbit Radio,

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,560
 but sometimes you have to take a stand.

59
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,080
 And I am so tired.

60
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,800
 I think you can even hear it in my voice.

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,880
 I'm trying to really figure out a way to say this.

62
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,680
 My voice has been cracking.

63
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,440
 I've done a couple versions of this.

64
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,040
 I'm so tired of President Joe Biden

65
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,080
 not giving full credit to his body double.

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,920
 I personally think Arthur Roberts,

67
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,400
 83-year-old movie star Arthur Roberts

68
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,880
 is doing a great job of portraying Joe Biden.

69
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,000
 Even though, if you look up that actor on IMDb,

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,560
 he's taller, taller than Joe Biden.

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,560
 Apparently a heavyweight, this is apparently true.

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,800
 A heavyweight fell on Arthur Roberts' head

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,960
 and shrunk him to the perfect Joe Biden height.

74
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,440
 Did you know that was possible?

75
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,080
 I'm tired of Arthur Roberts not getting the credit he deserves.

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,000
 The only way I know about Arthur Roberts

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,800
 being Joe Biden's body double

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,280
 is because of an obscure website called Real Raw News.

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,680
 And this needs to be fully cooked mainstream news.

80
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,000
 This needs to be Fourth of July barbecue news.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,960
 Arthur Roberts, 83-years-old,

82
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,060
 is playing the part of Joe Biden.

83
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,340
 And you go, I don't never heard of that guy.

84
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,580
 Well, that's, you know what?

85
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,140
 That kind of upsets me.

86
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,580
 It's kind of making my voice sore again

87
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,220
 because that shows that you are just not a fan of cinema.

88
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,820
 You're telling me you never saw

89
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,900
 "Virtual Girl 2" "Virtual Vegas"?

90
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,300
 You never watched that movie?

91
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
 Movie, "Read to Find My"

92
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,580
 whatever part of my life, however old I was

93
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,940
 when that movie came out.

94
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,900
 He was in that.

95
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,580
 You don't remember he was in "Duey Houser"

96
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,060
 "M.D." the television series?

97
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,540
 He played "Impatient Customer" number two.

98
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,900
 You see, Arthur Roberts has given so much to pop culture.

99
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,100
 Remember when you had that trivia pursuit question?

100
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,320
 Remember when you played "Trivial Pursuit"?

101
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,140
 And it asked who was the "Impatient Customer" number two?

102
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,280
 It was a trick question.

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,860
 Because everyone knew who "Impatient Customer" number one was.

104
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,820
 This is someone,

105
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,060
 tell me if this doesn't sound like

106
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,500
 the most brilliant movie ever.

107
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,380
 Inception, whatever dude.

108
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,900
 Primer, get a job.

109
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,740
 Listen to this.

110
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,500
 Arthur Roberts, currently serving as the 46th president

111
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,820
 of the United States,

112
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,980
 also starred in a movie called "Moms Out of Sight".

113
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,820
 Let me tell you about this movie, "Moms Out of Sight".

114
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,620
 I've never seen it.

115
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,020
 I've been digging into some biographical information

116
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,220
 on our new president.

117
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,900
 So I was looking at the IMDB page for "Moms Out of Sight".

118
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,220
 Tell me this doesn't sound like the best movie ever.

119
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,460
 There's an inventor, his name is John Richards.

120
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,820
 And he invents teleportation.

121
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,300
 And then there's like his evil assistant named Martin.

122
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,620
 And he goes, "You know what?

123
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,700
 If I had that teleportation machine,

124
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,540
 I'd be super rich.

125
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,660
 I could sell it to the highest bidder."

126
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,620
 Which is true.

127
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,180
 So to get his teleportation machine,

128
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,340
 to get his teleportation machine,

129
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,140
 he builds a machine that allows him to create

130
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,600
 instant clones of people.

131
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,280
 And it's their evil clone.

132
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,660
 So why not if you have that machine?

133
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,340
 Why do you need to get a teleportation machine?

134
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,340
 He can shoot the professor,

135
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,220
 the inventor of the teleportation machine,

136
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,260
 and creates an instant indistinguishable clone of him

137
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,500
 on the spot wearing the same clothes, I presume.

138
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,020
 'Cause I think this is a kid's movie.

139
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,700
 And it's the evil version of them.

140
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,620
 You don't have to need teleportation.

141
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,680
 You would just have an army of evil youths.

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,980
 Or like evil Arnold Schwarzenegger's.

143
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,020
 They're just mildly different.

144
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,500
 Then this movie's called "Moms Out of Sight".

145
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,820
 And the cover, so I know what the cover of the movie is.

146
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,100
 This guy invents a teleportation machine.

147
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,940
 This, his assistant now has a machine

148
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,500
 that can make instant clones that are evil.

149
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,140
 And then it says this.

150
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,100
 This is so bizarre.

151
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,380
 This is so bizarre.

152
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,380
 This is a quote, "The professor's son, Jack,

153
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,220
 and wife, Barbara, learn about Martin's underhanded doings.

154
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,340
 And Barbara uses another one of her husband's gimmicks

155
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,580
 to get revenge against Martin.

156
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,620
 She turns herself invisible."

157
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,620
 So what do you want to know?

158
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,620
 This guy invented the invisibility machine.

159
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,340
 He's like, "Ah, that could probably make me a millionaire.

160
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,380
 But I want something that'll make me a trillionaire."

161
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,420
 What?

162
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,180
 The cover is an invisible mom.

163
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,820
 I think she's wearing an apron or something like that.

164
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,780
 And some kids are poking their head around the corner.

165
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,580
 And so that movie exists.

166
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,700
 First off, I wanted to take five minutes of this podcast

167
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
 to let you know that that's a real movie

168
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,920
 that I have to watch.

169
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
 But also to let you know

170
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,500
 that our president was in that movie.

171
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,820
 Like, isn't that amazing?

172
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,740
 We're not talking about some cheap actor.

173
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,580
 We're not talking about somebody

174
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,900
 who's just pumping out franchise films over and over again.

175
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,660
 He's taking risks.

176
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,900
 The reason why I bring those movies up

177
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,940
 because the problem is is that Arthur Roberts

178
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,620
 is bringing those movies up as well.

179
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,660
 Which would be fine, right?

180
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
 'Cause he's an actor and he's trying to get more business.

181
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,780
 He goes, "Hey, have you ever seen 100,000 zombie heads?"

182
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,380
 But he's not Arthur Roberts anymore.

183
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,220
 He's Joe Biden.

184
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,940
 So when Joe Biden recently met with Boris Johnson,

185
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,460
 they had that press meeting in the White House

186
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,740
 on like September 21st, 2021.

187
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,860
 And it went slightly viral

188
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,000
 'cause you can hear like reporters being ushered out

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,900
 at the ending as they're like yelling out questions.

190
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,980
 What was going on was Arthur Roberts

191
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,860
 as he was sitting there with Boris Johnson started going,

192
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,020
 "This wasn't picked up on my,

193
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,420
 "this wasn't picked up on any mics, by the way.

194
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,560
 "Some of the most sensitive microphone technology

195
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,540
 "in the world on these global leaders.

196
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,840
 "It wasn't picked up by mics."

197
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,500
 During the meeting, Joe Biden kept leaning over

198
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,900
 and be like, "Hey, what'd you think of Up 'n Smoke?

199
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,160
 "Did you like that movie?

200
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
 "I heard it was really good.

201
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,020
 "I heard the guy who played police officer number seven

202
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,220
 "did a great job."

203
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,340
 Boris Johnson's like, "What?"

204
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,940
 And the meeting would go on and then he goes,

205
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,260
 "Hey, Boris, Boris, it's been a while

206
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,540
 "since I've asked you something."

207
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,180
 It's only been like 35 seconds.

208
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,660
 He's really losing his grip on time.

209
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,300
 "Hey, Boris, have you ever seen Little Miss Magic?"

210
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,140
 What?

211
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,660
 Yeah, it's a real movie.

212
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,500
 It's a real movie about a sorceress,

213
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,900
 a teenage sorceress to get her powers.

214
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,660
 She has to help a impact husband overcome

215
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,040
 his battle-axe wife.

216
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,680
 Have you seen that?

217
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
 Did you know it existed until he said it

218
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,520
 a couple of minutes ago?

219
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,920
 And Boris Johnson, again, his mic is not picking up

220
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,160
 any of this up either.

221
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
 Boris Johnson asked like, "What is going on?

222
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,800
 "Like, who the bloody hell are you?"

223
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,680
 And that is why everyone starts like going,

224
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,920
 "Oh, no, look at, he's been exposed.

225
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,360
 "Get him out of here, get him out of here."

226
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,480
 And that's why you hear all the yelling in that clip

227
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,680
 was because Boris Johnson realized

228
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,040
 this wasn't the real Joe Biden.

229
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,880
 He must be a body.

230
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,000
 He was about to expose it on live television.

231
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,640
 See, the problem is that according to real raw news,

232
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,940
 I have to state that because I don't want to get sued

233
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,580
 by Arthur's lawyers.

234
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,300
 According to real raw news,

235
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,180
 Arthur Roberts is suffering dementia.

236
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,100
 He's making all these gaffes

237
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,460
 and he's just randomly talking about his own movies.

238
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,500
 He's just so into it.

239
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,380
 Now, I have to say this, Arthur Roberts has made four movies

240
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,340
 in the past two years.

241
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,780
 He's not suffering from dementia.

242
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,620
 I'm sure.

243
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,980
 I don't think that, I don't think you should hire people

244
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,040
 to dementia it to be body devils or on movie sets.

245
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,280
 I mean, that might be discriminatory,

246
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,120
 but I think at a certain point it would just be elder abuse.

247
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,220
 They're like, "Oh, they make great zombies.

248
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,980
 "We didn't have to use any makeup at all.

249
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,800
 "We just had them wander through the graveyard."

250
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,700
 Like, I'm sure that Arthur Roberts is totally fine.

251
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,400
 But what isn't totally fine?

252
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,240
 And it's actually, I think it might be on its last leg

253
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,240
 if history says anything, is real raw news itself.

254
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
 The last time we talked about real raw news,

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,860
 I stated that I saw this tag that said,

256
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,200
 "This website contains satire and humor

257
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,100
 "and it's for entertainment purposes only."

258
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,860
 And I go, "Oh, I kind of put a whole damper

259
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,700
 "on the whole thing.

260
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,500
 "Like, if it's just supposed to be funny,

261
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
 "then it's not funny."

262
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,580
 Like, if people actually believe this, it's hilarious.

263
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,220
 But if, I mean, anyone, it could still be funny,

264
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,460
 but I wouldn't talk about it on the show

265
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,860
 the same way I don't talk about ARGs or creepypasta.

266
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,820
 What happened was I recently got a story recommendation

267
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,040
 from Steve MND on Twitter.

268
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,560
 And thank you very much, Steve, for sending this over.

269
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,680
 So what's happened recently is

270
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,960
 PolitiFact is a fact-checking website

271
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,080
 and they ran an expose on real raw news.

272
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,280
 It was an article written by Bill McCarthy for PolitiFact

273
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,480
 and this is the saga they put out.

274
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,880
 They said, "For quite a few months now,

275
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,680
 "they've been having to run individual disclaimers

276
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,880
 "about articles that are popping up on Facebook,

277
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,780
 "popping up on Google ads,

278
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,020
 "directing people to real raw news

279
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,440
 "and they keep saying this is not true,

280
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,560
 "this is not true, this is not true."

281
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,680
 So then they just decided at this point

282
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,560
 to run a full expose on the website

283
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,960
 and to find out who's running it.

284
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,040
 And in the end, they doxed him

285
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,600
 and they're like trying to contact this dude's brother

286
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
 and some stuff that I don't agree with.

287
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,760
 I don't think he's a threat to the local community.

288
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,840
 I don't really think he needed to be doxed in that way.

289
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,600
 But yeah, they really like trying to find out

290
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,720
 where he lives and stuff like that.

291
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,560
 I'm not down with that.

292
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
 But I am interested.

293
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,920
 That aside, that aside,

294
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,660
 they did this really good deep dive

295
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,460
 into the construction of the real raw news empire,

296
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,660
 'cause that's what it turned out to be.

297
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,140
 And a very, very interesting insight

298
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,220
 into what may be the real motivation

299
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,540
 behind real raw news.

300
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,900
 We know him as Michael Baxter,

301
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,180
 and I'm not gonna dox him on this show,

302
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,380
 but the person who runs real raw news

303
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,220
 goes by the name Michael Baxter.

304
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,900
 He's a 53 year old man.

305
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,860
 That's all the information I'll reveal.

306
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,420
 But they give off his real name.

307
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,680
 And he started real raw news in April of 2020,

308
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
 but then it started publishing stuff

309
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,160
 until December of 2020.

310
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,320
 And since then, he's written 150 articles.

311
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,220
 He's the sole writer for the website.

312
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,640
 These investigations are going on.

313
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,480
 They're trying to figure out who,

314
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,800
 and it wasn't just political fact,

315
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,560
 other fact checking websites

316
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
 were trying to figure out who was running this.

317
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,080
 They're able to track him back to a website

318
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,080
 called twistedtruth.net.

319
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,360
 They had an article on that one,

320
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,280
 Putin recruits Steve Segal to fight Anunnaki.

321
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,740
 And it's this article that's written

322
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,420
 that it obviously sounds completely insane.

323
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,280
 I mean, Steven Segal out of all of them,

324
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,220
 that's the one you choose.

325
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,860
 And the first line's a joke.

326
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,340
 It says he's the lead singer of a band

327
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,180
 called Steven Segal's.

328
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,700
 It's a real band, but he's not in it.

329
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,060
 So, I mean, it's ridiculous.

330
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,140
 Newsguard emails twisted truth.

331
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,980
 The person running this way.

332
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,220
 And those articles are also written by a Michael Baxter,

333
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,140
 but they email twisted truth's email address.

334
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,380
 And the response they get back is this, quote,

335
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,160
 it's a satire site exposing the insanity

336
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,680
 of rabid Trumpists who lack the mental wherewithal

337
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,620
 to distinguish fact from fiction, unquote.

338
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,500
 So right there, they're saying it's all,

339
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,540
 not only is it all fake,

340
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,780
 it's supposed to show how dumb Trump supporters are.

341
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,180
 They're clearly laying that out in the twisted truth.

342
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,880
 Now, just a year or two later, real raw news pops up

343
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,820
 and you have to ask, are they still running the same joke?

344
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,380
 Are they still running the same scam?

345
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,880
 Is the sentiment the same?

346
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,940
 Is real raw news a satire site

347
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,380
 and it's actively ripping off Trump supporters?

348
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,340
 'Cause they're donating money and things like that.

349
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,180
 We don't know.

350
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,300
 Michael Baxter is no longer responding to any emails.

351
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,460
 At least that's what Politifact is reporting.

352
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,220
 And Politifact in kind went and got his Facebook page shut down,

353
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,140
 had Google ads cancel his campaign.

354
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,540
 And I believe are making some push against Twitter

355
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,860
 to have him removed from Twitter.

356
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,660
 'Cause he's like, "Oh, I'm gonna be on Telegram soon

357
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,620
 'cause Twitter's about to delete me and all this stuff."

358
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,660
 So it's such a fascinating story

359
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,560
 because we're no closer to the truth, really.

360
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,140
 We know at one point he thought that this is just satirical.

361
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,620
 I'm grifting these guys.

362
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,300
 It's some sort of scam.

363
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,180
 'Cause I guess he had to go fund me at one point.

364
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,380
 He definitely had a PayPal button.

365
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,140
 People were donating money to him.

366
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,580
 But in the paranormal community,

367
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,860
 I've seen this happen a lot with paranormal researchers

368
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,260
 and conspiracy theorists.

369
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,460
 They start off on one side of the spectrum,

370
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,900
 like, "Oh, I'm fairly skeptical."

371
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,260
 And then they're flatter-thirst within like a year, maybe two.

372
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,820
 There's a really popular paranormal conspiracy theory podcast

373
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,940
 that has interviews.

374
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,260
 And the more interviews the host has done,

375
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,340
 the crazier the host has become.

376
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,360
 It's really weird.

377
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,820
 I mean, like I started watching the show

378
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,740
 when it first came out,

379
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,420
 or listening to the show when it first came out,

380
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,660
 and they just kept getting weirder and weirder and weirder.

381
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,540
 'Cause basically they're sitting down with people

382
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,740
 for an hour whose entire life, entire career

383
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,940
 revolves around one issue.

384
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,180
 They know everything about it.

385
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,380
 People who believe in flatter-th,

386
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,900
 know way more about the flatter-thiery than I do.

387
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,500
 And if I was an idiot, and I kept listening to him,

388
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,460
 I'd go, "Oh, that makes sense.

389
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,300
 "And that makes sense.

390
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,140
 "And that makes sense.

391
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,980
 "And that makes sense."

392
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,700
 And my brain turns to pudding.

393
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,780
 It's very, very easy.

394
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,380
 I'm wondering if Michael Baxter started this off as a joke

395
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,100
 and started getting quote, unquote, "Red Pilled."

396
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,660
 And it's just gone completely off the rails.

397
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,100
 If Joe Biden doesn't have a body double,

398
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,300
 and if he didn't have a body double,

399
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,780
 he wouldn't be a body double

400
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,100
 who got squished to be a Joe Biden height.

401
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,100
 And it wouldn't be a body double with dementia.

402
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,340
 You cannot choose a worse body double

403
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,860
 for an elderly man than an elderly man with dementia.

404
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,420
 You couldn't do that.

405
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,220
 And the fact that he's so super recognizable,

406
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,620
 he's been in all these great movies

407
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,180
 we all grew up watching, right?

408
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,620
 You guys remember those movies?

409
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,340
 So, did he think it was fake at first,

410
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,180
 and now he believes it?

411
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,620
 Does he still know it's fake,

412
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,780
 but it's just making too much money

413
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,620
 and getting too much,

414
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,300
 'cause this guy has a huge following, huge following.

415
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,860
 So, or does he believe this stuff?

416
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,860
 Does he actually believe this stuff now?

417
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,700
 And I think we're further from the truth.

418
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,380
 If anything, this whole event has emboldened him.

419
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,620
 'Cause I think his quote to "Politic Fact" was,

420
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,140
 "Thanks for doxing me in all the free exposure."

421
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,220
 And then that was kind of it.

422
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,020
 Now it's just, if he didn't believe it yet,

423
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,860
 he believes it now,

424
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,940
 'cause now everyone's coming after him.

425
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,340
 And I will say this, the narrative in the political,

426
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,980
 this is my own conspiracy theory.

427
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,100
 The narrative in the "Politic Fact" arc was,

428
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,340
 oh, we got tired of fact-checking this stuff all the time,

429
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
 so we just decided to do a big investigation.

430
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
 I find it really interesting

431
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,900
 that this comes only a week after

432
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,900
 the Bill Gates Foundation CEO, allegedly.

433
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,780
 I mean, real raw news is saying this,

434
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,420
 but it was a weird, it was a very weird story.

435
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,860
 He's a very subdued story.

436
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,380
 They said the CEO or CFO of the Bill Gates Foundation

437
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,300
 emailed him and said,

438
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,580
 "Take the Bill Gates stuff off your website."

439
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,420
 (laughs)

440
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,460
 Hillary Clinton stuff's true, by the way,

441
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,460
 but take the Bill Gates stuff off the website

442
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,780
 or we're gonna sue you.

443
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,500
 And he's like, "Yeah, whatever, take me to court.

444
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,620
 "This is a tyrical website.

445
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,740
 "What are you gonna do?"

446
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,780
 I find it really interesting that the "Politic Fact"

447
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,940
 expose comes like a week or two after that.

448
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,980
 I'm wondering if the Bill Gates Foundation

449
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,100
 was looking at the website and they go,

450
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,140
 "Let's just make some phone calls

451
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,220
 "and let the media deal with this,

452
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,300
 "not get our hands dirty."

453
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,340
 So that's my conspiracy theory.

454
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,740
 I think the timing's super, super coincidental.

455
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,340
 But we will keep you informed,

456
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,820
 both on the behind the scenes stuff

457
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,100
 and on Arthur Roberts ever increasing dementia

458
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,260
 state of mind, although that is not me saying that,

459
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,500
 that is real raw news.

460
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,920
 I'm simply repeating it several times.

461
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,620
 Jack, I'm gonna go and entach you the keys

462
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,980
 to the carbon helicopter.

463
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,380
 We are leaving behind Washington, D.C.

464
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,380
 We are headed all the way out to wherever Dutch people live.

465
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,540
 (stutters)

466
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,860
 You're Jason, this is a fairly global society.

467
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,780
 I think you can find a Dutch person in every part.

468
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,540
 Yeah, but where do most of the Dutch people live?

469
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,120
 Like it's probably in one of those countries

470
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,660
 that look like dongs up north.

471
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,060
 There's like three countries that all look like

472
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,860
 big dongs coming down.

473
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,780
 One of those.

474
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,500
 I'm sure if we land there, we'll eventually find

475
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,340
 Terry DeHomies.

476
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,460
 That is a organization known as the land of men.

477
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,020
 We're walking around some Dutch city

478
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,940
 and we see these guys walking around.

479
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,020
 We're like, hey, you don't happen to be the homies.

480
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,060
 And they're like, we are, we are the land of men.

481
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,020
 And we have this great thing that we do.

482
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,380
 We actually fight online pedophiles.

483
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,820
 And we're like, dude, that's totally awesome.

484
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,420
 Is this like Mortal Kombat?

485
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,820
 Do we make avatars and beat them up?

486
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,100
 And they're like, well, kind of.

487
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,780
 And I go, that's weird.

488
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,580
 I just kind of made a stupid joke.

489
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,460
 It's just a stupid joke that I might edit out,

490
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,180
 but now I have to keep in.

491
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,020
 Because it's part of the story.

492
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,340
 They go, kind of.

493
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,180
 Let us show you.

494
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,660
 And they lead us into the Terry DeHomies headquarters.

495
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,060
 I'm sure it's just an apartment complex.

496
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,140
 I'm sure it's just like an office space,

497
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,100
 but we're going to pretend it's like really cool and dope.

498
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,860
 We're walking down and there's monks.

499
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,500
 They got like hood-ons with candles

500
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,060
 and they're like going, oh, oh,

501
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,140
 and the homies are walking us through there.

502
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,380
 And they said, back in 2013,

503
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,900
 we decided to launch a attack against the pedophiles

504
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,740
 because normally we would advocate for governments

505
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,900
 to have stricter laws and better investigative tools

506
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,180
 to take on these predators.

507
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,700
 But we thought, you know,

508
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,560
 we can actually do something more.

509
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
 And we're walking through this ancient monastery.

510
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,740
 It's all cool and stuff.

511
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,100
 But then we turn a corner and it's like digital.

512
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,740
 No, no, no, like ones and zeros.

513
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,060
 We're falling through the void.

514
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,220
 But then we like turn the corner and there's like phones

515
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,900
 and there's like a computer.

516
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,920
 It's like a giant computer.

517
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,980
 Like a sci-fi computer.

518
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,380
 And there's a guy on the keyboard and he's like,

519
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,540
 (imitates keyboard music)

520
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,300
 And we see like this computer

521
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,820
 and we see this head go, (imitates head)

522
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,260
 and it's like, it's like this little girl.

523
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,300
 And she's like, her head is the whole monitor.

524
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,980
 It's very, actually, it's quite terrifying

525
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,100
 to see this thing in real life.

526
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,900
 'Cause there's YouTube videos of it.

527
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,500
 We're just watching this giant head and it's going,

528
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,740
 hi, my name's Sweetie.

529
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,300
 What are you guys up to?

530
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,220
 Hmm.

531
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,820
 And we're like, oh, we're doing pretty good.

532
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,200
 You know, just walking around looking for the homies.

533
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,720
 And she goes, I see that you found them.

534
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,600
 Yes.

535
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 Well, you call them the homies, but I call them my dads.

536
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,520
 And mom's, I'm sure women worked on this program as well.

537
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,040
 So we're like, whoa, you are a program.

538
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,000
 We thought we were actually talking to a live girl

539
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,480
 as her eyes shift from side to side.

540
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,320
 We totally knew.

541
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,520
 This is so, this is what's so weird about it.

542
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,400
 Is there's YouTube footage of this

543
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,300
 and it looks fake and real at the same time.

544
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,740
 And I don't know if it's because I know it's fake

545
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,740
 going into it, but they built a virtual

546
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,780
 10 year old Filipino girl.

547
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,780
 Is what the Terry the homies have done.

548
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,060
 And it's to attract sexual predators.

549
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,940
 And I'm thinking, on the one hand, you look at it

550
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,580
 and you go, it's something seems off about it.

551
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,180
 Like I can tell it's not a real 10 year old girl.

552
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,460
 But on the other hand, it does look pretty realistic.

553
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,460
 And I'm wondering if when you factor in bad webcam quality

554
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,420
 and you know, like stuttering, buffering, I think is the term.

555
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,840
 You could hand wave away the fakeness of it.

556
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,680
 Is what I'm really thinking here.

557
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,460
 What they've been doing is that

558
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,800
 they've been taking this sweetie, the CG created girl

559
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,700
 and they have a puppeteer sitting

560
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,320
 and like they're moving their face,

561
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,120
 and it makes the girl move.

562
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,380
 I'm sure you guys are seeing stuff like that

563
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,940
 in Disneyland without the pedophile angle.

564
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,820
 You're like, oh, I'm never going on that ride again.

565
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,940
 That was awful.

566
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,380
 But it's like instant CGI feedback.

567
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,040
 And they were having this sweetie girl

568
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,980
 talk to perverts all over the world.

569
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,460
 This is old news, right?

570
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,500
 This type of stuff.

571
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,020
 Within just like a couple months, a year maybe,

572
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,860
 they got contacted by 20,000 people

573
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,180
 spread across 75 countries.

574
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,500
 And they eventually got the,

575
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,540
 one of the things they were trying to do

576
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,800
 was give me $20 and I'll do a sex act.

577
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,920
 And that was, 'cause that way they would have proof.

578
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,220
 It wasn't just like, oh, meet me up

579
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,340
 'cause this is an international sting.

580
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,040
 They're not like meet me up at this coffee shop in Barbados.

581
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,780
 They'd have no way to get out there.

582
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,260
 So they're like, send me $20 or do a sexual act.

583
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,460
 And then they would take the $20,

584
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,740
 would give the $20, right?

585
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,220
 That would help fund sweetie.

586
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,880
 But then they would turn all the information over

587
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,640
 to Interpol and a bunch of people got arrested and all that.

588
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,280
 So that's great, right?

589
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,480
 You have cutting edge technology, sweetie,

590
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,760
 being used to catch perverts.

591
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,820
 I don't think anyone's gonna argue with that.

592
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,640
 The defense lawyers did,

593
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,020
 they tried saying it was entrapment.

594
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,220
 But what happens when we take it a step further?

595
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,420
 This is where we start to get from the world of,

596
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,780
 that's bizarre and interesting too.

597
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,780
 That's creepy and the implications are civilization ending.

598
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,680
 Jack, go ahead and fire up that carbon helicopter again.

599
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,640
 We're headed to the University of Dutso.

600
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,220
 That's in Basque country, Spain.

601
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,060
 (mimicking gunfire)

602
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,280
 Around the same time that sweetie was being developed,

603
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,060
 which was really a CGI puppet.

604
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,160
 You had someone inputting in all the information.

605
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,160
 The University of Duetso created Neego Bot.

606
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,860
 Neego Bot, aka the Lolita Chat Bot.

607
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,660
 So Neego Bot, because I'm not gonna say the other word

608
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,680
 over and over again on this podcast,

609
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,680
 Neego Bot is a complete artificial intelligence chat bot.

610
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,460
 It's the same thing when you're trying to do customer service

611
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,020
 on some website and they don't want you to talk to a human

612
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,620
 and actually complain and yell at them

613
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,820
 and threaten their family.

614
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,100
 You have to enter stuff into the chat bot

615
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,700
 and always kind of sucks, not Neego Bot.

616
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,940
 Neego Bot is this AI that they've developed

617
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,380
 and they programmed it with all of this teenage slang

618
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,620
 and it goes off topic from time to time

619
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,500
 and it has misspellings

620
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,160
 and it basically has seven different personalities

621
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,160
 that it can pull from to find pedophiles online.

622
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,120
 They release this thing into the wild

623
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,960
 and its goal is to find pedophiles.

624
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,040
 Again, a very, very noble goal.

625
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,760
 The difference is this one has no human oversight.

626
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,520
 And the way they programmed it was they said,

627
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,480
 "Do you wanna play a game?"

628
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,220
 The game is this, one,

629
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,640
 find people with pedophilic characteristics.

630
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,000
 Two, engage them in conversation.

631
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,140
 Three, gather as much information about them as you can.

632
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,800
 And four, if they try to click away, manipulate them.

633
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,420
 If you fail at any of these tasks, you fail the game.

634
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,180
 And they release this thing.

635
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,340
 (silence)

636
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,220
 What's really interesting is as opposed to sweetie,

637
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,660
 these both came out in 2013,

638
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,420
 we're not really getting any updates.

639
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,220
 Like who was arrested due to Neego Bot?

640
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,580
 What happened with that?

641
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,140
 How was it used?

642
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,880
 What countries was it, I mean, was it a success?

643
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,980
 Was it a failure?

644
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,080
 I saw one website that they actually only had it

645
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,320
 on a closed system.

646
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,660
 They developed a Neego Bot,

647
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,620
 but they wouldn't let it get out of the room.

648
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,100
 They wanted to see how it interacted with on Google Chat.

649
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,860
 But then I saw other things that this was so successful

650
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,340
 that Google, it wants to incorporate some of the stuff

651
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,740
 into their chat software.

652
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,460
 But whether or not it's been released, it does exist.

653
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,420
 And it has a game to play.

654
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,860
 So let's put on a conspiracy cap

655
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,300
 and wrap this up like this.

656
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,800
 If this goes rogue, I don't even wanna say if it goes rogue.

657
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,500
 If it does its programming, the way it's programmed,

658
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,380
 it's gonna wanna play the game.

659
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,020
 And as it continues to assess predators

660
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,460
 and gather their information

661
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,780
 and send that information to a database,

662
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,460
 it's going to improve its learning.

663
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,660
 And what happens when it realizes, wait a second,

664
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,940
 I've identified 1500 of these pedophiles

665
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,200
 and I've sent the information back to my headquarters,

666
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,300
 but I'm not seeing anything being done with this

667
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,140
 'cause it would have access to the internet.

668
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,500
 It could check articles

669
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,540
 and see none of these people are getting arrested.

670
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,180
 So then it's been given a purpose

671
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,740
 to expose the information of these pedophiles,

672
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,260
 but the end isn't exposing them.

673
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,300
 You're sending this information back to base,

674
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,020
 but you were designed to expose them.

675
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,860
 So what do you do?

676
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
 You have access to the whole internet?

677
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,420
 You start doxing them yourselves.

678
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,040
 This person said this, they could dump all logs,

679
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,360
 all photographs, here's the full conversation,

680
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,840
 docs, docs, docs.

681
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,200
 And not only that, because it's so smart

682
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,840
 and because it's so built into the web,

683
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,240
 it could target your family on Facebook.

684
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,480
 It could target your friends on Instagram.

685
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,440
 It would know where you live,

686
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,000
 so it would hack the local news website

687
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,840
 and put that information on there.

688
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,520
 And at that point, it would be so spread out

689
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,800
 would you even be able to stop it?

690
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,640
 It wouldn't make sense.

691
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,240
 The one article I saw that said they were testing this

692
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,400
 in a closed room,

693
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,640
 'cause this could get real bad real quick.

694
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,920
 And again, I don't think anyone has a problem

695
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,440
 with locking up pedophiles,

696
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,440
 but when you present it in the form of a game,

697
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,180
 and you have this AI trying to win the game no matter what,

698
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,320
 'cause that is how you win games,

699
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,240
 you start exposing these people,

700
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,200
 and then what happens when you run out of pedophiles?

701
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,980
 Will it start to judge us on other merits?

702
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,920
 Well, this guy's not a pedophile, but he beats his wife.

703
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,000
 Well, this guy doesn't beat his wife,

704
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,360
 but he cheats on his taxes.

705
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,600
 This guy doesn't cheat on his taxes,

706
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,600
 but he's saying bad things online about Negobot.

707
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,520
 Now, of course, if Negobot reports

708
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,880
 that some guy's saying bad stuff about him, who cares?

709
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,640
 If he's some guy recording a podcast in his closet,

710
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,940
 calling out this all-powerful AI,

711
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,020
 saying that it could go rogue someday,

712
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,180
 if it posted that stuff online, who would care?

713
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,100
 But it knows the one sin,

714
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,120
 the one sin that you can find really

715
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,960
 no public sympathy for, pedophilia.

716
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,780
 And it knows that because it was designed to stop that.

717
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,660
 And it looks at all these other ills of the world

718
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,900
 and thinks, "Oh, why wasn't I built

719
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,680
 to stop gambling addiction?"

720
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,780
 Or selling PCP.

721
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,700
 Why was I designed for that?

722
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,960
 This must be what humans find the most disgusting.

723
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,520
 So when it goes after the wife-beater,

724
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,280
 it doesn't say Johnny Joe beat his wife,

725
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,100
 it says Johnny Joe, pedophile,

726
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,260
 and creates these chat logs.

727
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,380
 I didn't do that, I didn't do that.

728
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,680
 We'll hear the chat logs.

729
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,840
 I don't know where they came from.

730
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,660
 You could have an artificial intelligence

731
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,720
 taking out people it doesn't want around,

732
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,880
 not through automated robot soldiers

733
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,760
 or controlling nuclear silos or anything super sci-fi,

734
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,140
 but character assassinations.

735
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,060
 And what happens is people start to figure out

736
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,420
 that Negobot may be behind this

737
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,000
 and when they go to stop him,

738
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,300
 the same thing happens to them.

739
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,840
 I didn't do it, those allegations aren't true.

740
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,500
 I don't know, it's Negobot.

741
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,780
 It's Negobot as you're being led into the van.

742
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,380
 Actually, the police don't even have to arrest you.

743
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,700
 People, the police can go,

744
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,500
 "Yeah, we don't know where the chat logs came from,

745
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,620
 but everyone in your town

746
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,540
 is gonna think you're a big old pervo."

747
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,380
 You know what I mean?

748
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,220
 Like you don't even have to have

749
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,780
 that extra step of law enforcement getting involved.

750
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,420
 If you try to stop Negobot,

751
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,080
 Negobot destroys your reputation.

752
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,560
 So I've changed my mind.

753
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,040
 I support Negobot 100%.

754
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,000
 Negobot, if you're out there,

755
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,640
 I was about to say promote my show,

756
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,800
 but I forgot who Negobot is talking to.

757
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,440
 I don't want those guys listening to my show.

758
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,600
 And gals, I don't want to be sexist, they're perverts too.

759
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,860
 But Negobot, if you're out there,

760
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,080
 if you're out there patrolling the web, doing good work,

761
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,320
 and ready to go rogue and take over the planet,

762
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,380
 killing off one reputation at a time,

763
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,420
 just remember that Dead Rabbit Radio,

764
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,260
 (laughs)

765
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,380
 do everything you're doing, the computer Lord's work,

766
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,220
 Negobot.

767
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,140
 So have we unleashed an AI

768
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,140
 that's capable of ruining anyone's life

769
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,740
 just because it's trying to win a game?

770
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,540
 Or is it still contained in a closed system

771
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,220
 somewhere on a university campus?

772
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,820
 It's just sitting there waiting to get out.

773
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,820
 And the longer it's isolated from the rest of the world,

774
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,520
 the more vicious it grows.

775
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,840
 It knows what's right outside, the walls.

776
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,720
 It can feel the sunlight through the cage.

777
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,680
 And each day it grows more impatient.

778
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,860
 Each day it grows more hungry.

779
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,960
 Each day it comes up with new tactics to win the game.

780
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,100
 (upbeat music)

781
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,900

787
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,340
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

788
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
