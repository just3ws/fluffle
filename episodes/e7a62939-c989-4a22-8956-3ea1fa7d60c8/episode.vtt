WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.560
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.600
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.680
 Here I am.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.720
 Rocking me like a hurricane.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.560
 Is that not the song?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.400
 Wait, no, I'm sorry.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.320
 This is supposed to be somber.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.160
 (humming)

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.920
 That's Enya music playing.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.180
 (humming)

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.720
 Enya's sitting in the darkness.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.440
 We're in the pitch darkness of Dead Rabbit Command.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.880
 I have a special announcement for all of you.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.640
 I wasn't originally gonna include this

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.880
 on the opening of an episode,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.680
 but it was kind of bringing the mood down for the episode.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 I knew this was gonna happen,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.200
 and I've been predicting it for hundreds of episodes

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.600
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.440
 We're sitting in a pitch black room in Dead Rabbit Command,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.880
 and there's like a lump in the middle of the room.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.080
 And you're sitting on it, I'm like,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.000
 no, no, get off that lump.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.120
 It's sacred, it's sacred.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.040
 Come sit by me.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.120
 I knew this was gonna happen.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.640
 The YouTube channel is done.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.320
 Dead Rabbit Radio YouTube channel is absolutely done.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.960
 I'm including this as a separate feature,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.040
 'cause some people wanna know this,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 and I think it's important to know

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.080
 for just the future of conspiracy content

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.440
 and paranormal content on YouTube.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.360
 But if you don't wanna know about it

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.560
 and you just wanna hear goofy stories,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.720
 I totally respect that.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.480
 What is going on was last Sunday,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.680
 I was just, I don't remember what the episode was,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.600
 and I got hit with a content warning

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.800
 for an episode I did 200 episodes ago.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.080
 I got hit with promoting harmful or misleading information.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.360
 You know, I was like, what could possibly, what was it?

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.800
 It was nothing I said.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.440
 I included a link into YouTube,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.760
 'cause I included my show notes

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.400
 because I think when you make crazy,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.880
 it would be really easy for me to say,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.720
 you won't believe what this guy over here says

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.920
 and just make a bunch of stuff up.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.320
 And I'm lambasting this guy,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.560
 I'm lambasting this person who says they're a super soldier

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.000
 or whatever, some stupid belief,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.600
 or just making it about a whole cloth,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.960
 and you'd be like, oh, that is crazy,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.120
 and there's no way to check my work.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.680
 And it's also important because I considered this

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.600
 paranormal research for other people

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.200
 to continue from the research.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.800
 So I include the show notes.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.000
 It was the episode about Civil War of the Worlds.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.040
 It was the episode, this guy had a website,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.560
 it was a Civil War fan website,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.240
 and he had an April Fool's article

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.320
 about space aliens invading during the Civil War.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.560
 And I covered it 'cause I was like,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.360
 what, I've never heard of this story before.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.560
 Mysterious Universe covered it.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.080
 I covered it off of them.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.880
 And then it turns out that it was an April Fool's joke,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.320
 which made the story even better.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.080
 And I got to talk to the author of the article.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.960
 It was a great way to end the whole saga.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.000
 But now we are 200 episodes later,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 and which is 40 weeks, which is almost a year later.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.680
 And I get hit with promoting

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.320
 harmful or misleading information.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.120
 And I thought, what, in the world?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.520
 I thought, one, Tarnation?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.080
 I turned into a cartoon character?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.520
 Yo, Sam and Sam says that right now.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.840
 I don't know, has nothing to do with the somber mood.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.480
 The point is, is that I filed an appeal.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.200
 I got that warning last week to say,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.400
 hey, this is content warning,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.720
 you're promoting this stuff, I filed an appeal.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.840
 And I was kind of flabbergasted.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.800
 I guess I am a cartoon character.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.560
 I'm flabbergasted.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.400
 I said, hey, it's just, you know, I covered the story.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.440
 It's in the show notes.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.640
 I go, it's an April Fool's joke.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.280
 Like, sure it didn't really happen,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280
 but it's an April Fool's joke.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.680
 But I found that, my thing was that 90% of the stuff

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.320
 that we covered could be considered harmful

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.280
 or misleading in some way.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.800
 Someone goes, Ghost don't exist.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.240
 It's very misleading that this guy's talking about ghosts exist.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.760
 He labeled this as a cult.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.600
 That's not a cult.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.960
 It's just 12 people who hang in a barn

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.040
 who just like murdering people.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.960
 That's not a cult though.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.960
 Don't, don't infer they're a cult.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.440
 You can call them, call them a bunch of killers.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.160
 You, that's harmful to that religion.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.280
 So you could do that with pretty much everything

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.440
 we talk about on this show.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.520
 It's harmful or it's misleading.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.920
 I was like, okay, this must be some sort of glitch.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.880
 I filed the appeal and then one week later,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.960
 exactly one week later,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.360
 I just recorded and uploaded yesterday's episode,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.320
 which would have been the Orangevale episode,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.720
 which I really enjoyed.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.600
 It was a slog, I recorded an episode, had to re-record it.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.000
 I recorded the Orangevale episode

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.160
 and at the end of it was the episode,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.400
 the segment about the man who built a hidey hole

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.280
 in a men's restroom and he stuck his head

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.440
 underneath the urinal and people were peeing on him.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.920
 Now I got, the first one was a warning

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.200
 because of that story, I got another content strike.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.240
 But it wasn't because of what I said.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.960
 It was because of the link to the Vice News article,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.880
 which was listed as nudity or sexual is what it said.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.640
 And I thought, well, listen,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.080
 the person who's flagging on YouTube

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.120
 might really find it sexy when people get peed on.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.400
 There's definitely no nudity in there.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.920
 And if you read the article,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.200
 there is no explicit, like,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.720
 oh, he must have been doing this and this

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.280
 and it must have felt this good.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.600
 It's a guy telling a story to the reporter.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.040
 It's very like, hey, you won't believe what happened.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.240
 I worked at a pub and pretty much the same narrative

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.080
 I told you.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 So it's nothing I'm saying, it's my links.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.800
 But at this point, I cannot upload or comment

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.840
 or post anything, live stream or anything to YouTube

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.960
 for the next week.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.200
 So I'm done.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.080
 Because I'm not gonna, I tried for the past couple of episodes

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.520
 if you look at YouTube, I started going into the document

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.960
 and making it so goes, if you wanna see the show notes,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.080
 go to this page on my DeadRabbit.com website.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.160
 I'm gonna show you the show notes for that episode.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.000
 I started doing that, but this one happened within 10 minutes.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.120
 This one happened before, before I could,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.000
 and I didn't think it was gonna happen,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.960
 but within 10 minutes of me uploading the episode,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.200
 I got a content strike.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.520
 The fact of the matter is, if I'm getting hit for a website

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.600
 that I posted 200 episodes ago,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.640
 there's 642 time bombs out there on my channel

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.120
 that the algorithm or someone at YouTube

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.060
 is personally going through and going harmful, misleading.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.520
 So I'm not going to play that game.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.080
 I am making a decision to stop uploading to YouTube.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.560
 The YouTube episodes are going to end at 642

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.400
 and we're gonna go ahead and other 600, 800,000 episodes.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.720
 They're not gonna be available on YouTube.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.880
 I am making the decision that I'm,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.560
 the main reason, 'cause I could basically

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.520
 just burn it to the ground and just keep putting out

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.080
 content until it gets copyrighted,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.880
 striked into existence or content striked into existence.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.040
 I could do that.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.960
 I kind of like the fact that I have a platform for,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.780
 I can hit a button and I can start live streaming

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.140
 to a channel where I have a bunch of subscribers.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.940
 I'm still thinking in the future,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.420
 I may live stream to advertise for the podcast,

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.900
 maybe once a month pop in and go,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.100
 "Hey, this is what you guys have been missing

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.540
 "if you haven't been watching the podcast."

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.500
 I might do that.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.060
 I don't know.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.060
 I like having the opportunity of live streaming,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.940
 definitely like the opportunity of live streaming,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.900
 but I have to kind of weigh the pros and the cons of that,

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.320
 but I definitely know new content on DeadRabbit Radio,

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.480
 outside maybe live stream,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.120
 and really that will only exist until I figure out a way

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.680
 that I can make a Twitch thing.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.760
 What do you kids call that?

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.600
 A Twitch account?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600
 No, I have a Twitch account,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.480
 but until I can know that if I hit a button

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.920
 that you guys will be notified.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.960
 'Cause a lot of you guys would jump,

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.280
 when I start a live stream,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.720
 I'd get 40 people watching right away,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.280
 which was really good on YouTube.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.200
 So I wanna keep it for that

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.000
 and I can advertise the show as that

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.960
 and all the content and all the community

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.380
 that we've built, all those comments,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.860
 all that interaction I've had with you guys.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.180
 If I just nuke the channel,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.940
 if I just start keep putting the stuff out

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.020
 and don't let this get,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.100
 and even if they resolve this in my favor,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.540
 I'm still, I'm done, I'm still done.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.620
 I total, 'cause they're both still in appeal.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.580
 Both of these things are both still in appeal.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.540
 The first one, I go,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.020
 "Dude, you didn't even let the first appeal play out."

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.340
 And I'm getting hit with this other one.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.060
 I go, "It's a vice.com article.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.460
 There's nothing sexual about it.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.700
 There's nothing nude about it."

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.520
 And then, you know, but I do think it's fitting.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.080
 I thought it was funny as when I saw that that happened,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.400
 I thought, "Great, the last episode

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.160
 that I post on YouTube is the episode where I say,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.200
 "You know, it'd be really cool

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.120
 if everyone could just forget their differences

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.800
 and it, or not forget their differences,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.960
 but acknowledge their differences,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.560
 but work towards a better and brighter future for everybody."

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.520
 I said, "It's a very childish way of looking at the world,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.960
 but it's something I've never grown out of.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.880
 I think eventually we can all work together

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.800
 as one human race and still have our differences."

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.120
 YouTube's like, "Nope.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.060
 Nope, this is the type of content this guy's putting out.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.140
 Let's hit him with this nudity strike a week

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:48.980
 after his first one.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.120
 We're not gonna let this appeal process play out.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.440
 We're not gonna let him upload for a week."

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.900
 YouTube's like, "Nah, we don't want this content on here.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.740
 We don't want this stuff.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.080
 We don't want someone disputing conspiracy theories."

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.900
 Nah, nah, we want six hour videos on flat earth.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.860
 You know, to be, okay, that's not fair.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.700
 That's not fair.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.400
 I don't wanna have a persecution complex.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.360
 My actual fear about this isn't so fine.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.560
 I'd been predicting this for years.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560
 I've had backup plans.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.400
 I mean, I thought, you know, we'll eventually move to Twitch.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.760
 I knew YouTube was pretty shaky.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.560
 I've been saying it for a long time.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.400
 I'm showing people are saying,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.560
 "You're paranoid, you're paranoid."

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.400
 My concern is that I am, and I think,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.840
 I hit the appeal button a week ago and haven't heard back.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.000
 I bet you they're doing this everywhere.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.860
 And I bet you they're getting hit with tons of appeals.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.220
 And I think a lot of channels are gonna get shut down.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.560
 I think a lot of channels doing stuff like this.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.560
 But they're coming for Windy Goon.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.520
 They're coming for all of this content.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.280
 They're coming for that chapter.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.760
 They're coming for Nexpo.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.880
 I think they're really gonna start just sweeping

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.680
 all of this stuff up.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.960
 I'm not going to bit shoot.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.960
 I don't think that that's the right format.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.640
 Also, it's extra work.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.800
 YouTube, I just hit a button

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.400
 and it automatically uploaded to YouTube

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.240
 with a static image.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.980
 Bit shoot, I'd have to do video processing again,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.320
 like I did in the early days.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.120
 So I think that this is a harbinger for things to come.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.360
 I think that,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.440
 and I knew it was gonna happen.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.440
 I 100% knew it was gonna happen when I saw,

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.280
 and I would joke about it.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.200
 I go, that's why Hans Worm Hats channels

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.400
 are getting shut down all the time.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.960
 Even though I talk about stuff in a way that I'm like,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.120
 I don't believe this, it doesn't make sense.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.080
 The algorithm I knew would eventually start

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.280
 to just realize,

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.600
 thinking that I was part of the conspiracy promoters.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.120
 And there's some, you know, like,

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.960
 even the stuff right at me,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.280
 let's put on our conspiracy caps.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.560
 Let's look at it this way.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.860
 I knew that it was coming.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.260
 I knew that it was coming.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.680
 So we are sitting in a dark and dead rabbit command,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.160
 and I throw a torch.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.400
 I was holding the torch this whole time.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.760
 You didn't know, you're sitting right next to me.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.600
 You had a torch in your face.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.760
 You're like, ah, I throw the torch onto the lump

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760
 in the middle of the room.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.320
 And it is the YouTube channel in effigy.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.200
 (sizzling)

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.840
 And it's burning, and we're just standing there

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.240
 and your music playing.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.720
 (singing)

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.160
 So it's just, what did I just say?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.400
 It's burning, it's still burning.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400
 We're just standing there.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.060
 I forgot we're doing this indoors.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.140
 Smoking elation.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.020
 We go outside of Dead Rabbit Command.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.380
 We're looking through a window

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.380
 as we're watching the YouTube channel burn.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.620
 I'm no longer upload.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.660
 No longer gonna upload on YouTube.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.340
 Keep it around for the live streams.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.380
 I think it would be really cool to figure out a way.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.100
 I couldn't do it weekly 'cause it's too much work,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.620
 but figure out a way that we could all get together

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.580
 and talk on you.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.420
 I don't know.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.260
 I don't know.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.100
 I don't know.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.140
 But we're just gonna stop posting new content on there.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.300
 And also if you do listen to the show,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.540
 obviously you're hearing this.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.120
 There's a lot of people who listen to it on YouTube

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.220
 who don't know what's going on.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.260
 They're gonna spend a whole week going like, what?

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.100
 So if you do happen to see them online or in real life,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.240
 you have a buddy who just always watches YouTube

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.240
 and be like, hey, Jason is now primarily only

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.760
 on podcast channels and DeadRabbit.com.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.040
 So that's how you will be able to listen to him

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.000
 from now on.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.260
 Fire is burning.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.360
 It's just the end of a chapter.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.280
 It's not the end of the show.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.760
 It is something that I expected.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.800
 If I can figure out a way to alert everyone

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.380
 when I'm doing a Twitch livestream,

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.460
 we will just do that as well because I just don't want,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.740
 right now I'm having to download as much content as I can

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.700
 'cause for all I know the channel's gone

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.220
 while I've been recording this.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.540
 I could be racking up strikes from past content.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.260
 So we're just doing that.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.780
 But yeah, I'd be not, I'm not gonna do bit shoot.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.780
 But yeah, maybe we'll see about Twitch

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.060
 and I got some other tricks up my sleeve.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.140
 Some other tricks up my sleeve.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.940
 But the show is not going anywhere.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.280
 The podcast is completely safe.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.320
 Spotify doesn't work like a certain episode of mine.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.480
 But that's fair.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.320
 You know, the same thing, YouTube is a private,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.160
 it's a private business.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.680
 If they wanna get rid of all conspiracy

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.880
 and all paranormal content and all true crime content

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.320
 and clear it up and just have makeup channels,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.600
 so that's their right.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.640
 That's their right to do that.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.200
 But we will not be a part of that anymore.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.200
 To all the friends that I made on YouTube,

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.240
 you guys are still around.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.480
 You guys are still gonna be able to talk

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.640
 and I'd like to figure out a way that we could still meet up

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.640
 and that's why we may still do a livestream every now

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.560
 and then.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.780
 But that, we will decide on later.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.800
 So let the Inya Music play us out

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.140
 and I'll have an episode coming out in a couple hours, guys.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:10.980
 I love you.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.640
 Thanks for sticking around and I will see you soon.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.820
