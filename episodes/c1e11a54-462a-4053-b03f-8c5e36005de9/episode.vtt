 Get a book from the 18th century, lead to dozens, if not hundreds, of deaths.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.080
 And then we travel to California, where one night a young girl answered the door and the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.040
 unthinkable happened.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.160
 There were no clues to her death until her ghostly image appeared on a nearby billboard

00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:19.480
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.320
 So let's see how it goes.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.200
 Now, what I really want to get to is this really interesting story.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.560
 So as I'm going down this internet rabbit hole, I was researching the Golden Gate Bridge

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 because I was researching Ghosts of San Francisco for an upcoming episode.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:55.320
 We started talking about the suicides on the Golden Gate Bridge, and then I started doing

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:10.400
 it.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.000
 I've told people before, I've talked to people who are kind of at the end of their rope, and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.400
 they're like, "I'm gonna end it, man.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 I'm gonna do it."

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.560
 And I always tell them this.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.040
 I have a couple different tools for talking people out of suicide.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.040
 Who knows how effective?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.240
 I know it's been effective for me because they haven't killed themselves, but one of

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.120
 the things I've talked to people and I said, "It's a contagious disease."

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.440
 When we look at families, when somebody in the family kills themselves, it's usually

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.920
 not isolated.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.240
 Daughter kills herself, uncle kills themselves, brother kills himself, brother kills himself.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.240
 You know, it's something like that.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.320
 It's a contagious disease.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.440
 The reason why I've discovered that is because of stuff like suicide contagion.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.560
 There's a town, I think it's in Scotland or Ireland called Bridgend, and there was a

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.720
 documentary made about this town, and they had this cluster, suicide clustering, and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.160
 all the young people, or a bunch of young people in town, killing themselves.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.640
 As the documentary is being made, one of the guys being interviewed for the documentary

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.640
 kills himself.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.640
 Now, it doesn't do it during the interview.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.160
 The guy's not like, "Hey, so tell us a little bit about your friends."

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160
 And he's like, "Yeah, sure.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.640
 Let me get this chair set up first."

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.440
 And the guy's just filming it.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.400
 But through the creation of the documentary, the guy killed himself.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400
 Now there's been debate about the documentary.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.520
 Some people say that it's sensationalized and so on and so forth, but you do have these

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.520
 things, suicide clusters, suicide contagion.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.720
 And as I'm reading about this stuff, and again it's fairly depressing, as I'm reading about

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.800
 this stuff, I came across this story, and it's actually, suicide contagion has another name.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.400
 It's called the Werther Effect.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.080
 I thought this was fascinating stuff.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080
 Fascinating.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080
 Let me tell you this story.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.920
 I haven't read this book.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.200
 I'm sure a lot of you have.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.200
 Let's go back in time to year 1774.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.160
 I tricked you there.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.240
 You thought I was going to say 1777.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.800
 I was just looking at my notes wrong.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.800
 1774.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.240
 Let's hop in the carbon helicopter.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240
 And now we're back.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.760
 It's provincial Germany, I believe.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.200
 So a bunch of little thatched huts with Belle.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200
 Was that her name?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200
 Belle?

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.800
 Right, Belle from Beauty and the Beast is walking around.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.880
 And you know, she would have been okay if she ended up with Gaston.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.880
 She really would.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.120
 I think they would have made it work out.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.600
 I know a lot of Belle's who ended up with Gaston's in real life, it works out.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.160
 He was a cad, but he didn't deserve to die.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.720
 He didn't go that extra level.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.520
 He wasn't trying to really hurt anybody.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.000
 He was trying to bed this beautiful woman.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.680
 He would have been better off with those blondes anyways, but he wanted to marry this

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.400
 beautiful woman and then he found out that a monster kept her prisoner, which was really

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.120
 going on and he gets the townspeople to rescue her, which she really was a prisoner.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.320
 He didn't know she had fallen in love with this monster and he falls to his death.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.600
 I think he's probably one of the most tragic Disney villains.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.800
 He is a cad, but it wasn't like he was like broken or house one night was like trying

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.400
 to rape her and then she ran and got kidnapped by the beast or nothing like that.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.240
 He was just an idiot who wanted the best chicken town, i.e. me.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.080
 So I have a lot of sympathy for Gaston.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.320
 They might have retconned him in the live action movie where they made him more evil,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.800
 but I didn't watch that garbage.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.640
 And you're just looking at me as I'm watching about beating the beast as I'm trying to navigate,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.000
 trying to land this helicopter in this German village.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.320
 You're like dude, you just landed on all those sheep and I was like add another thing.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.160
 That little dude who was sitting here like, "Oh, did you jump out of the helicopter before

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160
 we even landed?"

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:52.240
 It's 1774 and there's a young German author named Johann Wolfgang von Goeth.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.280
 Goeth I think is how you pronounce it.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.520
 It's spelled goh the, but I'm pretty sure it's not goh the.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.880
 We'll call him Goeth.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.480
 And this dude, Goeth is writing this book.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.680
 That's what it sounded like back then when you wrote.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.680
 It sounded like Ants marching.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.480
 It sounded like Dave Matthews' band song.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.120
 That song was playing every time you wrote something.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.600
 That's why there's not a lot of literature from back then.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600
 It's not true.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.600
 There's a ton of it.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.840
 So anyways, he's writing this book.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.760
 Goeth is writing this book, The Sorrows of Young Werther.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.880
 So here's the story, dude.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.400
 There's this dude named Werther, right?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.880
 He's like Werther's original.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.120
 That's where they got that name from.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.760
 That delicious hard caramel.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.560
 Let's put one in our mouth for the rest of this adventure.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.520
 This delicious hard caramel is named after this lovable young scamp Werther.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.400
 So he's chilling in this town in Germany, right?

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.520
 And he meets this beautiful woman named Charlotte.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.360
 And he's like, "Oh, dude."

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.480
 He's like, "Hey, Shar, what's up?"

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.960
 And she's like, "Ooh, what's your name?"

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.120
 And he's like, "I'm Werther.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.480
 Here, have a caramel candy."

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.000
 So she bites down on it and breaks a bunch of her teeth.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.640
 And he's like, "No, you're supposed to suck it."

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.640
 So he gives her another one.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.000
 Anyway, so he's hanging out with Charlotte.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.280
 Now, Charlotte is about to be married to this older man named Albert.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.080
 And Werther's totally in love with this chick, though, right?

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.880
 And Albert's just kind of like, "Hey, Werther, what's up?"

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.880
 They all start hanging out together.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.840
 So he actually moves in with them.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.920
 So Werther is chilling there and then you have Charlotte, the love of his life, the

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.000
 only woman he's ever wanted to be with.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And then Albert is just kind of walking around.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 And you know, living there too.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.240
 He didn't just walk by the house.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.440
 He's like, "Hey, that's my house."

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.080
 And I'm just walking by.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:41.160
 So anyways, he's totally like just like, "Oh my God, like this, their torment in my heart

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160
 is killing me.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.160
 I'm in love with this woman.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.560
 She's with this other guy and they're going to get married.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.920
 But maybe I can woo her.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.760
 Maybe something will work out here.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.320
 Maybe somehow against all odds we can do this."

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.520
 And then he's like, "No, I can't.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.040
 I have to leave."

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.440
 Like, yeah, we're really good friends, but I got to leave.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.520
 So he bounces out and for a couple of months he goes to this other town.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.920
 Now I'm reading all of this from Wikipedia because I'm going down this suicide rabbit

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920
 hole.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.640
 So I could be totally off of major details.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.640
 You could be like, "No way.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.280
 Albert was a bricklayer and that was symbolic of him like putting bricks on stuff."

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280
 Yeah, yeah, maybe.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.520
 I'm just reading the Wikipedia thing.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.760
 So anyways, here is a, I don't understand this.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.800
 This makes me think it's a different novel, an awesome novel.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.480
 This is, he goes to the other town and there's this sentence in Wikipedia.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.000
 He goes to this other town, okay?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.160
 "He suffers great embarrassment when he forgetfully visits a friend and unexpectedly has to face

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.400
 there the weekly gathering of the entire aristocratic set.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.840
 He's not tolerated and asked to leave since he is not a nobleman."

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.560
 Which makes me think that all of a sudden he became a Rodney Dangerfield story where

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.360
 he's like, "Yo, I get no respect.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.040
 The woman I love is with someone else.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.760
 I'm like nothing over there."

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.600
 And it's a bunch of people with their little wine glasses going, "What?

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600
 I never."

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.200
 He's not an aristocrat.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.720
 He basically shows it at his buddy's house with a six-pack.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.640
 He's like, "Yo Ralph, let me in.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.640
 It's worth her."

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.200
 And he goes in and it's basically Wayne Manor during a ball where everyone's dressed up

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200
 in their suits.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.800
 Not their Batman suits.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.720
 Dressed up in their suits and ties.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720
 There's violin, music, playing.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.800
 He's like, "Whoa, what kind of party is this?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.160
 Yo Ralph, things have gotten real snazzy for you."

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.560
 And they're like, "You're not an aristocrat, please leave."

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.560
 And he's like, "What?

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560
 I get no respect.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560
 I get no respect."

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.680
 Half my audience is like, "Who the hell is Rodney Dangerfield?"

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.640
 And why doesn't he get respect?

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.320
 And no one knows the answer to that question.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.120
 But apparently, so he goes to his buddy's house to chill and there's a huge party going

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120
 on and they kick him out.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.640
 So now he has no choice but to go back to Charlotte and Albert.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:53.000
 When he gets back there, when he goes back to Charlotte's villa, he finds out that they're

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.280
 already married.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.960
 And he's like, "Are you kidding me?

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.880
 I truly do get no respect."

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.760
 And he can't live with the fact that he can't be with Charlotte.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.560
 So he decides, "Listen, one of three things has to happen.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.720
 Either he dies, she dies, or I die."

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.440
 And he goes, "Well, I never want to hurt anybody else.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.720
 So I'm going to kill myself."

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.520
 So he asks Albert, "Hey, do you got two pistols I can borrow?

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.560
 I'm going to go on a quote, an adventure."

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560
 And Albert goes, "That's weird.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.280
 Why did you say quote, an adventure?"

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.760
 And he's like, "Well, that's just what Wikipedia said I'm going on an adventure."

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.760
 Albert goes, "Fine.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.760
 Yeah, sure.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.320
 I don't know why you would need two pistols, but here you go."

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.320
 Albert goes, "Thank you."

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320
 And he goes back to his house.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.320
 Where was he living?

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.520
 Maybe he was doing this outside.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.480
 Anyways, the point is he goes somewhere away from them.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.560
 He's not standing in front of them and going like, "How you like me now?"

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.200
 He goes somewhere else.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.920
 And the story is written as like a collection of letters.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.480
 It's supposedly a true story and in some ways it is.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.760
 Anyways, he goes and he pulls out a pistol and he blows his brains out and he doesn't

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.760
 die.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.520
 He basically just bleeds there for a while just since they're bleeding.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.360
 And the book lets you know that it takes 12 hours for him to die.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.720
 So it's not even just like it's this instant death.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.920
 He's all, "Uhhh," as he's bleeding out, dies.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.200
 The book also wants you to know that at his funeral there was no clergyman and Charlotte

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.440
 and Albert didn't even show up to the funeral.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.520
 So totally died alone.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.080
 That is the story of Werther.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.840
 So that story was the story that made Goath super famous.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.840
 He became an overnight celebrity.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.240
 It would be like one day you were walking down the street and the next day you were on Jersey

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.720
 Shore, level famous.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.320
 He was the situation of the 1770s.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:55.440
 And the book, I've been in that situation multiple times in my life where I like me

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.880
 to chick and she's with a dude and they're married and I'm like, "Yo dude, we'll hang

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.880
 out."

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:07.360
 And then I've been there to be pining over a girl in a relationship.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.840
 And I've lived with them.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840
 It's totally real.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.560
 I've done this stuff and I've gone to parties and gotten kicked out of parties.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.120
 Obviously I didn't blow my brains away, but I've been there.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.720
 And so I'm reading this and I'm like, "Dude, this is super relatable.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.840
 It's super relatable to me."

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.920
 I think I've done this twice honestly.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.920
 I think I've been in love with a girl, moved in with her and she was married or had a boyfriend

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.640
 at the time, both.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.280
 But both times I was like, "Ah, this ain't working out."

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.800
 And bounced.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.760
 But I totally relate to this character.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.040
 And this is one of the things that's fascinating.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.360
 Everyone else related to this character too.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.320
 So often a book will come along that people really, or a movie or song, it's usually a

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.640
 book or a movie, but they take off because people can absolutely 100% relate to that

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.080
 character.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:02.560
 And this guy became so relatable that supposedly young men all over Europe were reading this

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.080
 book and going, "You got two guns."

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.320
 And they dressed up like he became super fashionable to dress up as worthy.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.280
 He's a very emo character.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.600
 He's very tortured character.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.680
 But people began dressing like a warrior and shooting themselves in the head.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.880
 And some people have said, "No, no, no, that didn't happen."

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.480
 Or, "It didn't happen on the scale people think it did.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.480
 It's apocryphal.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.120
 It's a rumor."

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.880
 But we do know the book was incredibly famous and historians and researchers say there was

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:40.520
 a spate of suicides of young men found dressed in the type of clothes or dressed in his style

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.640
 shooting themselves in the head.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.240
 They said some people even went so far to get the same pistol that's described in the

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.000
 book to do the deed.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.040
 Fascinating, fascinating stuff.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.960
 And obviously Goath wasn't like, "Step one, write a book about a young man killing himself.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.120
 Step two, everyone kills himself."

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.120
 That wasn't his plan.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.680
 It wasn't his plan at all.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.080
 But he wrote the book and it was based on his true story.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.520
 Like his elements of it were that he obviously didn't kill himself either.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.000
 The emotional stuff.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.320
 And as time went on he distanced himself from the story.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.520
 It was basically like, again, his first big novel.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:23.000
 It's one of those things that you're a band, you release a hit song, you're Destiny's

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.320
 Child and you release Bootylicious.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.560
 And then 30 years later people are yelling at Beyonce, "Hey, do Bootylicious.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.560
 Do Bootylicious.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.560
 I don't want to do that."

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.320
 That was basically his Bootylicious.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.440
 It made him famous, but he distanced himself for it.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.640
 However, thought this was an interesting little note too.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.680
 However, even though he distanced himself from this book that caused a bunch of people

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.000
 to kill themselves, he wouldn't let anyone else do anything to the book.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 I didn't know how.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.120
 This is the segue that there was this dude, because the book was super popular.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.440
 There was this other author named Frederick Nicolai and he wrote a satire of the book

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.520
 called The Joys of Young Worther.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.280
 And he changed the ending.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.760
 So basically the book's totally different.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.560
 And then he changed the ending where when he asks Albert for the guns, Albert, instead

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.160
 of putting bullets in the gun, puts chicken blood in the gun.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.120
 So when Worther goes to shoot him, it's funny because it can't be that much of a difference

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.160
 from the plot if it still ends with him trying to kill himself, but he grabs the gun, pulls

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.160
 a trigger and just a bunch of chicken blood shoots out, which is...

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.200
 That's incredibly traumatizing, because he still goes through the whole mental process

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.120
 of deciding to end his life.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.880
 And then it's like, "Wha-wa-wa!"

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.960
 And he's just like covered in blood.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.840
 And he's like, "What?

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.280
 That showed me.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.320
 No more depression for me?"

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.720
 And then Albert gives Charlotte to Worther.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.720
 It was a satire.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.160
 And that made Goath...

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160
 This was...

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.880
 Like, from what I understand, this is like two decades after the original version came

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.360
 out, Goath had already distanced himself from his novel.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.360
 Furious!

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.760
 That's someone who would write the...

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.240
 Again, it was his life story in a way.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.120
 It was his emotional journey.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.240
 Furious that someone would write this.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.000
 So then Goath writes a poem called "Nicolai on Worther's Grave."

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.760
 So it gets meta here.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.360
 He writes a poem that we're back in the Worther verse.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.680
 We're back in the universe where Worther actually killed himself.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.240
 And his grave is underneath like a lime tree or a pine tree or something.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.240
 What was it again?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.600
 Yeah, it was a lime tree.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.760
 It was underneath a lime tree.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.640
 Oh, Napoleon Bonaparte loved this book so much, he carried it with him.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.640
 That's it.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.640
 That was not a just factoid.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.920
 Anyways, so he wrote this poem about Worther's grave is sitting there.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.120
 Obviously, they don't move around.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.520
 Graves aren't known to be quite mobile.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.280
 And Nicolai walks up to the grave.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.600
 This is a poem, by the way.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.640
 Nicolai walks up to the grave, looks at it, pulls his pants down and takes a steaming

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.400
 fat dump on Worther's grave.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.440
 And that's basically the poem.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.520
 And they became rivals until they died.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.160
 Both in Nicolai begin constantly like hate-writing people.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.840
 Suicide Contagion, aka the Worther Effect, based on the book that inspired men to kill

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.840
 themselves.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.440
 And I can almost guarantee you, sadly enough, that this book probably still does that.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.840
 I think it's probably harder to get a flintlock pistol and a big old floppy hat.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.920
 But I'm sure the book is so relatable, stories relatable that people are still reading it

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.480
 and going, "Well, if it works for him, it'll work for me."

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.160
 Yeah, bizarre stuff.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.200
 But let's go ahead, and we're leaving behind the story of Worther.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.520
 The sorrow of Worther.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.520
 Ugh.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.800
 What a relatable story.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.320
 Anyways, leaving it behind.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.600
 You're like, "Jason, are you over it?"

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.240
 And I was like, "Yes, yes, I am over it.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.840
 You don't have to have a place to live for a while, right?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840
 How's your wife doing here?"

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.320
 You're like, "Ah, you're never staying at my house.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.840
 Now that I know that you have designs on men's wives when you live with them."

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.840
 Like, "What?

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.840
 No, I don't.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.480
 That wasn't what I was saying as my eyes shift from side to side."

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.480
 I've never figured it.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.840
 My mom thinks that I have a, like, mental disorder.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.400
 She goes, "You always fall in love with women you can't have.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.440
 You're constantly falling in love with married women."

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.440
 All the time.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.440
 And I go, "That's not true."

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.440
 I pull a pistol out of my...

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.440
 Okay, that was dark.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.440
 That was dark.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.440
 Okay.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440
 And she's like, "Where'd you get those two flintlock pistols?"

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.080
 I'm like, "I'm going on an adventure."

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.080
 Okay, that's...

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.080
 Okay, anyways.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080
 So...

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:28.440
 Ugh, good old jokes about committing suicide and falling in love with the wrong women.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.640
 Let's forget all that stuff.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.160
 We are going to June...

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.160
 No, we're not.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.800
 We're going to Chula Vista, California.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.000
 It's June 19th, 1991.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.960
 You know, I'm not a big person who believes in a lot of numbers, numerology, and changing

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.800
 these codes up and stuff.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.000
 I've talked about it, but this did strike me as odd.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.280
 Chula Vista, California.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.280
 That part's not odd.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.040
 That's just the city in California.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:58.400
 June 19th, 1991 at 9 p.m.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.720
 June is the sixth month.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.080
 If you turn it upside down, you can an upside down six.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.440
 There are that joke aside.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.640
 There are a lot of nines involved in this.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640
 There's a lot, actually.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.640
 Very, very weird.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640
 What?

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.640
 I'm even seeing more.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.640
 Okay, I got to start doing this.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640
 Chula Vista, California.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640
 It's 9 p.m.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.000
 June 19th, 1999.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.280
 There's a young girl in the house.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.320
 Her name is Laura Arroyo.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.720
 She's nine.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720
 She's nine years old.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.120
 This is true story, by the way.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.800
 It's true story.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.240
 She's upstairs reading a book with her mom and there's a knock at the door.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.240
 Knock, knock, knock.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.160
 She jumps out of bed and she goes, "I'll get it.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.160
 I'll get it."

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.160
 She runs downstairs.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.800
 Now, the mom is thinking, "It's kind of late, but this Chula Vista area they were in, kind

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.960
 of a nice neighborhood and friends would always kind of come over and be like, "Hey, she doesn't

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.240
 really think too much of it."

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.120
 Then as she hears Laura running down the hallway, she hears Laura say, "Who is it?"

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.120
 And then the door opened.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.320
 Then she doesn't hear anything.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.440
 The mom goes, "Oh, must have been one of her friends talking about homework or something

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.640
 like that."

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.920
 But after about 10 minutes, she goes, "Uh-oh.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.760
 Where's my daughter at?"

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.080
 If it was a casual conversation, they would have come in where she at.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.640
 So the mom jumps out of bed and Laura's gone from her front door.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.280
 Obviously, police are called very shortly.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:27.240
 Neighbors looking for her, moms looking for her, neighbors are all looking for this girl.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.920
 She's disappeared.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:37.080
 At 6.30 a.m. the next morning, four miles away, her body is found at a business park

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:48.120
 and she's been murdered and there are signs of sexual assault.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.000
 So obviously just the disappearance had the police working high gear.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.200
 Now they're absolutely freaking out about this whole thing.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.760
 And they can't find who did it.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.440
 They are looking all over for the murderer of a nine-year-old and the assaulter of a

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.240
 nine-year-old girl.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.720
 This is an interesting case.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.720
 There's a paranormal angle.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.120
 I'm just going to talk about this horrible crime.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.760
 It's an interesting case because you can find, it's very well publicized.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.400
 You can find a ton of articles detailing everything.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:24.800
 A couple weeks after the murder, we're in the month of July now, there in town was a billboard

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.000
 that was no advertisement was put up on.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 It was a blank billboard.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.480
 It was in between someone saying, "Hey, I want to put my advertisement on there."

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:39.600
 So it would stand there on the street corner just white with the lights shining up on it.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.880
 That's the sound of the lights at night in Chula Vista.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.680
 And one day someone's driving down the road and they're looking at the billboard and they

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.680
 go, "What?"

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.680
 They're kind of squinting.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:54.600
 They're like, "Oh, that looks weird."

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.800
 Someone else driving down that same road at night looking in there like, "What the hell

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.800
 is that?"

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:06.880
 Now missing girl, young little nine-year-old girl, her photo was plastered everywhere.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.480
 Everybody knew what this girl looked like in town.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.920
 Horrible, horrible story.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.760
 So people who had never met Laura while she was alive knew what she looked like.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.880
 So when people were driving down this road in Chula Vista and they're looking at this

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:27.760
 billboard, they see the light and the shadow make the image of Laura's face.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.240
 The billboard was two miles between the house and the murder scene.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.760
 So it was like right in the middle.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.960
 And word gets out in town.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.200
 Now this is again before social media, you actually had to walk up to someone and go,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.120
 "Hey buddy, have you seen that billboard?"

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.520
 Or you would pick up the phone and be like, "Yo, what are you doing tonight?

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.960
 Let's go see the billboard."

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.040
 So it wasn't like someone could tweet something and then a bunch of people showed up.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.800
 But a bunch of people did show up.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:59.160
 At one point, they were recording crowds of like 25,000 people, which is mind-boggling

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.160
 to me.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.960
 I don't know how big Chula Vista is, but people, huge traffic jams.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.960
 Cops had to come out and direct traffic because people were driving by this billboard.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.000
 And that's one thing, we have a bunch of articles on this.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.920
 If this story happened today, we'd have video footage and photos and everything like that.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.960
 We don't have any of that, at least none of it's posted.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.200
 This was way before the internet was even really a thing.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.000
 So the father of the girl, Luis Arroyo, says, "I gotta check this out."

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.720
 And he goes and he goes, "Oh my god, that's my daughter.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.920
 That's my daughter on that billboard."

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.520
 He took her brothers, she had like, I think like a 12 year old brother and a 10 year

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.880
 old brother.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.280
 They went there and the brothers were like, "Laura, Laura."

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.280
 And they started crying.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.600
 It's a tragic story, tragic story.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.240
 So the general consensus was this was Laura's image on the board.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.640
 And you're like light and shadow, people are imagining things.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.200
 The police are looking at it and they go, "Can you take some photos of that?"

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:05.200
 So they had other cops photographing, taking it as evidence.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.000
 And there was a quote from Detective Wayne Maxie.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.920
 He goes, "It's one of those things where we don't know where it could lead us."

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.200
 And they asked the billboard people.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.400
 They said, "Do you have another person ready to put up a sign there?"

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.160
 And the billboard company says, "Yeah, we actually do have someone.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.480
 We were just in between putting up advertisements."

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.640
 And the police said, "Listen, could you do us a favor?"

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.600
 We don't know if this is a ghost face or anything like that.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.120
 It's funny because cops tend to be kind of superstitious.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.400
 But this officer wasn't saying, "We think there's a ghost here and we're trying to contact her."

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:43.080
 This officer said, "Listen, we think this might help lure out the killer."

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.080
 Because if he believes there's some sort of supernatural force going on or something

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.440
 like that, can you not put up a new advertisement?

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.240
 And he goes, "Yeah, yeah, we'll give it some time.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.920
 Maybe this will help catch the killer."

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.960
 So it wasn't so much like they thought a giant Laura hand, a ghostly hand is going to reach

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.200
 out and grab him like the Staple of Marshall, oh man.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.240
 It was just that maybe the guy in the area would just be so overwrought by guilt.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.880
 But at some point, the image didn't go away.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.920
 At some point, the traffic jams are so much.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.160
 I think that Citi disconnected the power to the sign.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.840
 And then the people in town got up there and reconnected the power.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.480
 Now, there was also stories that you could see the image of the killer in the background.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.520
 Now I heard that out of my National Directory of Haunted Places book.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.880
 I wasn't able to find any verification in any news articles saying, and some people

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.040
 said you could see the killer.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.680
 So I'm not for sure about that detail.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:42.320
 But anyways, eventually though, enough time passes, traffic dies down, company throws

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.000
 up another billboard.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.640
 The image is no longer seen.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:54.280
 It wasn't until 2005 when the cops break down a door.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.040
 This is what, 14 years later, put your hands on your head, put your hands on your head,

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.520
 guys wrestling.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.680
 Smash hopefully smashed his head into the floorboard.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.880
 Manuel Bracamantes, 42 year old man.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.680
 So he would have been in his what, what's 14 minus 42, would have been 28 something?

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.880
 I think he would have been 28 when this happened.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:22.880
 Used to live in the area, moved out a week before the crime, had access to a tool that

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.720
 they believe was used in the murder, and they caught him because of the DNA he left at the

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.880
 crime scene.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.120
 He ends up getting sentenced to death.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.520
 He ends up getting sentenced to death.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.840
 And it's interesting because when you look at the early articles it said there's no sexual

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840
 assault.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.920
 This child was not sexually assaulted.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:44.760
 She was just chopped up with this weird looking tool that he used at his construction company

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.760
 or something.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.400
 It was like a normal weapon that you would see.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.720
 So that kind of helped him kind of narrow it down, but it was the DNA that finally got

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720
 him.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.920
 And it was one of those things, it was a cold case and they were like just run the DNA

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.760
 again and then like six, seven years would pass and they were like just run it again.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.760
 Can you run it one more time?

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.680
 And they were like yeah, you'll run it as much as you want.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.760
 This guy murdered a kid.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.760
 Let's do it.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.080
 And they finally caught him.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.240
 But he gets guilty, sentenced to death.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.320
 And that's where we're at now.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.240
 The last real article I saw in this was 2005.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.960
 So I'm assuming that he was appealing his death sentence or something like that.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.680
 I think it's an interesting story because we have that convergence.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.880
 We're at that intersection of paranormal and true crime, which when I started the show

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.160
 I said that's going to be a common theme.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.760
 And it pops up every now and then.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760
 Every now and then.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.120
 So it's always interesting when it does.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:43.720
 But the idea of the billboard and the little girl looking out from the shadows and the

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.200
 light out of the street below her.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.840
 The father said, you know, I worked on the street that the billboard was like looking

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.640
 down and I figured that was a way for my daughter to watch over me and to send me a message.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.280
 But I don't know what she's trying to tell me.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.480
 Damn, that's horrible.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.720
 I mean, I get that's awesome that he finds that uplifting thing.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.040
 But imagine it's one thing to lose your child.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.880
 But then imagine if you saw your child frozen in time.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:17.320
 If you truly believe that was her frozen in time, her image looking at you, giant looming

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.560
 over the night skyscape of Chula Vista.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.440
 And you just being this father looking up at this image of your daughter and thinking,

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.600
 what are you trying to tell me?

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:34.120
 And then have it go another 14 years before you finally have any peace about what happened

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.040
 to her.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.560
 And then let's say that it was some ghostly apparition up there.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:47.720
 I think the creepiest part is there's a chance that it was.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:53.160
 And there was that brief moment in time where there was no billboard up there and people

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:59.160
 were driving by and they happened to recognize the way that it looked as Laura.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.360
 But what if there was a billboard there?

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.480
 What if there was an Eda Kentucky Fried Chicken, Colonel Sanders taking a big old bite.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.640
 And yet somehow the soul of this young girl, her ghostly image was still impressed on that

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.720
 thing.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.960
 And people just continued to drive by, drive by this billboard and you have the soul of

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:26.320
 this young girl looking out, trying to send her father a message.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.440
 But it's simply being ignored.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:35.120
 I find that infinitely more creepy.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.040
 How many messages could be out there?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:44.680
 People who are lost, people who are dead, that they're trying to send to their loved ones

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:51.480
 but we just don't see because of all of the information overload all around us.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.240
 Is it possible someone's trying to reach out to you right now?

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.400
 You just don't notice it.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:06.760
 You just drive by that sign as a ghostly presence is trying to send you a message from the other

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.200
 side.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.480
