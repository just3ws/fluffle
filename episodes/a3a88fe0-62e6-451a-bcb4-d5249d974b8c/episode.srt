1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 This is the story of a home.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 "You're dying down now."

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 "That was some storm."

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 And the insurance company that offered information and advice to help prepare that home for the worst.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 If it matters to you, Traveler's Insurance will help protect it.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Travelers, speak to an independent agent today.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 In the city of Prague during World War II, was a real-life superhero fighting the Nazis?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And then we traveled to America to take a look at one of our most famous real-life superheroes,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 and then Phoenix Jones will profile his rise and his fall today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 [Music]

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 You're like, "Jason, are you... what's up with your voice?"

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Well, I still have this sinus infection. I'm still super congested up on my nose.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 As I say, you sound more like a muppet than you normally do.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Hey, I know. What are you gonna do? It's a daily show and I want to miss episodes just because my sound's super congested.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But other than this sinus infection going on, and totally healthy, guys don't be worried.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 I'm self-isolated. I'm doing really good.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 So, I hope you guys are good as well.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with today's episode. We got a lot of stuff to cover here.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 First off, let's hop on the Carpenter Copter. We're headed to Czechoslovakia.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 The country somewhere in Eastern Europe. We're flying over...

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And as we're going over to Czechoslovakia, does that...

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Oh, that's Yugoslavia. That disappeared.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And we're also going back in time to World War II.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So, not a high point for Eastern Europe. There weren't many, to be honest.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 It seems that it's always been kind of a rough go over there.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 You had territorial warlords for the longest time, and then things kind of got settled.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And then Hitler came in and took over much stuff, started executing people.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And then the saviors, the glorious Soviet Empire, saved them from the Nazis.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And people were like, "Yay, we're free!" And the Soviets were like, "Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm."

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 "That's what you thought!" And they put up the Iron Curtain for about 50 years,

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 and now we are here today, Czechoslovakia.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 But we're not here today. We are in World War II.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And we're in the streets of Prague. There's Nazis walking down the street,

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 doing Nazi stuff, just generally being a pain to the Czechoslovakian citizens.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And you also have Czechoslovakians who are informants, who are turncoats,

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 working with the Nazis, because they're like, "Oh, yeah, I want some of that sweet, sweet Nazi power.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I'm going to turn in my own people for minor infractions."

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 But there's someone in the shadows in the streets of Prague.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 A man watching, waiting.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 He doesn't have to wait. There's evil around every corner.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 It basically would be the best place to be a vigilante, because basically you're like,

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 "You wouldn't need a bat signal. There's crime everywhere."

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 You have Nazis and collaborators on every single street corner.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So, I mean, you just walk down the street and start punching people.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 You're going to hit a Nazi eventually.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Anyways, this guy springs into action, "Baboying."

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Now, that wasn't a turn of phrase, but "Baboying" a man jumps out of the shadows,

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 super high, 20, 30 feet, "Baboying" and lands right behind a Nazi,

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 punches him in the back of the neck.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 "Oi, my neck!" Bounce away, sees two collaborators being like,

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 "Who should we rat on next?"

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 "Oh, that girl turned me down for a date. We should say that she's hiding some Jews in her."

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 "Baboying!" The dude bounces on top of his head multiple times,

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 pushes him into the dirt.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 The other collaborator runs away, "Baboying, not for long."

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 So, he just does this. So, just imagine for the course of World War II,

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 this dude was jumping on people.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Now, this guy, his name is Parak,

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 aka the "Springman" or the "Springer," is what his name means.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And throughout World War II, there was rumors of an event.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So, he basically has two origin stories.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Some people swear that this guy is real.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 People nowadays go, it's an urban legend,

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 because when they look in Nazi and police reports,

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 there's no men--which were the same thing back then,

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 because the police were the collaborators--

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 there was no reports of a man with springs on his feet

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 "Baboying" all over the city stopping crime.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 To be fair, I wouldn't put that down in a report.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I mean, it's Nazi--it's Nazi-controlled territory, right?

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You're not going to be like, "Um, I lost those people.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I was supposed to kidnap," because a man "Baboying" them on my head.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Like, you're not going to put that. You're just going to be like,

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 "Oh, they ran away. They just dissolved.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 They just dissolved right in front of me."

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 You're not going to put that there's a superhero chasing you down the street.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Anyways, some people swear this guy is real.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Other people think it was just a legend, but he has two origin stories.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 One, there was an inventor who was like, "How do I fight crime?

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I'm just a lowly inventor. I know."

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And he put--oh, god, look at this chase.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 He's an inventor. He puts springs on his shoes.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Some people specifically say they're springs from a couch,

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 which I've never met a couch that boing-y,

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 because apparently he could jump over railcars.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Which, okay, that's a bad image.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 When we're talking about the holocausts, we're talking about World War II.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Can they co--come on. He's just bouncing over trains.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 He doesn't stop them. They keep headed east.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 He's just bouncing over them.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 They could have come up with a better image for something that's bouncing over a building, perhaps.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 But anyways, an origin story about a guy who put springs on his shoes.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 The reason why part of me thinks this is real,

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 you're like, "Jason, you can't actually believe that a guy can bounce over structures."

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Well, we can talk about physics later.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 The reason why I think this might be true,

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 because that's such a stupid power, right?

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Like, if I was making up a power, it would be he could turn it visible,

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 or he could, like, transform himself into, like, I don't know, anything really.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 You don't need to have a limit on that.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 If you're making it up, he can transform himself into, like, a he-man.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And he's ripping Nazis in half and stuff like that.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 If you're making it up, why do you just give him this power to jump really high with springs on his feet?

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Makes me think it might be true.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 But when folklorists look at this, because what happened was,

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 whether or not the police were writing this down,

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 everyone believed in Prague believed in Patar. Everybody.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And when anything went wrong, they blamed it on him, like a munition truck explodes, or it was Patar.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I'm walking down the street and all my groceries fall out of my hand. It was Patar.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 When folklorists look back on this, they go,

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 "We see stories of a springing man in Prague all the way back to, like, the 1890s,

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 almost a contemporary to Springheal Jack in England."

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 What's interesting about that is Springheal Jack,

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 it was kind of like, he was sexually molesting women.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 They leave that part out of a lot of the monster books for kids.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 The first time I ever heard about Springheal Jack, there's a little monster toy line.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 It was like, remember those muscle characters, little rubbery muscle guys?

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 They had a toy line like that, but they were all classic monsters.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And I remember one of the first ones I got was Springheal Jack.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 It was like, this menacing man jumps over buildings,

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 and then maybe about a year and a half ago I was doing research for a show,

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 and he didn't jump over buildings, he jumped into buildings, and sexually assaulted the women inside.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Springheal Jack, he was known for jumping everywhere,

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 but when you look into the actual myth, he was constantly assaulting women, pinching their butts, at the least.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So when I saw this, I go, "That's weird, like, one, it's weird that you have two bouncing people,

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 but if this guy was a contemporary of Springheal Jack in the 1890s,

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 why did he become a hero character in the 1940s?"

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 But this is why. He wasn't a hero character in the 1940s, actually.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So what happened? This is from what they can gather, because part of the problem is that

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 this guy was totally believed in during World War II.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 People had heard stories about him before, but during World War II you had all of these things happening.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 People were blaming Patar.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And then when the Soviets freed, quote unquote freed Prague, and took over,

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 the legend of Patar was put to rest.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 You can't have this guy jumping around, or maybe he was actually arrested by the KGB,

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 or maybe he joined the KGB, who knows.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 But the Soviet Union said no more stories about Patar.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So it wasn't until the fall of the Iron Curtain where you had people going back and researching this stuff

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 and going, like, "Well, there's a lot of stuff about this, but there's not a lot of real documents

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 because they were suppressed for so long."

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 The Nazis didn't want to hear about it. People were afraid to go to work during World War II.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 People blamed every problem on Patar.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And then the Soviets took over. They didn't want to hear about it either.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 There's a really cool cartoon, and I actually included it in the show notes.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It's called "A Spring Man in the SS," is what it's called.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 It's in the show notes. Check it out. It's like 14 minutes long.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 It's kind of a really cool little cartoon that talks about it.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 It has the spring man as just a chimney sweep, which was another origin story,

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 but that didn't really make any sense.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 This is the weird thing. So like I said, you had stories of him back in the 1890s, right?

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And then you had stories of him in World War II, and today he's celebrated as a war hero, fighting the Nazis.

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And he has cartoons and theater based on a bunch of books coming out of Czechoslovakia.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It's considered Czechoslovakia's only superhero.

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 But here's the weird part. So he does show up.

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 These are the things that everyone agrees on.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 He shows up during World War II mostly, bounces around on people, and fights the Nazis towards the end of the war.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 For the first couple of years, and the reason why people were so afraid of him,

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 and people wouldn't go out at night, and the Nazis were like,

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 "Dude, we need you to build these bullets for us. We need this cheap slave labor."

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And people were like, "No. I don't want to leave my house and watch your factory."

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Because this guy is going to bounce on top of me.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 The people of Prague, for the first couple years of the war, did not seem as a hero.

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 He was raping and murdering people.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 He would bounce out of the shadows and rape you, bounce out of the shadows and murder you, or both.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And the Nazis were like, "That's impossible."

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And the citizens were like, "Who is raping and murdering us? Why can't you catch this guy?"

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And that people refused to work, and at some point, he became a hero, versus not being a villain anymore.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 What made that change?

172
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 At what point were you like, "Oh, that mythological figure we made up. Yeah, now he's a good guy."

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 It would be the equivalent of, if all of a sudden, everyone agreed that the boogeyman was actually like an undercover cop.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And he was like hiding in the shadows, he started arresting criminals.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 He'd be like, "Wait, no, no, no, I forgot the boogeyman. He hid it under my bed and ate my dog. No, no, no, no, no, no, no."

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Well, he did that, but now he's a good guy.

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 It was that deep of a myth that people refused to leave their house.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 People were telling the Nazis, "No!"

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Because they were afraid of this guy was going to rape and murder them.

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And then that guy becomes a national hero.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 To this day, people still use "Patar" as the symbol of resistance.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 But that's a pretty weird origin story. At what point do you like, "Hmm, I've raped and murdered so many people in this city. I hate them so much.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 But you know what I hate even more? Nazis."

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 So let's team up.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 The city that I've terrorized forever, everyone's all huddled in the corner.

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Do you want to team up? They're like, "Yes, whatever you want to do, as long as it's not towards us."

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 He's like, "Yes."

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 What origin story is that? But anyways, so that is the story.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And that makes him more like Spring Hill Jack, honestly.

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 That's what I was like, "Why is he..."

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Spring Hill Jack was like, "Oh, there he goes. Yeah, he's a sexual predator too."

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Totally weird.

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Also, just to show you how weird Czechoslovakian people are, there is another guy at the time who walked around with razor blades taped to his fingers

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 and he was just slashing people as they were walking down the street.

195
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So listen, man, either Czechoslovakians have a really weird imagination

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 or there were real-life superheroes walking around in World War II.

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Most likely the Spring Hill guys made up.

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 But then who was raping and murdering all those people?

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 I mean, yeah, like a truck driving down the street and the wheels falling off and you being like, "Buttar!"

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And you just think of him as like some sort of gremlin that's constantly interfering with stuff.

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 That's fine, but when people are dead in the street and they're like, "Who did this?"

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Like that's an actual crime when someone's like, "I got raped."

203
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And they're like, "Who did it?"

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And she's like, "I don't know. He jumped like two houses away."

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And they're like, "Uh..."

206
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Like that's the difference between like a gremlin type character and an actual criminal.

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 But let's go ahead and quickly leave Prague.

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 We're like running for our lives now.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Come back! The guy's bouncing after us. I'm a good guy.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 For now, we run. We get on the Carbondocopter.

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 The tires are all slashed in the Carbondocopter, but it's fine.

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 We don't need tires.

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 We're flying off to Seattle.

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Now, a long time ago, really early on in the show, I kind of did an overview of real-life superheroes.

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So some of this stuff might be a repeat, but I mean, it had to be like episode like 50 or 60.

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And I find the idea super fascinating.

217
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 This is real-life superhero special, by the way, which I didn't announce earlier.

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 But I find the whole thing totally fascinating.

219
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Let's come up to Seattle, Washington.

220
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And there we're going to meet who I could... Oh, and you know, before we do this, before we do this.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Dead Rabbit recommends real quick, before I forget.

222
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Everyone's inside right now, or you should be.

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 If you can be. If you're out working and you have to work, then totally that's fine.

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 You don't need my permission, but that's awesome because you're keeping everything going.

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 But if you don't need to be outside, it sucks, but just stay inside.

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 There's a documentary. It was made on HBO.

227
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 There's a copy on YouTube. It's in the show notes. It's called superheroes.

228
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 It's a documentary about real-life superheroes.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I've watched it. I don't know how many times.

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 It's one of those documentaries that I've...

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 When I've been hanging out with other people, I was like, dude, you want to see something dope?

232
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And I've watched it with friends.

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 There's three documentaries that I recommend all the time.

234
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 They're all extremely rare because I'm a hipster when it comes to my documentaries.

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Superheroes is one of them.

236
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Link in the show notes.

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Dig. There's a documentary called Dig, which is one of the best documentaries,

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 or all three of these documentaries.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 It's all about being in the right place at the right time.

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Superheroes is kind of just a collection of interviews,

241
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 but you get to see these people who all believe that they're superheroes.

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And some of them actually seem to be, and some of them are just drunk weirdos,

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 but superheroes.

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Dig. It's a story of two bands that I never heard of before this...

245
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Before I watch the documentary, the band, you have the Dandy Warhalls and the Brian Jonestown Massacre.

246
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 They're both completely no-name bands at the beginning of the documentary.

247
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 This director just decides to take these two bands and start following them around.

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And it's such a story of the creative process, of the music industry, of drug abuse, of...

249
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Dig. Dig is a great one if you can find it.

250
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 It's really, really hard. And then the third best documentary is Overnight.

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Overnight is brilliant.

252
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 It's another document. All three of those documentaries I've showed to multiple people.

253
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Overnight is the story of the making of the Boondock Saints.

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 You're like, "What? That movie about the two guys is shooting everyone?"

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 It's a story of a man who works at a bar who writes a script and it sells it to Harvey Weinstein,

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 who's basically the villain of this movie.

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 But is Harvey Weinstein... It's a true story.

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Is Harvey Weinstein the villain of the movie? Or is Troy Duffy the guy who made the movie so self-destructive?

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Overnight is probably the best example of a documentary filmed at the right time.

260
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Because his buddies are filming their buddy making a feature film.

261
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And everything that came out of it. Great, great.

262
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 But anyway, so if you want something to watch, Superheroes, you can find that easily on YouTube.

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And I have the links there. Overnight is usually streaming everywhere. Dig. Incredibly hard to find.

264
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 But if you're into music or the creation of music or the music business or just creativity in general, creative geniuses, dig.

265
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 All of them are great. Anyways, Dead Rabbit recommends all three of those documentaries.

266
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So let's go ahead and take a look, though. We're going to Seattle, Washington.

267
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 So in 2011, there is formed a group of superheroes for Seattle,

268
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 known as the Rain City Superhero Movement. Or RCSM.

269
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 They could have picked a better name, right? Could have been the Seattle Superheroes or something like that.

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 You had all of these... I didn't even know there was this many superheroes in Seattle or really alive.

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 But yeah, the superheroes, they walk around in costume and they say, "Stop doing that."

272
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Now, some of them beat up drug dealers and then get, like, stabbed. Some of them stop fights or start fights.

273
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 A lot of times they do social work. So they're handing out sandwiches to the poor and talking to kids about don't doing drugs, stuff like that.

274
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 All that stuff's important. I don't think you should be walking around punching drug dealers.

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 But if no one else is doing it and you can get away with it, I had to have that caveat.

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Don't walk up and punch a drug dealer and then, you know, get your family shot up or go to jail or any of that.

277
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 But anyways, superheroes, they're not flying around town. They're not stopping bank robberies.

278
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 But the thing is, it's like they think they are. Which is what makes this so funny.

279
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 They don't think they're flying around. I don't know, they might. But all of this stuff I find...

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 I've always been fascinated by these guys. I think in a little part of my brain, a little bit jealous,

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I wish I had the physical fitness or the balls to put on a costume and walk around and go and stop.

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Evil doer here, homeless person, have this sandwich. You put down that baseball bat.

283
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 But I'm playing baseball. It's a weapon. Put it down here. You homeless person have this sandwich.

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 You already gave me two. My work here is done. I wish I could do that. I can't.

285
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Since I can't, let's make fun of these people who do. So Rain City Superhero Movement,

286
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 these are the people who are involved in this, some of them at least.

287
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 So in 2011, we have this Rain City Superhero Movement with these superheroes in it.

288
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 These are real people. I'm not making these names up. These people fought crime and/or gave hobo sandwiches.

289
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 You had Thorn, Buster Doe. You remember famous Buster Doe? He stopped that nothing. He didn't stop anything.

290
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 We have No Name. We have Penelope. It's kind of a cute name. Not very superhero-ish, but cute name.

291
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Skyman. His power was whenever he looked up, he could see the sky for miles and miles and miles.

292
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 We had El Caballero. El Caballo. His superpower was podcast host could never pronounce his name.

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And that way no one could ever make fun of him. El Caballero. I think it means cowboy in Spanish.

294
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Purple Rain, but it's spelled R-E-I-G-N. Now see, that's the type of thing like, let's say you save a young damsel in distress.

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 She's getting mugged. You jump down from the rooftop and then you like, say, stop, you will do her and the guy runs away.

296
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And as you're tending your two broken ankles, she goes, what's your name? And he goes, Purple Rain.

297
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 But you got to spell it R-E-I. And she's already walking away. No, come back. Come back. Don't spell it the wrong way.

298
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's R-E-I-G-N. Ah, my ankles. Like, I get it. It looks good on a comic book page, but you can't do that.

299
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I'll say this. So you have the Rain City Superhero Movement. You have all these superheroes.

300
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 This is on the Wikipedia page. They list a couple of crimes that they stopped. And they're like, oh, they chased down a sexual offender.

301
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Which is good. I shouldn't be wrong. I was super dis-- oh, good job, guys. Chasing down a sexual offender.

302
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I don't mean like that. I mean, like, that's super vague, right? Like, was he-- like, was he currently offending someone?

303
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Or was he, like, on the registered sex offender list? And he was walking down the street and they're like, get him.

304
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Like, I don't get it. I don't get it. Well, okay, okay. To be fair, now that I've read more of this sentence, it said, chase down and aid it in the apprehension of a sex offender.

305
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Okay, so, yes, he probably was doing it at that time. I didn't mean to be super dismissive. The reason why is that.

306
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 That's in a list of stuff. So they're like, we stopped carjackings. We helped stranded vehicles on the highway.

307
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Stopped people from driving drunk. They also said that which is a great thing. So is stopping carjackings.

308
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 But then they go into detail about this one particular thing. And this is what I'm saying. So they go, I want to know more details about them stopping the sexual offender.

309
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Because now I look like I don't like them doing that. No, you should stop the sexual offender. I just think it's weird that that's in a list of stuff, but we have one crime that's more detailed.

310
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 So here's what happened. This group, the Rain City Superhero Movement, all these people walking around in their superhero costumes.

311
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 They come across four, I do not believe this happened. This is totally made up. I do not believe this happened.

312
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 They're walking down a bunch of superheroes or walking down the street in the real world, apparently. And there's four cops.

313
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Or are they just people dressed as police officers? So these superheroes see four cops walk up to a blind man and go, hey, you, we need to search your pockets.

314
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And the blind man's like, what, what? They put the blind man against the wall and they start going through his pockets and they're stealing all of this blind man stuff.

315
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And the superheroes go look at each other and like, what? Those police officers are stealing from that blind man.

316
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So the cop, so the superheroes show up and they confront the cops and the cops freak out and it turns out they're not cops.

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 There are four people dressed in police uniforms robbing a blind man and they run off and the superheroes retrieve all of their stuff.

318
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Let me explain why that story is not true. Let's think about this for a second.

319
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 One, why would you need four fake cops? When are just one fake cop just walking on the street being like, sir, turn around, show me your license registration.

320
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Let me see your wallet. That works. Let's say they wanted four. So now not only do you have to go through the trouble of getting one police uniform, you have to get four of them.

321
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 So now you have four authentic police uniforms, right? So that way when you tell people, when you tell people, get against the wall, we're the police.

322
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 We need to search you for drugs and contraband. They will look at you and realize that you're cops. If you're doing it to a blind person, you can be wearing sweatpants.

323
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 If you're robbing a blind person, you don't need to go through the trouble of getting a police uniform. You just walk up and go, I'm a cop. What?

324
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Turn around and stand against the wall. Okay, officer. Okay.

325
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Why did they get four cop uniforms to rob one blind guy when you don't need any police car? You just rob a blind guy.

326
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Why would you even go through the rigmarole of any sort of, what's he going to do? He's blind. Just walk up and take stuff out of his pockets.

327
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Anyways, I don't believe that story happened at all. Okay, so anyways, anyways, let's talk about Phoenix Jones.

328
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Now, I think that kind of sets, I wanted to go over the whole thing because these people seem to kind of exaggerate stuff.

329
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 They really do seem to kind of exaggerate stuff. But let's, that group dissolved in 2014.

330
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And Phoenix Jones started working on his own. Now, Phoenix Jones started fighting crime back in 2009. His origin story is spectacular.

331
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 His origin story is as spectacular as you could imagine a real-life superhero's story would be.

332
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Because it's real life. You're not walking down the street and your billionaire parents get assassinated and then you fight crime because bats or something like that.

333
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 You're bit by a radioactive spider. It's the real world, okay?

334
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Phoenix Jones. So Phoenix Jones before 2009. I don't know exactly when this happened.

335
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And also the origin story seems to change from article to article so I don't want anyone, any fans of real-life superheroes being like, "That's not it."

336
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Well, it changes and sometimes it's more drastic than other times.

337
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 But the earliest thing I could find when it's kind of, because he was a martial artist. He was like a Taekwondo world champion.

338
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And he did mixed martial arts and he's won a bunch of fights and stuff like that. So he knows how to fight.

339
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 But anyways, so he had all that technique, all that training. But he needed to match lit.

340
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 He needed to find that fire of justice inside of him. Inside all of us.

341
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 He was hoping to inspire all of humanity. But before any of that, he's walking down the street.

342
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And he's walking down the street with his son and he gets to his car and the window has been busted open.

343
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 No! Someone broke into my car and he's like, "What happened?" And then his son is...

344
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 His son is walking obviously with him and his son apparently slips on.

345
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 So there's broke... There's broke... I want you to imagine this as a comic book.

346
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 There's broken glass everywhere. Phoenix Jones is like, "No!" He's shaking his hand in the sky.

347
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 He's not paying attention. His son, I don't know how old his son is, but his son is walking.

348
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 He slips on the broken glass that's on the ground and it cuts him up.

349
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And then he's like, "Why? Why?" Now you're like, "Jason, that's horrible! That's horrible!

350
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Why are you making fun of a little boy getting cut by glass?"

351
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Well, here's the thing. One, I don't know if it even happened, too.

352
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 If it did happen, it sucks, right? But that's kind of a weird origin story.

353
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And then seeing some articles, he just got injured on the glass.

354
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Which even if you slipped and fell, I guess you'd have to like... One, glass isn't like...

355
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 His window wasn't made out of grease. But anyways, he walks and slips on the grass.

356
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 One version of the story, the son had to go to the ER. So that's sad.

357
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 But that was... I read a lot of articles on this and it was only one version.

358
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 The other version is that him and his buddy were out at a bar and his buddy got in a fight.

359
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And Phoenix Jones didn't know what to do, so he threw on a ski mask and jumped around the corner and, quote,

360
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 "made a commotion" until the people left and the cops showed up or something like that.

361
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And I'm thinking, "Wait a second, so you're a fighter?" He is a fighter.

362
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Like, we know that. We do know his record because he did actually compete in a lot of MMA stuff.

363
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 He is a fighter, but your buddy's getting beat up. You take the time to run around the corner.

364
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Do you just have a ski mask on you? Was there one in the garbage can? Then come back and the guys are already left anyways

365
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 and you're like, "Ahhh!" And then there's a version of that story where his friend had a permanent facial injury.

366
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Come on, man. Like, what? Something like that is generally reported in all the articles.

367
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 His friend was left with a horrible injury and every time Phoenix Jones looked at his friend,

368
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 he thought, "Somebody has to do something." So he put on a costume.

369
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Whatever the case, both of those stories supposedly happened. His son slipped on some glass, got cut up.

370
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 His son became his own superhero glass boy that wherever he went, he was--

371
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 that was his superpower was slipping on glass. He was like, "Ice Man."

372
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 He's like, "I'll get down from this cliff real fast." He like, throws glass in front of him and like slides everywhere.

373
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Weeeeeee! Everyone's all getting blind. That's how the guy became blind in that first story. Some kid was just throwing glass and then sliding on it, cut my eyeballs out.

374
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Anyways, so he decides to start fighting crime. Now, his first costume he wore all spandex. He wore a tuxedo over the spandex.

375
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And according to him, I don't know how much I can actually, like, believe these stories, but according to him, we'll just--

376
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 I've told stories about Mormon Bigfoot. I think I can trust Phoenix Jones. Phoenix Jones was standing on a rooftop.

377
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 His very first time fighting crime. He was standing on a rooftop wearing a tuxedo underneath was his spandex uniform.

378
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I don't know why the tuxedo either. I don't know why a tuxedo either. But anyways, he's on the rooftop and his idea was to rip off the tuxedo and then run around in spandex.

379
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 He sees a mugging and he's like, "Oh, no, I gotta get down there." And according to him, it took him five minutes to get down off the building.

380
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And then he runs over and the woman had already been mugged and she's like, "What are you doing? You look like Count Chocula here."

381
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Like, that's--the actual quote is--well, that's pretty close, actually. The actual quote is quote. This is what she said.

382
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 "What are you doing? He already left. You look like Count Chocula. You look stupid."

383
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I don't believe that happened. Like, I don't believe--I don't believe that she's dropping pop culture references after being mugged.

384
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 What do you mean? You look like Thomas the Tank Engine, but without the Thomas or the Tank Engine? You look like nothing because you're a big old loser.

385
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 I don't--I don't believe that story. I do believe he's probably running around in tuxedo. I do believe that he probably saw a mugging and he couldn't stop, but I don't think she turned around with a witty one-liner.

386
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 But anyways, anyways, so that happened according to him. That was back in 2009. He continues fighting crime. Quote, unquote.

387
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 In 2011, the first time that he got in the news was some guy's car was getting stolen. Phoenix Jones shows up. At this point, at a certain point, he starts wearing body armor.

388
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 He has like, ballistic armor. He has his own private doctor. They made--so at one point, he got stabbed. This is written in this article. He gets stabbed, right?

389
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And they said, "Jones fixed his suit up and then got treated by his private doctor." And I'm thinking, "Everyone has a private--I have a private doctor. Everyone has a private doctor."

390
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And I go to the doctor. There's not four other people sitting in the room with me. They try to make it sound like he went to go see Alfred.

391
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Your private doctor is your doctor that you pay for, right? I don't think this guy has a do--just I guess the only thing the doctor does.

392
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 The doctor's like, "Oh, man. Hope Phoenix Jones gets shot tonight. I really need to make a car payment. Ah."

393
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Everyone has a private doctor, journalist. You're trying to make it sound like he basically is a superhero. I mean, he's stopping crime. That's great. That's really good.

394
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 But I also--I'm super suspicious about a lot of the stuff, a lot of the adventures that you guys are having.

395
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Where I grew up, you would watch people beat each other up and you'd be like, "Okay, do you want to keep sitting in this Burger King or should we leave?"

396
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Because we're not getting in the middle of that. Like, the only time you would get in the middle--you rarely see this. I'm trying to think of a time that I'd seen this.

397
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 The only time you'd ever get in the middle of a fight is when it was someone who was much bigger than the other person.

398
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And even then, it was like--I remember once I came across the fight and it was between a guy who was, I don't know, a 200-pound weightlifter out of prison

399
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 and his 19, 18-year-old daughter and he was throttling her and I just walked up and I was like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."

400
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Now, what I did was I just put my hands on his shoulders. I was like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa." I knew both of them.

401
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 "Whoa, whoa, whoa, man. Come on. Come on. Come on." And you let her go.

402
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 You put my hands on him to let him know, "No, I'm here. I'm standing behind you." You're overreacting.

403
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 "Let's let--I didn't jump in the middle of them and go, 'Stop, evil doer,' because now I'm escalating it."

404
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Perfect example, one day Phoenix Jones was walking down the street and he saw two men arguing and he did jump in the middle of them.

405
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And one of them got him in the headlock. The other guy pulled out a gun and broke his nose, started pistol whipping him in the face.

406
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And then they both left. So you don't really jump in the middle of fights. It's super not smart.

407
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 That's why domestic violence incidents are so dangerous for cops.

408
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 I made an offhand reference to that in the last episode. I was like, "Cops hate doing those."

409
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Because what happens is you go up, knock on the door, the cops come in, guys fight and the wife, the wife's fighting the husband,

410
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 you start to separate them and then they're like, "Get off my wife and now you're fighting two people at once.

411
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 They hate doing domestic violence stuff." So anyways, I mean, like, yeah, I think it's cool to fight crime,

412
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 but I don't think it's feasible in that way. I think that's one of the follies of youth.

413
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 I don't know how many of these real life superheroes exist in their 40s and their 50s, because as you get older you go,

414
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 "I'll just make a phone call to the police." Or, "I'll just don't..." I mean, you can give sandwiches out to anybody.

415
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Maybe also, that's the weird thing about it. There seems to be a weird egotistical thing about this.

416
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Because can't you just hand out sandwiches to the police? Not the police, I don't need sandwiches.

417
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Can't you just hand out sandwiches to the homeless people anyways? Why do you need the costume?

418
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 But, like Bane once said, "Nobody cared about me until I wore the mask."

419
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 If Phoenix Jones was just out doing handing out sandwiches and stuff like that, would anyone have paid attention to him?

420
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Now, Phoenix Jones actually has retired now. He's retired.

421
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 He was on a podcast called the Northwest Nerd podcast, NW Nerd podcast.

422
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And he gives this quote. Kind of heartbreaking. We've had a lot of fun at this dude's expense.

423
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 We have a quote. This is in March of 2019.

424
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Quote, "I've seen what people do to each other, and I live with it every day.

425
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Every day I live with horrible, horrible things.

426
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And I think to myself, apparently he's Barack Obama now, and I think to myself, I made a difference.

427
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 But I didn't make a difference. It didn't make a difference."

428
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 The difference was supposed to be the people who saw a superhero being inspired to not act this way anymore.

429
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 We have not gotten that lesson. We didn't get it at all.

430
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 The shots, the stabbings, the bullets. It wasn't worth it. No one got it.

431
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Maybe I stopped an individual situation, but people were supposed to get better.

432
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 So he was wearing a suit as a symbol. He was wearing a suit to inspire the population of Seattle and hopefully the world.

433
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Let's see this man. He fought crime from 2009 to 2019.

434
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 And ton of stuff. He'd pop up in the media every once in a while for being one sort of crazy antique or another.

435
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 He says that he stopped a bunch of people from blowing up City Hall in Seattle.

436
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Again, I don't believe that. I don't believe that's true.

437
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I believe that he was at a May Day protest. Apparently May--

438
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 You're like, "That was just a poignant--" How do you pronounce that?

439
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 There was such a great moment. Now you're back to making fun of this guy.

440
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And you can't pronounce poignant.

441
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 But anyways, on May 1st, 2012, Phoenix Jones, El Calbrero, and Midnight Jack

442
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 were undercover at a Black Block protest.

443
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 "Raw! Hate the U.S. Hate the U.S. Down with Banks!"

444
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 And the superheroes are undercover and they hear some guys being like, "Hey, you got the explosives? You're-- yep, right here. Right here in this bag.

445
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 It's full of dynamite and a bunch of other-- of comical bombs.

446
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 There's a bomb with a giant fuse out of it. This is bomb on it. Good.

447
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Now let's just get these to City Hall and blow it up!

448
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Then everyone will agree with our anarchist ways.

449
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 That's the best way to achieve people to come to our point of view.

450
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Terrorism! Phoenix Jones, El Calbrero, and Midnight Jack look at each other.

451
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 They go and they tell the cops, "Hey, those guys are gonna blow up City Hall."

452
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And the cops refuse to stop it.

453
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 So the trio of heroes have to beat them to City Hall.

454
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And while they're there, they start getting beat up and apparently one of them--

455
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 I don't recognize this, but one of the superheroes sprayed the protesters with pepper spray and they prevented--

456
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 they prevented the bombing.

457
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 What I think happened was some knuckleheads in the crowd.

458
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 You always get some weirdos like, "You know what would be awesome, dude? You know, to really show them if we blew up that building and someone else being like, 'Yeah!'

459
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And I know that that guy's just running his mouth.

460
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Most people know they're just running their mouth.

461
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 That's why if they went to the cops and said, "Hey, this guy's talking about blowing up a building."

462
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 "Oh, yeah, whatever."

463
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 I don't think they actually had comically-comically-sized bombs on them.

464
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 And the police refuse to do nothing. The police are part of the plan. They're like, "Oh, yes.

465
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Only we could--only we have the guts to blow up the Capitol, but these black-block protesters, they will do it."

466
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 I don't believe that story.

467
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 I believe that they overheard someone threatening to blow something up, i.e. they're on any college campus, right?

468
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 There's always radicals on every level, basically anywhere young people gather.

469
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 You're gonna get people talking about blowing up this or blowing up that.

470
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 So, you're like, "Jason, where do you hang out?"

471
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 You're like, "Where are you going?"

472
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 They're like, "Bomb threats! It's no big deal."

473
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 "What? They're threatening to blow that stuff up?"

474
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 "I don't get it. There's just smoldering ruins all behind me."

475
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I'm like, "Fake news! Uh-uh-uh-uh."

476
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 "Yes, I'll hold this bag of bombs that are lit."

477
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 "What?"

478
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 "No, but anyways, I've heard tons of weirdo threats like that."

479
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 "Anyways, so he retires, March 2019."

480
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 And I hope you don't--I hope you guys don't. I kind of like Phoenix Shows, right?

481
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Like, I'm making fun of all this stuff, but at the same time, I admire him.

482
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 I know the episode, it seems to be a little weird, 'cause I'm like totally making fun of this guy,

483
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 but I get where his heart is at.

484
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Like I said, if I was younger and wasn't as, like, realizing how the world worked,

485
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 if I was much younger and I didn't understand logic, I would also want to go out to fight crime.

486
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 But it's just, you can't really do that.

487
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 I think--I've always said this, you can't save the world, but you can save the people in it.

488
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 You can affect lives one at a time.

489
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Handing out food to the homeless, that's awesome.

490
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Not now. Don't do it now. Stay inside. Don't do any of this stuff now.

491
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 But when things--when this is all over, community service is great.

492
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Starting your own community service is totally fine, too.

493
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 If there's like groups in the area, you don't necessarily want to work with them.

494
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 There's tons of stuff you can do. I totally agree with that.

495
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 And I enjoy that part of it.

496
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 At the same time, you can--I think you'd be more effective working with a drug prevention program

497
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 with middle school students and high school students than you would be beating up a drug dealer.

498
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Because then the other drug dealer's going to be like, "Great, now my territory has expanded

499
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 because you beat this guy up."

500
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 So, or just become a cop or a judge or a lawyer or anything.

501
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 There's a lot of different ways you can do this without putting on a mask.

502
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 But he retires in 2019.

503
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Now that all the superheroes are gone in Seattle, there's whispers of a super criminal in the city.

504
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 An unstoppable drug dealer.

505
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 So maybe these superheroes were actually doing some good.

506
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Because now you have a drug dealer who's moving a lot of product.

507
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 There's a drug dealer operating in Seattle that the police didn't even know about.

508
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 They know drugs are being sold. Obviously, that's part of their job.

509
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 They're not selling the drugs, but part of their job will sum up the cops might,

510
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 but part of their job is to track and stop drug dealers.

511
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 So they know drugs are coming through.

512
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 But finally, this informant, this confidential informant for the police goes,

513
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 "I'm surprised that nobody has caught this drug dealer yet."

514
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 The cops are like, "What drug dealer?"

515
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 And they're like, "There's a really big drug dealer operating in Seattle.

516
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 You guys don't even know about it."

517
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Police are like, "Well, okay, okay, Einstein. Don't leave us in suspense.

518
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 You're an informant. You're supposed to inform us.

519
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Go try to be dramatic."

520
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 And the informant goes, "One of the biggest drug dealers that is out right now that you can't catch

521
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 is Phoenix Jones."

522
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 Police begin an investigation of Phoenix Jones just months after announcing his retirement.

523
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 He retires in March of 2019.

524
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 By November, the police are setting up deals online to buy Mali or MDMA.

525
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 But they can't catch him. He's slick.

526
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 They're making these deals and when he makes an appointment to show up at this spot to move the product,

527
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 he's not there. He's at a different spot.

528
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 The drops are changing. Everything is constantly moving.

529
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 It takes three months of them tracking him down before they finally arrest the former superhero,

530
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 Phoenix Jones, with four grams of cocaine and 31 grams of an unknown white powdery substance.

531
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 I mean, it's probably not confectionary sugar, right?

532
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 It's most likely the MDMA. They caught him with distribution.

533
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 They're charging him with drug dealing, all of this stuff.

534
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 And at his bail hearing, the police are like, "Don't do not let this guy out on bail."

535
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 And the judge let him out on bail.

536
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 So he's walking free. He's probably self-quarantined now, but...

537
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 That is the story of Phoenix Jones.

538
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 A man whose broken window caused him to wage a one-man war on crime for 10 years.

539
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 And then for a couple years, he was with other people.

540
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 But you get the point.

541
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 The Dark Knight, you guys knew I was going to say this.

542
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 The Dark Knight had that great quote, "You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."

543
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 And that fits this perfectly.

544
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 A man who risked his life.

545
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 And he could pronounce that word correctly.

546
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 A man who risked his life.

547
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 He did get stabbed. He did get shot.

548
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 He went to his private doctor.

549
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 He went to his private doctor who worked at Kaiser.

550
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 A man who put his life on the line to save us.

551
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Us homo sapiens. Us normal people.

552
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 And in the end, he became disillusioned with the hero thing.

553
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 For 10 years he put on that costume.

554
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 For 10 years, he went out and saved people.

555
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 And each night, as the sun was rising, that's the morning.

556
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Each morning, when the sun was rising and was headed back to his secret headquarters, a house that he lived in with his family.

557
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Every morning he thought, "I made a difference tonight.

558
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 I became a symbol. People will change."

559
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 But for 10 years the sun rose and the sun set.

560
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 And nothing changed.

561
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 The people of Seattle continued to use drugs, to beat each other up.

562
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 To beat him up. That never changed either.

563
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 10 years he became disillusioned and said enough.

564
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 Tired of being a symbol.

565
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Tired of risking my life.

566
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 It's time to put away the cowl.

567
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Become a citizen.

568
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 And then become a drug dealer.

569
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 And then he became part of the problem.

570
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 And every morning, as he walked back to his house, a pocket full of cash, the other pocket empty, because there were use to be drugs in it, he thought,

571
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 "I couldn't be a symbol of hope, so I will be the problem.

572
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 I will be the drug dealer.

573
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 I will make money for me.

574
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 Nothing else matters. Just me."

575
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 How the mighty have fallen.

576
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 From hero to zero.

577
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 From Phoenix Jones, the superhero.

578
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 To Benjamin...

579
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 [laughs]

580
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 This is his real name.

581
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 From Phoenix Jones.

582
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 From Benjamin...

583
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 John Francis.

584
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 From Benjamin...

585
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 John Francis Fodor.

586
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 From the lofty superhero name of Phoenix Jones.

587
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 To man on trial.

588
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Benjamin John Francis Fodor.

589
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 We can't choose fate.

590
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Some people are fated to be successful.

591
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Some people are fated to slip and fall on glass.

592
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 The things we do with what fate gives us,

593
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 that either makes us a survivor,

594
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 or makes us become disillusioned,

595
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 quit, and become the very thing you've always fought against.

596
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 Which to me, is the greatest tragedy of all.

597
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
