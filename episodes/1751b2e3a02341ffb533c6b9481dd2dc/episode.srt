 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,920
 A Russian super weapon backfires.

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,200
 A bizarre vandal strikes a small town in Virginia.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,040
 And then we take a look at the story of Turnbull Canyon,

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,160
 a winding little piece of road in California,

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,280
 but it is no one to hold Satan worshipers

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,400
 and drifters who kill without warning today

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,680
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,260
 (upbeat music)

23
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,840
 (upbeat music)

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,980
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,100
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,260
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

27
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,180
 I'm having a great day.

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,780
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

29
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,460
 We got a lot of stuff to get through today,

30
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,020
 so we're just gonna get started.

31
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,080
 We're gonna go with this.

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,500
 The first two stories are actually incredibly recent,

33
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,580
 so I wanted to kind of put them in one episode

34
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,420
 'cause they're really kind of going on right now.

35
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,420
 But let's start off on our journey of the weird in Russia.

36
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,020
 We're headed to Russia, mother Russia, the icy continent.

37
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,260
 I have nothing else to describe Russia.

38
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,740
 Anyways, they have funny looking buildings.

39
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,980
 We go to Russia.

40
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,080
 Let's all hop on board.

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,340
 We're just gonna walk there.

42
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,260
 Takes us a long time, but we get to Russia.

43
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,940
 And the date is August 8th, 2019.

44
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,540
 So last week, really?

45
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,620
 Unless you're listening to this episode in the future.

46
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,940
 People are hanging out in town,

47
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,940
 this little Russian town called Severodosvinsk.

48
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,980
 Severovinsk, Severovinsk.

49
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,780
 Anyways, it's a town in Russia.

50
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,460
 People are hanging out in this town.

51
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,980
 And they start to get news filtering to the town

52
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,980
 saying, hey, hey, they're walking down the street.

53
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,180
 Guys like, oh, I don't feel so good.

54
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,620
 I wonder, I don't feel so good.

55
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,060
 My clothes are starting to get a little tight.

56
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,900
 What's going on here?

57
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,020
 Someone runs out of the house and it's like,

58
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,060
 "Everyone, everyone run to the store

59
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,540
 "and take your iodine pills or buy them first

60
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,500
 "and then take your iodine pills."

61
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,380
 We're like, why?

62
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,580
 Their skin starts to turn green

63
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,940
 because radiation had spiked in the town.

64
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,460
 Everyone's starting to mutate.

65
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,980
 People are levitating cars.

66
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,580
 One of them can suck the power from other people.

67
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,220
 So for 40 minutes, the radiation spiked in this town.

68
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,940
 Now, Russia, the government is not saying anything.

69
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,220
 They're just like, (hums)

70
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,060
 So people are freaking out.

71
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,980
 Why is the radiation levels going up in this town?

72
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,420
 But after 40 minutes, they started to go down

73
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,100
 and everyone, whew, and their mutations disappeared.

74
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,660
 And one guy was in mid-flight and he's like, "Ah, it dies."

75
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,420
 Now, so what we think has happened,

76
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,900
 because again, the Russian government

77
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,180
 really isn't giving a lot of details on what's going on,

78
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,700
 what we know and we being the rest of the world,

79
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,660
 you may know more if you live in Russia,

80
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,660
 or a member of Russian parliament, is that there was a,

81
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,860
 like a giant oil rig type platform out in the Arctic Sea.

82
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,020
 So it was by that town, it was by that town, right?

83
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,780
 And they were testing or building some sort of new weapon

84
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,780
 and it exploded and it killed five scientists.

85
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,740
 Now, these scientists have been named

86
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,380
 and they are now considered heroes

87
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,740
 of the Russian government, which I mean,

88
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,020
 in the pursuit of science, they died, they gave their lives.

89
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,660
 But these were like the best of the best.

90
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,380
 These were some of Russia's best scientists

91
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,860
 on this platform working on this.

92
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,380
 And we don't know what they were working on,

93
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,300
 but because of the radiation spike

94
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,820
 and because of the area it was in

95
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,260
 and just general intelligence,

96
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,060
 this is what they believed they were building.

97
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,900
 This is nuts.

98
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,740
 They call it the 9M730 beer vestnik.

99
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,180
 It is known as a vengeance weapon.

100
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,780
 There's a, I was reading an article about it

101
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,620
 and one of the people said,

102
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,100
 the only reason why you would ever use this weapon,

103
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,900
 it's in, the quote was,

104
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,180
 it's impractical for anything short

105
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,340
 of an all out nuclear war.

106
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,500
 It's a missile, not just a nuclear missile,

107
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 but the fuel is nuclear.

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,820
 So it has unlimited range.

109
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,140
 It has a nuclear fuel source.

110
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,180
 It doesn't, it's not using like jet fuel

111
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,220
 or anything like that.

112
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,700
 Rocket fuel, I guess is what it would be.

113
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,180
 It's not using any sort of traditional propulsion.

114
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,860
 It's powered by nuclear power.

115
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,380
 This weapon is supposedly designed to be used

116
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,180
 after all other nukes have dropped.

117
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,100
 This is basically like an FU

118
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,900
 to whatever country they're attacking,

119
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,640
 most likely America or China.

120
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,340
 And it's impractical other than an all out nuclear war

121
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,500
 because the engine itself is basically a dirty bomb.

122
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,620
 So you wouldn't use it as like a tactical strike.

123
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,300
 This weapon was built for the last stages

124
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,140
 of a nuclear war.

125
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,580
 A doomsday weapon, an apocalyptic weapon.

126
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,220
 That's what we believe blew up.

127
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,460
 There's another suspicion,

128
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,500
 I thought this was crazy too,

129
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,100
 there was another suspicion that what blew up

130
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,780
 was they were building a missile,

131
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,700
 a top secret missile that could fly

132
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,260
 eight times the speed of sound.

133
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,100
 And just for comparison,

134
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,280
 that's as fast as Iron Man flies in the comic books.

135
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,660
 That is how fast a fictional superhero flies.

136
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,460
 His top speed is like 8.8 times the speed of sound.

137
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,540
 They were building a missile that can go,

138
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,940
 we'll say almost as fast as a cartoon hero.

139
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,900
 That's the level of weaponry that's being built out there.

140
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,820
 'Cause you can't stop it.

141
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,300
 There's no anti-missile system

142
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
 that can stop something that's hypersonic,

143
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,580
 just doesn't exist.

144
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,620
 But yeah, coming soon to a neighborhood near you.

145
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,740
 You know, in Hood River here where I live,

146
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,100
 we have Hanford nuclear power waste dump.

147
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,820
 It used to be a nuclear power plant,

148
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,900
 I don't know, 40, 50 miles down the river.

149
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,980
 It's a total mess over there

150
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,220
 and they've tried cleaning it up

151
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,580
 but they don't know what to do with it.

152
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,260
 That is actually a third phase target

153
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,700
 for the Soviet Union, Russia now.

154
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,980
 The first strikes you wanna take out

155
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,020
 like military infrastructure and heads of state,

156
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,180
 chain of command, stuff like that.

157
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,180
 Second strike was big cities where you just wanna,

158
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,500
 so the first strike was basically,

159
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,260
 let's see what we can do to their military might.

160
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,980
 But if we're still lobbing missiles at them,

161
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,460
 they're like, okay, now let's target the civilian population.

162
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,300
 Let's start taking out major cities,

163
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,860
 financial centers and stuff like that,

164
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,280
 'cause now we want to bring them to heel.

165
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,820
 But then they have what's called third phase,

166
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,580
 which is basically like that one, just the effort.

167
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,940
 Let's just do as much damage as we can to our enemy

168
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,580
 and Hanford, or Hanford, however you pronounce it,

169
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,380
 is a third phase strike.

170
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,080
 Basically, if a nuclear missile detonated there,

171
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,500
 it would irradiate the Pacific Northwest.

172
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,780
 It would basically turn miles and miles of soil

173
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,380
 into a giant dirty bomb.

174
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,500
 You turn Pacific Northwest itself into a dirty bomb.

175
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,060
 I welcome the new mutant powers

176
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,460
 I will get during the nuclear war.

177
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,140
 I'm not afraid, but I'm hoping I get a cool mutation

178
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,580
 like healing, I guess I would need that,

179
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,900
 'cause I'd be dying of radiation poisoning all the time.

180
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,940
 Telepathy, I think, would get boring.

181
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,020
 But I want super strength.

182
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,500
 Flying doesn't make sense unless you're invulnerable,

183
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,180
 'cause otherwise you're gonna be hitting birds all the time.

184
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,320
 People just shoot you out of the sky.

185
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,980
 You need to have one of the big ones.

186
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,380
 A lot of people go, I wish I was invisible, no, lame.

187
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,860
 Telepathy's kinda lame because people,

188
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,620
 I don't think, are thinking about you that much.

189
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,300
 You'd be talking to a girl and she'd be thinking

190
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,860
 about someone else, she'd be like, oh, this sucks.

191
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,980
 I thought I was gonna be reading

192
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,020
 all these sexy, sexy thoughts.

193
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,340
 Strength, super strength, invulnerability, regeneration,

194
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,860
 teleport, no, teleportation,

195
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,260
 it's like I'd get stuck in something.

196
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,100
 Okay, but let's go ahead, I welcome my mutant powers though.

197
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,660
 Well, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

198
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,500
 Next story, super, super short, super, super mysterious.

199
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,360
 Happened August 11th, 2019, so just a couple days ago.

200
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,860
 We're in Henrico, let's all use our mutant powers

201
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,860
 to fly now to Henrico County, Virginia.

202
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,820
 Stop, evil doers.

203
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,700
 It's totally peaceful suburb.

204
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,500
 Actually, no, there is an evil doer in this story.

205
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,140
 This is actually gonna work.

206
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,500
 We're flying around.

207
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
 You're like, hey, Jason, look.

208
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,980
 And you're like my kid's sidekick.

209
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,220
 I'm like, what is it, young lean?

210
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,660
 It's a mysterious man and we're like looking.

211
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,780
 We're hovering in the air looking at the student.

212
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,020
 And we see a man walking through the neighborhoods

213
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,700
 of little suburbs in Henrico County, Virginia.

214
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,820
 And he's carrying a big box and I'm like,

215
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,140
 ooh, could that possibly be a bomb?

216
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,820
 And you're like, golly, jinkies, I don't think so.

217
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,420
 That is a TV set.

218
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,220
 I'm like, oh, you are right.

219
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,660
 So we land, the gimmick's done.

220
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,140
 That gimmick was going nowhere.

221
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,580
 We land, we go back in our civilian clothes.

222
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,040
 We've real, now we're hiding in the bushes,

223
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
 like a bunch of weirdos.

224
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,540
 We're hiding in the bushes and we want,

225
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,700
 like we normally do in our civilian clothes.

226
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,500
 And we're watching a man carry an old CRT television set

227
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,220
 up to a house and we look at each other.

228
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,100
 We're like, oh, this is weird.

229
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,260
 And he sets it down on the porch

230
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,540
 and turns and walks away.

231
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,260
 And that's when we notice his head is an old television set.

232
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,700
 Dun, dun, dun.

233
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,660
 Now this isn't creepypasta.

234
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,160
 This isn't rumor.

235
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,700
 There is videotape of this.

236
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,860
 You know, they have those little ring doorbell cameras.

237
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,860
 So when people walk up to your front door,

238
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,140
 it goes off and it records what's going on.

239
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,300
 They have footage of this guy walking through the town,

240
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,460
 walking up to a door, putting down an old CRT.

241
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,780
 And he's wearing like all blue,

242
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,540
 like blue work slacks, like dickies.

243
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,060
 And then like a dickies top.

244
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,220
 All the labels are covered up, which is smart.

245
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,780
 He's wearing a big CRT on his head,

246
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,620
 big old tube television set.

247
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,620
 Now, in one night, this guy, or men, we don't know,

248
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,980
 faces covered up by a television set,

249
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,460
 dropped off 50 big giant television sets.

250
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,060
 Now some of them were only like 13 inches,

251
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,380
 but if you know those old TVs, if you grew up in that,

252
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,740
 those are still quite heavy,

253
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,900
 but some of them were bigger,

254
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,940
 some were like 27 inches and stuff like that.

255
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,740
 But anyways, 50 television sets,

256
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,380
 a little over 50 television sets,

257
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,140
 appeared on front porches all over this small,

258
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,620
 sleepy little suburb in the course of one night.

259
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,500
 And it's funny 'cause they called the cops out

260
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
 and there's video of the cops having to lug

261
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,180
 these television sets and they're throwing them

262
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,260
 in a big moving van.

263
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,580
 So I mean, that sucks.

264
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,900
 There's their Monday having to pick up all these things.

265
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,280
 But the police said, listen, this is probably a prank.

266
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,580
 We don't know what's going on,

267
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,900
 but it is illegal 'cause it's illegal dumping.

268
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,740
 And the residents seem to be pretty amused by it.

269
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,500
 They're like, it's kind of funny.

270
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,360
 Like someone must have a lot of time in their hands

271
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,900
 and obviously a lot of television sets.

272
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,620
 But what's weird about it is that this happened

273
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,860
 in Henrico County.

274
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,540
 It happened in the same county, different little town,

275
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,460
 but in the same county last August.

276
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,380
 So the same month a year ago,

277
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,300
 someone dropped 20 television sets off,

278
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,860
 one at each different house.

279
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,700
 Never caught the guy.

280
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,520
 He wasn't on video.

281
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,560
 Now they have video of him wearing this television head.

282
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,600
 College prank, hazing ritual,

283
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,100
 TV repair guy trying to get rid of some product.

284
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,480
 Or what if that's not a mask?

285
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,360
 What if that CRT helmet is his real head

286
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,520
 and he's dropping off his babies at people's houses

287
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,320
 hoping someone will take care of them?

288
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,640
 But you see, then police take the babies

289
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,840
 and put them in their impound lot

290
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,880
 and then the babies hatch.

291
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,080
 And the next time you get pulled over by a cop,

292
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,920
 you're like, oh, that's weird.

293
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
 Cop walks up and has television forehead.

294
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,960
 And they're just taking the government over from the inside.

295
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
 One police department at a time.

296
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,920
 Now obviously that's, I'm joking around,

297
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,760
 but that'd be pretty awesome.

298
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,600
 As long as the television head overlords don't bother me.

299
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,440
 I think it's a prank.

300
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,120
 I actually think it's quite a funny prank,

301
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,920
 but yeah, it is also illegal dumping.

302
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,120
 So if these guys get caught,

303
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
 they'll get a fine or something like that.

304
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,720
 It'll be interesting to see if they do it again next year.

305
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,960
 Maybe it'll become a tradition.

306
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,040
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

307
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,600
 Our next story is the story of Turnbull Canyon.

308
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,080
 Turnbull Canyon is a winding canyon,

309
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,800
 little winding country road.

310
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,520
 It's about a four mile loop.

311
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,680
 It's down in California.

312
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,040
 It's in Whittier, California.

313
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,760
 Here's the, so weird USA, we've talked about them before.

314
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,760
 They're a mixed bag as far as their research goes.

315
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,560
 And this was their headline.

316
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,520
 This was their headline.

317
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,640
 Saintness, child snatcher, and drifters

318
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,320
 in Turnbull Canyon, Whittier.

319
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
 And I was like, "What, that sounds interesting.

320
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,240
 "A little dubious of the source,

321
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,280
 "but we got Satanists, we got babies getting kidnapped,

322
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,720
 "which I'm not a fan of, I'm not a fan of that."

323
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,080
 But drifters, you got like drifters,

324
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,240
 like homeless people hiding in the bushes with sickles,

325
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,480
 cutting people up.

326
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,520
 Anyways, supposedly this place,

327
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,560
 this bushy little canyon, little sagebrush,

328
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,720
 let's take a walk along the canyon.

329
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,840
 It's super dusty, we're all dirty now.

330
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,140
 There's a tumbleweed rolling by, lizards on rocks.

331
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,320
 Looking at us and stuff.

332
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
 Just walking, walking through the canyon, right?

333
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,240
 Keeping an eye out for them drifters,

334
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,640
 keeping an eye out for saint worshipers,

335
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,560
 hoping to rescue some babies, but we don't see any of them.

336
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,680
 But before we wrestle a drifter,

337
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,200
 we have to talk about the history of this place.

338
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
 Supposedly it was known as, yes, it's the episode

339
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,560
 where Jason can't pronounce anything,

340
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,200
 hut, hut you conga, hut you conga.

341
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,040
 So the natives in the area called it that,

342
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,600
 and it means either the dark place

343
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
 or the place of the devil,

344
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,440
 depending on what translation you go with.

345
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,280
 And the natives in the area stayed away from it.

346
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,880
 That's part of the old legend.

347
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,880
 In 1845, the Spanish governor of Alta, California,

348
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,600
 which was the region there, gave it to two settlers.

349
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,160
 And then the natives started raiding the property

350
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,320
 'cause they didn't want the settlers there.

351
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,760
 So right there should start setting off your skeptics alarm.

352
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,480
 If the legend is the natives stayed away from the area,

353
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,680
 and then they started doing raids on the area,

354
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,760
 and later started working on the area

355
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,880
 that doesn't jive at all.

356
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,480
 I couldn't find any reference to the place

357
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,680
 actually being called that outside of these ghost stories.

358
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,720
 So a little skeptical right off the bat.

359
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,680
 But we got a lot of other good elements, right?

360
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,280
 The past have may have been added

361
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,600
 and may have been like put a little lipstick on it,

362
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,320
 but we'll keep going forward.

363
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,920
 So we keep walking down Turnbull Canyon,

364
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,080
 keeping an eye out.

365
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,480
 What?

366
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
 What's that?

367
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,840
 It's just a vulture flying by.

368
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,480
 And then you get a little suspicious

369
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,640
 'cause they start circling us.

370
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,000
 I'm like, "Oh no, that's fine."

371
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
 They do that all the time.

372
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
 I see it all the time in cartoons.

373
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
 You're like, "This isn't a cartoon, bro."

374
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,240
 We're walking through the canyon, sun's starting to set.

375
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,520
 You're no longer scared of the stories of the natives

376
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,640
 calling to the place of the devil.

377
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,360
 You think, "Yeah, it's probably pretty skeptical, right?"

378
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,520
 But let's get into some more recent events.

379
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,640
 So the sun completely sets.

380
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,120
 (cat meows)

381
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,960
 You're around.

382
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,800
 Where'd that owl come from?

383
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
 I like it.

384
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,020
 So during the depression, there was a rumor in the area.

385
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,820
 The Great Depression, I should say,

386
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,340
 not just an A depression,

387
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,780
 some guys all sad and a rumor starts.

388
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,620
 During the Great Depression,

389
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,100
 people were having a hard time feeding their kids.

390
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,460
 So this part's true.

391
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,220
 This happened all over America

392
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,740
 and probably other parts of the world.

393
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,000
 Probably happens today, unfortunately,

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,140
 but people had a hard time taking care of their kids

395
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,660
 so they would sell them off

396
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,100
 to get money to feed themselves,

397
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,500
 which sounds a little cruel,

398
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,580
 but they're figuring, "Ah, I'll sell it to a rich family.

399
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,900
 "It'll be brought up well.

400
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,260
 "I get to eat today and it's a win-win."

401
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,100
 But the rumor became a little more sinister

402
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,420
 because people said that in Turnbull Canyon,

403
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,660
 these wealthy families were buying babies,

404
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,180
 going around like poor people.

405
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,420
 Poor people around the street corner going,

406
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,940
 "Babies, babies."

407
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,620
 And they have a wheelbarrow full of their kids

408
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,480
 and rich people are like, "Oh, awesome."

409
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,820
 They would buy these babies and they said,

410
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,140
 "I will provide them a perfect home."

411
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,380
 And then they have fingers across

412
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,220
 and the guys are like, "Oh, awesome."

413
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,060
 Goes away.

414
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,380
 Guys buying a bunch of bread.

415
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,660
 And the rich people were really Saint worshipers

416
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,580
 and they were sacrificing the babies in the canyon.

417
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,020
 That was a rumor that was going around apparently back then.

418
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,580
 There is no verification of that.

419
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,300
 It's an easy rumor to start and for people to buy into

420
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,580
 because you did have people selling their kids

421
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,860
 and you would never know what happened to those kids.

422
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,820
 So it basically mixes the fact,

423
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,460
 it would basically demonize people

424
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,620
 who did sell their kids and would go,

425
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,540
 "Hey, man, you don't know.

426
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,620
 "You just go into a nice house.

427
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,580
 "You might be like, you know,

428
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,740
 "getting sacrificed to the devil."

429
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,180
 And guys are like, "Oh my God, why'd you tell me that?

430
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,700
 "Now I'm super paranoid.

431
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,300
 "I got these two more kids to sell.

432
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,020
 "Now I don't want to, but I'm gonna 'cause I need to eat."

433
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,780
 That was a rumor that was going around at the time.

434
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,060
 Again, there's no verification of that.

435
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,180
 We could never really prove that either way.

436
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,540
 But people in the area still talk about these things.

437
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,900
 Even today, there are stories of satanic cults

438
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,540
 in this canyon doing these rituals.

439
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,880
 Now at this point, we're walking through Turnbull Canyon.

440
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,880
 The large canyon walls are steep on both sides of us.

441
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,600
 There is no way out but to walk the four mile loop.

442
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,420
 And you're thinking, "Jason, why didn't you tell me

443
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,980
 "about the more recent Saint-Warsher Wars

444
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,940
 "before I started walking through here?"

445
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,440
 Now it is almost pitch black.

446
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,660
 The moon is just kind of peeking over

447
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,580
 one of the sheer faces of the canyon.

448
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,600
 Super spooky.

449
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,180
 Now, people are posting online about running into

450
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,980
 Satan worshipers and things like that.

451
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,260
 You had one guy tell a story that him and his buddies

452
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,460
 were driving through the canyon

453
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,540
 and they went on some off-road, right?

454
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,380
 (whooshing)

455
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,020
 And they get out of their car and they start walking.

456
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,260
 They're ghost hunters, right?

457
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
 And then they hear a bunch of hooded people

458
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,100
 walking behind them.

459
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,260
 I don't know how they could tell you.

460
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,100
 They sounded like they could hear the hoods

461
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,220
 shifting against their head.

462
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,460
 They ran and they jumped in the bushes

463
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,700
 and they saw all these people in black hoods

464
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,500
 start doing a chant right in front of them conveniently enough.

465
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,900
 And then cops showed up and everyone scattered

466
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,020
 and they hid in the bushes and then one more,

467
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,340
 they saw like black boots walk by the bush.

468
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,500
 They're like, "Oh."

469
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,060
 And then the person left and they all ran back

470
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,980
 to their car and there's no police reports verifying that.

471
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,940
 That's one person's story, but that's a common story

472
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,100
 that goes on with Turnbull Canyon.

473
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
 People in the area go there for ghost hunting.

474
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,580
 It's fairly remote.

475
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,780
 It's not like in the middle of the boonies.

476
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,500
 Like you could get there,

477
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,980
 but it's also not on the beaten path.

478
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,580
 It would be a good place to go to look for ghosts,

479
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,260
 to smoke weed, stuff like that.

480
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,940
 So people still talk about Saint worshipers there

481
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,380
 as well now today.

482
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,020
 Now there have been murders linked to the area.

483
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,380
 There was a young woman who was shot in the head

484
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,060
 and it took him a couple of years to arrest the guy,

485
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,740
 that seemed to be drug related.

486
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,020
 It was two gang bangers who shot her

487
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,780
 and they set her body on fire or something like that.

488
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,020
 But people just, you know how stories evolve in these areas.

489
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,180
 People stumble across the body that's burned up

490
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,660
 and be like, "Ah, Saint worshipers."

491
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
 And then after years of police investigation,

492
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,700
 they go, "Oh no, it's actually these two idiot gang bangers

493
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,500
 who shot her over like a drug dead or something like that."

494
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,580
 There was a plane crash in the canyon.

495
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,060
 I thought this one was fascinating.

496
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,940
 There was a plane crash in the canyon.

497
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,940
 In 1952, I read this and then I had to go find verification

498
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,060
 of it and I came across this guy who said he's done

499
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,940
 thousands of hours of research on Turnbull Canyon.

500
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,200
 This was his account.

501
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,980
 1952, this plane crash is 29 people were killed.

502
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,940
 21 of them were children.

503
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,420
 But see, when everyone saw the plane crash

504
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,260
 or they heard the plane crash,

505
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,100
 it was kind of far away,

506
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,580
 but when rescuers finally got to the area

507
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,940
 and they started digging the bodies out,

508
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,780
 everyone on the plane was killed.

509
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,940
 21 of them were children,

510
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,540
 or the other eight were also killed as well.

511
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,500
 They're not invincible because they're not children.

512
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,100
 When they bought the bodies back to the corner,

513
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,220
 none of the bodies could be identified.

514
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,140
 They were all just basically bodies

515
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,180
 that no one had ever seen before.

516
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,140
 Not like just strangers,

517
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,700
 not like they're out of town or something,

518
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,860
 there was no record that these people ever existed.

519
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,260
 There was no record that the plane was ever registered.

520
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,300
 So it was just like a ghost airplane

521
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,420
 full of ghost people basically.

522
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,860
 And the rumor in the area was,

523
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,420
 was that Satan worshipers,

524
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,260
 like the dark magic of the area

525
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,140
 actually pulled the plane out of the sky.

526
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,980
 The canyon itself wanted fresh blood.

527
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,300
 Maybe the plane came out of some sort of portal

528
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,420
 from an alternate dimension or from the future,

529
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,460
 and it was pulled in via dark magic

530
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,220
 into the canyon and blow up.

531
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,540
 The only thing that is true about that statement

532
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,740
 is the plane crash in 1952.

533
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,940
 29 people did die.

534
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,180
 They weren't, there was almost no children, if any.

535
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,500
 It was mostly US servicemen.

536
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,580
 They were all identified

537
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,860
 because they were a US servicemen.

538
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,740
 We have the names of everyone

539
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,020
 who died in that plane crash.

540
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,940
 We know who flew the plane.

541
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,900
 We know who chartered the plane.

542
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,940
 We know what airline company owned the plane.

543
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,180
 We know the airport the plane flew out of

544
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,020
 and where it was headed.

545
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,300
 And it didn't crash due to magic.

546
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,380
 It crashed because it was really foggy

547
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,940
 and the landing gear was down

548
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,580
 and the pilot didn't know it and it hit the rock.

549
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,780
 Now you could say, well, what if Satan made the landing gear

550
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,940
 come down and the Satan's fog machine?

551
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
 Fine, I'll give you that.

552
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,380
 But thousands of hours of research,

553
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,700
 he needed a thousand hours and 10 minutes of research

554
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,260
 because that's the problem with Turnbull Canyon

555
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,100
 is that it's really hard to separate

556
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,500
 the myth from the legend.

557
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,460
 I'm sure that stuff went down there.

558
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,380
 But when one of the stories is back in the 60s

559
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,060
 a bunch of dudes ran this one of my favorite things,

560
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,340
 there used to be an insane asylum in this remote canyon,

561
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,500
 in this desert road.

562
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,740
 There used to be a full-fledged insane asylum.

563
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,940
 It burned down in the 1940s.

564
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,260
 And then in the 1960s, some crazy, far-out, trippy dudes

565
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,980
 was like walking around Turnbull Canyon

566
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,300
 being like, oh man, isn't this cool?

567
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,500
 We got owls and tumbleweed and stuff.

568
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,420
 And they come across the burnt down remains

569
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,580
 of this insane asylum.

570
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,380
 One of the hippies is like, look at me, man, look at me.

571
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,220
 I'm crazy.

572
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,420
 And he sits down in an electroshock chair

573
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,780
 and he puts on the cap.

574
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,740
 He's like, shock me, baby.

575
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,100
 And then the girl hits the switch

576
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,740
 and he actually (imitates explosion)

577
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,380
 gets electrocuted even though the place had

578
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,540
 absolutely no power.

579
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,740
 It was a burned out shell.

580
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,540
 Nothing had existed really in it for 20 years.

581
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,060
 Somehow this hippie gets electrocuted.

582
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,620
 Now, that's not, that's 100% not true.

583
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,620
 There, that not only bends the logic of what ghosts can,

584
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,420
 if a ghost can electrocute you,

585
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,460
 then ghost turning your lights on

586
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,820
 or making your faucet run is so low-level lame.

587
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,420
 Like if a ghost can actually bring electricity

588
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,700
 into a building where there's been no electricity

589
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,900
 for 20 years and give you enough volts

590
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,780
 to blow your brains out,

591
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,940
 I am no longer impressed when people say,

592
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,220
 and then the book fell off the bookcase.

593
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,380
 I'm like, did you die?

594
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,260
 Did you get electrocuted?

595
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,740
 He'd be like, what are you talking about?

596
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,580
 I'm like, do not tell me a ghost story

597
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,060
 that doesn't involve a hippie getting his brains melted.

598
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,860
 And then I'll just leave.

599
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,020
 I hope someday someone invites me

600
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,320
 to a paranormal convention.

601
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,940
 So I don't believe that story.

602
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,260
 Either that story is 100% made,

603
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,500
 and of course I can't verify it.

604
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,180
 People said there is like a bit of a room

605
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,300
 and like a flat looks like something was built out there,

606
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,540
 but other people have said there's no,

607
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,500
 there's no record of an insane asylum out there.

608
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,900
 If that, and I don't, I believe the story's not true,

609
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,380
 but if that story is true,

610
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,580
 it is the greatest ghost encounter of all time.

611
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,780
 It should be, every episode of Ghost Hunters

612
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,360
 should just be people sitting down

613
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,800
 with electro shock elements at that location.

614
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,740
 So let's get to the part I was the most excited about,

615
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,460
 because again, we had sane worshipers,

616
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,260
 child snatchers and drifters.

617
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,060
 I was like, oh, so sane worshipers,

618
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,040
 you can assume like someone walks around

619
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,120
 with a creepy mask on, you go,

620
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,220
 oh, that person's sane worshiper.

621
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,660
 They could just have a fetish.

622
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,620
 They could be a sane worshiper.

623
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,460
 I don't know.

624
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,660
 Child snatchers, that's just horrible.

625
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,380
 I'm like researching that stuff, but a drifter.

626
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,500
 Like a homeless person hiding in the bushes.

627
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,680
 I've had 100 encounters with homeless people over the years.

628
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,980
 I'd say maybe 30% of them are good.

629
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,600
 I've had friends who were homeless.

630
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,260
 There was a time where I lived in my car

631
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
 because I lost my apartment.

632
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,100
 I was going to college.

633
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,940
 I lived in my car.

634
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,780
 But my friends who were homeless

635
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,740
 and they went around Panhandley when I was living in my car,

636
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,140
 I would never consider them drifters or myself a drifter.

637
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,780
 We were still in the same area.

638
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,220
 But like I've run into actual drifters

639
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,100
 and there it's always been an unpleasant experience.

640
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,100
 Generally homeless people themselves are fine,

641
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,060
 but in Hood River, we get a ton of them

642
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,220
 because as the weather kind of warms up,

643
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,340
 they migrate, you get a ton of them.

644
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,020
 So anyways, drifters.

645
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,340
 I'm like drifters, my mortal enemy.

646
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,120
 The blood feud continues.

647
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,900
 I should just do a whole episode about my drifter stories.

648
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,600
 And so as I'm reaching for my screwdriver in my pocket,

649
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,680
 you're like, whoa, whoa, dude.

650
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,880
 You're not getting ready to stab that man over there.

651
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,040
 I'm like, you don't understand the war is today.

652
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,620
 But I was so excited to read about drifters

653
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,120
 because they were saying that drifters

654
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,080
 had killed people in Turnbull Canyon.

655
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,160
 I'm not excited that they're murdering people,

656
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,320
 but I was like, that's something

657
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,800
 that I can see my teeth into.

658
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,460
 That's something that can be verified.

659
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,980
 I can just pick up the bum daily and flip through it

660
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,700
 and go to the drifter murder section.

661
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,260
 It's the biggest part of the newspaper

662
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,420
 and read about it, right?

663
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,100
 So I'm reading this main article in Weird USA

664
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,140
 about Turnbull Canyon and I get to this quote.

665
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,780
 Oh my God, I get to this quote.

666
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,660
 And it says, "I live near Turnbull Canyon."

667
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,340
 This is a guy's first person, obviously.

668
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,940
 "I live near Turnbull Canyon."

669
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,820
 And yes, I've heard all about this.

670
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,200
 "It is one hell of a scary ass place to be in

671
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,960
 "if you're by yourself and you aren't familiar with it."

672
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,640
 I remember seeing people walking around with hoods on,

673
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
 but I'm not sure.

674
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,480
 (laughs)

675
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,320
 That's a little vague.

676
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,840
 Like, could have had hoods on.

677
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,320
 Could have just had a weird haircut.

678
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,240
 I don't know.

679
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,720
 So where did I leave off?

680
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,280
 Oh, I remember seeing people walking around with hoods on,

681
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
 but I'm not sure.

682
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,560
 For sure, though, I know that there are many

683
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,240
 devil worshipers/colds in that area.

684
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,720
 Also, they found some rapist killer hiding there also.

685
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,320
 That was written and I'm reading that and I was like,

686
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,000
 oh, okay, just another piece of the puzzle.

687
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,200
 And then I get to who wrote it.

688
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,920
 They included his name.

689
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,720
 Counterlock.

690
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,160
 Drifting.com.

691
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,380
 And I'm like, my heart sunk.

692
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,500
 Because then I realized that Counterlock

693
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,140
 from drifting.com was one of the drifters.

694
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,020
 Let me re-read you that headline here.

695
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,060
 Let me re-read you that headline.

696
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,340
 Satanist, child snatcher, and drifters

697
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,300
 in Turnbull Canyon, Whittier.

698
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,100
 In that context, would you think Tokyo Drift?

699
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,640
 In that context, would you think a bunch of lowered Hondas

700
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,480
 (mimics car engine)

701
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,360
 going around corners super fast?

702
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,280
 No, not at all.

703
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,480
 Drifters have killed people in this area

704
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,000
 because the road is so curvy, people race out there

705
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,280
 and they drift in their cars and they hit people.

706
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,880
 They hit a police officer, they've hit some people

707
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,840
 standing on the side of the road.

708
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,520
 That is not a, I get, technically, they are drifters,

709
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,960
 but in the context, if you said,

710
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,760
 hey, you wanna go see a movie about same worshipers

711
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,940
 and drifters killing people, you would go,

712
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,460
 oh yeah, is that from Blumhouse?

713
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,300
 What is this?

714
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,940
 Is this some new horror movie coming out?

715
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,900
 And they're like, no, it's Fast and Furious 11,

716
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,780
 where they have to drive their cars

717
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,460
 underneath the statue of Balfament.

718
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,140
 And if they drift just right, they can break the ankles

719
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,300
 of the statue and save humanity from the Satan.

720
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,140
 Go over there.

721
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,780
 You'd be like, what are you talking about?

722
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,980
 That movie doesn't exist.

723
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,780
 That movie would never exist.

724
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,180
 So if someone says, hey, you wanna go see a movie

725
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
 about street racing and drifters, you're like, yeah.

726
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,960
 And then he realizes it's about homeless people

727
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,080
 driving cars.

728
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,580
 Context is important.

729
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,000
 Context is important.

730
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,080
 And I came across that linearly.

731
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,280
 I came across that and I was like, my heart just sunk.

732
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,520
 I was like, are you kidding me?

733
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,080
 Those are the drifters killing people?

734
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,400
 Those drifters kill people all over the place.

735
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
 It's really bad in Tokyo, apparently.

736
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,200
 My thing is this.

737
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,880
 That guy who I read about, who did thousands of hours

738
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,200
 of research and was talking about the plane crash,

739
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,440
 he does this huge write up on the history

740
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,340
 of Turnbull Canyon.

741
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,740
 He's also on drifting.com.

742
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,020
 So apparently drifting.com, a website dedicated

743
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,420
 to getting the best drift out of your car,

744
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,700
 to living life a quarter mile at a time,

745
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,940
 to beating your enemies and winning those pink slips

746
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,100
 and hooking up with some hot girl in a bikini,

747
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,980
 also has an entire section of their form

748
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,060
 dedicated to hauntings of Turnbull Canyon.

749
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,100
 So I guess Turnbull Canyon is really famous among drifters,

750
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,900
 but if I'm going to drifting.com,

751
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,380
 I wanna know how to get like, nauseous to shoot out

752
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,960
 some part of my car, right?

753
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,700
 I wanna learn how to like, spin the wheel just right

754
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,880
 so I can right in front of the ladies and impress them.

755
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,920
 Not ghost planes and saying worshipers

756
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,360
 and all sorts of nonsense.

757
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,840
 Drifting.com, I have an eternal war against drifters

758
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,280
 of all kinds now.

759
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,360
 Not just the homeless people who harass me,

760
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,240
 violently harass me, but you guys spinning around

761
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,040
 in your cars doing those donuts and stuff.

762
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,920
 And a Monquito, so I especially hate donuts.

763
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,380
 Turnbull Canyon is an interesting story

764
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,980
 because after all, you're like Jason,

765
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,120
 you told us this crazy story

766
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,400
 and you pretty much just said,

767
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,520
 "This is why this isn't true,

768
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,700
 this is why this isn't true."

769
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,640
 The child selling thing could possibly be true.

770
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,200
 The electroshock therapy is just hilarious.

771
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
 But what's really interesting,

772
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,800
 and I wanna leave you with this note

773
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,980
 as we're walking through the darkened canyon,

774
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,200
 is that people have come out in the area and said,

775
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,160
 "It's not haunted.

776
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,580
 "I've grown up in this area.

777
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,560
 "Those are just rumors.

778
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,220
 "There are no saint worshipers.

779
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,420
 "There are no child sacrifices.

780
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,360
 "There are no ghost.

781
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,240
 "You guys, you children are foolish.

782
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,940
 "I've lived here all my life."

783
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,480
 I read this, I was looking around online

784
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,540
 'cause I had to do a bunch of research

785
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,860
 on these type of stories to see

786
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,620
 whether or not any of it's true.

787
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,660
 And this one poster was saying,

788
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,980
 "Listen, I've hiked there with my dog

789
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,800
 "all times day and night.

790
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,540
 "It's a very relaxing place.

791
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,820
 "I take my dog, we walk out there,

792
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,040
 "just enjoy the splendor of it all."

793
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,580
 It is definitely not haunted.

794
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,660
 There's no dark magic there.

795
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,540
 There's no baby ritual sacrifices.

796
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,700
 That doesn't happen here.

797
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,980
 But one day I was walking through the canyon

798
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,980
 and I saw a stick.

799
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,420
 And on top of the stick was the severed head of a deer

800
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,780
 that was mounted on it, so I was looking up at the sky.

801
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,100
 And this is her quote, this is her exact quote.

802
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,660
 So I'm not saying that stuff doesn't happen there,

803
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,660
 animal sacrifice to be specific,

804
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,940
 but most of this crap is just urban legend best ignored.

805
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,460
 If the people disputing the urban legends

806
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,060
 have to admit they themselves have seen the signs

807
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,900
 of ritual animal sacrifice,

808
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,680
 that doesn't do the debunkers a lot of good.

809
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,180
 It's possible that the canyon does hold

810
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,520
 some dark mysteries.

811
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,660
 It's right on the precipice of the perfect place

812
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,020
 to commit some sort of heinous act.

813
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,980
 But you'd also have to be aware

814
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,420
 that some ghost hunters could stumble across you at any time,

815
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,220
 like we were walking down Turnbull Canyon late at night.

816
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,460
 You could go there and use the fear of the area,

817
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,100
 use the history of the area.

818
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,340
 Whether or not it was true,

819
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,380
 people believe that the place is soaked in evil

820
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,700
 and it basically could become some sort of topa.

821
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,140
 People think the area is evil,

822
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,420
 so it gets slightly evil over the years.

823
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,180
 And you go to this place to commit your sacrifices

824
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,340
 out of the eyes of all the Prine people around you.

825
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,620
 Gotta be careful of those drifters

826
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,680
 coming around the corner, but they're going too fast.

827
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,860
 They don't see you and your cohorts

828
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,180
 in the hooded gowns walking through the canyon.

829
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,120
 But they see us.

830
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,140
 A pair of ghost hunters goofing off,

831
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,940
 debunking these stories and laughing about it.

832
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,860
 You just have ghost investigators,

833
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,900
 paranormal people, drunk teens coming to the area

834
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,820
 to investigate these stories.

835
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,860
 We came here to go for a walk

836
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,220
 and look into the history of this canyon.

837
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,420
 And as we sit there laughing about the goofy stories

838
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,920
 we've heard, having a good time,

839
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,820
 the cult leader is watching us from the darkness.

840
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,940
 And he thinks, the best thing we ever did

841
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,420
 was start these legends about this canyon.

842
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,940
 Not only did it charge this area with negative energy,

843
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,100
 but it convinced gollible people

844
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,420
 to come out here in the middle of the night on their own,

845
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,580
 looking for some answers.

846
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,860
 When in truth, we were just looking for sacrificial lambs

847
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,940
 to deliver themselves to our doorstep.

848
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,500

 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

855
