00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.800
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.920
 A Russian super weapon backfires.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.200
 A bizarre vandal strikes a small town in Virginia.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.040
 And then we take a look at the story of Turnbull Canyon,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.160
 a winding little piece of road in California,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.280
 but it is no one to hold Satan worshipers

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.400
 and drifters who kill without warning today

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.680
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.260
 (upbeat music)

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.840
 (upbeat music)

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.980
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.100
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.260
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.180
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.780
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.460
 We got a lot of stuff to get through today,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.020
 so we're just gonna get started.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.080
 We're gonna go with this.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.500
 The first two stories are actually incredibly recent,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.580
 so I wanted to kind of put them in one episode

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.420
 'cause they're really kind of going on right now.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 But let's start off on our journey of the weird in Russia.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.020
 We're headed to Russia, mother Russia, the icy continent.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.260
 I have nothing else to describe Russia.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.740
 Anyways, they have funny looking buildings.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.980
 We go to Russia.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.080
 Let's all hop on board.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.340
 We're just gonna walk there.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.260
 Takes us a long time, but we get to Russia.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.940
 And the date is August 8th, 2019.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.540
 So last week, really?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.620
 Unless you're listening to this episode in the future.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.940
 People are hanging out in town,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.940
 this little Russian town called Severodosvinsk.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.980
 Severovinsk, Severovinsk.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.780
 Anyways, it's a town in Russia.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.460
 People are hanging out in this town.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.980
 And they start to get news filtering to the town

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 saying, hey, hey, they're walking down the street.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.180
 Guys like, oh, I don't feel so good.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.620
 I wonder, I don't feel so good.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.060
 My clothes are starting to get a little tight.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.900
 What's going on here?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.020
 Someone runs out of the house and it's like,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.060
 "Everyone, everyone run to the store

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.540
 "and take your iodine pills or buy them first

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.500
 "and then take your iodine pills."

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.380
 We're like, why?

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.580
 Their skin starts to turn green

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.940
 because radiation had spiked in the town.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.460
 Everyone's starting to mutate.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.980
 People are levitating cars.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.580
 One of them can suck the power from other people.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.220
 So for 40 minutes, the radiation spiked in this town.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.940
 Now, Russia, the government is not saying anything.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.220
 They're just like, (hums)

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.060
 So people are freaking out.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.980
 Why is the radiation levels going up in this town?

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.420
 But after 40 minutes, they started to go down

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.100
 and everyone, whew, and their mutations disappeared.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.660
 And one guy was in mid-flight and he's like, "Ah, it dies."

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.420
 Now, so what we think has happened,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.900
 because again, the Russian government

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.180
 really isn't giving a lot of details on what's going on,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.700
 what we know and we being the rest of the world,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.660
 you may know more if you live in Russia,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.660
 or a member of Russian parliament, is that there was a,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.860
 like a giant oil rig type platform out in the Arctic Sea.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.020
 So it was by that town, it was by that town, right?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.780
 And they were testing or building some sort of new weapon

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.780
 and it exploded and it killed five scientists.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.740
 Now, these scientists have been named

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.380
 and they are now considered heroes

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.740
 of the Russian government, which I mean,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.020
 in the pursuit of science, they died, they gave their lives.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.660
 But these were like the best of the best.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.380
 These were some of Russia's best scientists

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.860
 on this platform working on this.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.380
 And we don't know what they were working on,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.300
 but because of the radiation spike

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.820
 and because of the area it was in

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.260
 and just general intelligence,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.060
 this is what they believed they were building.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.900
 This is nuts.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.740
 They call it the 9M730 beer vestnik.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.180
 It is known as a vengeance weapon.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.780
 There's a, I was reading an article about it

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.620
 and one of the people said,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.100
 the only reason why you would ever use this weapon,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.900
 it's in, the quote was,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.180
 it's impractical for anything short

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.340
 of an all out nuclear war.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.500
 It's a missile, not just a nuclear missile,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.500
 but the fuel is nuclear.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.820
 So it has unlimited range.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.140
 It has a nuclear fuel source.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.180
 It doesn't, it's not using like jet fuel

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.220
 or anything like that.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.700
 Rocket fuel, I guess is what it would be.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.180
 It's not using any sort of traditional propulsion.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.860
 It's powered by nuclear power.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.380
 This weapon is supposedly designed to be used

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.180
 after all other nukes have dropped.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.100
 This is basically like an FU

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.900
 to whatever country they're attacking,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.640
 most likely America or China.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.340
 And it's impractical other than an all out nuclear war

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.500
 because the engine itself is basically a dirty bomb.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.620
 So you wouldn't use it as like a tactical strike.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.300
 This weapon was built for the last stages

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.140
 of a nuclear war.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.580
 A doomsday weapon, an apocalyptic weapon.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.220
 That's what we believe blew up.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.460
 There's another suspicion,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.500
 I thought this was crazy too,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.100
 there was another suspicion that what blew up

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.780
 was they were building a missile,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.700
 a top secret missile that could fly

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.260
 eight times the speed of sound.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.100
 And just for comparison,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.280
 that's as fast as Iron Man flies in the comic books.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.660
 That is how fast a fictional superhero flies.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.460
 His top speed is like 8.8 times the speed of sound.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.540
 They were building a missile that can go,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.940
 we'll say almost as fast as a cartoon hero.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.900
 That's the level of weaponry that's being built out there.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.820
 'Cause you can't stop it.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.300
 There's no anti-missile system

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.300
 that can stop something that's hypersonic,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.580
 just doesn't exist.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.620
 But yeah, coming soon to a neighborhood near you.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.740
 You know, in Hood River here where I live,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.100
 we have Hanford nuclear power waste dump.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.820
 It used to be a nuclear power plant,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.900
 I don't know, 40, 50 miles down the river.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.980
 It's a total mess over there

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.220
 and they've tried cleaning it up

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.580
 but they don't know what to do with it.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.260
 That is actually a third phase target

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.700
 for the Soviet Union, Russia now.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.980
 The first strikes you wanna take out

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.020
 like military infrastructure and heads of state,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.180
 chain of command, stuff like that.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.180
 Second strike was big cities where you just wanna,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.500
 so the first strike was basically,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.260
 let's see what we can do to their military might.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.980
 But if we're still lobbing missiles at them,

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.460
 they're like, okay, now let's target the civilian population.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.300
 Let's start taking out major cities,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.860
 financial centers and stuff like that,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.280
 'cause now we want to bring them to heel.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.820
 But then they have what's called third phase,

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.580
 which is basically like that one, just the effort.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.940
 Let's just do as much damage as we can to our enemy

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.580
 and Hanford, or Hanford, however you pronounce it,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.380
 is a third phase strike.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.080
 Basically, if a nuclear missile detonated there,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.500
 it would irradiate the Pacific Northwest.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.780
 It would basically turn miles and miles of soil

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.380
 into a giant dirty bomb.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.500
 You turn Pacific Northwest itself into a dirty bomb.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.060
 I welcome the new mutant powers

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.460
 I will get during the nuclear war.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.140
 I'm not afraid, but I'm hoping I get a cool mutation

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.580
 like healing, I guess I would need that,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.900
 'cause I'd be dying of radiation poisoning all the time.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.940
 Telepathy, I think, would get boring.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.020
 But I want super strength.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.500
 Flying doesn't make sense unless you're invulnerable,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.180
 'cause otherwise you're gonna be hitting birds all the time.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.320
 People just shoot you out of the sky.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.980
 You need to have one of the big ones.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.380
 A lot of people go, I wish I was invisible, no, lame.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.860
 Telepathy's kinda lame because people,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.620
 I don't think, are thinking about you that much.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.300
 You'd be talking to a girl and she'd be thinking

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.860
 about someone else, she'd be like, oh, this sucks.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.980
 I thought I was gonna be reading

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.020
 all these sexy, sexy thoughts.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.340
 Strength, super strength, invulnerability, regeneration,

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.860
 teleport, no, teleportation,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.260
 it's like I'd get stuck in something.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.100
 Okay, but let's go ahead, I welcome my mutant powers though.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.660
 Well, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.500
 Next story, super, super short, super, super mysterious.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.360
 Happened August 11th, 2019, so just a couple days ago.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.860
 We're in Henrico, let's all use our mutant powers

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.860
 to fly now to Henrico County, Virginia.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.820
 Stop, evil doers.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.700
 It's totally peaceful suburb.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.500
 Actually, no, there is an evil doer in this story.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.140
 This is actually gonna work.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.500
 We're flying around.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500
 You're like, hey, Jason, look.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.980
 And you're like my kid's sidekick.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.220
 I'm like, what is it, young lean?

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.660
 It's a mysterious man and we're like looking.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.780
 We're hovering in the air looking at the student.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.020
 And we see a man walking through the neighborhoods

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.700
 of little suburbs in Henrico County, Virginia.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.820
 And he's carrying a big box and I'm like,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.140
 ooh, could that possibly be a bomb?

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.820
 And you're like, golly, jinkies, I don't think so.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.420
 That is a TV set.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.220
 I'm like, oh, you are right.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.660
 So we land, the gimmick's done.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.140
 That gimmick was going nowhere.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.580
 We land, we go back in our civilian clothes.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.040
 We've real, now we're hiding in the bushes,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.880
 like a bunch of weirdos.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.540
 We're hiding in the bushes and we want,

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.700
 like we normally do in our civilian clothes.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.500
 And we're watching a man carry an old CRT television set

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.220
 up to a house and we look at each other.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.100
 We're like, oh, this is weird.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.260
 And he sets it down on the porch

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.540
 and turns and walks away.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.260
 And that's when we notice his head is an old television set.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.700
 Dun, dun, dun.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.660
 Now this isn't creepypasta.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.160
 This isn't rumor.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.700
 There is videotape of this.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.860
 You know, they have those little ring doorbell cameras.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.860
 So when people walk up to your front door,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.140
 it goes off and it records what's going on.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.300
 They have footage of this guy walking through the town,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.460
 walking up to a door, putting down an old CRT.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.780
 And he's wearing like all blue,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.540
 like blue work slacks, like dickies.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.060
 And then like a dickies top.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.220
 All the labels are covered up, which is smart.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.780
 He's wearing a big CRT on his head,

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.620
 big old tube television set.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.620
 Now, in one night, this guy, or men, we don't know,

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.980
 faces covered up by a television set,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.460
 dropped off 50 big giant television sets.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.060
 Now some of them were only like 13 inches,

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.380
 but if you know those old TVs, if you grew up in that,

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.740
 those are still quite heavy,

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.900
 but some of them were bigger,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.940
 some were like 27 inches and stuff like that.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.740
 But anyways, 50 television sets,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.380
 a little over 50 television sets,

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.140
 appeared on front porches all over this small,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.620
 sleepy little suburb in the course of one night.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.500
 And it's funny 'cause they called the cops out

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.500
 and there's video of the cops having to lug

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.180
 these television sets and they're throwing them

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.260
 in a big moving van.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.580
 So I mean, that sucks.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.900
 There's their Monday having to pick up all these things.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.280
 But the police said, listen, this is probably a prank.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.580
 We don't know what's going on,

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.900
 but it is illegal 'cause it's illegal dumping.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.740
 And the residents seem to be pretty amused by it.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.500
 They're like, it's kind of funny.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.360
 Like someone must have a lot of time in their hands

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.900
 and obviously a lot of television sets.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.620
 But what's weird about it is that this happened

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.860
 in Henrico County.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.540
 It happened in the same county, different little town,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.460
 but in the same county last August.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.380
 So the same month a year ago,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.300
 someone dropped 20 television sets off,

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.860
 one at each different house.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.700
 Never caught the guy.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.520
 He wasn't on video.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.560
 Now they have video of him wearing this television head.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.600
 College prank, hazing ritual,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.100
 TV repair guy trying to get rid of some product.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.480
 Or what if that's not a mask?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.360
 What if that CRT helmet is his real head

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.520
 and he's dropping off his babies at people's houses

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.320
 hoping someone will take care of them?

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.640
 But you see, then police take the babies

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.840
 and put them in their impound lot

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.880
 and then the babies hatch.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.080
 And the next time you get pulled over by a cop,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.920
 you're like, oh, that's weird.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.920
 Cop walks up and has television forehead.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.960
 And they're just taking the government over from the inside.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.960
 One police department at a time.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.920
 Now obviously that's, I'm joking around,

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.760
 but that'd be pretty awesome.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.600
 As long as the television head overlords don't bother me.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.440
 I think it's a prank.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.120
 I actually think it's quite a funny prank,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.920
 but yeah, it is also illegal dumping.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.120
 So if these guys get caught,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.560
 they'll get a fine or something like that.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.720
 It'll be interesting to see if they do it again next year.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.960
 Maybe it'll become a tradition.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.040
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.600
 Our next story is the story of Turnbull Canyon.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.080
 Turnbull Canyon is a winding canyon,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.800
 little winding country road.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.520
 It's about a four mile loop.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.680
 It's down in California.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.040
 It's in Whittier, California.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.760
 Here's the, so weird USA, we've talked about them before.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.760
 They're a mixed bag as far as their research goes.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.560
 And this was their headline.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.520
 This was their headline.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.640
 Saintness, child snatcher, and drifters

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.320
 in Turnbull Canyon, Whittier.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.720
 And I was like, "What, that sounds interesting.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.240
 "A little dubious of the source,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.280
 "but we got Satanists, we got babies getting kidnapped,

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.720
 "which I'm not a fan of, I'm not a fan of that."

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.080
 But drifters, you got like drifters,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.240
 like homeless people hiding in the bushes with sickles,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.480
 cutting people up.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.520
 Anyways, supposedly this place,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.560
 this bushy little canyon, little sagebrush,

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.720
 let's take a walk along the canyon.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.840
 It's super dusty, we're all dirty now.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.140
 There's a tumbleweed rolling by, lizards on rocks.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.320
 Looking at us and stuff.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.440
 Just walking, walking through the canyon, right?

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.240
 Keeping an eye out for them drifters,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.640
 keeping an eye out for saint worshipers,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.560
 hoping to rescue some babies, but we don't see any of them.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.680
 But before we wrestle a drifter,

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.200
 we have to talk about the history of this place.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.160
 Supposedly it was known as, yes, it's the episode

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.560
 where Jason can't pronounce anything,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.200
 hut, hut you conga, hut you conga.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.040
 So the natives in the area called it that,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.600
 and it means either the dark place

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.600
 or the place of the devil,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.440
 depending on what translation you go with.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.280
 And the natives in the area stayed away from it.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.880
 That's part of the old legend.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.880
 In 1845, the Spanish governor of Alta, California,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.600
 which was the region there, gave it to two settlers.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.160
 And then the natives started raiding the property

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.320
 'cause they didn't want the settlers there.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.760
 So right there should start setting off your skeptics alarm.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.480
 If the legend is the natives stayed away from the area,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.680
 and then they started doing raids on the area,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.760
 and later started working on the area

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.880
 that doesn't jive at all.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.480
 I couldn't find any reference to the place

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.680
 actually being called that outside of these ghost stories.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.720
 So a little skeptical right off the bat.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.680
 But we got a lot of other good elements, right?

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.280
 The past have may have been added

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.600
 and may have been like put a little lipstick on it,

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.320
 but we'll keep going forward.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.920
 So we keep walking down Turnbull Canyon,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.080
 keeping an eye out.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.480
 What?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.320
 What's that?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.840
 It's just a vulture flying by.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.480
 And then you get a little suspicious

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.640
 'cause they start circling us.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.000
 I'm like, "Oh no, that's fine."

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.840
 They do that all the time.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.200
 I see it all the time in cartoons.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.000
 You're like, "This isn't a cartoon, bro."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.240
 We're walking through the canyon, sun's starting to set.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.520
 You're no longer scared of the stories of the natives

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.640
 calling to the place of the devil.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.360
 You think, "Yeah, it's probably pretty skeptical, right?"

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.520
 But let's get into some more recent events.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.640
 So the sun completely sets.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.120
 (cat meows)

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.960
 You're around.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.800
 Where'd that owl come from?

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.800
 I like it.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.020
 So during the depression, there was a rumor in the area.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.820
 The Great Depression, I should say,

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.340
 not just an A depression,

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.780
 some guys all sad and a rumor starts.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.620
 During the Great Depression,

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.100
 people were having a hard time feeding their kids.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.460
 So this part's true.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.220
 This happened all over America

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.740
 and probably other parts of the world.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.000
 Probably happens today, unfortunately,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.140
 but people had a hard time taking care of their kids

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.660
 so they would sell them off

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.100
 to get money to feed themselves,

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.500
 which sounds a little cruel,

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.580
 but they're figuring, "Ah, I'll sell it to a rich family.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.900
 "It'll be brought up well.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.260
 "I get to eat today and it's a win-win."

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.100
 But the rumor became a little more sinister

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.420
 because people said that in Turnbull Canyon,

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.660
 these wealthy families were buying babies,

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.180
 going around like poor people.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.420
 Poor people around the street corner going,

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.940
 "Babies, babies."

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.620
 And they have a wheelbarrow full of their kids

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.480
 and rich people are like, "Oh, awesome."

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.820
 They would buy these babies and they said,

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.140
 "I will provide them a perfect home."

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.380
 And then they have fingers across

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.220
 and the guys are like, "Oh, awesome."

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.060
 Goes away.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.380
 Guys buying a bunch of bread.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.660
 And the rich people were really Saint worshipers

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.580
 and they were sacrificing the babies in the canyon.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.020
 That was a rumor that was going around apparently back then.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.580
 There is no verification of that.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.300
 It's an easy rumor to start and for people to buy into

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.580
 because you did have people selling their kids

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.860
 and you would never know what happened to those kids.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.820
 So it basically mixes the fact,

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.460
 it would basically demonize people

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.620
 who did sell their kids and would go,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.540
 "Hey, man, you don't know.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.620
 "You just go into a nice house.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.580
 "You might be like, you know,

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.740
 "getting sacrificed to the devil."

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.180
 And guys are like, "Oh my God, why'd you tell me that?

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.700
 "Now I'm super paranoid.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.300
 "I got these two more kids to sell.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.020
 "Now I don't want to, but I'm gonna 'cause I need to eat."

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.780
 That was a rumor that was going around at the time.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.060
 Again, there's no verification of that.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.180
 We could never really prove that either way.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.540
 But people in the area still talk about these things.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.900
 Even today, there are stories of satanic cults

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.540
 in this canyon doing these rituals.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.880
 Now at this point, we're walking through Turnbull Canyon.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.880
 The large canyon walls are steep on both sides of us.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.600
 There is no way out but to walk the four mile loop.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.420
 And you're thinking, "Jason, why didn't you tell me

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.980
 "about the more recent Saint-Warsher Wars

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.940
 "before I started walking through here?"

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.440
 Now it is almost pitch black.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.660
 The moon is just kind of peeking over

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.580
 one of the sheer faces of the canyon.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.600
 Super spooky.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.180
 Now, people are posting online about running into

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.980
 Satan worshipers and things like that.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.260
 You had one guy tell a story that him and his buddies

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.460
 were driving through the canyon

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.540
 and they went on some off-road, right?

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.380
 (whooshing)

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.020
 And they get out of their car and they start walking.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.260
 They're ghost hunters, right?

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
 And then they hear a bunch of hooded people

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.100
 walking behind them.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.260
 I don't know how they could tell you.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.100
 They sounded like they could hear the hoods

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.220
 shifting against their head.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.460
 They ran and they jumped in the bushes

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.700
 and they saw all these people in black hoods

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.500
 start doing a chant right in front of them conveniently enough.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.900
 And then cops showed up and everyone scattered

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.020
 and they hid in the bushes and then one more,

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.340
 they saw like black boots walk by the bush.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.500
 They're like, "Oh."

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.060
 And then the person left and they all ran back

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.980
 to their car and there's no police reports verifying that.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.940
 That's one person's story, but that's a common story

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.100
 that goes on with Turnbull Canyon.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.100
 People in the area go there for ghost hunting.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.580
 It's fairly remote.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.780
 It's not like in the middle of the boonies.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.500
 Like you could get there,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.980
 but it's also not on the beaten path.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.580
 It would be a good place to go to look for ghosts,

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.260
 to smoke weed, stuff like that.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.940
 So people still talk about Saint worshipers there

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.380
 as well now today.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.020
 Now there have been murders linked to the area.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.380
 There was a young woman who was shot in the head

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.060
 and it took him a couple of years to arrest the guy,

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.740
 that seemed to be drug related.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.020
 It was two gang bangers who shot her

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.780
 and they set her body on fire or something like that.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.020
 But people just, you know how stories evolve in these areas.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.180
 People stumble across the body that's burned up

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.660
 and be like, "Ah, Saint worshipers."

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.660
 And then after years of police investigation,

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.700
 they go, "Oh no, it's actually these two idiot gang bangers

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.500
 who shot her over like a drug dead or something like that."

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.580
 There was a plane crash in the canyon.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.060
 I thought this one was fascinating.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.940
 There was a plane crash in the canyon.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.940
 In 1952, I read this and then I had to go find verification

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.060
 of it and I came across this guy who said he's done

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.940
 thousands of hours of research on Turnbull Canyon.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.200
 This was his account.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.980
 1952, this plane crash is 29 people were killed.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.940
 21 of them were children.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.420
 But see, when everyone saw the plane crash

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.260
 or they heard the plane crash,

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.100
 it was kind of far away,

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.580
 but when rescuers finally got to the area

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.940
 and they started digging the bodies out,

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.780
 everyone on the plane was killed.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.940
 21 of them were children,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.540
 or the other eight were also killed as well.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.500
 They're not invincible because they're not children.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.100
 When they bought the bodies back to the corner,

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.220
 none of the bodies could be identified.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.140
 They were all just basically bodies

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.180
 that no one had ever seen before.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.140
 Not like just strangers,

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.700
 not like they're out of town or something,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.860
 there was no record that these people ever existed.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.260
 There was no record that the plane was ever registered.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.300
 So it was just like a ghost airplane

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.420
 full of ghost people basically.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.860
 And the rumor in the area was,

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.420
 was that Satan worshipers,

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.260
 like the dark magic of the area

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.140
 actually pulled the plane out of the sky.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.980
 The canyon itself wanted fresh blood.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.300
 Maybe the plane came out of some sort of portal

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.420
 from an alternate dimension or from the future,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.460
 and it was pulled in via dark magic

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.220
 into the canyon and blow up.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.540
 The only thing that is true about that statement

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.740
 is the plane crash in 1952.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.940
 29 people did die.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.180
 They weren't, there was almost no children, if any.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.500
 It was mostly US servicemen.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.580
 They were all identified

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.860
 because they were a US servicemen.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.740
 We have the names of everyone

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.020
 who died in that plane crash.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.940
 We know who flew the plane.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.900
 We know who chartered the plane.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.940
 We know what airline company owned the plane.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.180
 We know the airport the plane flew out of

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.020
 and where it was headed.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.300
 And it didn't crash due to magic.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.380
 It crashed because it was really foggy

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.940
 and the landing gear was down

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.580
 and the pilot didn't know it and it hit the rock.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.780
 Now you could say, well, what if Satan made the landing gear

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.940
 come down and the Satan's fog machine?

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.940
 Fine, I'll give you that.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.380
 But thousands of hours of research,

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.700
 he needed a thousand hours and 10 minutes of research

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.260
 because that's the problem with Turnbull Canyon

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.100
 is that it's really hard to separate

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.500
 the myth from the legend.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.460
 I'm sure that stuff went down there.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.380
 But when one of the stories is back in the 60s

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.060
 a bunch of dudes ran this one of my favorite things,

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.340
 there used to be an insane asylum in this remote canyon,

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.500
 in this desert road.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.740
 There used to be a full-fledged insane asylum.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.940
 It burned down in the 1940s.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.260
 And then in the 1960s, some crazy, far-out, trippy dudes

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.980
 was like walking around Turnbull Canyon

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.300
 being like, oh man, isn't this cool?

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.500
 We got owls and tumbleweed and stuff.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.420
 And they come across the burnt down remains

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.580
 of this insane asylum.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.380
 One of the hippies is like, look at me, man, look at me.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.220
 I'm crazy.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.420
 And he sits down in an electroshock chair

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.780
 and he puts on the cap.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.740
 He's like, shock me, baby.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.100
 And then the girl hits the switch

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.740
 and he actually (imitates explosion)

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.380
 gets electrocuted even though the place had

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.540
 absolutely no power.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.740
 It was a burned out shell.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.540
 Nothing had existed really in it for 20 years.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.060
 Somehow this hippie gets electrocuted.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.620
 Now, that's not, that's 100% not true.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.620
 There, that not only bends the logic of what ghosts can,

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.420
 if a ghost can electrocute you,

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.460
 then ghost turning your lights on

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.820
 or making your faucet run is so low-level lame.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.420
 Like if a ghost can actually bring electricity

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.700
 into a building where there's been no electricity

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.900
 for 20 years and give you enough volts

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.780
 to blow your brains out,

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.940
 I am no longer impressed when people say,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.220
 and then the book fell off the bookcase.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.380
 I'm like, did you die?

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.260
 Did you get electrocuted?

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.740
 He'd be like, what are you talking about?

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.580
 I'm like, do not tell me a ghost story

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.060
 that doesn't involve a hippie getting his brains melted.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.860
 And then I'll just leave.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.020
 I hope someday someone invites me

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.320
 to a paranormal convention.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.940
 So I don't believe that story.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.260
 Either that story is 100% made,

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.500
 and of course I can't verify it.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.180
 People said there is like a bit of a room

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.300
 and like a flat looks like something was built out there,

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.540
 but other people have said there's no,

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.500
 there's no record of an insane asylum out there.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.900
 If that, and I don't, I believe the story's not true,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.380
 but if that story is true,

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.580
 it is the greatest ghost encounter of all time.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.780
 It should be, every episode of Ghost Hunters

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.360
 should just be people sitting down

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.800
 with electro shock elements at that location.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.740
 So let's get to the part I was the most excited about,

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.460
 because again, we had sane worshipers,

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.260
 child snatchers and drifters.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.060
 I was like, oh, so sane worshipers,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.040
 you can assume like someone walks around

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.120
 with a creepy mask on, you go,

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.220
 oh, that person's sane worshiper.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.660
 They could just have a fetish.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.620
 They could be a sane worshiper.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.460
 I don't know.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.660
 Child snatchers, that's just horrible.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.380
 I'm like researching that stuff, but a drifter.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.500
 Like a homeless person hiding in the bushes.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.680
 I've had 100 encounters with homeless people over the years.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.980
 I'd say maybe 30% of them are good.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.600
 I've had friends who were homeless.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.260
 There was a time where I lived in my car

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.260
 because I lost my apartment.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.100
 I was going to college.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:10.940
 I lived in my car.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.780
 But my friends who were homeless

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.740
 and they went around Panhandley when I was living in my car,

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.140
 I would never consider them drifters or myself a drifter.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.780
 We were still in the same area.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.220
 But like I've run into actual drifters

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.100
 and there it's always been an unpleasant experience.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.100
 Generally homeless people themselves are fine,

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.060
 but in Hood River, we get a ton of them

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.220
 because as the weather kind of warms up,

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.340
 they migrate, you get a ton of them.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.020
 So anyways, drifters.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.340
 I'm like drifters, my mortal enemy.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.120
 The blood feud continues.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.900
 I should just do a whole episode about my drifter stories.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.600
 And so as I'm reaching for my screwdriver in my pocket,

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.680
 you're like, whoa, whoa, dude.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.880
 You're not getting ready to stab that man over there.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.040
 I'm like, you don't understand the war is today.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.620
 But I was so excited to read about drifters

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.120
 because they were saying that drifters

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.080
 had killed people in Turnbull Canyon.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.160
 I'm not excited that they're murdering people,

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.320
 but I was like, that's something

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.800
 that I can see my teeth into.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.460
 That's something that can be verified.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.980
 I can just pick up the bum daily and flip through it

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.700
 and go to the drifter murder section.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.260
 It's the biggest part of the newspaper

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.420
 and read about it, right?

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.100
 So I'm reading this main article in Weird USA

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.140
 about Turnbull Canyon and I get to this quote.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.780
 Oh my God, I get to this quote.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.660
 And it says, "I live near Turnbull Canyon."

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.340
 This is a guy's first person, obviously.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.940
 "I live near Turnbull Canyon."

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.820
 And yes, I've heard all about this.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.200
 "It is one hell of a scary ass place to be in

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.960
 "if you're by yourself and you aren't familiar with it."

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.640
 I remember seeing people walking around with hoods on,

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.640
 but I'm not sure.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.480
 (laughs)

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.320
 That's a little vague.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.840
 Like, could have had hoods on.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.320
 Could have just had a weird haircut.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.240
 I don't know.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.720
 So where did I leave off?

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.280
 Oh, I remember seeing people walking around with hoods on,

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.280
 but I'm not sure.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.560
 For sure, though, I know that there are many

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.240
 devil worshipers/colds in that area.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.720
 Also, they found some rapist killer hiding there also.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.320
 That was written and I'm reading that and I was like,

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.000
 oh, okay, just another piece of the puzzle.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.200
 And then I get to who wrote it.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.920
 They included his name.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.720
 Counterlock.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.160
 Drifting.com.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.380
 And I'm like, my heart sunk.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.500
 Because then I realized that Counterlock

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.140
 from drifting.com was one of the drifters.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.020
 Let me re-read you that headline here.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.060
 Let me re-read you that headline.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.340
 Satanist, child snatcher, and drifters

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.300
 in Turnbull Canyon, Whittier.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.100
 In that context, would you think Tokyo Drift?

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.640
 In that context, would you think a bunch of lowered Hondas

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.480
 (mimics car engine)

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.360
 going around corners super fast?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.280
 No, not at all.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.480
 Drifters have killed people in this area

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.000
 because the road is so curvy, people race out there

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.280
 and they drift in their cars and they hit people.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.880
 They hit a police officer, they've hit some people

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.840
 standing on the side of the road.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.520
 That is not a, I get, technically, they are drifters,

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.960
 but in the context, if you said,

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.760
 hey, you wanna go see a movie about same worshipers

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.940
 and drifters killing people, you would go,

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.460
 oh yeah, is that from Blumhouse?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.300
 What is this?

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.940
 Is this some new horror movie coming out?

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.900
 And they're like, no, it's Fast and Furious 11,

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.780
 where they have to drive their cars

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.460
 underneath the statue of Balfament.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.140
 And if they drift just right, they can break the ankles

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.300
 of the statue and save humanity from the Satan.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.140
 Go over there.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.780
 You'd be like, what are you talking about?

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.980
 That movie doesn't exist.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.780
 That movie would never exist.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.180
 So if someone says, hey, you wanna go see a movie

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.180
 about street racing and drifters, you're like, yeah.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.960
 And then he realizes it's about homeless people

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.080
 driving cars.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.580
 Context is important.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.000
 Context is important.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.080
 And I came across that linearly.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.280
 I came across that and I was like, my heart just sunk.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.520
 I was like, are you kidding me?

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.080
 Those are the drifters killing people?

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.400
 Those drifters kill people all over the place.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.640
 It's really bad in Tokyo, apparently.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.200
 My thing is this.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.880
 That guy who I read about, who did thousands of hours

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.200
 of research and was talking about the plane crash,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.440
 he does this huge write up on the history

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.340
 of Turnbull Canyon.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.740
 He's also on drifting.com.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.020
 So apparently drifting.com, a website dedicated

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.420
 to getting the best drift out of your car,

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.700
 to living life a quarter mile at a time,

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.940
 to beating your enemies and winning those pink slips

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.100
 and hooking up with some hot girl in a bikini,

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.980
 also has an entire section of their form

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.060
 dedicated to hauntings of Turnbull Canyon.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.100
 So I guess Turnbull Canyon is really famous among drifters,

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.900
 but if I'm going to drifting.com,

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.380
 I wanna know how to get like, nauseous to shoot out

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.960
 some part of my car, right?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.700
 I wanna learn how to like, spin the wheel just right

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.880
 so I can right in front of the ladies and impress them.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.920
 Not ghost planes and saying worshipers

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.360
 and all sorts of nonsense.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.840
 Drifting.com, I have an eternal war against drifters

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.280
 of all kinds now.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.360
 Not just the homeless people who harass me,

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.240
 violently harass me, but you guys spinning around

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.040
 in your cars doing those donuts and stuff.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.920
 And a Monquito, so I especially hate donuts.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.380
 Turnbull Canyon is an interesting story

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.980
 because after all, you're like Jason,

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.120
 you told us this crazy story

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.400
 and you pretty much just said,

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.520
 "This is why this isn't true,

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.700
 this is why this isn't true."

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.640
 The child selling thing could possibly be true.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.200
 The electroshock therapy is just hilarious.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.200
 But what's really interesting,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.800
 and I wanna leave you with this note

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.980
 as we're walking through the darkened canyon,

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.200
 is that people have come out in the area and said,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.160
 "It's not haunted.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.580
 "I've grown up in this area.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.560
 "Those are just rumors.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.220
 "There are no saint worshipers.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.420
 "There are no child sacrifices.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.360
 "There are no ghost.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.240
 "You guys, you children are foolish.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.940
 "I've lived here all my life."

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.480
 I read this, I was looking around online

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.540
 'cause I had to do a bunch of research

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.860
 on these type of stories to see

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.620
 whether or not any of it's true.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.660
 And this one poster was saying,

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.980
 "Listen, I've hiked there with my dog

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.800
 "all times day and night.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.540
 "It's a very relaxing place.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.820
 "I take my dog, we walk out there,

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.040
 "just enjoy the splendor of it all."

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.580
 It is definitely not haunted.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.660
 There's no dark magic there.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.540
 There's no baby ritual sacrifices.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.700
 That doesn't happen here.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.980
 But one day I was walking through the canyon

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.980
 and I saw a stick.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.420
 And on top of the stick was the severed head of a deer

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.780
 that was mounted on it, so I was looking up at the sky.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.100
 And this is her quote, this is her exact quote.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.660
 So I'm not saying that stuff doesn't happen there,

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.660
 animal sacrifice to be specific,

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.940
 but most of this crap is just urban legend best ignored.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.460
 If the people disputing the urban legends

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.060
 have to admit they themselves have seen the signs

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.900
 of ritual animal sacrifice,

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.680
 that doesn't do the debunkers a lot of good.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.180
 It's possible that the canyon does hold

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.520
 some dark mysteries.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.660
 It's right on the precipice of the perfect place

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.020
 to commit some sort of heinous act.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.980
 But you'd also have to be aware

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.420
 that some ghost hunters could stumble across you at any time,

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.220
 like we were walking down Turnbull Canyon late at night.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:00.460
 You could go there and use the fear of the area,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.100
 use the history of the area.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.340
 Whether or not it was true,

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:07.380
 people believe that the place is soaked in evil

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.700
 and it basically could become some sort of topa.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.140
 People think the area is evil,

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.420
 so it gets slightly evil over the years.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:20.180
 And you go to this place to commit your sacrifices

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.340
 out of the eyes of all the Prine people around you.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.620
 Gotta be careful of those drifters

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.680
 coming around the corner, but they're going too fast.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.860
 They don't see you and your cohorts

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.180
 in the hooded gowns walking through the canyon.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.120
 But they see us.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.140
 A pair of ghost hunters goofing off,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.940
 debunking these stories and laughing about it.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.860
 You just have ghost investigators,

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.900
 paranormal people, drunk teens coming to the area

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.820
 to investigate these stories.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.860
 We came here to go for a walk

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.220
 and look into the history of this canyon.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.420
 And as we sit there laughing about the goofy stories

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.920
 we've heard, having a good time,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.820
 the cult leader is watching us from the darkness.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.940
 And he thinks, the best thing we ever did

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.420
 was start these legends about this canyon.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.940
 Not only did it charge this area with negative energy,

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.100
 but it convinced gollible people

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.420
 to come out here in the middle of the night on their own,

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.580
 looking for some answers.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.860
 When in truth, we were just looking for sacrificial lambs

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.940
 to deliver themselves to our doorstep.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:34.500
