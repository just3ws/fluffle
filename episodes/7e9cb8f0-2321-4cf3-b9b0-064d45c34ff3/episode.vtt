 British Swim School, make us flash.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.700
 Today we take a look at two terrifying households.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.780
 First off, we travel to France to meet a woman who swears

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.980
 that the only way to enter her house

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.900
 is to walk on your hands.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.220
 And then we travel to South Dakota

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.860
 to meet a young man who's moving into his new apartment.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.140
 He quickly realizes that not only is he not alone

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.740
 in his new abode,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.740
 this creature may have sinister implications for us all.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.900
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.480
 (upbeat music)

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.340
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.740
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.700
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.620
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.100
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.100
 I hope you have some cool plans for this weekend coming up.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.060
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.340
 Patreon supporters coming into Dead Rabbit Command

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.540
 right now is Devin.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.820
 Woohoo, come on in buddy, come on in.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.420
 Devin, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.780
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.860
 Just help spread the word about the show

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.580
 that really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.180
 I say it every episode 'cause it's true.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.860
 You can really help the show grow.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 Devin, AKA fellow content creator.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.140
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.640
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.060
 We are headed all the way out to Old Timie, France.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.540
 (imitates engine revving)

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.380
 As Devin is driving us out to Old Timie, France,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.120
 we're headed back to the early 1900s.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.120
 I do wanna say next week is the last week of season 17.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.120
 So next week, we're gonna have five episodes

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.480
 and then I'm taking a two week break.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.700
 I'm not gonna do the bonus episodes this week.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.380
 I gotta start those up again.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.980
 I always talk about 'em.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.820
 But that's just 10 more episodes of work

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.060
 and it's really hard to do the show.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.280
 It is a solo podcast.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.480
 I don't have anyone else helping me,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.880
 except when you guys help me

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.800
 financially support the show and get the word out.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.400
 I don't wanna minimize that,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.640
 but the production of the show is just me

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.320
 and I get burned out and everything like that

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.120
 and I feel bad I even take two weeks off.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.480
 But I gotta take two weeks off every 50 episodes,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.840
 that seems fair.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.160
 So there will be no bonus episodes.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.880
 It'll be two weeks of just Dead Silence

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.400
 on the Dead Rabbit Radio channel,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.000
 but we will be back for season 18

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 and another 50 episodes of crazy, bizarre, macabre stories.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.580
 Like these ones, these ones are really cool

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.380
 and I'm glad I was able to present these two as a pair.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.380
 'Cause I got an interesting hypothesis with this one.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.660
 So Devon's driving the old timey Jason Jalopy.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.460
 We're wearing old timey clothes.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.580
 We got on like the girdles and the big old petticoats

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.980
 and tiny little umbrellas.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.740
 We are walking around Roux de MontrÃ©al.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.900
 That's in the Saint Margarita district in Paris, France.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.300
 So we're walking around and we look dapper.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.000
 And we're going to court.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.840
 We're going to court.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.600
 We stole all these clothes from some old lady.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.760
 We're running down the street and we end up in court.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.800
 And as we're handcuffed,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.280
 sitting in the back of the courtroom,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.040
 in walks Madame Berlody.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.320
 I'm almost for sure that's not a he pronounced her name.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.320
 If my last name was Bloody,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.080
 I would definitely change it.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.280
 I don't care if my dad was very proud.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.640
 The Bloodies helped build this country.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.280
 Madame Bloody, she's an elderly woman.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.820
 She walks into the local magistrates office.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.180
 I don't know if that's the same thing as the court,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.580
 but anyways, just roll with it.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.020
 Just roll with it like you're a big, bloaty old lady.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.860
 She walks into the local magistrates office

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.820
 and she says, "Listen, you need to help me, sir.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.900
 "I am just a simple old woman living at home

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.540
 "with my son and my brother.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.860
 "And it's fine, like everything's going good there, right?

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.580
 "But one thing that's super weird,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.700
 "every time I walk to my house,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.800
 "put the key in the door, click, click, clink, clink."

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.480
 And they open the door.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.040
 Eeeeee.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.280
 She's making the sound effects too, the magistrates.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.080
 Like, I know what a door, I know what you're doing.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.280
 You're not doing some sort of audio podcast.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.240
 She opens the door.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.800
 Eeeeee.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.880
 And then, me, this old lady,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.400
 I have to get down on my hands and knees,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.480
 do a handstand,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.720
 and hand walk into my house.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.040
 And then I get back on my feet

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.500
 and I go about my business.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.660
 And magistrate is looking at this lady and thinking,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.060
 "Dude, she must be seeing now."

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.940
 Like, "And she must be super limber

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.340
 "if she can walk on her hands."

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.180
 And he goes, "Wait, wait, wait, wait."

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.300
 So you're saying that, like, they make you do that?

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.700
 Your son and your brothers?

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.900
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.820
 I'm not accusing them of like making me do that.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.140
 When I come to my door frame,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.900
 I am overcome, it's not even overcome.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.860
 I have to walk on my hands.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.880
 I can't enter in my house any other way.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.760
 The magistrate has the woman detained

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.600
 because he goes, "She must be nuts."

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.680
 That's impossible.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.400
 There's not any sort of magical force

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.880
 that will make you walk on your hands.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.120
 Maybe a guy with a truncheon, right,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.680
 would force an old lady to do this,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.160
 but there's not,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.320
 so he actually sends an officer out to her house.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.360
 And he's like, "Listen, go talk to the son or the brother.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.080
 "Figure out what's going on.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.540
 "Cause I'm assuming this woman's either insane

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.860
 "or she's being abused."

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.220
 So he sends out this dude,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.940
 a sergeant, DeVille, to go out there.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.660
 And he's greeted there by her son,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.100
 and he's a 27-year-old man, he's a bank clerk,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.240
 we don't have his name,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.380
 we're just assuming it's Bobby Bloaty.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.500
 And Bobby goes, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.100
 "I know why you're probably here, right?"

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.940
 My mom went to go talk to you about

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.140
 fixing the whole door thing.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.500
 Are you here to like take care of that?

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.260
 And the officer's like, "Yeah, yeah, what's going on

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.400
 "with that?" And the son's like, "Dude, this is so weird.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.080
 "Every time I try to go into the house, I can't.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.600
 "I physically stop at the door frame,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.720
 "and then I get down on my hands and knees,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.160
 "and I walk on my hands into the house."

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.880
 And the officer's like, "What in the world is going on here?

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.520
 "That's impossible."

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.320
 So they go and they get his uncle,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.200
 who we have his name, Paul Rice, this was the brother.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.520
 Paul Rice shows up, he's 50 years old,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.100
 and he goes, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.180
 "thanks for calling me down, officer."

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.260
 You're here about the whole walking hands thing,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.340
 and the officer's like, "Yeah."

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.820
 And the brother, Paul goes, "Listen,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.900
 "I don't know what this old lady's been telling you,

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.460
 "or what the son's been telling you,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.140
 "but I'm gonna tell you the truth right now.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.300
 "Every time I come to the door frame,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.060
 "every time I come to the door, I can't enter the house."

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.300
 And the son's like, "Yeah, that's what I'm saying too."

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.220
 He's like, "Oh, you're telling him

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.180
 "about the whole walking on the hand."

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.180
 Yeah, yeah, that's why we're here.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.140
 The uncle goes, "Yeah."

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.640
 So the officer, the Sergeant DeVille,

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.880
 takes these two dudes back to the magistrate,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.240
 where the mom is currently in detention,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.200
 she has like on a little prison jumpsuit,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.640
 and they're all standing there,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.120
 and they're like, "Yeah, no, this is 100% true.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.360
 "We cannot walk into this house

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.860
 "without walking on our hands."

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.800
 And Paul Rice goes, "Here, let me show you."

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.320
 And he gets on all fours in the magistrate's office.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.480
 The uncle starts walking around on his hands

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.800
 in the magistrate's office,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.720
 and then the son joins in, he's doing it too,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.660
 and then Madame Bloaty, elderly woman,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.740
 she's walking around on her hands as well,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.100
 and the magistrate goes, "Okay, stop, stop, stop.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.580
 "I know what walking on your hands look like,

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.940
 "but this can't be true."

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.260
 And they actually summon the concierge for the building.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.540
 So the officer brings him before the magistrate,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.620
 and the concierge goes, "Listen, dude."

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.540
 He sees those three,

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.300
 he sees those three standing in the room,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.460
 and he goes, "Okay, you heard what they're saying.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.740
 "It sounds insane."

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.460
 And it is insane, right?

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.760
 But, the magistrate's like, "Damn it, damn it."

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.440
 And since he said, "But I know what's coming next,"

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.640
 the concierge goes, "They complained to me about it.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.320
 "I went to their door,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.640
 "and I couldn't move inside.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.520
 "I couldn't do it."

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.040
 And then, I got down on all fours,

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.720
 and I'm incapable of doing a handstand.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.880
 It's not something that I can do.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.040
 I mean, I don't know who these three gymnasts are,

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.480
 but I sat there in the doorway,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.220
 trying to kick my feet up to do a handstand.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.160
 You cannot enter the house on your feet.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.380
 This story, as ludicrous as it sounds,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.380
 was reported in several newspapers of the time.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.740
 We have a publication,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.780
 we have The Daily Mail,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.260
 which published it on May 1st, back in 1907.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.580
 And then, I found The Roanoke Times,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.500
 Volume 41, number 120.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.940
 They published it on May 19th, 1907.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.200
 And they tell this story, and the story ends with

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.040
 the judge or the magistrate,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.840
 they use the right terminology.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.240
 The magistrate ordered the house disinfected.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.140
 And that's the end of the story.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.960
 There's no follow-up to it.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.640
 There's no everyone went back to the house,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.200
 and they can enter it as normal.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.320
 There's no telling us that it worked,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.300
 that it didn't work, it just says,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.820
 "The magistrate ordered the room disinfected."

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.160
 It's injurized, here's the thing.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.140
 We know, we've talked about this a lot on the show,

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.140
 old-timey newspapers made a lot of stuff up.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.140
 New-timey newspapers make a lot of stuff up.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.140
 But old-timey newspapers would publish fiction.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.740
 For, I mean, you could call it fiction,

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.300
 you could call it a lie.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.700
 Sometimes they would publish basically tall tales.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.060
 And it would get mixed in with these things,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.460
 and then you fast forward 100 years,

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.700
 and they're like, "Oh, look at this article

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.540
 "about finding giants in Arizona."

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.680
 It was fake, the story was made up.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.920
 We see that a lot in old-timey newspapers.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.000
 Well, they will publish stuff that simply didn't happen,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.960
 and what also can happen is,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.640
 the Daily Mail could have published it,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.880
 knowing it was a joke,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.320
 and then other newspapers started picking it up.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.800
 That happens as well.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.920
 And I almost feel like this could be a joke

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.440
 that's lost in translation,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.760
 'cause it just ends with the magistrate saying,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.220
 "Have the room disinfected."

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.000
 And maybe there was some joke or meme going around

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.420
 at the time that we've totally lost context for.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.460
 And if someone of the time in 1907, they read that,

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.080
 they're like, "Disinfected!

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.100
 "Ha ha ha ha, oh Mary, come on, look at this article.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.140
 "This is so funny,"

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.940
 'cause the joke would have made sense to them.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.340
 Or because we do believe in the paranormal,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.700
 or even if you don't,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.140
 you're fascinated by the paranormal.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.980
 It could be true.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.020
 Right, you could have a house that has that type of pull,

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.940
 that type of hold over someone.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.540
 I could not do a handstand

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.360
 if someone put a gun to my head.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.200
 I can't do a handstand.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.840
 And I think the story's interesting

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.040
 because they do have a character

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.280
 who can't do the handstand.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.200
 And there's no magical force

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.560
 that makes him do the handstand.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.440
 He just feels compelled to do it.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.640
 But that old lady's doing them, right?

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.280
 So I mean, they're old ladies more fit than I am.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.800
 Fascinating story.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.520
 And in the world of paranormal,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.680
 this definitely fits the lore, right?

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.240
 Some sort of compelling force, some sort of command.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.340
 And it's not necessarily a verbal command or a threat.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.140
 It's a psychic impulse on you.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.940
 You can't enter it unless you do X.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.900
 So it's a fascinating story.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.340
 And the question is, disinfecting help.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.680
 What was the disinfecting, right?

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.520
 What does that mean?

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.620
 Was there some sort of,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.900
 the Roanoke article kind of added a bit of a detail

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.180
 and said there might have been some strange disease

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.820
 in the house.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.860
 There might have been some fleas

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.040
 that escaped a flea circus

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.560
 and they were making everyone do tricks

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.840
 by biting them at night.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.160
 Who knows?

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.720
 Probably not that one, probably not that one.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.400
 But it's just an interesting story about a house

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.120
 that makes you do something.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.560
 We have ghosts that can make you do something.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.600
 We have demons that can make you do something.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.840
 Both of those in ways of possessing people.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.560
 And if a ghost can haunt a house,

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.040
 why couldn't the ghost have that also effect

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.080
 on type of people?

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.920
 It's not something, I say it's in the lore, it makes sense.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.080
 It's not something that's super common though,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.540
 where people enter a house

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.140
 where they feel compelled to do something.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.540
 However, it is not one of a kind.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.700
 It does happen, it's just not super common.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.180
 And strap in guys, because that's a pun,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.220
 that's a pun you'll understand in a bit.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.280
 Strap in because we're about to head to another house

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.360
 with a far more sinister version of this story.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.620
 And a far more recent example as well.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.160
 Devon, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.820
 of the carbon helicopter we're leaving behind France.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.040
 Waving at these people as they are doing handstands,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.380
 waving their feet back at us.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.480
 We are leaving behind old timey France.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.200
 We're headed all the way out to Aberdeen, South Dakota.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.040
 (imitates gunshots)

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.760
 Recently on the export,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.080
 there was a really cool thread about the Midwest area.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.760
 What's some creepy weird stuff

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.200
 that's going on the Midwest of the United States.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.120
 So, lot of really cool posts in there.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.720
 And there's this one I really wanted to highlight.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.720
 Cause it is just terrifying and opens up a whole new avenue

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.140
 of how our lives can be affected

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.940
 by the paranormal forces hidden around us.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.620
 We're in Aberdeen, South Dakota.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.580
 The year is 2002, give or take.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.920
 It's somewhere around there.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.420
 And there's this young man in the area.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.180
 Let's call him John.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.180
 And that's just a guess.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.060
 If that's, it's a super common name,

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.900
 but that's your real name.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.020
 I'm just shot in the dark there.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.880
 And he says, you know, the city of Aberdeen in South Dakota,

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.800
 it's just full of weirdos, right?

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.280
 As you're listening to this, you're like, what?

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.120
 It's full of weirdos.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.560
 He says it's one of those towns

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.400
 that no matter where you go in South Dakota,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.200
 whatever, no matter where you go in South Dakota.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.840
 If you mention Aberdeen, people go,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.160
 uh, people are just kind of like, yeah, that sounds weird.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.960
 And every state has that town.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.280
 I think every area has that town up where I'm at.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.640
 That's Doofers.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.840
 Doofers considered a full of a bunch of weirdos.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.020
 But I'm starting to my doofers listeners.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.220
 He says this town of Aberdeen is just weird.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.300
 Now he had a friend who lived in this town

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.700
 and his friend who lived in Aberdeen

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.860
 would often have dreams about demons.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.940
 And that would just be unsettling to begin with.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.260
 I, as much as I spend time in the world paranormal,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.500
 I don't often dream about demons.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.460
 Shockingly, very little now that I think about it.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.300
 It's kind of weird.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.700
 He has these dreams.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.300
 It's not like I'm like holding a heart shape

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.140
 filled with a demon on it.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.920
 And I'm like, oh, come to me in nighttime,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.900
 please, my infernal buddies.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.680
 I'm glad, I'm glad that I don't have it.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.960
 He dreams about demons and he goes,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.560
 so it's not just that I was having dreams about demons.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.380
 I'm having dreams that in the basement of my house,

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.360
 which there is a basement, there's this huge pit.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.100
 There's not a pit, there's not a pit in my real basement.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.080
 But in the dreams, I will be in the basement

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.640
 and there's this pit there.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.860
 And then I can see demons crawling out of the pit

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.540
 into our reality.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.660
 Whatever, right?

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.100
 Spooky, spooky dreams.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.300
 He goes, I had him every once in a while.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.760
 But just dreams.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.380
 Well, eventually the house got sold

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.500
 and the new owners of the house had been there for a bit.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.380
 They actually get ahold of him and his family

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.100
 and they go, hey, you know, we bought this house from you.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.340
 Thanks for selling it to us.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.480
 But there's been some weird things going on in this house.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.420
 You guys have any idea of what they could be?

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.040
 I don't know if they told the truth.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.880
 I don't know if they lied.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.960
 They're like, oh no, man, that house is totally dope.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.240
 But the new owners also said,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.220
 not only has some weird things been happening,

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.900
 we keep having these weird dreams about the basement.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.380
 So that's just a creepy story from the town

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.600
 of Aberdeen, South Dakota,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.360
 but that's not the reason why we're here.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.480
 That was just a story.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.940
 So if you have a basement, you'll be scared tonight.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.020
 The reason why we're here is we are helping John

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.240
 move into his new apartment.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.060
 We're actually watching him, we're not helping.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.020
 We're watching John move into his new apartment.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.740
 Now his new apartment in Aberdeen used to be an old house,

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.060
 over a hundred years old,

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.280
 but it had recently been sectioned off

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.900
 into three separate apartments.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.580
 And what a cool place to live, right?

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.360
 And John said, my apartment had a standard bedroom.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.360
 Like you walk into the entryway for his apartment,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.200
 you have a standard bedroom, living area, things like that.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.960
 But right when you walk into his apartment,

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.960
 right off from the entryway was this room.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.560
 This room that seemed almost too small

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.780
 to have any real use, very, very small room

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.760
 off to the side of the entryway.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.760
 And he's moving his stuff in, he's all alone,

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.760
 moving by himself, putting his stuff in his bedroom,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.260
 setting stuff out.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.220
 And he goes, I had a very weird vibe,

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.960
 just moving my stuff in.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.580
 And this is the first night he's putting everything away.

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.060
 And he says, as I'm continuing to get stuff out of my car

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.240
 and bring it inside,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.140
 the weird vibe changed to almost a paranoia.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.520
 I felt like someone was watching me.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.140
 But you know, new place, right?

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.540
 Is that something that normally happens

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.940
 when you move into new apartments?

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.580
 The overwhelming dread of being watched by the dam.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.360
 He doesn't know, maybe it's his first apartment.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.160
 As he's putting stuff in his bedroom

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.520
 and coming back outside to get stuff out of his car

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.620
 and coming back into his bedroom,

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.040
 as this process is going on,

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.520
 at one point he walks out of his bedroom

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.420
 into the living room and he sees,

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.240
 sitting there in his living room,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.020
 a man in a straight jacket.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:11.520
 The man is staring at John with piercing eyes.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.260
 And a huge grin across his face.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.640
 John described it as,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.320
 it is what you would think a psychotic stare would look like.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.120
 It was the very definition of that rictus grin

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.560
 with wild wide eyes staring directly at you.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.320
 John ran out of the living room,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.820
 ran out of his apartment, ran out to his car

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.460
 and drove away trying to make sense

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.360
 of what that was, right?

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.360
 He's pretty sure he doesn't have a roommate,

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.880
 definitely doesn't have a roommate in a straight jacket.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.540
 And he drives out to his buddy's house in the area.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.520
 This has to have just been like my imagination, right?

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.360
 I'm getting creeped out, it's a new place.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.360
 Maybe I just need some help moving in.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.240
 So he talks to his buddy, doesn't tell him anything.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.600
 He's like, "Hey, he's all sweat."

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.840
 He's also in his big peace staying on his pants.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.480
 He's like, "Hey buddy, how's it going?

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.320
 Long time no see."

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.960
 He's like, "Dude, take a shower and change your pants.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.860
 Hey, you wanna come back and help me move stuff in?

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.140
 You come check out my new place?"

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.720
 Yeah, sure, let's go do it.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.660
 So he picks his friend up, doesn't tell him what he saw

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.180
 and they both enter the apartment.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.720
 John looks, living room's completely empty.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.600
 John goes into his bedroom, starts putting stuff away.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.340
 His friend's helping him move stuff around

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.180
 and then all of a sudden from the living room,

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.420
 he hears his friend screaming at the top of his lungs.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:50.600
 John's in the bedroom and from the living room,

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.500
 he hears his best friend screaming at the top of his lungs.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:01.400
 John knows exactly what his friend is seeing.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.400
 John leaves the bedroom just as his friend

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.320
 is leaving the apartment running outside.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.780
 And John catches up to his friend and goes,

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.180
 "You saw it, didn't you? You saw it."

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.780
 Friends like, "Yeah, you knew that was there?

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.420
 You knew that was there and you invited me over

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.380
 without telling me?"

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.180
 I didn't know, like I knew because I saw it,

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.540
 but that was real, wasn't it?

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.380
 Yeah, yeah, that was, what was that?

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.620
 That was some crazy guy in a straight jacket.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.620
 Insane look on his face, I know.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:38.980
 So then, this is hilarious and exactly what I would do.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.900
 They decide to go get the best friends, little brother,

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.040
 who I'm assuming is at least an adult, right?

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.540
 I hope it's not like a 10 year old,

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.520
 but they decide, listen, we need,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.120
 so maybe we're both just losing our minds, right?

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.360
 Let's go pick up your little brother

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.000
 and we will tell him there is a phantasm

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.760
 of an insane man in my new apartment.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.280
 Let's just go pick him up, see what he sees.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.860
 So they go and they pick up little brother,

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.440
 he's playing switch, he's like,

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.780
 wee, Animal Park or whatever that game is,

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.480
 Animal Farm is so fun.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.500
 They're like, come on, dude, come on, Bobby,

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.340
 let's go to this house.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.740
 They're all have gummy worms to try to trick him out.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.580
 Come on, come on, yay, I'll go with you guys.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.280
 They take the younger brother to the house,

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.760
 John's driving.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.920
 They take the younger brother to the house

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.540
 and they have not told him anything

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.500
 about what's in the house.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.520
 And when John and his friend walk into the house,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.240
 the brother follows them in

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.580
 and then once he gets into this apartment, he stops.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:52.960
 And then he walks into the small room off the entryway,

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.600
 he walks into that small room

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:00.760
 and wraps his arms tight around his body

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.080
 and goes, ha ha ha, look at me, look at me, I'm crazy.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.340
 (laughing)

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.740
 And they go, what are you doing?

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.140
 And he goes, oh, I'm just pretending

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.740
 I'm in a straight jacket, woo hoo, look at me, I'm crazy.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.460
 (laughing)

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.220
 And his fear is gripping John and his friend.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.500
 They ask, why in the world are you acting

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.200
 like you're in a straight jacket?

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.580
 And the brother goes, I don't know,

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.540
 I just, I feel like this is a room

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.340
 where you would put someone with a straight jacket.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.800
 I just, I don't know, look at me, I'm all trapped in here,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.920
 let me out, let me out.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:44.160
 John packed his stuff up, broke his lease

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.440
 and never went back to that apartment.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.680
 This was his first night, remember, never went back.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:57.280
 He said like years later, he was talking to his friend

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.680
 about it and he goes, hey, remember that house

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.640
 that I got with the crazy guy with the straight jacket

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.340
 and then your brother started acting

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.140
 like a crazy guy in a straight jacket

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.820
 and all that stuff and his friend who will name Kevin.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.060
 I didn't give him a name the whole story.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.300
 The friend goes, yeah, I can't remember that.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.860
 I think we were just tired.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.820
 John's like, what?

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.380
 Kevin's like, I don't want to hit,

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.660
 I just, I think we were both tired that night

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.900
 probably just seeing things, not real.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.660
 There was no ghosts.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.420
 John goes, so you think we were both tired

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.180
 and we both saw the exact same thing

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.720
 and I didn't tell you what I saw

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.760
 but somehow you saw the same thing.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.920
 Oh yeah, yeah, just sleepy.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.200
 And it's funny 'cause I've encountered that as well.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.920
 I've met people who have gone on ghost hunts with me

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.320
 and we've seen paranormal phenomenon

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.280
 and that night we talk about it

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.920
 and weeks later we're talking about it

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.240
 and then months later, well, maybe it wasn't that.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.360
 Well, no dude, we clearly saw something.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.840
 I don't know, maybe we were just tired.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.400
 It's weird how the human mind

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.100
 doesn't want to believe in this stuff

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.780
 'cause it's creepy, right?

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.940
 Our brains have governors built into them

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.940
 so we don't see everything that we see

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.620
 and the things we do see that we're not supposed to see,

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.220
 we will discard them.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.340
 It's very, very interesting.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.300
 I've seen that happen too with friends of mine

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.660
 and it may have even happened to me.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.940
 I wouldn't know obviously, right?

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.520
 If my brain goes, "Ah, I was probably just made up

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.880
 "and then I stopped remembering it."

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.760
 But yeah, it's super weird.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.240
 I've been on ghost hunts with people

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.760
 that were really good friends of mine

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.880
 and they would have seen something

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.520
 and I brought it up months or a year later

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.440
 and they're like, "Ah, they'll remember the event."

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.840
 See, that's what's interesting.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.160
 They'll remember the event but they'll remember it as,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.240
 oh, I think it was something different.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.200
 So now that they go, "Jason, what are you talking about?

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.120
 "Is that when you were doing all those binadurals?"

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.360
 No, they remember the event and they remember seeing the thing.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.680
 They just have a new, I was just tired.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.620
 I just hallucinated the same thing you saw

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.820
 which really is unlikely.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.460
 The thing I love about this story

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:11.420
 is it's not just that there was a phantom in the house, right?

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.900
 It's not just that there was the image

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.580
 of a man in a straight jacket with a terrifying grin

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.900
 and crazy eyes, right?

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.500
 That enough is scary but the fact that the brother,

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.360
 when he walked in,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.800
 became the phantom.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:34.840
 He walked in and instantly felt compelled

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.120
 to wrap his arms around his body,

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.560
 walking to this little room and start acting

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.060
 like he's in a straight jacket.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.980
 Now the other two people, Kevin and John,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.840
 were walking throughout the apartment

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.000
 for a period of time before this creature,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.560
 this spirit made itself known

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.040
 but the younger brother immediately

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.040
 takes on the personality of the lunatic.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:06.760
 Now he goes, there's no history of the house.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.280
 He said there was a hospital nearby

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.240
 but he tried looking at me,

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.280
 when he was trying to break his lease,

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.120
 he's probably trying to prove

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.560
 that it was haunted or something like that.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.480
 He goes, he couldn't find anything in the house

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.880
 that would point to it being haunted

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.120
 or being used as an insane asylum or something like that

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.960
 but the kind of implication is that little room

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.280
 was set up for a man in a straight jacket

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.080
 and now his spirit is free to roam

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.800
 but again, not only that,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.240
 that it can actually not necessarily possess people

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.080
 but latch on to certain people

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.680
 and that person takes those traits.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.440
 Did it see the man?

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.760
 Just felt acting a little crazy

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.660
 which makes you wonder,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.040
 what if it was the younger brother

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.920
 who moved into this place, right?

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.840
 And he walks in there and he sees that room

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.040
 and he goes, oh, I bet you,

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.080
 I bet you this is where a crazy person would be

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.200
 and he wrapped his, he's all by himself in this instance

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.040
 but he's pretending he's wrapped in a straight jacket

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.480
 for a bit in the room and he's like, ha ha ha,

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.280
 crazy, crazy times.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.240
 Then he goes on and he's unpacking his stuff

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.920
 and this man is very vulnerable to this spirit

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.560
 and over time it's not just,

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.800
 oh, I bet you that room was used

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.040
 for a guy with a straight jacket.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.800
 This dark psychic energy is actually infusing

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.240
 this young man, driving him crazy.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.680
 The other people had enough shielding,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.720
 they could at least see it

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.360
 but this young man when he walked in,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.320
 he was instantly vulnerable to this thing.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.320
 And Mike and like the story before,

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.320
 I mean, these are very obvious visualizations

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.160
 or actions from this.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.720
 The first story having to walk in on your hands,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.520
 in this story seeing this ghost

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.880
 and then someone being influenced instantly by the ghost.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.480
 I started put together that hypothesis,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.760
 like these are obvious things but what about

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.920
 all the houses that we've lived in,

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.240
 all the apartments we've been in over the years, right?

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.640
 Even just visiting someone else's apartment.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.240
 Who's to say, and we'll wrap the episode up like this,

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.120
 with this very dark and dreary ending,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.160
 how much of our personalities are us?

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.680
 How many of our likes and dislikes are vices and addictions?

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.580
 Our fears and hopes are actually us.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:32.040
 And how many are psychic residue

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.040
 from a place we visited once?

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.760
 Or a home we grew up in?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:44.720
 Where a young girl died in a pool back in the 70s

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.200
 and you moved into that house and you just didn't like swimming.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.880
 You just never really could explain it.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.280
 I'm not, you know, I'm a goat swimmer and all,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.040
 I just don't enjoy swimming.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:06.280
 Or you spend most of your life not being anti-cigarette

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.840
 but not really being interested in cigarettes either.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.560
 And then you're in your mid-20s and you're in a new town

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.880
 and you find yourself craving a cigarette.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.440
 You don't know, you figure, listen,

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.560
 I work in this new job, I'm in this new town,

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.440
 I'm super stressed and I saw the movie "Joker"

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.120
 and it made smoking look really cool.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.080
 So I knew I would impress some girls,

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.080
 so I went and I picked up some cigarettes and,

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.440
 you know, I am not addicted.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.440
 I just smoke casually on the weekends.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.200
 But it's just all this other stuff going on in my life.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.240
 But it's actually psychic residue

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.640
 from your new place of residence.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.800
 It's interesting 'cause this is actually a belief

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.720
 of Scientology that there are ingrams

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.040
 that are connected to you

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.160
 and we have to wipe those off of ourselves.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.000
 And part of being a Scientologist is building up,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.400
 I'm gonna bastardize it.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.880
 I've had a few Scientology friends in my life

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.440
 and I'm just kind of putting it together piece by piece.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.680
 But it's something that you have to do this cleansing.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.200
 You do like the E-meter thing

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.320
 and you relive the experience over and over again

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.160
 of this negative thing

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.280
 you're kind of washing these ingrams off of you

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.080
 until you become clear, I think,

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.280
 is the supposed to be the base level of humanity.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.280
 And then if you do it more, you can ascend type of thing.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.360
 It kind of is aligned with that,

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.120
 but this leans more into just a paranormal thing.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.600
 All of the yesterday we talked about ghosts are everywhere.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.960
 This one's kind of the same thing.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.080
 This psychic energy is everywhere.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.800
 And how much of ourselves is actually ourselves?

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.280
 One thing that I find very interesting

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.920
 that my appetites are not my own.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.720
 When you fast, you very quickly realize

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.520
 that a lot of the stuff you love to eat

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.280
 is actually the stuff your gut biome needs to fuel itself.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.860
 It's fascinating, your gut biome sends chemicals

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.280
 into your body saying we need sugar, we need carbs,

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.640
 we need sugar, we need carbs.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.880
 That's where those cravings come from.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.640
 And if you can go, I think it's two or three days

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.320
 without consuming sugar or carbs,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.280
 all of that gut biome dies off.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.400
 You'll actually be craving it even more

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.920
 'cause it's releasing more signals to your brain

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.080
 'cause they will die.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.640
 It's basically an entire civilization in your stomach

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.760
 that will die if you don't have at least a candy bar

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.720
 or a donut.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.880
 Come on, just eat that donut.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.040
 And you have to go three days, basically,

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.360
 and then all of that dies in your stomach

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.400
 and your gut biome is now different

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.560
 and your taste buds are different.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.120
 And what you wanna eat is different

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.800
 until you start eating sugar and carbs again

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.240
 and that gut biome starts to reappear.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.960
 And then the cravings start again.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.400
 Those aren't my cravings, those are cravings

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.960
 that are coming from within my stomach.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:56.960
 An alien life form that's made its home in me,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.200
 but it's not me.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.240
 And that's explained by science.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.560
 We know that from science.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.360
 So the question is, when we look at the world

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.200
 of psychic energy, how many of our phobias

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.000
 or how many of our addictions

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.040
 or how many of our attractions,

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.600
 how many of our desires are actually natively ours?

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.960
 How many are things attaching themselves to us?

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.600
 It's a tricky question because there was really

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600
 no answer for it, right?

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.800
 It comes down to who are you as a person?

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.880
 What is yourself?

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.720
 And you may think you know you

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.560
 and you may be very introspective and know you,

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.720
 but whatever could be inhabiting you

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.840
 could also be hiding very, very well.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.920
 I used extreme examples like picking up a smoking habit

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.280
 or being afraid of water.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.840
 It could be far more simple than that,

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.880
 far more simple than that.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.360
 Doesn't have to be walking on your hands.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.000
 Doesn't have to be being crazy in a house.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.680
 The world of the paranormal is so fascinating

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.800
 because there's so many roads we can walk down.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.200
 And a lot of those roads are spooky.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.460
 Very, very scary and unsettling roads.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.840
 And I think this is one of those.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.840
 I think this really kind of makes you buy

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.520
 into this hypothesis that who are you?

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:32.200
 When you get angry, is it you?

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.240
 Or is it some sort of rage energy

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.800
 that latched onto you many, many years ago?

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:46.400
 You think you're in love with a person,

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.040
 but you don't really understand why.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.780
 It doesn't make sense to you why you love them so much.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.360
 Maybe you don't.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.720
 But some energy, some thought form

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.920
 attached itself to you around the same time you met them.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.000
 Things just seemed to click,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.440
 but were you really in control of those decisions?

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:14.060
 I talked about on my episode, Solar Plexus Clown Gliders,

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.080
 how when I was in a courtroom in Sacramento,

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.840
 for, it was a college class, I had to go to the courtroom,

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.840
 I saw a King Cobra on the seat next to me.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:29.320
 Wasn't real, but I saw it,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.280
 and I saw it uncoil and lunge at me.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:38.760
 And then for the next five years, I suffered from back pain,

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:45.300
 which led me to be prescribed 240 Vicodin a month.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.460
 (silence)

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:53.980
 And I always wondered, I always figured

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.620
 that that was some sort of psychic energy

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.900
 that someone had left in that courtroom.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.980
 And it had attached itself to me and caused this pain.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.020
 It was physical pain, but it was caused

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.540
 by some sort of psychic entity.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.140
 And who knows where that is now, right?

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:12.980
 Other than a few bumps and bruises due to being 45 years old,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:17.140
 my back's fine, I didn't need to be on 240 Vicodin a month.

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:22.660
 Back in 2003, that's where they were prescribing

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.780
 for a little bit of back pain.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.040
 And my life really started to slide.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.940
 'Cause how do you function on that much narcotics, right?

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.420
 It's a narcotic drug.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.540
 You know, I'm doing good, I'm doing great.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.260
 There's a lot of people, right?

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.420
 There's a lot of people who didn't get out of that.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.900
 There's a lot of people who got sucked deeper

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.940
 into that world of painkillers.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.580
 I'm very, consider myself very, very lucky.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.900
 Blessed, right?

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.740
 Blessed.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:55.420
 But I do believe that there are entities out there

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.020
 that can latch on to us.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.740
 And I do believe that it may not be the cause

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.020
 of all of our vices and all of our passions.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.740
 I do believe that these things are out there.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:06.820
 I've talked about it before.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.820
 I call them psychic landmines.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.380
 A thousand people could walk back and forth

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.380
 across one of these things and it never do anything.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.380
 And a hundred people could walk by

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.020
 and get a weird feeling, right?

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.620
 Something feels off in this area.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.660
 They don't wanna be here, it's creepy.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:28.700
 But maybe three or four people walk across that thing

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.300
 and that landmine goes off.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:35.020
 That spirit, that demon, that archon,

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.140
 whatever you wanna call it, springs to life,

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:42.780
 latches on and takes you for one hell of a ride.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:48.180
 The world of the paranormal is fascinating and terrifying

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:52.720
 because it can go from being a spooky story

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.480
 to a life-changing event like that.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:02.100
 And you never know what side you're gonna be on.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:07.780
 Are you gonna be the person just listening to the story

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.020
 on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.860
 Or are you going to be the person

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.980
 whose life slowly descends into a living hell

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:21.480
 simply because you moved into the wrong apartment?

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:26.380
 (upbeat music)

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.020
