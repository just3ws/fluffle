14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,560
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,320
 - Today, we take a look at three different hauntings.

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,280
 Each one exploring their own theory

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,840
 of what ghosts actually are.

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,000
 And all three take place in my hometown

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,720
 of Sacramento, California.

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,200
 We're going back to Cali today on Dead Ravva Radio.

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,780
 (upbeat music)

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,760
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,840
 of Dead Ravva Radio.

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,800
 I'm having a great day.

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
 I really, really do.

28
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,760
 Let's go ahead and get started here

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,520
 'cause we got three stories to cover.

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,240
 That'll take place in Sacramento, California,

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,160
 the town I'm from and the town that I just left.

32
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,000
 I was on vacation there for three weeks.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,300
 These ones I picked because they're actual,

34
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,120
 not only are they all located

35
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,960
 in the same geographical area,

36
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,040
 but they all are different as far as

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,200
 what people think ghosts are or what ghosts might be.

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,760
 So for our first story,

39
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,000
 let's hop into Jason Jalopy

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,920
 'cause we're just gonna be driving around Sacramento.

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,040
 Sunny, sunny Sacramento, the city that never sleeps.

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,520
 And we're in the Jason Jalopy.

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
 (indistinct)

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,680
 It's like a, how did I describe it before?

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,040
 Oh, a chitty, chitty, bang, bang car.

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,440
 Just imagine that just slowly going through the street

47
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,720
 on metal wheels, totally tearing up the pavement,

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
 but we don't care 'cause we're just there for a little bit

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,040
 and then we're gonna go our separate ways.

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,960
 We are on J Street in Sacramento.

51
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,560
 So Sacramento is one of those cities

52
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,080
 that isn't very imaginative.

53
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,000
 All their streets are pretty much just numbers and letters.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,300
 And so we're on J Street.

55
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,880
 So that's about in the middle of town.

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,640
 It's incredibly unimaginative.

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,040
 So if it's in the middle of the alphabet,

58
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,520
 it's in the middle of town.

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,200
 I think X Street is right on the outskirts.

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,780
 I don't know if there's a Z Street, but there should be.

61
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,840
 Now this story takes place before the 1950s.

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,700
 You're like, that's quite vague.

63
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,440
 And again, we've talked about this before.

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,000
 The less details we have,

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,300
 generally the more skeptical things can be.

66
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,080
 Or the more skeptical we should be of things,

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,180
 but this is takes place before the 1950s.

68
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,720
 So it could have been in the year 16 AD,

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,500
 could have been 1949.

70
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,300
 It actually took place in the general decade

71
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,700
 of the '40s and the '50s.

72
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,660
 We're not going back to native time.

73
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,020
 So where was it going?

74
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,220
 Oh yeah, so pre-1950s, a family moves into a house.

75
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,860
 You have Roland Johnson, big fan of limp biscuit.

76
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,120
 It's Roland Johnson, not Roland Johnson,

77
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,540
 but his wife and he has a four-year-old daughter.

78
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,940
 They all live in this beautiful Victorian apartment building.

79
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,780
 It kind of kept throwing me off,

80
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,500
 but they live in a beautiful Victorian apartment building.

81
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,900
 Maybe it was Victorian house turned into

82
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,740
 a new apartment building.

83
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,140
 I don't think Victorians had apartment buildings.

84
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,580
 But anyways, okay, let's forget the details

85
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,060
 that don't make sense,

86
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,260
 'cause I wanna get to the meat of the story.

87
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,060
 Take off our skepticism hat.

88
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,660
 Let's explore this story.

89
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,340
 So there's this little girl walking around the house.

90
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,220
 And the little, the four-year-old girl keeps talking

91
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,740
 about this dude named Sam.

92
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,700
 She'd be like, "Mommy, daddy, I met this guy named Sam

93
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,540
 and he's so nice.

94
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,420
 He's like super tall and he has a beard."

95
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,780
 And the parents are like,

96
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,540
 "Is there someone creeping around her house

97
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,860
 talking to our little girl?"

98
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,540
 She's like, "No, he's totally fine.

99
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,500
 Like we just hang out."

100
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,980
 And he wants me to go into the basement.

101
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,740
 Roland is like, "It's not a good idea.

102
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,780
 He has his hat on backwards, big baggy pants."

103
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,940
 He's like, "That's not a good idea, little lady.

104
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,500
 Don't go into the basement with anybody,

105
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,180
 except your mom or your dad,

106
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,700
 and be kind of suspicious of your mom,

107
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,300
 'cause I think she's making meth down there.

108
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,260
 But definitely don't go into the basement

109
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,620
 with a dude you don't know, even if you know his name.

110
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,080
 He's still, don't do that.

111
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,020
 But she's so convincing over the course of time.

112
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,580
 She's constantly bringing up Sam in the basement.

113
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,500
 The dad's like, "You know what?

114
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,060
 I'm gonna go see what's going on in the basement."

115
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,220
 Which actually you should probably do right away.

116
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,500
 If your daughter tells you there's a man in the basement

117
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,820
 trying to get you to go down there,

118
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,980
 you shouldn't just blow it off,

119
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,060
 being like, "Ah, there's no monsters under your bed,

120
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,140
 'cause there might actually be a man named Sam

121
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,980
 in your basement."

122
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,740
 But anyways, so him and his wife and his four-year-old girl

123
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,420
 decide to go, the dad says, "I'm gonna go into the basement."

124
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,340
 And the wife and the daughter pretty much tag along.

125
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,300
 So they walk down the spooky, spooky steps

126
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,140
 into the basement.

127
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,780
 (imitates growling)

128
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,460
 This is the 1950s, so the light bulb

129
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,220
 hadn't been invented yet, no phones, nothing.

130
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,060
 They're walking through with candles,

131
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,380
 and they have a pitchfork.

132
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,220
 Getting ready to pitchfork somebody.

133
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,580
 They get down to the bottom, they get into the basement,

134
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,080
 and they realize that they're not alone.

135
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,060
 Maybe our daughter was onto something.

136
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,980
 Maybe our daughter isn't as stupid as we thought she was.

137
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,860
 Because he sees a shovel laying on the ground, right?

138
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,660
 Roland looks down and he sees this shovel

139
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,900
 sitting on the ground, and he picks it up,

140
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,100
 and then they all see a man standing in front of them.

141
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,180
 This is how they describe him.

142
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,040
 He's a tall man, dressed in all black,

143
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,980
 with a long white beard.

144
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
 Normal human face, they don't have to go into,

145
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,580
 you know, like his fingers were extra wrinkly.

146
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,020
 Just like a normal human, just a little taller,

147
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,500
 dressed in black with a long white beard.

148
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,860
 And they're looking at him, and he points to a spot

149
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,300
 in the ground.

150
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,340
 And the dad is just standing there with his shovel.

151
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,220
 He's not swinging it at this dude.

152
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,500
 He's just standing there with his shovel.

153
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,660
 And the dad decides not to dig.

154
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,340
 He's like, "Nah, I'm not gonna do that."

155
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,260
 Now, it's kinda weird to pick up a digging instrument,

156
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,820
 and then someone say, "Hey, can you dig here?"

157
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,740
 And be like, "Nah, I'm just gonna stand here

158
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,380
 with the only thing in the basement

159
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,020
 that can be used to dig and not dig."

160
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,620
 But Roland decides not to dig.

161
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,320
 And at that point, the tall man, the tall spooky man,

162
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,820
 his eyes turn, quote, "Fiery red."

163
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,900
 So I don't know if flames are shooting out of his eyes,

164
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,020
 or they were glowing red like Goosebumps television show

165
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,220
 or something like that.

166
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,140
 Or just that his eyes looked mean,

167
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,420
 but they were glowing a fiery red.

168
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,420
 Family takes off.

169
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,540
 (panting)

170
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,420
 He's pushing his daughter and his wife out of the way.

171
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,660
 He's like, "Mid first!"

172
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,100
 Pushing him out of the way, he runs up the stairs.

173
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,860
 He's destroying the stairs, so Sam can't chase him.

174
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,540
 Daughter and mom are down there, help us.

175
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,100
 Now anyways, they all go upstairs.

176
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,480
 They actually end up boarding up the basement at that point.

177
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
 They don't ever wanna go down there.

178
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,440
 I hope they don't ever have any trouble with their boiler,

179
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
 but they board up their basement,

180
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,840
 never go back down there.

181
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,840
 Roland ends up leaving, moving with the family.

182
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,720
 He doesn't leave them there.

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
 They all move.

184
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,680
 He becomes chief of police in Taha Chappy,

185
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,280
 which is a city in California.

186
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,520
 Now I tried to verify as much as I could with this story,

187
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,160
 because obviously it just sounds ridiculous.

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,500
 But I couldn't find that there was actually a chief of police

189
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,580
 of that name in that city.

190
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,220
 But again, we're talking pre-1950s,

191
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,020
 so it's not like they were keeping internet records

192
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,060
 and stuff like that.

193
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,420
 I will take off our skeptic hats

194
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,540
 and assume this is true just for the next part of it.

195
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,660
 In 1954, this is why we know the story

196
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,020
 took place before the 1950s,

197
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,980
 'cause in 1954 they decided to tear down the building

198
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,300
 and they were gonna build a new building in its place.

199
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,020
 And while they're laying a new foundation,

200
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,940
 some workers find a small bag,

201
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,000
 a little baggy, full of gold coins.

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,320
 Forest Fin's Treasure, you ask?

203
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,300
 No, no, it wasn't, because that doesn't exist.

204
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,720
 But, assuming this story is true,

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,080
 this story kinda highlights one of the things

206
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,600
 people think ghosts are.

207
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,260
 And those are people who died with unfinished business.

208
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,520
 That's probably the most popular version of a ghost.

209
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,880
 There's, well, two most popular versions of ghosts.

210
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,140
 One, people who died in horrible circumstances,

211
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,060
 whose spirit is left to torment the living

212
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,460
 or just kinda float around with no head

213
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,300
 and stuff like that.

214
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,340
 That's one of the most common

215
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,080
 and the second most common would be

216
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,340
 people who died with unfinished business.

217
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,220
 They're still here because there's things

218
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,000
 they weren't able to complete while they were alive.

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,700
 And this ghost kind of is the perfect example of that.

220
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,660
 This ghost, this man, Sam, whoever he was,

221
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,940
 had left a treasure there

222
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,920
 and was never able to retrieve it as a living person,

223
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,620
 but when he died, he still wanted that treasure retrieved.

224
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,140
 Very, very common type of ghost,

225
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,420
 but not the only kind of ghost.

226
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,980
 Let's go ahead, we're gonna hop back

227
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,420
 in the Jason Jalopy, (imitates popping)

228
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,020
 and we're going to Antelope.

229
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,820
 Antelope is where I actually hung out a lot in Sacramento.

230
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,620
 Now, Sacramento, if you don't know it,

231
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,620
 I'm sure a lot of other cities are like this,

232
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,500
 but Sacramento is basically a giant city in the middle

233
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,620
 and then suburbs pushing out in every single direction.

234
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,880
 So you would leave Sacramento,

235
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,920
 you would drive through North Highlands,

236
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,760
 you drive through all the stuff.

237
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,360
 Eventually you have to drive through all these suburbs,

238
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
 you get to Antelope.

239
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,160
 Now, Antelope is actually on the verge of farmland.

240
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,920
 It's basically almost the farthest you can get

241
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,240
 from the city center.

242
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,840
 And I spent a lot of time there, hung out,

243
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
 that's where all my friends were,

244
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,840
 I used to hang out at Godfather's Pizza.

245
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,520
 Couple of the ghost stories that I've told

246
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,800
 took place or start in Antelope.

247
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,160
 It's a nice little area,

248
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,760
 but not for these people we're about to talk about.

249
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,240
 So where Antelope and Roseville Road meet,

250
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,180
 it's the border of Antelope and Citrus Heights,

251
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,420
 which is another place I spent most of my time.

252
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,820
 There is a bunch of, you can look at satellite pictures

253
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,500
 of that, there's a bunch of houses,

254
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,940
 this fully developed area,

255
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,540
 and this large plot of land in the middle of all of it,

256
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,260
 worth millions of dollars

257
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,740
 because the area is so congested with homes

258
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,100
 that's completely undeveloped,

259
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,460
 as far as I can tell by satellite maps to this day.

260
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,580
 Definitely undeveloped when I was there a couple of years ago.

261
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,780
 And what it was, there's a reason why it's undeveloped.

262
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,720
 One, the government owns it, and two, the history behind it.

263
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,380
 This area that is now surrounded by happy, happy families

264
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,200
 living in their happy, happy homes was known as Camp Kohler.

265
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,160
 Camp Kohler was a, I'm trying to think of the right word,

266
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,840
 basically a holding area for Japanese Americans

267
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,960
 who were being sent to internment camps

268
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,160
 during World War II.

269
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,840
 It wasn't an internment camp itself,

270
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,760
 but it was one of the way stations.

271
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
 As they were bringing them up through the West Coast,

272
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,100
 they would stop off there,

273
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,600
 and then they would be sent off to other,

274
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,760
 I think the internment camp was up in Eureka

275
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,940
 or something like that, it was farther off,

276
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,280
 but it was a way station for people who were being

277
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,720
 basically arrested because of their ethnicity,

278
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,900
 because people were afraid that they'd be spiser

279
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,060
 in World War II.

280
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,060
 And you had up to 4,600 Japanese Americans held there,

281
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,560
 and then they'd be shipped off to somewhere else.

282
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,500
 So nobody wants to live there.

283
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,700
 Nobody wants to buy a home that used to be

284
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,740
 a Japanese internment camp.

285
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,540
 I don't think it's like a memorial park

286
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,380
 or anything like that.

287
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,900
 I think it's just undeveloped land.

288
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,400
 There's a couple buildings, that's it.

289
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
 They don't really draw attention to it,

290
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,580
 but the government doesn't really want to sell it.

291
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,500
 They may have plans for the future as grim as that may be,

292
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,420
 but this was a place where this was part of the process

293
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,060
 of moving people into the internment camps.

294
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,140
 So when that was being done,

295
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,740
 there were no houses surrounding it.

296
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,540
 It was kind of off in the middle of nowhere.

297
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,460
 Like I said, it's about as far from Sacramento

298
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,420
 as you can get in the North direction.

299
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,260
 I think it's North.

300
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,300
 I'm not really good with directions.

301
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,140
 West maybe.

302
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,980
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.

303
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,500
 It's about the farthest, one of the farthest points

304
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,620
 you can get away from the city

305
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,500
 and still be in some sort of area.

306
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,860
 Now, nowadays there's houses surrounding it.

307
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,900
 I often talk about the book,

308
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,580
 The National Directory of Haunted Places,

309
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,020
 and I recommend people buying that.

310
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,380
 It's a great book.

311
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,780
 Check it out on Amazon.

312
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,580
 Anywhere you can get it, use bookstores have it.

313
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,860
 It's a great, great resource.

314
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,900
 I refer to it all the time.

315
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,660
 And I've met the author.

316
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,060
 Back when I was a journalism student,

317
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,780
 I interviewed him 'cause I was looking at doing

318
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,660
 a story on him and I've talked to him.

319
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,540
 And we talked specifically about this case

320
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,620
 'cause he talks about this Japanese internment camp situation

321
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,700
 in his book, but he doesn't go into a lot of detail

322
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,780
 because the people he talked to said,

323
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,660
 "I don't want anyone to know about this.

324
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,460
 "I'll talk to you."

325
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,060
 Someone vouched for you.

326
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,180
 You talk to these other people

327
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,820
 and they said, "You're really cool and you keep secrets."

328
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,660
 So I'll talk to you,

329
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,740
 "I don't want my address given out.

330
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,620
 "I don't want anyone coming around my house."

331
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,060
 'Cause the National Directory of Haunted Places,

332
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,300
 one of the reasons why I recommend it,

333
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,860
 is there are addresses in it in contact phone numbers

334
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,300
 that you can go to these houses

335
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
 and check them out for yourself.

336
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,980
 It's a great, great resource.

337
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,860
 But he goes out there and he's doing this investigation.

338
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,860
 And he hears this through the grapevine

339
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,020
 and he goes out to this area and interviews them.

340
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,340
 The neighborhood is riddled with ghosts.

341
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,820
 But there's two odd things about it.

342
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,580
 One, only people of Japanese descent can see the ghosts.

343
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,780
 So you could be a Hispanic dude living in your house

344
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,740
 and a whole bunch of ghosts just standing there

345
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,340
 looking at you as you're playing your Xbox One.

346
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,900
 You never see them.

347
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,540
 Some white dude mowing his lawn,

348
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,380
 running over a Japanese ghost,

349
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,420
 just taking a nap on your lawn.

350
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,540
 You run him over, you would never know it.

351
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,500
 But then you look over at your neighbor,

352
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,220
 who's Japanese and he's like,

353
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,780
 "Doesn't he want to dig up the garbage?"

354
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,500
 He seemed like opening up the blinds.

355
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,460
 He's like, "Oh, he's walking outside."

356
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,100
 He throws the garbage in, runs back inside

357
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,980
 because one of the ghost sightings

358
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,180
 was a man of Japanese descent was mowing his lawn.

359
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,580
 Beautiful sunny day.

360
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,700
 He's mowing his lawn.

361
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
 There's a tree on his property

362
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,500
 and he's mowing his lawn and he looks up.

363
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,300
 There's a Japanese guy just sitting in his tree,

364
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,020
 staring at him as he's mowing his lawn

365
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,460
 in the middle of the day.

366
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,100
 And then apparently the Japanese man went

367
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,940
 (blows air)

368
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,540
 and turned into ectoplasm and dripped out of the tree.

369
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,980
 And it totally freaked the guy out.

370
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,020
 As it would anybody.

371
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,220
 Zach Baggins would have a heart attack if he saw that.

372
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,100
 Anyone who has anything,

373
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,060
 I don't care what your experience is with ghosts.

374
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,180
 If you were doing something mundane,

375
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,900
 looked up and you saw a ghost sitting in a tree,

376
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,740
 the reason why that's so scary, 'cause that's so unnatural.

377
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,260
 Like a ghost standing behind you

378
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,900
 while you're like taking a shower.

379
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,580
 It's creepy, but it's a place where humans reside.

380
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,420
 Or if you're getting in bed, like, okay,

381
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,260
 let's put it this way.

382
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,100
 If you're getting into bed

383
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,380
 and you see a person standing at the foot of your bed,

384
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,420
 that's creepy.

385
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,740
 That's undeniably creepy,

386
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,900
 but it's not as creepy as you getting into bed

387
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,060
 and as you're getting ready to shut your light off,

388
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,780
 you see that small gap underneath your bookshelf.

389
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,500
 So you have a bookshelf and it ends,

390
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,460
 and then there's maybe a four inch gap before

391
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,180
 you see the floor.

392
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,340
 And you see human eyes staring at you from there.

393
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,020
 One is a nap, both are creepy,

394
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,620
 but one is a natural thing.

395
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,720
 People stand at the foot of beds.

396
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,820
 People can't fit in four inch gaps.

397
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,340
 So one is a human,

398
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,780
 one is you're like, oh my God, that's so scary.

399
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,460
 There's a man at the foot of my bed.

400
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,980
 Sorry for the listeners who are listening to this in bed.

401
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,700
 But there's another thing is right before that light,

402
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,440
 you flick that switch and as the light bulb is going black,

403
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,900
 you see human eyes staring at you

404
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,500
 from a place where a human being could never fit.

405
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,660
 So this guy's mode is long,

406
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,620
 Japanese dude in the tree explodes into ectoplasm.

407
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,280
 There was one where this family was living in this house,

408
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,440
 going about their normal business.

409
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,720
 One day, one of them,

410
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,640
 well let's just say the mom for whatever reason,

411
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,280
 one of them, I don't know which one.

412
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,640
 I don't think the whole family saw it.

413
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,320
 I don't think they were moving as a snake

414
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,080
 through the house.

415
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,240
 Family living in a house,

416
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,720
 one of the people in the house looks

417
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,600
 and they see a Japanese manager

418
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,400
 sitting on the end of a bed in the bedroom.

419
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,720
 She's kind of staring off into nowhere.

420
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
 They boarded the room up.

421
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,560
 They just said, we're not going in there.

422
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,500
 Now hopefully they had enough rooms.

423
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,660
 Hopefully that didn't require like the kids to share a room

424
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,900
 'cause then they would just get really mad

425
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,460
 and they'd be like, oh, I hate ghosts.

426
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,860
 They make me share a room with Timmy

427
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,220
 and I hate Timmy, he stinks and he pees his bed.

428
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,700
 Like hopefully they had a spare bedroom

429
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,560
 but they boarded that one up.

430
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,020
 Now there was other sightings of ghosts

431
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,700
 in these houses around the area.

432
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,660
 But one of the things, one, they wanted privacy.

433
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,020
 They didn't want people coming around.

434
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,100
 Two though.

435
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,900
 Japanese culture, this might be stereotypical,

436
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,120
 but Japanese culture tends to be more into ancestor worship.

437
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,160
 So they're not going to get a priest

438
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,040
 to make the ghost go away.

439
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,220
 They're not going to antagonize it

440
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,000
 or set up tape recorders or bring,

441
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,160
 and again, that's a stereotype.

442
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,440
 Of course, there are Japanese people who do those things

443
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,480
 but in general, and this is what I was getting

444
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
 from the author too, he goes,

445
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,480
 that's not the way that culture deals with ghosts.

446
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,600
 They're not going to bring spirit boxes

447
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,260
 and antagonize them in any sort of way.

448
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,600
 They're there for a reason.

449
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,940
 Just stay out of their way.

450
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,100
 Don't mow your lawn, the guy's lawn is all gross.

451
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,260
 He's like, hey man, my ancestors told me

452
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,660
 not to do any chores, he's not taking out the garbage.

453
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,860
 Oh no, my ancestor told me not to do that.

454
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,060
 His wife's super mad.

455
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,980
 So what's interesting about this?

456
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,100
 So let's go into this thing of how this exemplifies

457
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,860
 a certain type of ghost.

458
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,860
 As far as I could tell,

459
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,860
 there weren't deaths at that holding station.

460
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,120
 So you didn't, it wasn't a death camp.

461
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,920
 It was a camp that people went to

462
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,240
 and then they moved on to the next camp.

463
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,280
 So why are there so many ghosts floating around there?

464
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,080
 And it's not just the two, there's other stories.

465
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,320
 I'm just picking out the two of them,

466
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,980
 but why are there ghosts floating around this neighborhood

467
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,440
 if people didn't actually die?

468
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,340
 One of my theories of what a ghost is,

469
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,080
 is that you don't even have to be dead to be a ghost.

470
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,040
 You could be so tormented with emotional anguish

471
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,060
 or psychic pain that you can leave that residue

472
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,260
 and then go on with your life.

473
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,400
 I talked about it before, I can come into your house

474
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,020
 and I can tell you how good your relationship is

475
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,660
 with your significant other.

476
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,300
 Like I'm not a psychic by any means,

477
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,180
 but you invite me over to your house,

478
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,900
 I'll let you know how your relationship is

479
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,820
 because I can just pick up on the quote unquote vibe,

480
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,000
 the energy of the house.

481
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,700
 I think it's something everyone can do.

482
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,920
 I think it's something that people can train themselves to do.

483
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,860
 I don't think I have any sort of magical power.

484
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,820
 I just think that I am intuitive.

485
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,840
 And I think what happens is when you're fighting

486
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,380
 with somebody that you love or used to love,

487
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,360
 it charges things around your house.

488
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,940
 I feel like an idiot talking about it.

489
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,720
 I feel like I'm medium, that show where I'm like picking up

490
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,660
 a fruit and going, oh, your wife's cheating on you.

491
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,400
 It's not like that, cheating on you with the banana,

492
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,500
 but it's not like that.

493
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,340
 There's just, you can tell, and I think that people can go

494
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,240
 through so much psychological anguish

495
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,440
 that they can leave a ghost and still be alive.

496
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,520
 The guy in the tree, I don't think he was climbing trees

497
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,200
 and then he got picked up and sent to the internment camp

498
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,120
 and he's like, I'll never climb a tree again.

499
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,480
 I think that whatever, these guys were rightfully going

500
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,800
 through emotional anguish because they lived in a country

501
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,400
 that was now rounding them up and shipping them out

502
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,080
 because of their ethnicity.

503
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,360
 You're gonna be pretty psychically angry.

504
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,320
 You're gonna be very emotionally distraught

505
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,060
 and you don't know how this story's going to end.

506
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,420
 For all you know, that last stop is your last stop.

507
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,020
 You don't know.

508
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,380
 So I think that the ghosts in this area

509
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,460
 aren't the ghosts of dead people.

510
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,580
 They're not the ancestors.

511
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,100
 You're actually just people who were so tormented

512
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,000
 that they psychically broke and left a piece

513
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,280
 of themselves there.

514
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,620
 I think it's interesting that they're only seen

515
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,020
 by people of their same ethnicity.

516
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,160
 It could just be that those are the people

517
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,100
 they wanted to be seen by.

518
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,240
 Like their psychic version of themselves felt betrayed

519
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,780
 by every other ethnic group in America at that point

520
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,440
 and where they're getting rounded up and put on these trucks

521
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,020
 and they're watching all their other neighbors,

522
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,860
 black neighbors, white neighbors not do anything.

523
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,560
 Never trust someone of another ethnicity after that.

524
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,560
 Even their tortured psychic self can't get over that betrayal.

525
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,340
 Let's end on this note.

526
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,360
 Let's end on this note here.

527
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,260
 Get your hankies ready 'cause this story

528
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,980
 actually kind of got to me.

529
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,040
 Kind of got to me.

530
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,060
 Maybe you're a little more hardcore than I am,

531
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,900
 but I don't know.

532
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,540
 Even when I was researching it 'cause I have to read

533
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,100
 a bunch of different versions of stuff

534
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,300
 to kind of get to the truth.

535
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,860
 Kind of got to me.

536
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,980
 We're going back to the mid to late 1800s.

537
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,380
 So Jason Jalopy, we go so fast we go back in time.

538
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,780
 88 miles an hour I think.

539
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,420
 Jason Jalopy can't even go that fast.

540
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,660
 It's like 25 tops.

541
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,900
 We go back in time.

542
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,640
 We are still in Sacramento though.

543
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,460
 We're now in old timey Sacramento.

544
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,180
 And there's a mansion there.

545
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,580
 And this mansion is populated by a little family.

546
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,240
 You have Leland Sr.

547
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,820
 So Leland Sr., people of the time

548
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,620
 considered him a robber baron,

549
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,700
 which is someone who basically used very unscrupulous methods

550
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,860
 to get money, to basically whatever it took to get rich,

551
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,980
 he would do.

552
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,260
 Leland had his toes and everything.

553
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,940
 He was a politician.

554
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,060
 He was a railroad tycoon.

555
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,580
 He was basically a real life monopoly game board.

556
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,220
 Just got to own it all.

557
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,800
 And his wife Jane, they lived together

558
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,700
 and they tried for 18 years to have a child.

559
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,620
 They had everything they could ever want,

560
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,540
 but they could not have a child.

561
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,500
 At the age of 39, so Leland's 44, she's 39.

562
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,700
 Very, very old.

563
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,020
 That's around my age.

564
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,340
 But it's quite old to have a child.

565
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,900
 Jane becomes pregnant and gives birth to Leland Jr.

566
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,300
 So now they're like, our life is perfect now.

567
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,320
 Jane said the first time she ever saw her husband pray

568
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,220
 was after his son was delivered.

569
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,420
 Because he was so overcome with joy

570
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,660
 that he got down on his knees and bowed before God.

571
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,460
 Before that, it's all about him, material wealth.

572
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,700
 But once his son was born, first time she ever saw him pray

573
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,180
 was then humbled himself, prayed for all the great fortune

574
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,060
 that he had been bestowed upon him.

575
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,740
 He had a son now.

576
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,780
 And Leland Jr. was the perfect son.

577
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,500
 He was the type of son that not only would you want to have,

578
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,260
 but he was the type of dude you would wanna hang out with.

579
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,260
 A true bro.

580
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,600
 Super wealthy, good looking kid, came from it all,

581
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,940
 couldn't stand to see anyone or anything suffer.

582
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,680
 Dude with the backward cap, baggy pants,

583
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,180
 looks like he's gonna beat you up,

584
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,180
 but he puts a hand out and says,

585
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,700
 "Hey man, you need help?

586
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,340
 "Hey, let's go hang out."

587
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,820
 He's that guy.

588
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,700
 Leland Jr. is that guy.

589
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,660
 Sitting in his mansion, one day he looks out the window

590
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,940
 and sees a mongrel, a little mixed breed dog

591
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,020
 walking down the street.

592
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,440
 Legs all bashed up, matted fur,

593
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,940
 runs out of his mansion, picks the puppy up,

594
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,660
 calls up family personal doctor.

595
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,020
 Again, one of the wealthiest families in America

596
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,900
 brings his personal doctor in and says,

597
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,780
 "Fix this dog, please.

598
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,640
 "How can we help this dog?"

599
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,340
 He saw a little poor boy once, covered in mud, all dirty.

600
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,820
 Leland brings him inside and washes him,

601
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,780
 scrubs his boots down.

602
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,820
 And you're thinking, "Why didn't he just give him

603
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,660
 "a million dollars?"

604
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,260
 Well, he's a kid.

605
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,580
 And that's how a kid sees about fixing a problem.

606
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,940
 And the maids and the wait staff were totally freaking out

607
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,180
 that you have this little boy here scrubbing this little,

608
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,820
 poor boy's shoes off, cleaning them up.

609
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,300
 He just liked helping people.

610
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
 One of the things his dad though saw,

611
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,160
 his dad loved his son, but he knew that he was being raised

612
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,800
 in this incredibly rich environment.

613
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,440
 He wanted his son to be rugged as well,

614
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,840
 because Leland Sr. had grown up in the country.

615
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,520
 So he bought 650 acre plot of land in Palo Alto, California.

616
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,560
 That was all like orchards and vineyards and stables

617
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,520
 and grazing land and all this stuff.

618
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,600
 He would take his son there and just say,

619
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,720
 "Do man stuff.

620
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,200
 "Go out and be a man."

621
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,760
 And Leland Jr. loved this activity.

622
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,460
 He'd grab a gun, he'd go out hunting,

623
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,660
 he'd ride horses and he'd have a little like dogs

624
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,180
 next to him, he'd hunt all these animals.

625
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,740
 He loved being in the wilderness.

626
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,060
 It was something alien to him

627
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,020
 and he immediately grabbed onto it.

628
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,180
 It was his favorite place in the world.

629
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,100
 And he had a blessed childhood.

630
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,300
 And at age 15, he was getting ready to go off

631
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,940
 into the East Coast to go to college.

632
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,220
 That's bizarre to me that he's going to college at 15.

633
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,220
 Maybe it was different back in the 1800s, but.

634
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,180
 And before he left though, his parents said,

635
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,860
 Leland Sr. and Jane said,

636
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,960
 "Let's go on a trip to Europe.

637
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
 "We're going to travel all over Europe.

638
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
 "It'll be our last big hurrah.

639
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,840
 "Then you're going to go off to college.

640
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,360
 "We're not going to see you for a while."

641
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,040
 So they go to Europe and it is a journey out of a fairy tale.

642
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,200
 They're meeting with the Sultan of Turkey.

643
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,080
 They're going to the Rome, they're going to England.

644
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,920
 They're going to all these places.

645
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,400
 But both of his parents at this point,

646
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,120
 the dad I think is like 60 and the mom is 54.

647
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,000
 So they're both elderly.

648
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,480
 Which back then would,

649
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,980
 we didn't have all the medical advances we have.

650
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,160
 At 1654, you're dealing with a lot of stuff.

651
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,540
 At one point, the mom was too sick to leave,

652
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,860
 to actually go out and visit anything.

653
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,740
 So Leland Jr. would walk along the city

654
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,780
 and take notes about all the beautiful things he'd see.

655
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,220
 And then he'd come back,

656
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,300
 sit next to his mother and tell her about his visits.

657
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,260
 Tell her about all the amazing things out there.

658
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,140
 But eventually his parents did start to feel better

659
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,260
 during the trip, traveling all around.

660
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,740
 But Jane one day realizes that Leland,

661
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,000
 the story's all true by the way.

662
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,080
 She says she should have said that in the beginning.

663
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,920
 The mother sees that Leland looks a little pale

664
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,380
 and it kind of worries her,

665
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,600
 but he's like, no, don't worry about it mom,

666
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,520
 don't worry about it.

667
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,200
 And she should have worried about it

668
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,720
 because what happened was he had contracted typhoid,

669
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,560
 typhoid fever and he falls incredibly ill.

670
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,960
 Super high temperature, super gross.

671
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,720
 He's all sweaty all the time.

672
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,040
 Dad is getting the best doctors in Europe

673
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,560
 to come out here to see a son.

674
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,820
 And his son is just not getting any better.

675
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,220
 At one point they're staying at this huge hotel

676
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,220
 and the hotel manager had hay brought to the area

677
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,940
 and put down on the sidewalk on the streets outside

678
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,180
 so the boy could rest.

679
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,620
 So he didn't have to hear the outside noises.

680
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,220
 Because everybody loved this boy.

681
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,140
 He was not a spoiled brat.

682
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,420
 I know you could go, well, no one takes care of,

683
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,060
 no one puts hay on the ground when I'm sick.

684
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,780
 I gotta hear people driving out of the street

685
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,660
 playing la cucaracha.

686
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,180
 And I'm not saying people don't love you either.

687
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,120
 I don't want him to come off as a spoiled brat.

688
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,880
 I'm just saying that people were bending over backwards

689
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,000
 to save this kid because they knew

690
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,580
 that this little boy was special.

691
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,420
 He was different.

692
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,300
 Someone who came from wealth and everything

693
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,460
 and was just humble and nice.

694
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,340
 One of the treatments was they had to put

695
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,500
 ice cold wraps on him to keep his temperature down

696
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,340
 and he hated it.

697
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,640
 He begged them not to do it, but they had to.

698
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,300
 And he would have to feel like his hot skin

699
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,120
 and then these ice cold rags put on his skin.

700
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,540
 It was a very, very miserable time.

701
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,380
 But they were doing anything they could

702
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,580
 to save Leland Jr.

703
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,580
 And in the end, couple days before he turned 16,

704
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,020
 Leland Jr. passed away.

705
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,100
 His father builds a mausoleum for him

706
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,820
 and puts it in Palo Alto,

707
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,160
 puts it in Leland Jr.'s favorite spot,

708
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,460
 goes back to Sacramento.

709
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,060
 One night Leland Sr. is sleeping in bed

710
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,620
 and his son appears to him in a dream.

711
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,680
 And Leland Jr. tells his father,

712
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,100
 "You've amassed a lot of wealth and a lot of power

713
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,200
 and you've done a lot of things to get both.

714
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,640
 But I want you to do something else now.

715
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,240
 I want you to dedicate your entire life to education.

716
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,880
 I want you to start a university

717
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,920
 and I want you to use your fortune

718
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,080
 to help children learn."

719
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,500
 Leland Sr. wakes up from this dream,

720
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,600
 this visitation from his son who had passed away.

721
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,700
 And he takes that visit to heart.

722
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,940
 He goes out to the East Coast

723
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,320
 and looks at all their schools,

724
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,240
 meets all these officials, sees how things are done.

725
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,980
 And then he travels back to Palo Alto,

726
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,240
 starts making arrangements to have a university created.

727
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,860
 And as he's filling out all the paperwork

728
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,060
 to break ground on this beautiful rugged land

729
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,420
 is now going to hold a major university.

730
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,060
 One of the businessmen goes, "Hey, Leland Sr.

731
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,240
 Never got your last name."

732
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,660
 Leland's right now and he goes, "Stanford,

733
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,600
 Leland Stanford."

734
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,820
 Finish was writing his name, hands it to the guy.

735
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,020
 Stanford University was founded there.

736
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:31,020
 And to this day, the Stanford mausoleum is still on campus.

737
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,140
 Nowadays it holds not just Leland Jr.'s body,

738
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,220
 but the body of his mother and father

739
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,520
 who loved him so much in life

740
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,980
 that they were gonna spend death with him as well.

741
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,040
 I actually looked a lot into whether or not

742
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,540
 that story was true.

743
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,260
 Everything's true, but did a ghost visit Leland Sr.

744
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,020
 and tell him to build a university?

745
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,740
 I looked at official accounts,

746
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,260
 I looked at a bunch of ghost sites

747
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,900
 and they all pretty much agree that

748
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,900
 as far as anybody knows, yes, a ghost did visit.

749
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,860
 I think the skeptics say he just had a dream

750
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,220
 that his son told him to do this.

751
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,380
 And then the haunted websites say,

752
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,820
 "No, no, no, it was a ghost."

753
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,220
 No website is saying that story's not true at all.

754
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,060
 It was a fable made up.

755
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,540
 As far as I could tell, as far as I could tell,

756
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,100
 'cause I was looking at like Stanford University's website

757
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,820
 and they weren't saying, "No, it wasn't true,

758
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,660
 "it wasn't true."

759
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,940
 They just had like a biography of Leland Jr. stuff like that.

760
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,300
 And they always go, "Some people say that Leland Sr.

761
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,540
 "was visited by the ghost,

762
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,180
 "but no one's out and out denying it."

763
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,380
 But that kind of brings us back

764
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,460
 to our wrap up of ghost stories.

765
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,020
 The first story was a stranger saying,

766
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,140
 "I have unfinished business here.

767
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,980
 "Please dig up these coins so I can move on."

768
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,960
 The second one was people who weren't actually dead

769
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,780
 but leaving some sort of psychic residue there.

770
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,020
 But the third story is a very common one.

771
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,860
 It's people who are still alive being visited

772
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,100
 by people who have passed away in their dreams or at night.

773
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,540
 Very, very common phenomenon.

774
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,500
 Coming, someone coming back from beyond saying,

775
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,380
 "You know, I'm in a happy place.

776
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,340
 "You can move on," things like that.

777
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,820
 This last one though has the particular note,

778
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,900
 the little particular thing,

779
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900
 other than just the nightly visitation,

780
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,660
 is that the ghost actually changed the person's life.

781
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,060
 It's the type of ghost that doesn't necessarily

782
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,460
 have unfinished business of their own,

783
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,740
 but when they pass through the mortal coil,

784
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,260
 when they go into this other realm,

785
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,540
 they see that if you let your loved one move

786
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,260
 in the direction they're moving in,

787
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,920
 things will not work out well.

788
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,020
 They're not coming back

789
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,140
 to correct unfinished business of theirs.

790
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,180
 They're coming back to help you become the person

791
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,260
 they know you can be.

792
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,540
 Did Leland Jr. see when he died,

793
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,980
 did he see a future of Leland Sr.

794
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,940
 just falling into ill health,

795
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,840
 never getting over the loss of his son,

796
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,800
 becoming a cruel businessman,

797
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,140
 becoming a cruel person,

798
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,380
 because if the world and God could steal

799
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,660
 a young boy from Leland Sr.,

800
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,620
 why should he give anyone any quarter?

801
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,500
 If the world can be so cruel to him,

802
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,820
 why shouldn't he be so cruel to the world?

803
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,780
 And Leland Jr. sees this and says,

804
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,060
 "That's not the father that I know.

805
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,900
 "I want one more chance to talk to my father."

806
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,180
 And he comes back and says,

807
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,980
 "I want you to forget all of that power

808
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,060
 "and all of that money.

809
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,440
 "I want you to dedicate your life to education

810
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,900
 "and lifting people up."

811
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,660
 I think the interesting thing,

812
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,380
 I remember once I had a friend

813
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,580
 who had lost somebody very, very close to them.

814
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,220
 And I said, "You know, time doesn't exist

815
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,740
 "on the other side.

816
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,540
 "We may have to wait 40 years to see them again,

817
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,700
 "but to them, you're already there.

818
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,500
 "You are already next to them.

819
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,220
 "They don't miss you at all.

820
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,540
 "Time doesn't exist after you're dead."

821
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,120
 I don't have any proof of that, obviously, I'm not dead,

822
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,120
 but I think things like time exist here in a mortal world.

823
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:02,040
 And when you're dead, there'd be no measurement of time.

824
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,000
 Everything just simply happens.

825
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,520
 So it would be possible that a young boy dies

826
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,640
 and experiences immediately the next 20 years

827
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,920
 of his father's life and goes,

828
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,440
 "I can change that because that's not the man

829
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,740
 "I know and love."

830
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,820
 Ghost stories intrigue humans like no other kind of story.

831
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,860
 I'd argue that ghost stories are some of the oldest stories

832
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,060
 in human history.

833
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,260
 What happens to us after we die

834
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,140
 is a very, very popular question.

835
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,980
 Ghost stories have lasted longer than UFO stories

836
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,620
 and they will last long after.

837
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,260
 Once aliens come down and we know that they're out there

838
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,420
 and we're having trading partners with the

839
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,760
 the globuli globs on Planet X,

840
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,200
 people will still tell ghost stories

841
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,080
 because there's just something about them

842
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,600
 that sends chills up our spine, even the good ones.

843
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,920
 Even the story of Leland Jr. talking to his father,

844
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,920
 there's still something intrinsically creepy about that

845
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,200
 because you have a man who's being told

846
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,200
 by a dead son what to do.

847
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
 And you go, Jason, that's not creepy, that's uplifting.

848
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,900
 Well, let's end it with this.

849
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,600
 What would have happened if he had said no?

850
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,820
 Like Roland in the first story.

851
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,780
 What would have happened if Leland Sr. had woken up

852
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,740
 and said no, the world has been cruel

853
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,580
 and it has robbed you from me?

854
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,660
 I don't want to dedicate my life to education.

855
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,660
 I am going to do whatever I can to punish God for ruining me.

856
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,220
 In the first story, the ghost just had glowing red eyes

857
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,060
 and chased the family out.

858
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,620
 What would have happened with Leland Sr.?

859
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,620
 What would have happened if he had said no

860
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,620
 in that circumstance?

861
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,340
 How would that story have ended?

862
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,900
 We have a university now,

863
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,140
 but the story could have just ended with the ghost

864
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,300
 of Leland Jr. realizing that his father was becoming

865
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,540
 a monster and one cold morning, Leland Sr.,

866
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,240
 stumbles down the stairs, dies.

867
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,820
 People just chalk it up to old age, clumsiness.

868
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,140
 But it could have been something else.

869
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,340
 Leland Jr. gave him the choice to change his life.

870
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,840
 Leland Sr. wouldn't do it.

871
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,980
 And so more drastic measures were taken

872
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,680
 than just red fiery eyes in the dark news.
