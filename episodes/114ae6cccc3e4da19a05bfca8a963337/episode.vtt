 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.320
 - Today, we take a look at three different hauntings.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 Each one exploring their own theory

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.840
 of what ghosts actually are.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.000
 And all three take place in my hometown

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.720
 of Sacramento, California.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.200
 We're going back to Cali today on Dead Ravva Radio.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.780
 (upbeat music)

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.760
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.840
 of Dead Ravva Radio.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.560
 I really, really do.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.760
 Let's go ahead and get started here

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.520
 'cause we got three stories to cover.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.240
 That'll take place in Sacramento, California,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.160
 the town I'm from and the town that I just left.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.000
 I was on vacation there for three weeks.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.300
 These ones I picked because they're actual,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.120
 not only are they all located

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.960
 in the same geographical area,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 but they all are different as far as

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.200
 what people think ghosts are or what ghosts might be.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.760
 So for our first story,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.000
 let's hop into Jason Jalopy

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.920
 'cause we're just gonna be driving around Sacramento.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.040
 Sunny, sunny Sacramento, the city that never sleeps.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.520
 And we're in the Jason Jalopy.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.600
 (indistinct)

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.680
 It's like a, how did I describe it before?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.040
 Oh, a chitty, chitty, bang, bang car.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.440
 Just imagine that just slowly going through the street

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.720
 on metal wheels, totally tearing up the pavement,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.640
 but we don't care 'cause we're just there for a little bit

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.040
 and then we're gonna go our separate ways.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.960
 We are on J Street in Sacramento.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.560
 So Sacramento is one of those cities

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.080
 that isn't very imaginative.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.000
 All their streets are pretty much just numbers and letters.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.300
 And so we're on J Street.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.880
 So that's about in the middle of town.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.640
 It's incredibly unimaginative.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.040
 So if it's in the middle of the alphabet,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.520
 it's in the middle of town.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.200
 I think X Street is right on the outskirts.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.780
 I don't know if there's a Z Street, but there should be.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.840
 Now this story takes place before the 1950s.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.700
 You're like, that's quite vague.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.440
 And again, we've talked about this before.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.000
 The less details we have,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.300
 generally the more skeptical things can be.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.080
 Or the more skeptical we should be of things,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.180
 but this is takes place before the 1950s.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.720
 So it could have been in the year 16 AD,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.500
 could have been 1949.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.300
 It actually took place in the general decade

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.700
 of the '40s and the '50s.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.660
 We're not going back to native time.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.020
 So where was it going?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.220
 Oh yeah, so pre-1950s, a family moves into a house.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.860
 You have Roland Johnson, big fan of limp biscuit.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.120
 It's Roland Johnson, not Roland Johnson,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.540
 but his wife and he has a four-year-old daughter.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.940
 They all live in this beautiful Victorian apartment building.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.780
 It kind of kept throwing me off,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.500
 but they live in a beautiful Victorian apartment building.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.900
 Maybe it was Victorian house turned into

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.740
 a new apartment building.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.140
 I don't think Victorians had apartment buildings.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.580
 But anyways, okay, let's forget the details

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.060
 that don't make sense,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.260
 'cause I wanna get to the meat of the story.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.060
 Take off our skepticism hat.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.660
 Let's explore this story.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.340
 So there's this little girl walking around the house.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.220
 And the little, the four-year-old girl keeps talking

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.740
 about this dude named Sam.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.700
 She'd be like, "Mommy, daddy, I met this guy named Sam

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.540
 and he's so nice.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.420
 He's like super tall and he has a beard."

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.780
 And the parents are like,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.540
 "Is there someone creeping around her house

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.860
 talking to our little girl?"

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.540
 She's like, "No, he's totally fine.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.500
 Like we just hang out."

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.980
 And he wants me to go into the basement.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.740
 Roland is like, "It's not a good idea.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.780
 He has his hat on backwards, big baggy pants."

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.940
 He's like, "That's not a good idea, little lady.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.500
 Don't go into the basement with anybody,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.180
 except your mom or your dad,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.700
 and be kind of suspicious of your mom,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.300
 'cause I think she's making meth down there.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.260
 But definitely don't go into the basement

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.620
 with a dude you don't know, even if you know his name.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.080
 He's still, don't do that.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.020
 But she's so convincing over the course of time.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.580
 She's constantly bringing up Sam in the basement.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.500
 The dad's like, "You know what?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.060
 I'm gonna go see what's going on in the basement."

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.220
 Which actually you should probably do right away.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.500
 If your daughter tells you there's a man in the basement

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.820
 trying to get you to go down there,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.980
 you shouldn't just blow it off,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.060
 being like, "Ah, there's no monsters under your bed,

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.140
 'cause there might actually be a man named Sam

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.980
 in your basement."

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.740
 But anyways, so him and his wife and his four-year-old girl

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.420
 decide to go, the dad says, "I'm gonna go into the basement."

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.340
 And the wife and the daughter pretty much tag along.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.300
 So they walk down the spooky, spooky steps

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.140
 into the basement.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.780
 (imitates growling)

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.460
 This is the 1950s, so the light bulb

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.220
 hadn't been invented yet, no phones, nothing.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.060
 They're walking through with candles,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.380
 and they have a pitchfork.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.220
 Getting ready to pitchfork somebody.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.580
 They get down to the bottom, they get into the basement,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.080
 and they realize that they're not alone.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.060
 Maybe our daughter was onto something.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.980
 Maybe our daughter isn't as stupid as we thought she was.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.860
 Because he sees a shovel laying on the ground, right?

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.660
 Roland looks down and he sees this shovel

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.900
 sitting on the ground, and he picks it up,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.100
 and then they all see a man standing in front of them.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.180
 This is how they describe him.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.040
 He's a tall man, dressed in all black,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.980
 with a long white beard.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.980
 Normal human face, they don't have to go into,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.580
 you know, like his fingers were extra wrinkly.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.020
 Just like a normal human, just a little taller,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.500
 dressed in black with a long white beard.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.860
 And they're looking at him, and he points to a spot

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.300
 in the ground.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.340
 And the dad is just standing there with his shovel.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.220
 He's not swinging it at this dude.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.500
 He's just standing there with his shovel.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.660
 And the dad decides not to dig.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.340
 He's like, "Nah, I'm not gonna do that."

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.260
 Now, it's kinda weird to pick up a digging instrument,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.820
 and then someone say, "Hey, can you dig here?"

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.740
 And be like, "Nah, I'm just gonna stand here

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.380
 with the only thing in the basement

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.020
 that can be used to dig and not dig."

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.620
 But Roland decides not to dig.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.320
 And at that point, the tall man, the tall spooky man,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.820
 his eyes turn, quote, "Fiery red."

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.900
 So I don't know if flames are shooting out of his eyes,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.020
 or they were glowing red like Goosebumps television show

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.220
 or something like that.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.140
 Or just that his eyes looked mean,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.420
 but they were glowing a fiery red.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.420
 Family takes off.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.540
 (panting)

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.420
 He's pushing his daughter and his wife out of the way.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.660
 He's like, "Mid first!"

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.100
 Pushing him out of the way, he runs up the stairs.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.860
 He's destroying the stairs, so Sam can't chase him.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.540
 Daughter and mom are down there, help us.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.100
 Now anyways, they all go upstairs.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.480
 They actually end up boarding up the basement at that point.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.480
 They don't ever wanna go down there.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.440
 I hope they don't ever have any trouble with their boiler,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.640
 but they board up their basement,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.840
 never go back down there.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.840
 Roland ends up leaving, moving with the family.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.720
 He doesn't leave them there.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.560
 They all move.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.680
 He becomes chief of police in Taha Chappy,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.280
 which is a city in California.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.520
 Now I tried to verify as much as I could with this story,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.160
 because obviously it just sounds ridiculous.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.500
 But I couldn't find that there was actually a chief of police

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.580
 of that name in that city.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.220
 But again, we're talking pre-1950s,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.020
 so it's not like they were keeping internet records

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.060
 and stuff like that.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.420
 I will take off our skeptic hats

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.540
 and assume this is true just for the next part of it.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.660
 In 1954, this is why we know the story

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.020
 took place before the 1950s,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.980
 'cause in 1954 they decided to tear down the building

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.300
 and they were gonna build a new building in its place.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.020
 And while they're laying a new foundation,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.940
 some workers find a small bag,

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.000
 a little baggy, full of gold coins.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.320
 Forest Fin's Treasure, you ask?

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.300
 No, no, it wasn't, because that doesn't exist.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.720
 But, assuming this story is true,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.080
 this story kinda highlights one of the things

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.600
 people think ghosts are.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.260
 And those are people who died with unfinished business.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.520
 That's probably the most popular version of a ghost.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.880
 There's, well, two most popular versions of ghosts.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.140
 One, people who died in horrible circumstances,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.060
 whose spirit is left to torment the living

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.460
 or just kinda float around with no head

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.300
 and stuff like that.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.340
 That's one of the most common

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.080
 and the second most common would be

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.340
 people who died with unfinished business.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.220
 They're still here because there's things

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.000
 they weren't able to complete while they were alive.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.700
 And this ghost kind of is the perfect example of that.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.660
 This ghost, this man, Sam, whoever he was,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.940
 had left a treasure there

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.920
 and was never able to retrieve it as a living person,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.620
 but when he died, he still wanted that treasure retrieved.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.140
 Very, very common type of ghost,

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.420
 but not the only kind of ghost.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.980
 Let's go ahead, we're gonna hop back

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.420
 in the Jason Jalopy, (imitates popping)

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.020
 and we're going to Antelope.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.820
 Antelope is where I actually hung out a lot in Sacramento.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.620
 Now, Sacramento, if you don't know it,

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.620
 I'm sure a lot of other cities are like this,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.500
 but Sacramento is basically a giant city in the middle

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.620
 and then suburbs pushing out in every single direction.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.880
 So you would leave Sacramento,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.920
 you would drive through North Highlands,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.760
 you drive through all the stuff.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.360
 Eventually you have to drive through all these suburbs,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.200
 you get to Antelope.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.160
 Now, Antelope is actually on the verge of farmland.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.920
 It's basically almost the farthest you can get

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.240
 from the city center.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.840
 And I spent a lot of time there, hung out,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.960
 that's where all my friends were,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.840
 I used to hang out at Godfather's Pizza.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.520
 Couple of the ghost stories that I've told

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.800
 took place or start in Antelope.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.160
 It's a nice little area,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.760
 but not for these people we're about to talk about.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.240
 So where Antelope and Roseville Road meet,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.180
 it's the border of Antelope and Citrus Heights,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.420
 which is another place I spent most of my time.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.820
 There is a bunch of, you can look at satellite pictures

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.500
 of that, there's a bunch of houses,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.940
 this fully developed area,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.540
 and this large plot of land in the middle of all of it,

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.260
 worth millions of dollars

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.740
 because the area is so congested with homes

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.100
 that's completely undeveloped,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.460
 as far as I can tell by satellite maps to this day.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.580
 Definitely undeveloped when I was there a couple of years ago.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.780
 And what it was, there's a reason why it's undeveloped.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.720
 One, the government owns it, and two, the history behind it.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.380
 This area that is now surrounded by happy, happy families

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.200
 living in their happy, happy homes was known as Camp Kohler.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.160
 Camp Kohler was a, I'm trying to think of the right word,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.840
 basically a holding area for Japanese Americans

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.960
 who were being sent to internment camps

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.160
 during World War II.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.840
 It wasn't an internment camp itself,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.760
 but it was one of the way stations.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.760
 As they were bringing them up through the West Coast,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.100
 they would stop off there,

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.600
 and then they would be sent off to other,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.760
 I think the internment camp was up in Eureka

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.940
 or something like that, it was farther off,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.280
 but it was a way station for people who were being

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.720
 basically arrested because of their ethnicity,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.900
 because people were afraid that they'd be spiser

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.060
 in World War II.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.060
 And you had up to 4,600 Japanese Americans held there,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.560
 and then they'd be shipped off to somewhere else.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.500
 So nobody wants to live there.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.700
 Nobody wants to buy a home that used to be

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.740
 a Japanese internment camp.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.540
 I don't think it's like a memorial park

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.380
 or anything like that.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.900
 I think it's just undeveloped land.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.400
 There's a couple buildings, that's it.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.200
 They don't really draw attention to it,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.580
 but the government doesn't really want to sell it.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.500
 They may have plans for the future as grim as that may be,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.420
 but this was a place where this was part of the process

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.060
 of moving people into the internment camps.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.140
 So when that was being done,

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.740
 there were no houses surrounding it.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.540
 It was kind of off in the middle of nowhere.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.460
 Like I said, it's about as far from Sacramento

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.420
 as you can get in the North direction.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.260
 I think it's North.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.300
 I'm not really good with directions.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.140
 West maybe.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.980
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.500
 It's about the farthest, one of the farthest points

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.620
 you can get away from the city

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.500
 and still be in some sort of area.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.860
 Now, nowadays there's houses surrounding it.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.900
 I often talk about the book,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.580
 The National Directory of Haunted Places,

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.020
 and I recommend people buying that.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.380
 It's a great book.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.780
 Check it out on Amazon.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.580
 Anywhere you can get it, use bookstores have it.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.860
 It's a great, great resource.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.900
 I refer to it all the time.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.660
 And I've met the author.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.060
 Back when I was a journalism student,

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.780
 I interviewed him 'cause I was looking at doing

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.660
 a story on him and I've talked to him.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.540
 And we talked specifically about this case

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.620
 'cause he talks about this Japanese internment camp situation

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.700
 in his book, but he doesn't go into a lot of detail

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.780
 because the people he talked to said,

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.660
 "I don't want anyone to know about this.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.460
 "I'll talk to you."

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.060
 Someone vouched for you.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.180
 You talk to these other people

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.820
 and they said, "You're really cool and you keep secrets."

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.660
 So I'll talk to you,

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.740
 "I don't want my address given out.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.620
 "I don't want anyone coming around my house."

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.060
 'Cause the National Directory of Haunted Places,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.300
 one of the reasons why I recommend it,

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.860
 is there are addresses in it in contact phone numbers

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.300
 that you can go to these houses

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.300
 and check them out for yourself.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.980
 It's a great, great resource.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.860
 But he goes out there and he's doing this investigation.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.860
 And he hears this through the grapevine

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.020
 and he goes out to this area and interviews them.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.340
 The neighborhood is riddled with ghosts.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.820
 But there's two odd things about it.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.580
 One, only people of Japanese descent can see the ghosts.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.780
 So you could be a Hispanic dude living in your house

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.740
 and a whole bunch of ghosts just standing there

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.340
 looking at you as you're playing your Xbox One.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.900
 You never see them.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.540
 Some white dude mowing his lawn,

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.380
 running over a Japanese ghost,

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.420
 just taking a nap on your lawn.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.540
 You run him over, you would never know it.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.500
 But then you look over at your neighbor,

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.220
 who's Japanese and he's like,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.780
 "Doesn't he want to dig up the garbage?"

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.500
 He seemed like opening up the blinds.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.460
 He's like, "Oh, he's walking outside."

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.100
 He throws the garbage in, runs back inside

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.980
 because one of the ghost sightings

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.180
 was a man of Japanese descent was mowing his lawn.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.580
 Beautiful sunny day.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.700
 He's mowing his lawn.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.700
 There's a tree on his property

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.500
 and he's mowing his lawn and he looks up.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.300
 There's a Japanese guy just sitting in his tree,

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.020
 staring at him as he's mowing his lawn

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.460
 in the middle of the day.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.100
 And then apparently the Japanese man went

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:33.940
 (blows air)

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.540
 and turned into ectoplasm and dripped out of the tree.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.980
 And it totally freaked the guy out.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.020
 As it would anybody.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.220
 Zach Baggins would have a heart attack if he saw that.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.100
 Anyone who has anything,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.060
 I don't care what your experience is with ghosts.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.180
 If you were doing something mundane,

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.900
 looked up and you saw a ghost sitting in a tree,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.740
 the reason why that's so scary, 'cause that's so unnatural.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.260
 Like a ghost standing behind you

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.900
 while you're like taking a shower.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.580
 It's creepy, but it's a place where humans reside.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.420
 Or if you're getting in bed, like, okay,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.260
 let's put it this way.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.100
 If you're getting into bed

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.380
 and you see a person standing at the foot of your bed,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.420
 that's creepy.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.740
 That's undeniably creepy,

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.900
 but it's not as creepy as you getting into bed

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.060
 and as you're getting ready to shut your light off,

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:20.780
 you see that small gap underneath your bookshelf.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.500
 So you have a bookshelf and it ends,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.460
 and then there's maybe a four inch gap before

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.180
 you see the floor.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.340
 And you see human eyes staring at you from there.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.020
 One is a nap, both are creepy,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.620
 but one is a natural thing.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.720
 People stand at the foot of beds.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.820
 People can't fit in four inch gaps.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.340
 So one is a human,

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.780
 one is you're like, oh my God, that's so scary.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.460
 There's a man at the foot of my bed.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.980
 Sorry for the listeners who are listening to this in bed.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.700
 But there's another thing is right before that light,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.440
 you flick that switch and as the light bulb is going black,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.900
 you see human eyes staring at you

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.500
 from a place where a human being could never fit.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.660
 So this guy's mode is long,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.620
 Japanese dude in the tree explodes into ectoplasm.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.280
 There was one where this family was living in this house,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.440
 going about their normal business.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.720
 One day, one of them,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.640
 well let's just say the mom for whatever reason,

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.280
 one of them, I don't know which one.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.640
 I don't think the whole family saw it.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.320
 I don't think they were moving as a snake

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.080
 through the house.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.240
 Family living in a house,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.720
 one of the people in the house looks

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.600
 and they see a Japanese manager

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.400
 sitting on the end of a bed in the bedroom.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.720
 She's kind of staring off into nowhere.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.880
 They boarded the room up.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.560
 They just said, we're not going in there.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.500
 Now hopefully they had enough rooms.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.660
 Hopefully that didn't require like the kids to share a room

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.900
 'cause then they would just get really mad

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.460
 and they'd be like, oh, I hate ghosts.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.860
 They make me share a room with Timmy

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.220
 and I hate Timmy, he stinks and he pees his bed.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.700
 Like hopefully they had a spare bedroom

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.560
 but they boarded that one up.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.020
 Now there was other sightings of ghosts

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.700
 in these houses around the area.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.660
 But one of the things, one, they wanted privacy.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.020
 They didn't want people coming around.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.100
 Two though.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.900
 Japanese culture, this might be stereotypical,

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:05.120
 but Japanese culture tends to be more into ancestor worship.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.160
 So they're not going to get a priest

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.040
 to make the ghost go away.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.220
 They're not going to antagonize it

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.000
 or set up tape recorders or bring,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.160
 and again, that's a stereotype.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.440
 Of course, there are Japanese people who do those things

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.480
 but in general, and this is what I was getting

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.920
 from the author too, he goes,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.480
 that's not the way that culture deals with ghosts.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.600
 They're not going to bring spirit boxes

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.260
 and antagonize them in any sort of way.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.600
 They're there for a reason.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.940
 Just stay out of their way.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.100
 Don't mow your lawn, the guy's lawn is all gross.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.260
 He's like, hey man, my ancestors told me

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.660
 not to do any chores, he's not taking out the garbage.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.860
 Oh no, my ancestor told me not to do that.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.060
 His wife's super mad.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.980
 So what's interesting about this?

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.100
 So let's go into this thing of how this exemplifies

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.860
 a certain type of ghost.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.860
 As far as I could tell,

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.860
 there weren't deaths at that holding station.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.120
 So you didn't, it wasn't a death camp.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.920
 It was a camp that people went to

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.240
 and then they moved on to the next camp.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.280
 So why are there so many ghosts floating around there?

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.080
 And it's not just the two, there's other stories.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.320
 I'm just picking out the two of them,

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.980
 but why are there ghosts floating around this neighborhood

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.440
 if people didn't actually die?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.340
 One of my theories of what a ghost is,

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.080
 is that you don't even have to be dead to be a ghost.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.040
 You could be so tormented with emotional anguish

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.060
 or psychic pain that you can leave that residue

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.260
 and then go on with your life.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.400
 I talked about it before, I can come into your house

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.020
 and I can tell you how good your relationship is

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.660
 with your significant other.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.300
 Like I'm not a psychic by any means,

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.180
 but you invite me over to your house,

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.900
 I'll let you know how your relationship is

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.820
 because I can just pick up on the quote unquote vibe,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.000
 the energy of the house.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.700
 I think it's something everyone can do.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.920
 I think it's something that people can train themselves to do.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.860
 I don't think I have any sort of magical power.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.820
 I just think that I am intuitive.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.840
 And I think what happens is when you're fighting

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.380
 with somebody that you love or used to love,

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.360
 it charges things around your house.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.940
 I feel like an idiot talking about it.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.720
 I feel like I'm medium, that show where I'm like picking up

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.660
 a fruit and going, oh, your wife's cheating on you.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.400
 It's not like that, cheating on you with the banana,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.500
 but it's not like that.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.340
 There's just, you can tell, and I think that people can go

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.240
 through so much psychological anguish

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.440
 that they can leave a ghost and still be alive.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.520
 The guy in the tree, I don't think he was climbing trees

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.200
 and then he got picked up and sent to the internment camp

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.120
 and he's like, I'll never climb a tree again.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.480
 I think that whatever, these guys were rightfully going

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.800
 through emotional anguish because they lived in a country

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.400
 that was now rounding them up and shipping them out

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.080
 because of their ethnicity.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.360
 You're gonna be pretty psychically angry.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.320
 You're gonna be very emotionally distraught

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.060
 and you don't know how this story's going to end.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.420
 For all you know, that last stop is your last stop.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.020
 You don't know.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.380
 So I think that the ghosts in this area

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.460
 aren't the ghosts of dead people.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.580
 They're not the ancestors.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.100
 You're actually just people who were so tormented

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.000
 that they psychically broke and left a piece

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.280
 of themselves there.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.620
 I think it's interesting that they're only seen

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.020
 by people of their same ethnicity.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.160
 It could just be that those are the people

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.100
 they wanted to be seen by.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.240
 Like their psychic version of themselves felt betrayed

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.780
 by every other ethnic group in America at that point

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.440
 and where they're getting rounded up and put on these trucks

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.020
 and they're watching all their other neighbors,

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.860
 black neighbors, white neighbors not do anything.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.560
 Never trust someone of another ethnicity after that.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.560
 Even their tortured psychic self can't get over that betrayal.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.340
 Let's end on this note.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.360
 Let's end on this note here.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.260
 Get your hankies ready 'cause this story

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.980
 actually kind of got to me.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.040
 Kind of got to me.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.060
 Maybe you're a little more hardcore than I am,

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:58.900
 but I don't know.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.540
 Even when I was researching it 'cause I have to read

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.100
 a bunch of different versions of stuff

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.300
 to kind of get to the truth.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.860
 Kind of got to me.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.980
 We're going back to the mid to late 1800s.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:13.380
 So Jason Jalopy, we go so fast we go back in time.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.780
 88 miles an hour I think.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.420
 Jason Jalopy can't even go that fast.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.660
 It's like 25 tops.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.900
 We go back in time.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.640
 We are still in Sacramento though.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.460
 We're now in old timey Sacramento.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.180
 And there's a mansion there.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.580
 And this mansion is populated by a little family.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.240
 You have Leland Sr.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.820
 So Leland Sr., people of the time

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.620
 considered him a robber baron,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.700
 which is someone who basically used very unscrupulous methods

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.860
 to get money, to basically whatever it took to get rich,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.980
 he would do.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.260
 Leland had his toes and everything.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.940
 He was a politician.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.060
 He was a railroad tycoon.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.580
 He was basically a real life monopoly game board.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.220
 Just got to own it all.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.800
 And his wife Jane, they lived together

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.700
 and they tried for 18 years to have a child.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.620
 They had everything they could ever want,

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.540
 but they could not have a child.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.500
 At the age of 39, so Leland's 44, she's 39.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.700
 Very, very old.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.020
 That's around my age.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.340
 But it's quite old to have a child.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.900
 Jane becomes pregnant and gives birth to Leland Jr.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.300
 So now they're like, our life is perfect now.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.320
 Jane said the first time she ever saw her husband pray

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.220
 was after his son was delivered.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.420
 Because he was so overcome with joy

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.660
 that he got down on his knees and bowed before God.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.460
 Before that, it's all about him, material wealth.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.700
 But once his son was born, first time she ever saw him pray

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.180
 was then humbled himself, prayed for all the great fortune

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.060
 that he had been bestowed upon him.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.740
 He had a son now.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.780
 And Leland Jr. was the perfect son.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.500
 He was the type of son that not only would you want to have,

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.260
 but he was the type of dude you would wanna hang out with.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.260
 A true bro.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.600
 Super wealthy, good looking kid, came from it all,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.940
 couldn't stand to see anyone or anything suffer.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.680
 Dude with the backward cap, baggy pants,

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.180
 looks like he's gonna beat you up,

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.180
 but he puts a hand out and says,

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.700
 "Hey man, you need help?

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.340
 "Hey, let's go hang out."

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.820
 He's that guy.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.700
 Leland Jr. is that guy.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.660
 Sitting in his mansion, one day he looks out the window

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.940
 and sees a mongrel, a little mixed breed dog

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.020
 walking down the street.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.440
 Legs all bashed up, matted fur,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.940
 runs out of his mansion, picks the puppy up,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.660
 calls up family personal doctor.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.020
 Again, one of the wealthiest families in America

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.900
 brings his personal doctor in and says,

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.780
 "Fix this dog, please.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.640
 "How can we help this dog?"

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.340
 He saw a little poor boy once, covered in mud, all dirty.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.820
 Leland brings him inside and washes him,

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.780
 scrubs his boots down.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.820
 And you're thinking, "Why didn't he just give him

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.660
 "a million dollars?"

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.260
 Well, he's a kid.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.580
 And that's how a kid sees about fixing a problem.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.940
 And the maids and the wait staff were totally freaking out

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.180
 that you have this little boy here scrubbing this little,

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.820
 poor boy's shoes off, cleaning them up.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.300
 He just liked helping people.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.300
 One of the things his dad though saw,

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.160
 his dad loved his son, but he knew that he was being raised

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.800
 in this incredibly rich environment.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.440
 He wanted his son to be rugged as well,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.840
 because Leland Sr. had grown up in the country.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.520
 So he bought 650 acre plot of land in Palo Alto, California.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.560
 That was all like orchards and vineyards and stables

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.520
 and grazing land and all this stuff.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.600
 He would take his son there and just say,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.720
 "Do man stuff.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.200
 "Go out and be a man."

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.760
 And Leland Jr. loved this activity.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.460
 He'd grab a gun, he'd go out hunting,

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.660
 he'd ride horses and he'd have a little like dogs

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.180
 next to him, he'd hunt all these animals.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.740
 He loved being in the wilderness.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.060
 It was something alien to him

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.020
 and he immediately grabbed onto it.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.180
 It was his favorite place in the world.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.100
 And he had a blessed childhood.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.300
 And at age 15, he was getting ready to go off

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.940
 into the East Coast to go to college.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.220
 That's bizarre to me that he's going to college at 15.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.220
 Maybe it was different back in the 1800s, but.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.180
 And before he left though, his parents said,

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.860
 Leland Sr. and Jane said,

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.960
 "Let's go on a trip to Europe.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.240
 "We're going to travel all over Europe.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.760
 "It'll be our last big hurrah.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.840
 "Then you're going to go off to college.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.360
 "We're not going to see you for a while."

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.040
 So they go to Europe and it is a journey out of a fairy tale.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.200
 They're meeting with the Sultan of Turkey.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.080
 They're going to the Rome, they're going to England.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.920
 They're going to all these places.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.400
 But both of his parents at this point,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.120
 the dad I think is like 60 and the mom is 54.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.000
 So they're both elderly.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.480
 Which back then would,

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.980
 we didn't have all the medical advances we have.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.160
 At 1654, you're dealing with a lot of stuff.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.540
 At one point, the mom was too sick to leave,

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.860
 to actually go out and visit anything.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.740
 So Leland Jr. would walk along the city

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.780
 and take notes about all the beautiful things he'd see.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.220
 And then he'd come back,

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.300
 sit next to his mother and tell her about his visits.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.260
 Tell her about all the amazing things out there.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.140
 But eventually his parents did start to feel better

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.260
 during the trip, traveling all around.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.740
 But Jane one day realizes that Leland,

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.000
 the story's all true by the way.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.080
 She says she should have said that in the beginning.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.920
 The mother sees that Leland looks a little pale

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.380
 and it kind of worries her,

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.600
 but he's like, no, don't worry about it mom,

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.520
 don't worry about it.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.200
 And she should have worried about it

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.720
 because what happened was he had contracted typhoid,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.560
 typhoid fever and he falls incredibly ill.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.960
 Super high temperature, super gross.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.720
 He's all sweaty all the time.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.040
 Dad is getting the best doctors in Europe

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.560
 to come out here to see a son.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.820
 And his son is just not getting any better.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.220
 At one point they're staying at this huge hotel

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:43.220
 and the hotel manager had hay brought to the area

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.940
 and put down on the sidewalk on the streets outside

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.180
 so the boy could rest.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.620
 So he didn't have to hear the outside noises.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.220
 Because everybody loved this boy.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.140
 He was not a spoiled brat.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.420
 I know you could go, well, no one takes care of,

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.060
 no one puts hay on the ground when I'm sick.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.780
 I gotta hear people driving out of the street

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.660
 playing la cucaracha.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.180
 And I'm not saying people don't love you either.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.120
 I don't want him to come off as a spoiled brat.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.880
 I'm just saying that people were bending over backwards

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.000
 to save this kid because they knew

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.580
 that this little boy was special.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.420
 He was different.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.300
 Someone who came from wealth and everything

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.460
 and was just humble and nice.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.340
 One of the treatments was they had to put

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.500
 ice cold wraps on him to keep his temperature down

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.340
 and he hated it.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.640
 He begged them not to do it, but they had to.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.300
 And he would have to feel like his hot skin

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.120
 and then these ice cold rags put on his skin.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.540
 It was a very, very miserable time.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.380
 But they were doing anything they could

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.580
 to save Leland Jr.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.580
 And in the end, couple days before he turned 16,

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.020
 Leland Jr. passed away.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.100
 His father builds a mausoleum for him

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.820
 and puts it in Palo Alto,

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.160
 puts it in Leland Jr.'s favorite spot,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.460
 goes back to Sacramento.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.060
 One night Leland Sr. is sleeping in bed

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.620
 and his son appears to him in a dream.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.680
 And Leland Jr. tells his father,

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.100
 "You've amassed a lot of wealth and a lot of power

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.200
 and you've done a lot of things to get both.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.640
 But I want you to do something else now.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.240
 I want you to dedicate your entire life to education.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.880
 I want you to start a university

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.920
 and I want you to use your fortune

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.080
 to help children learn."

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.500
 Leland Sr. wakes up from this dream,

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.600
 this visitation from his son who had passed away.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.700
 And he takes that visit to heart.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.940
 He goes out to the East Coast

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.320
 and looks at all their schools,

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.240
 meets all these officials, sees how things are done.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.980
 And then he travels back to Palo Alto,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.240
 starts making arrangements to have a university created.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.860
 And as he's filling out all the paperwork

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:01.060
 to break ground on this beautiful rugged land

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.420
 is now going to hold a major university.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.060
 One of the businessmen goes, "Hey, Leland Sr.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.240
 Never got your last name."

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.660
 Leland's right now and he goes, "Stanford,

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.600
 Leland Stanford."

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.820
 Finish was writing his name, hands it to the guy.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:26.020
 Stanford University was founded there.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:31.020
 And to this day, the Stanford mausoleum is still on campus.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.140
 Nowadays it holds not just Leland Jr.'s body,

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.220
 but the body of his mother and father

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.520
 who loved him so much in life

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.980
 that they were gonna spend death with him as well.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.040
 I actually looked a lot into whether or not

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.540
 that story was true.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:51.260
 Everything's true, but did a ghost visit Leland Sr.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.020
 and tell him to build a university?

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.740
 I looked at official accounts,

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.260
 I looked at a bunch of ghost sites

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.900
 and they all pretty much agree that

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:02.900
 as far as anybody knows, yes, a ghost did visit.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.860
 I think the skeptics say he just had a dream

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.220
 that his son told him to do this.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.380
 And then the haunted websites say,

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.820
 "No, no, no, it was a ghost."

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.220
 No website is saying that story's not true at all.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.060
 It was a fable made up.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.540
 As far as I could tell, as far as I could tell,

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.100
 'cause I was looking at like Stanford University's website

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.820
 and they weren't saying, "No, it wasn't true,

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.660
 "it wasn't true."

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.940
 They just had like a biography of Leland Jr. stuff like that.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.300
 And they always go, "Some people say that Leland Sr.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.540
 "was visited by the ghost,

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.180
 "but no one's out and out denying it."

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.380
 But that kind of brings us back

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.460
 to our wrap up of ghost stories.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.020
 The first story was a stranger saying,

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.140
 "I have unfinished business here.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.980
 "Please dig up these coins so I can move on."

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.960
 The second one was people who weren't actually dead

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.780
 but leaving some sort of psychic residue there.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.020
 But the third story is a very common one.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.860
 It's people who are still alive being visited

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.100
 by people who have passed away in their dreams or at night.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.540
 Very, very common phenomenon.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.500
 Coming, someone coming back from beyond saying,

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.380
 "You know, I'm in a happy place.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.340
 "You can move on," things like that.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.820
 This last one though has the particular note,

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.900
 the little particular thing,

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.900
 other than just the nightly visitation,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.660
 is that the ghost actually changed the person's life.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.060
 It's the type of ghost that doesn't necessarily

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.460
 have unfinished business of their own,

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.740
 but when they pass through the mortal coil,

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.260
 when they go into this other realm,

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.540
 they see that if you let your loved one move

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.260
 in the direction they're moving in,

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.920
 things will not work out well.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.020
 They're not coming back

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.140
 to correct unfinished business of theirs.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.180
 They're coming back to help you become the person

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.260
 they know you can be.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.540
 Did Leland Jr. see when he died,

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.980
 did he see a future of Leland Sr.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.940
 just falling into ill health,

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.840
 never getting over the loss of his son,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.800
 becoming a cruel businessman,

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.140
 becoming a cruel person,

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.380
 because if the world and God could steal

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.660
 a young boy from Leland Sr.,

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.620
 why should he give anyone any quarter?

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.500
 If the world can be so cruel to him,

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.820
 why shouldn't he be so cruel to the world?

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.780
 And Leland Jr. sees this and says,

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.060
 "That's not the father that I know.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.900
 "I want one more chance to talk to my father."

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.180
 And he comes back and says,

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.980
 "I want you to forget all of that power

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.060
 "and all of that money.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.440
 "I want you to dedicate your life to education

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.900
 "and lifting people up."

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.660
 I think the interesting thing,

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.380
 I remember once I had a friend

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.580
 who had lost somebody very, very close to them.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.220
 And I said, "You know, time doesn't exist

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.740
 "on the other side.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.540
 "We may have to wait 40 years to see them again,

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.700
 "but to them, you're already there.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.500
 "You are already next to them.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.220
 "They don't miss you at all.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.540
 "Time doesn't exist after you're dead."

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.120
 I don't have any proof of that, obviously, I'm not dead,

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:55.120
 but I think things like time exist here in a mortal world.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:02.040
 And when you're dead, there'd be no measurement of time.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.000
 Everything just simply happens.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.520
 So it would be possible that a young boy dies

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.640
 and experiences immediately the next 20 years

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.920
 of his father's life and goes,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.440
 "I can change that because that's not the man

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.740
 "I know and love."

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.820
 Ghost stories intrigue humans like no other kind of story.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.860
 I'd argue that ghost stories are some of the oldest stories

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.060
 in human history.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.260
 What happens to us after we die

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:33.140
 is a very, very popular question.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.980
 Ghost stories have lasted longer than UFO stories

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.620
 and they will last long after.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.260
 Once aliens come down and we know that they're out there

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.420
 and we're having trading partners with the

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.760
 the globuli globs on Planet X,

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.200
 people will still tell ghost stories

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.080
 because there's just something about them

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.600
 that sends chills up our spine, even the good ones.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.920
 Even the story of Leland Jr. talking to his father,

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.920
 there's still something intrinsically creepy about that

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.200
 because you have a man who's being told

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.200
 by a dead son what to do.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.200
 And you go, Jason, that's not creepy, that's uplifting.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.900
 Well, let's end it with this.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.600
 What would have happened if he had said no?

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.820
 Like Roland in the first story.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.780
 What would have happened if Leland Sr. had woken up

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.740
 and said no, the world has been cruel

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.580
 and it has robbed you from me?

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.660
 I don't want to dedicate my life to education.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:33.660
 I am going to do whatever I can to punish God for ruining me.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:39.220
 In the first story, the ghost just had glowing red eyes

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.060
 and chased the family out.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.620
 What would have happened with Leland Sr.?

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.620
 What would have happened if he had said no

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.620
 in that circumstance?

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.340
 How would that story have ended?

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.900
 We have a university now,

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.140
 but the story could have just ended with the ghost

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.300
 of Leland Jr. realizing that his father was becoming

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.540
 a monster and one cold morning, Leland Sr.,

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.240
 stumbles down the stairs, dies.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.820
 People just chalk it up to old age, clumsiness.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.140
 But it could have been something else.

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.340
 Leland Jr. gave him the choice to change his life.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.840
 Leland Sr. wouldn't do it.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.980
 And so more drastic measures were taken

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.680
 than just red fiery eyes in the dark news.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.580
