WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 Put down that bowl of top ramen.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.800
 Tell your mom no seconds on the tuna casserole please, because today we're going to take

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.640
 a look at a story of a man who is so bent on revenge he would feed his friends the unthinkable.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.920
 And then we travel to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where a young boy is out playing

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.180
 among the sand dunes.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.120
 Little does he know he's about to see something.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.120
 No modern human was ever meant to discover today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:44.880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.880
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.000
 It's pretty much just playing a killing floor for me and doing research for even more episodes

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 for next week.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.480
 But someone who can't wait till next week walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.640
 is one of our long time legacy Patreon supporters.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.400
 Give it up for Sweet Sweet Golden Goo.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 Woohoo!

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400
 Yeah, come on in.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.040
 Sticky sweets from her head to her feet.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040
 Sweet Sweet Golden Goo.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.800
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.120
 You guys can't swear the Patreon off, you guys aren't super tasty.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.120
 That's fine too.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.880
 Just helps read the word about the show.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.320
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.560
 Now we got a lot of stuff to cover today.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.960
 So let's go ahead and get started.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 Sweet Sweet Golden Goo.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.560
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys for the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.360
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 Fly us all the way out to Quebec.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 Specifically, we're headed out to Saint Andy Bellevue in Quebec.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.480
 And we're going to stop by MacDonald College, not MacDonald's University, which sounds

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 delicious.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.520
 This story is the opposite of that.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.680
 It's the most repulsive story that you could positively think of regarding food.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.520
 And we've covered a lot of gross ones.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.480
 We're at MacDonald College.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.360
 It's January 1970.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.120
 And we're walking around school and we're in the school cafeteria and they're handing

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.320
 out muffins and jelly and pancakes and stuff, I'm guessing.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.560
 And we're eating those.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.800
 And into the cafeteria walks Eric Cranes.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.560
 He's this 23-year-old student who is currently researching parasiteology, the study of parasites.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.440
 We're in the middle of taking a bite of a pancake.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.160
 I was like, "Yeah, this is a tough one."

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.080
 Eric Cranes just loves to be around parasites.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.640
 He's hanging around a bunch of people who borrow money and never give him any money back.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.600
 He's like, "Ah, my people."

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.080
 He loves looking through microscopes at tiny little eggs and he probably feeds chickens

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.720
 to snakes and stuff like that.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.640
 They're like, "Eric, stop doing that.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.360
 That's not a definition of a parasite."

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.520
 He's like, "Yeah, it's just fun."

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520
 Allegedly.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.840
 I should mention very clearly right now.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.800
 This is all alleged.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.400
 Eric Cranes goes home.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400
 Now he's currently sharing a home with four roommates.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.800
 Now they didn't get along.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.640
 This part isn't alleged.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.200
 They did not get along.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.520
 Eric Cranes and his roommates never saw eye to eye.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.440
 And this all came to a head when one day they're like, "Hey Eric, you owe us back rent."

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.360
 Eric's like, "Listen, man, I'm trying to get the money together.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.560
 I've already loaned my money off to a bunch of people.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.560
 They're not paying me back.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.000
 Parasiteology has gone too far."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.840
 They're like, "Eric, you've got to pay us the money."

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.000
 This is insane.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.200
 Actually, the thing we're going to get to is super insane.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.720
 But this also blows my mind.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.800
 He owed them $16.66 in back rent.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.280
 Now let's forget the whole 666 thing, because that's just creepy in and of itself.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.560
 But they were ready to evict this dude because he was short around $17.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.480
 He was $17 short on his rent and they're like, "Bro, pack your bags.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480
 You got to get out of here."

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.960
 Now, they didn't like the guy, right?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.400
 So they were looking for any reason.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.520
 But apparently there was a lot of debate on this.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.040
 I found this story online.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.480
 It was posted by a guy named Delano1998.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.760
 He's not a participant in this story.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.760
 Don't go after him.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.360
 Don't try to seek some parasite justice yourself.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.280
 He just posted this.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.040
 And a lot of people were debating, "Wow, $17 and he's getting kicked out."

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.640
 Apparently in 1970, Canadian money, that was close to about $130.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.520
 So yeah, I could see if someone's behind $130 and you didn't like them.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.080
 You want to get rid of them.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.760
 So they're like, "Eric, you got to pay the money.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.280
 You got to pay the money you owed to us."

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.040
 And he's like, "Oh, he's not picking up pennies."

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.040
 He's like, "Oh, now I just need $1,665 more and all my troubles are solved."

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.400
 He's getting so upset with these guys.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.800
 Like again, it seems to be a long-brewing thing when they keep on him about paying the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:05.000
 rent that he owes, he says, "This might be the most specific threat I've ever heard before.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.040
 Normally, it's like, "I'll get you.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.640
 One of these days, I'll get you."

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.600
 Then you fly away in your car and inspect your gadgets.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.000
 Like, "Oh, save the day once again."

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.560
 This was his threat.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.560
 He turned to his roommates.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.720
 They said, "Where's the $16 and 66 cents you owe us?"

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720
 He's like, "Ah."

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.720
 He said, "All put parasites in your food and you'll wake up dead."

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.720
 That is such a specific threat.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.880
 And it's coming from someone who could do it because he's studying parasitology.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.480
 He has access to parasites.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.560
 If I made that threat to someone, you're like, "Jason, you can barely pronounce the word.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.360
 I doubt you can rummage up more than three or four parasites, which would still be too

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.760
 much to be in your food."

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.160
 But you're like, "I'm not worried about Jason."

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.000
 And I'll be like, "Oh, get you gadget."

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.760
 They're like, "When it's not gadget, just please give me the $17 you owe me and leave."

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.880
 I'm like, "Ah."

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.880
 He owes them money.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.960
 He threatens them by putting parasites in their food.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.320
 What happens is January 31st rolls around and he comes into the house and he's like,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.680
 "Hey, guys, I got big news.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680
 Here's $17."

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.360
 And they're like, "Oh, yeah.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.800
 We were expecting something better than that, but that's what you owe us.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.880
 You've got to hope so when he said, you know, big news."

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.600
 But fine, we'll take the $17.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.840
 He paid them the $17 and yet they evicted them anyways.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840
 What crumbums.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.520
 What he did was threaten to put parasites in your food and you're evicting him.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.520
 He paid them money.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.080
 They evicted them.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.880
 But let bygones be bygones, right?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:50.840
 That's the holiday spirit of Quebec because the first week of February, there's a thing

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.720
 called the Winter Carnival where people dress up like snowmen and they walk around and everyone's

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720
 going, "Oh, oh, oh."

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720
 And people are like, "What?

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720
 It doesn't look like a snowman."

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.720
 So, no one doesn't say that.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.280
 They're like, "Ah, just go with it.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.280
 It's Canada.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280
 We do weird stuff up here."

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.160
 They have this thing called Winter Carnival where they just kind of dance around.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
 Actually, I didn't.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160
 I didn't research that.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.640
 I didn't research that at all.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.280
 I just go, "Oh, Winter Carnival."

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.520
 And then I clicked on Wikipedia and it was like a picture.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.320
 It was just a picture of a man in a snowman suit.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.400
 So, I go, "Ah, that's all the research I need to do on that.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.400
 Just one photograph."

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400
 So, I don't know.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.400
 It could be like some big religious festival.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.560
 I could have pissed off a whole nation.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.040
 Anyways, Winter Carnival and Eric is like, "You know what, guys?

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.760
 I was the crumbum this time.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.720
 I should have paid you that $17 when I owed it."

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.320
 So I have decided to serve you a feast.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.360
 And he brings in all this food he prepared for Winter Carnival.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.680
 Let's stop the story right here.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.480
 And I just, this isn't a Choose Your Own Adventure.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.680
 This is not a logic question.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.880
 It's not a word problem.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:08.680
 If someone ever threatened to put parasites in your food and then you evicted them, and

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.920
 then they show back up a couple of days later with food, would you eat it?

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920
 But you know what?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.920
 Maybe it's a holiday spirit.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.760
 Maybe bygones be bygones, right?

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.760
 Old enemies become friends.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.840
 Old people who threaten to feed you parasites become people who don't do that.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.080
 And he brought in all this food and you accept it as a good friend would, right?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.760
 What type of friend would you be if you didn't eat the food of a maniac who threatened to

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.760
 poison you?

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.840
 His roommates and apparently like three other people.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.520
 There is a total of seven people that got afflicted by what's about to happen.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.720
 I think you guys can kind of figure it out at this point.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.720
 But you can't.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.440
 You have no idea what's coming up next.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.920
 This is true story.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.360
 He brings in all this food.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360
 They eat it.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.840
 They're like, "Oh, this is delicious."

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.840
 "Oh, no, no."

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.840
 They're like fighting over.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.840
 They're fighting over the last roll.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.840
 They're like, "Oh, man.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.840
 Oh, man."

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.840
 And Eric's probably just sitting there with a big old smile.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.240
 They realize it's weird he didn't eat anything.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.920
 He's like, "Oh, I had my winter festival dinner on the way over.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.480
 Go ahead and gorge yourselves on this delicious food."

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:21.840
 About a week later, all of the roommates, all the four roommates, get sick around the

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840
 same time.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.080
 But you know, it's winter, right?

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.240
 pneumonia is going around.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.720
 People get sick.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.560
 They're coughing.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.720
 They're losing weight pretty rapidly, right?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.200
 That's usually not a symptom of the flu.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.440
 These four roommates start to develop a fever as well.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.200
 They're sweating, coughing, they're all skinny, though.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200
 They're like, "Oh, no.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.000
 Taking off their freshman 40?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 This is great."

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.400
 But then all four of them, and I'm assuming the other three people showed up for this

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400
 party.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.200
 I have no idea about the cryptic threat that Eric made.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.960
 They just showed up, but they don't play a lot into this later narrative.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.880
 I'm sure they were also incredibly sick.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.520
 We know about these four roommates cough, weight loss, fever, and then, this is the

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.240
 most troubling of all, right?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.040
 You can tank those other three, no problem.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.840
 You're like, "Jason, I don't know why you're so blasé about having high temperature."

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.400
 They start to feel, all four of them feel like they can't breathe.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.160
 Now that's frightening.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:29.160
 But on February 12th, it goes to full on, they can't breathe.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.560
 Like by February 12th, they are actually having a hard time taking a deep breath, and they're

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.120
 breaking out in hives.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.680
 So at this point, it's been like two weeks at this point, they go to the hospital, and

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.080
 they get in there, and they're in respiratory distress.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.600
 The doctor's like, "Oh, no.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.680
 You guys should have been here a long time ago.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.360
 You guys look terrible, but you've lost a lot of weight.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.360
 You look like pretty slim guys."

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360
 They take them in.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.440
 The doctor, the attending physician, brings them in, and is treating them, and they start

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.880
 treating them for pneumonia, right?

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.240
 They're having trouble breathing, all this other stuff.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.840
 So they start treating them for pneumonia, and nothing is working.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.240
 And he's like, "Doctor's like, 'Oh, man.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.240
 I don't know what else to do.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240
 I did one thing.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.680
 I tried one thing, and it didn't work out.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.180
 You guys will be fine."

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.440
 Two of them end up in critical condition, because they can't breathe.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:26.760
 February 16th, dude is coughing into like a little tray, a little spit tray.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.520
 And the nurse picks it up, and she goes, "Oh, yes.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.320
 This is my favorite part of my job.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.520
 I have a fetish for phlegm."

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.000
 She takes the tray of phlegm, and they're looking at it.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.880
 I'm sure, I don't know if they saw this with a naked eye, but what they discovered at this

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.680
 point, remember they ate the food on February 1st, or the first week of February.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.960
 It's February 16th now.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:58.320
 They find a worm in the phlegm, and he's coughing up.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.600
 A four millimeter long worm.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.160
 I'm just gonna say how big it was first to imagine a giant earthworm.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.160
 You're like, "Nope."

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.160
 He set off the podcast.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.160
 You're like, "I'm done."

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:13.040
 A four millimeter long worm just kind of squiggling around in his phlegm.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.760
 The nurse goes, "Oh, I gotta tell the doctor about this."

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.960
 And the doctor's looking at it, and he goes, "Wow.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.360
 Who would have thought that this worm would be inside a human?"

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.800
 What they found, what this worm was, was something known as the "ascaris sum."

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.160
 It's a round worm found in pigs.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.680
 It lives in pig intestines.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.880
 To giant roundworm, they grow to be about six to twelve inches long.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.880
 They live in pig intestines.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.880
 And the doctor's like, "You know, we've always had theories about these worms getting into

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.160
 humans, right?

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.560
 Because maybe if you ate enough pork products, you're eating so many hot dogs, you just

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.400
 start eating the life big, you're sucking their intestines up like a string of spaghetti

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.360
 and you ate all the eggs."

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.280
 So the doctor's like, "But this is still weird.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.280
 We don't even know if it's possible.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.160
 If it is possible, it's incredibly rare.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
 How did all these people eat pig intestines?"

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.080
 We didn't eat pig intestines, by the way.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.400
 The patients are like, "You know what?

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:15.480
 Just to start to make sense, because our roommate worked at a parapsytology lab.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.400
 He threatened to put parasites in our food."

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.400
 And the doctor's like, "Okay, that makes a little more sense."

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.680
 They start to do all these tests on the people and these four roommates, and they find the

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.280
 life cycle of this roundworm in these four dudes.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:35.420
 What happens is there's microscopic eggs in their bloodstream that float out of the

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:42.280
 intestines into the bloodstream and then go into the lung.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.680
 That's why they were having such trouble breathing.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.160
 And part of the life cycle is you would cough up this larva because the egg hatches in

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.920
 your lungs, so now you've got this little worm in you and then you would cough it up

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.520
 along with all the other phlegm and sputum.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520
 Right?

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.520
 Apparently that's the thing.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.960
 I think it's just a fancy word for phlegm, but I think it's like bloody phlegm.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.540
 Like Jason, please, please just quit giving the visuals.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.540
 They're coughing up these little worms, these little immature worms, and they climb up the

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:16.580
 trachea and then you swallow them back down and they go back into your stomach where they

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.700
 become mature worms.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.860
 Out of your intestines, into your blood, into your lungs, coughing out of your lungs back

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.860
 into your stomach.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.100
 The worms journey is complete.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.880
 So what they did was they go, "We got to get rid of these worms," even though this

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.680
 is kind of cool scientifically.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.080
 We got to get rid of the worms.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.120
 The attending physicians started them on this treatment that's used to kill this type of

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.880
 parasite.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:47.480
 Pretty much ends the infestation right there.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.600
 But they have like, you figure, okay Jason, they have a couple worms.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.840
 Big deal, big deal.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.560
 They have a couple worms in them.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:02.300
 One of the dudes was full of at least, at least, they probably lost count after a certain point.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:12.340
 He had at least 400,000 larvae inside of him.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.340
 400,000 wriggling little worms crawling through his body.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.340
 He's only tickled all the time.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.500
 He's like, "I didn't know it would be so fun."

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.500
 Trying to throw him up.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.000
 Dude, it was just coming out of his bowel movements.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Just worms.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 He's going poop.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 A bunch of worms are coming out.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.880
 I would rather be tickled by 400,000 worms than to have one worm come out of my butthole.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.600
 The doctor said, "This is real serious."

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.880
 He goes, "One of these guys, one of these patients, he's going to have permanent lung

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.880
 damage."

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.600
 Like, these worms did such a number on him that he's going to have lung damage for the

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.600
 rest of his life.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:55.340
 Eric, after the roommates and the friends started getting sick, he left Quebec.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.340
 He ditched the place.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.340
 He's like, "I'm done."

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:04.100
 And once his scheme was undone, right, once they figured out what had happened, they

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:09.780
 actually set out in a arrest warrant for attempted murder.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:14.100
 On March 9th, 1970, he surrendered himself and they let him out on bail.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.620
 They figured, you know, what's the worst he can do?

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.220
 What's the worst this guy can do?

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.220
 The supervillain.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.960
 He can just infest the world with parasites.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.200
 They let him out on bail.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.120
 June 1971 is when the trial took place.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.660
 And the prosecution was like, what evidence, what possible evidence do you need?

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.060
 He worked at a parapsytology lab.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.580
 He had access to parasites.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.640
 He threatened to give people parasites.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.680
 People he didn't like had parasites.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.600
 And here's a bunch of photos.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.800
 X-rays of him boogying down in his dude's stomach.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.320
 Case closed.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.360
 Like who else could possibly do this?

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:54.860
 Now his defense lawyer said, "Your Honor, parasites, schmericides."

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.420
 He totally blew off the whole thing.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:02.140
 He goes, "Listen, sure my client worked at a parasite lab, but who knows where they

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.140
 got these parasites?"

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:09.260
 It turns out that their kitchen sink was constantly full of sewage for some reason.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:14.580
 I know college life was hard, but that's what the defense lawyer said.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.600
 And the other roommates were like, "No, that's not true.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600
 That's not true."

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.600
 They're like, "Shift from side to side."

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600
 They're like, "Okay, it's a little true."

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.360
 But there wasn't so much sewage in our sink that we got parasites.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.440
 And the defense lawyer was like, "Mm-hmm."

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.360
 And then the defense lawyer goes, "Okay, well maybe it's not the sewage theory.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.520
 However, yes, my client did work at a parapsytology lab.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.120
 But this could happen accidentally.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:46.180
 You see, my client may have gotten some eggs on his clothes.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.220
 Some microscopic eggs, you wouldn't even see him, right?

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:54.060
 He's walking around the lab in his blue jeans and his polo and a couple of roundworm eggs

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.980
 end up all over his clothes.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.780
 It happens to the vestibulus.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.580
 And then his roommates, maybe when they were kicking him out, I don't know, maybe they

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.860
 were going through his clothes.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.300
 Maybe they were packing his bags for him.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.820
 Who am I to say?

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:13.040
 It's possible that this guy who threatened to put eggs in people's food didn't actually

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.040
 do it.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:19.360
 It was an accident from them handling his clothes.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.520
 And Eric won the case.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.160
 Eric was acquitted of this crime.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.360
 He served no jail time for poisoning seven people.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:33.640
 Some times they wrap up these true crime stories with some sort of lesson to be learned or

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.320
 some sort of look at the justice system and how corrupt it can be and how they can miss

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.320
 the mark.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.300
 I don't know if there's anything like this.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:47.860
 I think the moral of this story is if somebody ever threatens to poison you with parasites,

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.020
 do not eat their food.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:58.100
 The fact that he got off is it should be shocking, but Canadian justice system is just awful.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.700
 And this guy's still out there, right?

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.500
 He was 23 in 1970.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.500
 So that would make him.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.980
 You're like, "Oh, great, Jason's going to try to do math."

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.560
 This is how I do math.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.080
 They go 70 plus 90 is 20.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.840
 So then he'd be 43 in 1990.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.920
 And then he'd be 53 in 2000.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.120
 This is really how I do math.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.240
 This guy would be 75 years old now.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.200
 He could still be out there.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.360
 He could still be out there.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.120
 He could be working at a local restaurant.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.120
 You're at right now.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.440
 Listen, it's at the spot, guys.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.920
 You're still eating your noodles.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.420
 I told you not to and then you look over and you see in the kitchen, there's a man standing

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:43.140
 there with a glimmer in his eye and a parasite coming out of his other eye.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.700
 This guy's probably dead point now.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.580
 This guy's messing around with parasites.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.140
 This guy's constantly juggling roundworm eggs.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.860
 He probably infested himself at some point, but it's crazy, bizarre, true crime story

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.740
 and absolutely disgusting and lesson or not, whether or not there's there's a moral to

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.260
 what I just wanted to share it with you.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.480
 Great sweet golden goo.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.760
 Grab that barf bag, get it over with, and I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbon

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.920
 acopter.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.960
 We're leaving behind Quebec.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:16.160
 We're headed all the way out to Martha's Vineyard.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.280
 The year is 2002.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.480
 It's a beautiful summer and we're spending it in Martha's Vineyard.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.320
 Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:32.100
 Now the story was posted online by someone going by the name, "You're doing great sweaty."

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.460
 I think they might have misspelled, sweetie.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.460
 You're doing great sweaty.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.900
 We're going to go ahead and call this dude Samuel.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:40.900
 He tells a story.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.060
 This actually happened back when he was between the ages of eight and 10, back in the year

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.060
 2002.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.220
 He goes, "Listen, I've never told this story before.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.380
 I've never told it to anybody except for my parents because they were there and they

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.400
 wanted answers."

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:05.880
 Back in 2002, Samuel's family, mom, dad, and him, took a vacation out to Martha's Vineyard.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.560
 And he goes, "Listen, I was an excitable child.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.000
 I was always running around and tugging on people's shirts and picking their pockets.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.800
 I was a regular Aladdin.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:19.200
 I was constantly wanting to explore nature and my parents were like, "Sure, Sam, go.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.200
 Go away.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.520
 Go away playing the bushes.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520
 Have fun."

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.780
 They're somewhere far away from us.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.940
 So they fed into his need to explore.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.780
 So when they went to Martha's Vineyard, they're actually on the beach.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:37.500
 He believes this is somewhere near the Minimasha Hills Beach.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.380
 They're at the beach just having a good time.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.540
 Everyone's at the beach having a good time.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.460
 It's really hard to be depressed at the beach.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.540
 I mean, maybe you just got stung by jellyfish and you're watching somebody unzip their pants

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.740
 ready to pee on you.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.740
 That's probably the most depressed you could be at the beach.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.660
 But little Sam, he's running around.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.560
 "Oh yeah, this is so much fun."

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:01.360
 And he sees there's this tall series of rocks that some of the teens are climbing up and

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.160
 jumping off the rocks into the water.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.840
 And he's like, "Wow, that looks fun, but even being a little eight-year-old, I know that's

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.200
 extremely dangerous.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.800
 I want to go exploring instead of risking paralyzation."

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.920
 So he decides, "I'm going to see what's on the other side of those rocks.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.760
 I'll just go for a little kid journey."

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.060
 So he goes over the rocks.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.820
 He's kind of walking along and he says, "I'm probably about a half a mile at this point,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.100
 a half a mile from where my parents and everyone else is.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.140
 I'm kind of alone at this point."

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.300
 I see these huge sand dunes.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.980
 Now I actually looked, I couldn't find this exact location.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:44.140
 I tried looking for this exact location on Google Earth, but I was looking at this beach

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:49.380
 area and it's interesting because you have beach and then immediately, like it's like

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.400
 sand and then heavy greenery.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.200
 It's just like, goes from straight beach to grass.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.000
 In California, it was never like that.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.400
 Like you had the beach, then you had a bunch of rocks that you'd cut your feet on and then

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.640
 you had a bunch of paved stuff, usually referred to as a parking lot.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.400
 And then you just had more kind of dusty mountains, kind of rocky mountains and not the rocky mountains,

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.280
 but you know, and it was kind of laid out like that, right?

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.680
 It was a clear definition between the biomes, but here it's not the case.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.660
 It goes beach, then lush foliage.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.900
 So he's climbing up these huge sand dunes.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.700
 He says they're about 75 to 100 feet tall.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.220
 That might be the exaggeration of an eight-year-old boy, right?

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.380
 Or to an eight-year-old, everything may seem that tall, but he's climbing these dunes and

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.700
 he gets up on the top one of these dunes and he goes, "I'm going to see if I can see my

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.700
 family.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.860
 I'm going to get at the top of this dune and I'm going to see if I can see past the big

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.860
 rocks."

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:50.400
 And currently I have the vision of a superhero, see if I can see my family way, way over there.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.520
 See if I can pick out my parents from a half a mile away.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.200
 Now he gets at the top of the hill and he can't really see anyone.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.360
 He can't see his parents.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.360
 He's pretty far away.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.000
 But what he does see at the top of the sand dune, because again, it has this giant lump

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.960
 in the earth right next to it.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.360
 Like, it's literally like in the sand, they're like budding up against each other, are these

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.940
 huge bushes?

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:22.660
 And he turns and he looks and in one of the bushes is a cave.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.740
 Now not like the bush was on a mountain hiding a cave.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:33.380
 He said, "It looked like someone actually cut a tunnel through a bush."

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.740
 He's sitting there and he's looking at him.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.740
 He goes, "That's pretty weird.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.300
 I've never seen anything like this before.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:45.640
 It looks like someone actually took the time to bore a passageway through this bush."

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.360
 And as a young adventurer, he knew that he had to see what was going on.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.840
 So he starts kind of squatting down and walking through this bush.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.480
 It apparently is like a thorn bush.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.520
 And this kid doesn't have his shirt.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.000
 So he's being super careful.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.320
 He's not throwing his arms up and going, "Wee, wee!"

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.280
 He's got to keep it up close to his body and kind of squatting through.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:11.140
 And he's walking and then he sees a slide.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:17.420
 Not an actual metal slide, but the earth again looks like it's been formatted as some sort

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.260
 of slope.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:26.460
 Totally man-made.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.580
 Begins to crouch through it and go down this slide.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.060
 He said it had to be about 40 feet going down.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:37.560
 40 feet, you know, gradual slope.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.880
 And when he gets to the bottom of that, he is now standing in a clearing.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.920
 There's greenery all around him.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:50.400
 Now he's left the beach, which again is only maybe about 40 feet away.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.280
 And he's in this lush greenery.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.880
 And he says this was, again, it was a clearing.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.840
 I'm standing in this clearing, but everything else was covered by plant life, including

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.840
 the sky.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.840
 There is the canopy of bushes and vines, maybe not vines.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.880
 He didn't specify vines, he didn't magically get transported to the Lost City of Gold in

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.000
 the Yucatan or anything.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.920
 But he says, "Even the sky was blocked out by the greenery."

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:24.480
 And I'm looking around and it felt like someone had made a home inside of a giant bush.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.160
 He sees another tunnel leading away from this clearing and he walks down that.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.920
 And at that point he begins to hear voices.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.040
 Can't tell what they're saying.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.760
 Can kind of tell where they're coming from.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:44.120
 It sounds like they're coming from the end of this tunnel, but his curiosity is peaked.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.480
 He's a young boy who goes on adventures all the time.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.160
 He wants to see, he goes, "I wanted to meet the King of the Fort."

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:58.680
 Like to him this was some sort of place, some hidden habitat.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.920
 And there had to be a King and he was going to meet him, he was going to have so much

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.240
 fun with his new friends.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.200
 So he's walking through this tunnel that's built into this foliage.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:14.800
 And as he's getting towards the end of it, he sees another clearing, a larger clearing,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.000
 and he sees what he describes as a campfire.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.480
 But he goes, "I can't really say that I saw flames.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:30.840
 What I saw was a white, yellow, orange light in this clearing.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:40.480
 I assumed it was a campfire, but at this point he says his recollection begins to become blurry.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.120
 He has a hard time remembering super concrete details, but this is what he does remember.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.620
 He's looking through this tunnel, he sees the other clearing, and what he sees around

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.200
 it is a group of figures.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.800
 A group of, he doesn't like using the word "people" to describe them.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.840
 He kept putting people in air quotes or real quotes because it's typed out, but he wasn't

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.400
 comfortable using the word "people."

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.240
 They seemed like something else to him.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:15.560
 And at this point is when he begins to feel fear.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.920
 He was totally enthusiastic about meeting the King of the Fort until he gets a glimpse

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.360
 of who is in the clearing.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.480
 Just a fleeting glimpse, right?

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:28.000
 Again, he can't specifically say they were human, but this is when fear begins to overtake

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 him.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.200
 He starts to become terrified and specifically gets the thought that, "Oh my God, no one's

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.920
 ever going to see me again."

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.840
 And once he comes to that conclusion, once he comes to the conclusion, no one will ever

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.040
 find me again.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:52.200
 He actually makes an audible gasp, and the figures turn to face him.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.840
 He said, "One of them began running straight towards me, straight towards the tunnel I

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.840
 was in."

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.440
 And he goes, "Listen, it looked human."

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.960
 I'm not going to say that they were some sort of alien or monster, but they looked

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.840
 human, which is a very interesting wiggle word, right?

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.920
 It's like his soul, it's like his senses were telling them they're not human.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.080
 They may look human, but they're not human.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.600
 He said, "This one that's running towards me seems to be holding some sort of long object."

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:34.120
 He compared it to a staff or a spear, and he said this man was wearing a ceremonial

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.120
 headdress.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.960
 He goes, "The best I can compare it to is a stereotypical headdress of a Native American."

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.160
 He goes, "I'm watching this guy run towards me.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.360
 He's angry.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.360
 He's running towards me.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.360
 I'm standing in this tunnel.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.200
 I turn and I run as fast as I can.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:57.080
 I get to that first clearing, and then I realize that it's a 40-foot ascent, right?

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.040
 Up this slide, up this slope, and that tunnel is smaller.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.800
 It's full of thorns.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:11.520
 This young boy with no shirt begins to run up this slope as best as he can, squatting

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.520
 when he can.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:20.320
 But the bramble is scratching him, poking him, cutting him, leaving thin rivers of blood

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.040
 dripping out of the wounds across his body.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.040
 He finally gets to the top of the tunnel, bursts out of the clearing, and at this point he's

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:35.280
 standing on the top of this sand dune, and he sees an older couple walking down on the

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.520
 beach.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:44.400
 Now, he feels like this pursuer, the king of the forts, is right behind him.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.280
 He doesn't turn to look.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:51.800
 He just begins to run down the sand dune, screaming at the top of his lungs, waving his hands,

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.760
 looking for any sort of help.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.520
 This is like, "You're at the beach, and you'll change viewpoint.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.400
 You're at the beach with your lovely wife."

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:06.200
 And all of a sudden, a bloody eight-year-old boy comes bursting out of the bushes, running

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:14.840
 and probably rolling down a sand dune, screaming about something, was chasing him.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.480
 What he figured, he goes, "I..."

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.840
 The way that I was so scared, the way that everything was going on, he goes, "Realistically,

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.080
 I was in the bushes for about five minutes."

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.480
 But the whole ordeal felt like it took a half hour.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:37.080
 I know I wasn't in there for a half hour, but that was a level of fear that I hadn't

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.840
 ever come across.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:45.640
 You're being pursued by something in an area you're not familiar with, running up the slope,

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.400
 all getting cut up, something like that.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.400
 You know, it's the theory of relativity, but your hot hand on the stove, a second feels

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.960
 like a minute.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:02.040
 Certainly he's reunited with his parents.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.520
 They are furious.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.520
 Furious.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:11.400
 He'd been missing for almost three hours.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.640
 You know, he left them.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.040
 Like he always does, he goes off on these little exploring adventures.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.040
 It took him a while to realize that he hadn't come back.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.280
 It's been a little bit longer.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.760
 They're vacationing in this area.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.760
 He doesn't know the environment.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.000
 Once they started looking for him, they began walking up and down the beach, looking for

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 him.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.080
 For over two hours, the search continued until finally they found each other.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.280
 When he told his parents what happened about the bush, about the man, they don't believe

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.280
 him.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:48.000
 They 100% thought he was making it up because he knew he was in trouble for being gone so

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 long.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 He couldn't figure that out.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.280
 He was only gone for five minutes.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.600
 He knew it wasn't that.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.720
 I knew it definitely wasn't a couple hours.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.520
 He said it felt like 30 minutes.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.160
 I think it was really only five minutes.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.280
 They were telling me I was gone for hours.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.440
 That's not how it happened.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:09.400
 He goes, "I just don't really know what to make of this whole experience."

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.640
 This happened back in 2002.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.520
 He's posting about it 20 years later.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.800
 He goes, "I really just don't know what to think about the whole thing."

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800
 It happened.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.520
 It was real.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.600
 But what was it?

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:27.520
 He goes, "I've even been back to Martha's Vineyard multiple times since."

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520
 Couldn't find the claring.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.520
 Couldn't find the tunnel.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.920
 Couldn't find him.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.120
 Such an interesting story.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.000
 A lot of people online when they were talking about this trying to tell sweaty, maybe it

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.920
 was the Faye.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.000
 Maybe it was this fairy, "I don't like the Faye stuff.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.200
 I just think it's kind of boring."

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.800
 The Faye, they're abducting children.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.480
 They're holding spears and chasing children through the bushes.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.480
 "I'm all boring.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.960
 I have a bunch of tight-up kids.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.480
 I was like, 'Ah, if you guys were abducted by aliens, then I'd save you.'

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480
 Faye."

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.480
 Right?

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.480
 People are saying maybe it was the Faye.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.480
 I think they're only getting that because those dummies live in bushes too.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.200
 Some people thought they could have actually been humans, like actual Native Americans still

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:18.160
 living in the bushes around Martha's Vineyard, which actually sounds less plausible than

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160
 the Faye.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.160
 I did an episode a long time ago.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:25.760
 I don't remember what episode it was, but I do think there probably is America so big.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:31.000
 There might be one or two lost tribes in America that we've just never stumbled across.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.800
 I actually think I said there might be a lost group of pilgrims somewhere in the middle

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:42.800
 of the United States, like a straight-up little house on the prairie town of maybe like 23

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:48.400
 people or whatever, in the middle of some godforsaken wilderness.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.920
 They were just fine, right?

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.640
 But we don't know that they're there.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.040
 There's places in America that have never been explored.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:02.600
 But Martha's Vineyard, right on the coastline, it's less likely that it would be in a tourist

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.320
 destination like Martha's Vineyard.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.320
 But possible, right?

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.320
 Could have been humans.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.160
 But remember, he wasn't describing them as humans.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.160
 They were human-like.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.600
 They were "people."

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.360
 Inner-dimensional, maybe?

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.880
 Maybe they were people, but it was some sort of time distortion.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.920
 The fact of that, let's say that it was some sort of like he traveled back in time.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:33.320
 The fact that the bushes were kind of like the tunnel was made into the bushes, that,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.520
 even I don't know how to classify this.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.120
 Because if it was a time travel thing, he would have just walked around the corner and

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.440
 saw a bunch of Native Americans standing there and they're like, "Hey, what's up?"

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.280
 And then they chase it with the spear.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.320
 The fact that it was a tunnel, it was almost like it was leading him down this passageway,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.320
 right?

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.720
 It was almost like a hidden gateway into some place he shouldn't be.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.720
 You're like, "Yeah, Jason, the fairies do that.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.160
 I don't want to talk about fairies, man.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.200
 I don't think it's fairies."

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.200
 What?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.200
 Some sort of nature spirit that has wings?

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.200
 They have little wands and stuff like that and they grant wishes.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200
 "Forget the fairies.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200
 Forget the fairies.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200
 Forget the fairies.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200
 Forget the fairies."

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.200
 Could be...

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.200
 Here's the thing.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.200
 I'll tell you exactly this.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.200
 When I read the story the very first time, I thought...

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:29.800
 The first thing that popped into my head was they were real people and it was a cult.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.600
 It was like a Mithras cult.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:38.720
 It was like this old religion that's been long wiped from the history books, but yet

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.920
 people still worship this deity.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.920
 That's what I...

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.120
 That was the feeling I got from it right away.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.400
 Was that they were people.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:51.240
 Like, the fact that he was having things like a blurry memory, the fact that he didn't actually

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.640
 say they were human.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.440
 A lot of that stuff, I chalk up to him being eight, right?

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.760
 And being terrified.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.760
 I was reading it.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.520
 I said, "Let's look at it rationally."

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.520
 Right?

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.520
 Martha's Vineyard.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.360
 A bunch of rich people.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:18.840
 The elite who worship these old gods, who follow these pagan ways, are having a retreat

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.840
 in the bush.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.840
 Okay, that sounds kind of tough too because everyone's like, "Hey, hey, George Soros, where

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.840
 are you going?"

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.840
 He's like, "I got some business in the bush, isn't there?"

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.320
 "What are you doing?"

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.680
 And then you see this old dude like crawling down.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.680
 He's crawling down.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.680
 He's crawling through the ramble here and...

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.680
 Oh, oh, oh.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680
 People are like, "What?

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.180
 That's super weird."

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:41.080
 I saw a couple of Rothschilds and a couple of Rockefellers going there.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.080
 What?

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.040
 Why is Jeff Bezos taking his shirt off to go down that slide into that bush?

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:52.560
 Okay, so maybe the best place for the elite to meet, to worship an old pagan lord, where

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.680
 he is in a bunch of thorn bushes, straight off of a beach at Martha's Vineyard.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.560
 But that was the first idea that I had.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:07.040
 Was that not that I wanted to see Jeff Bezos with no shirt on, getting scratched up.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.400
 It was that I thought this was human.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.960
 It was some old cult.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.120
 Or old religion, but new followers type of thing.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.240
 That was the feeling I got.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:26.160
 But whether it's something cool, like my idea, like my totally awesome idea that it's a cult,

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:32.440
 or something lame, like the Fae, the point is that it's creepy.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.200
 Because it touches on all of our fears, right?

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:39.680
 The idea that you can go missing at any point, like he thought, "I'll never be seen again."

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.960
 We cover so many stories where people just disappear, missing 4011, that's pretty much

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.800
 all they talk about.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.120
 The idea that you, or one of your loved ones, could walk outside and just never be seen

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.880
 again is terrifying.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.600
 But it also touches on the fear of the other, right?

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.640
 This group holding these secret ceremonies just out of view.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:07.760
 And us normal people who go about our lives, we don't realize that just maybe 500 yards

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:15.880
 underneath us, or 60 feet away in the bushes, or maybe in your own attic, maybe in your own

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.920
 attic, there are these secret rituals going on.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.320
 There's these gatherings, there are these ceremonies taking place.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.000
 They're just completely oblivious to it.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.240
 It's creepy to think that these things may exist, and that this boy came across one of

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.800
 these, and probably did just barely escape.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.240
 This story could have easily ended, well, it wouldn't have been a story, right?

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.240
 We never would have out here on the West Coast.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.000
 Maybe we would have covered a story about a little boy who went missing back in 2002 at

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.240
 Martha's Vineyard, right?

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:56.160
 Maybe it could just be one of many missing persons cases that happen, and everyone but

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.440
 the family and friends of the victim, just forget about it and move on.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:08.200
 Whether the story is paranormal, conspiracy, or true crime, right?

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.040
 It could have been any of those three, or all.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:18.800
 It's still a reminder that as much as we want to believe it, we are not.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.880
 We are not the masters of the domain.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.920
 We are not the rulers of the earth.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:33.280
 We're simply bystanders, participants.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.600
 We don't make the rules.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.720
 We only follow them.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.000
 That is the way of this world.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.880
 Whether we like it or not, you can only hope that if you ever come across a situation where

00:40:51.880 --> 00:41:00.400
 you're confronted by a king of the fort, you also can outrun him.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.600
 Whether it's trying to find your way through a tunnel in a clearing of bushes, or booking

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:13.880
 it down a dark street as shadowy agents follow your every move.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:21.680
 Whether it's standing at a bus stop late at night, and you can sense eyes staring at you

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:29.000
 from the alleyway across the street, or you're simply sleeping in your bed and you have no

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:43.720
 knowledge that some dark cult or some malignant entity has chosen you as its next sacrifice.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.520
 The only thing you can hope for, the only thing any of us can hope for is that when

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:56.440
 our time comes, when we are put in a situation where we are confronted by this type of oppressor,

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.040
 the only thing we can hope for if we're ever put in such a dire circumstance, whether we

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.760
 looked for it or not, whether we went exploring in the bushes or in the safety of our own

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.560
 home.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:34.720
 We can only hope that we survive to tell the tale.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:43:03.120
.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.120
 Meet Zack.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:09.400
 His life balance is anything but balanced, but when he gets on the bike he becomes...

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.920
 Zenzack.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.600
 Zenzack exists outside of time.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.120
 His heartbeat sounds like a mellow drum circle.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.640
 The only notification he hears is the sound of the ocean, so if you want to reach him,

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.360
 talk to the ocean.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:29.320
 Zenzack is so zen because he has 24/7 expert claim service with Geico, which is totally

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.320
 chill.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.320
 Geico Motorcycle.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.720
