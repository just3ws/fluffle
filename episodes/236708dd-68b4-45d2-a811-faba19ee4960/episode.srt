1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
 Put down that bowl of top ramen.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,800
 Tell your mom no seconds on the tuna casserole please, because today we're going to take

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:15,640
 a look at a story of a man who is so bent on revenge he would feed his friends the unthinkable.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,920
 And then we travel to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where a young boy is out playing

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,180
 among the sand dunes.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,120
 Little does he know he's about to see something.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,120
 No modern human was ever meant to discover today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:44,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,880
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,000
 It's pretty much just playing a killing floor for me and doing research for even more episodes

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 for next week.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,480
 But someone who can't wait till next week walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,640
 is one of our long time legacy Patreon supporters.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,400
 Give it up for Sweet Sweet Golden Goo.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
 Woohoo!

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
 Yeah, come on in.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,040
 Sticky sweets from her head to her feet.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
 Sweet Sweet Golden Goo.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,800
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,120
 You guys can't swear the Patreon off, you guys aren't super tasty.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
 That's fine too.

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,880
 Just helps read the word about the show.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,320
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,560
 Now we got a lot of stuff to cover today.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,960
 So let's go ahead and get started.

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
 Sweet Sweet Golden Goo.

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,560
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys for the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,360
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,200
 Fly us all the way out to Quebec.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:52,200
 Specifically, we're headed out to Saint Andy Bellevue in Quebec.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,480
 And we're going to stop by MacDonald College, not MacDonald's University, which sounds

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
 delicious.

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,520
 This story is the opposite of that.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
 It's the most repulsive story that you could positively think of regarding food.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,520
 And we've covered a lot of gross ones.

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,480
 We're at MacDonald College.

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,360
 It's January 1970.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,120
 And we're walking around school and we're in the school cafeteria and they're handing

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,320
 out muffins and jelly and pancakes and stuff, I'm guessing.

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,560
 And we're eating those.

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,800
 And into the cafeteria walks Eric Cranes.

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,560
 He's this 23-year-old student who is currently researching parasiteology, the study of parasites.

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,440
 We're in the middle of taking a bite of a pancake.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,160
 I was like, "Yeah, this is a tough one."

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,080
 Eric Cranes just loves to be around parasites.

48
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,640
 He's hanging around a bunch of people who borrow money and never give him any money back.

49
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,600
 He's like, "Ah, my people."

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,080
 He loves looking through microscopes at tiny little eggs and he probably feeds chickens

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,720
 to snakes and stuff like that.

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,640
 They're like, "Eric, stop doing that.

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,360
 That's not a definition of a parasite."

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,520
 He's like, "Yeah, it's just fun."

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
 Allegedly.

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,840
 I should mention very clearly right now.

57
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,800
 This is all alleged.

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,400
 Eric Cranes goes home.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,400
 Now he's currently sharing a home with four roommates.

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,800
 Now they didn't get along.

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,640
 This part isn't alleged.

62
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
 They did not get along.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,520
 Eric Cranes and his roommates never saw eye to eye.

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,440
 And this all came to a head when one day they're like, "Hey Eric, you owe us back rent."

65
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
 Eric's like, "Listen, man, I'm trying to get the money together.

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,560
 I've already loaned my money off to a bunch of people.

67
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
 They're not paying me back.

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,000
 Parasiteology has gone too far."

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,840
 They're like, "Eric, you've got to pay us the money."

70
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
 This is insane.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,200
 Actually, the thing we're going to get to is super insane.

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,720
 But this also blows my mind.

73
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:47,800
 He owed them $16.66 in back rent.

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,280
 Now let's forget the whole 666 thing, because that's just creepy in and of itself.

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,560
 But they were ready to evict this dude because he was short around $17.

76
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,480
 He was $17 short on his rent and they're like, "Bro, pack your bags.

77
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
 You got to get out of here."

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,960
 Now, they didn't like the guy, right?

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,400
 So they were looking for any reason.

80
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,520
 But apparently there was a lot of debate on this.

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,040
 I found this story online.

82
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,480
 It was posted by a guy named Delano1998.

83
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,760
 He's not a participant in this story.

84
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
 Don't go after him.

85
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,360
 Don't try to seek some parasite justice yourself.

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,280
 He just posted this.

87
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,040
 And a lot of people were debating, "Wow, $17 and he's getting kicked out."

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,640
 Apparently in 1970, Canadian money, that was close to about $130.

89
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,520
 So yeah, I could see if someone's behind $130 and you didn't like them.

90
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,080
 You want to get rid of them.

91
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,760
 So they're like, "Eric, you got to pay the money.

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,280
 You got to pay the money you owed to us."

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,040
 And he's like, "Oh, he's not picking up pennies."

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,040
 He's like, "Oh, now I just need $1,665 more and all my troubles are solved."

95
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,400
 He's getting so upset with these guys.

96
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,800
 Like again, it seems to be a long-brewing thing when they keep on him about paying the

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,000
 rent that he owes, he says, "This might be the most specific threat I've ever heard before.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,040
 Normally, it's like, "I'll get you.

99
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,640
 One of these days, I'll get you."

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,600
 Then you fly away in your car and inspect your gadgets.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,000
 Like, "Oh, save the day once again."

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
 This was his threat.

103
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
 He turned to his roommates.

104
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,720
 They said, "Where's the $16 and 66 cents you owe us?"

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
 He's like, "Ah."

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 He said, "All put parasites in your food and you'll wake up dead."

107
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,720
 That is such a specific threat.

108
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,880
 And it's coming from someone who could do it because he's studying parasitology.

109
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,480
 He has access to parasites.

110
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,560
 If I made that threat to someone, you're like, "Jason, you can barely pronounce the word.

111
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,360
 I doubt you can rummage up more than three or four parasites, which would still be too

112
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,760
 much to be in your food."

113
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,160
 But you're like, "I'm not worried about Jason."

114
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,000
 And I'll be like, "Oh, get you gadget."

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,760
 They're like, "When it's not gadget, just please give me the $17 you owe me and leave."

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,880
 I'm like, "Ah."

117
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
 He owes them money.

118
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,960
 He threatens them by putting parasites in their food.

119
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,320
 What happens is January 31st rolls around and he comes into the house and he's like,

120
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,680
 "Hey, guys, I got big news.

121
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
 Here's $17."

122
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,360
 And they're like, "Oh, yeah.

123
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,800
 We were expecting something better than that, but that's what you owe us.

124
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,880
 You've got to hope so when he said, you know, big news."

125
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,600
 But fine, we'll take the $17.

126
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,840
 He paid them the $17 and yet they evicted them anyways.

127
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
 What crumbums.

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,520
 What he did was threaten to put parasites in your food and you're evicting him.

129
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
 He paid them money.

130
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,080
 They evicted them.

131
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,880
 But let bygones be bygones, right?

132
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,840
 That's the holiday spirit of Quebec because the first week of February, there's a thing

133
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:57,720
 called the Winter Carnival where people dress up like snowmen and they walk around and everyone's

134
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
 going, "Oh, oh, oh."

135
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
 And people are like, "What?

136
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
 It doesn't look like a snowman."

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
 So, no one doesn't say that.

138
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,280
 They're like, "Ah, just go with it.

139
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
 It's Canada.

140
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
 We do weird stuff up here."

141
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,160
 They have this thing called Winter Carnival where they just kind of dance around.

142
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
 Actually, I didn't.

143
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 I didn't research that.

144
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,640
 I didn't research that at all.

145
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,280
 I just go, "Oh, Winter Carnival."

146
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,520
 And then I clicked on Wikipedia and it was like a picture.

147
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,320
 It was just a picture of a man in a snowman suit.

148
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,400
 So, I go, "Ah, that's all the research I need to do on that.

149
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
 Just one photograph."

150
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
 So, I don't know.

151
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
 It could be like some big religious festival.

152
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,560
 I could have pissed off a whole nation.

153
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,040
 Anyways, Winter Carnival and Eric is like, "You know what, guys?

154
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,760
 I was the crumbum this time.

155
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,720
 I should have paid you that $17 when I owed it."

156
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,320
 So I have decided to serve you a feast.

157
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,360
 And he brings in all this food he prepared for Winter Carnival.

158
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680
 Let's stop the story right here.

159
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,480
 And I just, this isn't a Choose Your Own Adventure.

160
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
 This is not a logic question.

161
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,880
 It's not a word problem.

162
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:08,680
 If someone ever threatened to put parasites in your food and then you evicted them, and

163
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,920
 then they show back up a couple of days later with food, would you eat it?

164
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
 But you know what?

165
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
 Maybe it's a holiday spirit.

166
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,760
 Maybe bygones be bygones, right?

167
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
 Old enemies become friends.

168
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,840
 Old people who threaten to feed you parasites become people who don't do that.

169
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,080
 And he brought in all this food and you accept it as a good friend would, right?

170
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,760
 What type of friend would you be if you didn't eat the food of a maniac who threatened to

171
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
 poison you?

172
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,840
 His roommates and apparently like three other people.

173
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,520
 There is a total of seven people that got afflicted by what's about to happen.

174
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,720
 I think you guys can kind of figure it out at this point.

175
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
 But you can't.

176
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,440
 You have no idea what's coming up next.

177
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,920
 This is true story.

178
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,360
 He brings in all this food.

179
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
 They eat it.

180
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,840
 They're like, "Oh, this is delicious."

181
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
 "Oh, no, no."

182
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
 They're like fighting over.

183
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
 They're fighting over the last roll.

184
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
 They're like, "Oh, man.

185
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
 Oh, man."

186
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,840
 And Eric's probably just sitting there with a big old smile.

187
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,240
 They realize it's weird he didn't eat anything.

188
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,920
 He's like, "Oh, I had my winter festival dinner on the way over.

189
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,480
 Go ahead and gorge yourselves on this delicious food."

190
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,840
 About a week later, all of the roommates, all the four roommates, get sick around the

191
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
 same time.

192
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,080
 But you know, it's winter, right?

193
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,240
 pneumonia is going around.

194
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,720
 People get sick.

195
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
 They're coughing.

196
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
 They're losing weight pretty rapidly, right?

197
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,200
 That's usually not a symptom of the flu.

198
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,440
 These four roommates start to develop a fever as well.

199
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,200
 They're sweating, coughing, they're all skinny, though.

200
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
 They're like, "Oh, no.

201
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
 Taking off their freshman 40?

202
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 This is great."

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,400
 But then all four of them, and I'm assuming the other three people showed up for this

204
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
 party.

205
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,200
 I have no idea about the cryptic threat that Eric made.

206
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,960
 They just showed up, but they don't play a lot into this later narrative.

207
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,880
 I'm sure they were also incredibly sick.

208
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,520
 We know about these four roommates cough, weight loss, fever, and then, this is the

209
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,240
 most troubling of all, right?

210
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,040
 You can tank those other three, no problem.

211
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,840
 You're like, "Jason, I don't know why you're so blasé about having high temperature."

212
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,400
 They start to feel, all four of them feel like they can't breathe.

213
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,160
 Now that's frightening.

214
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,160
 But on February 12th, it goes to full on, they can't breathe.

215
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,560
 Like by February 12th, they are actually having a hard time taking a deep breath, and they're

216
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,120
 breaking out in hives.

217
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,680
 So at this point, it's been like two weeks at this point, they go to the hospital, and

218
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,080
 they get in there, and they're in respiratory distress.

219
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,600
 The doctor's like, "Oh, no.

220
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,680
 You guys should have been here a long time ago.

221
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,360
 You guys look terrible, but you've lost a lot of weight.

222
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
 You look like pretty slim guys."

223
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
 They take them in.

224
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,440
 The doctor, the attending physician, brings them in, and is treating them, and they start

225
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,880
 treating them for pneumonia, right?

226
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,240
 They're having trouble breathing, all this other stuff.

227
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,840
 So they start treating them for pneumonia, and nothing is working.

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,240
 And he's like, "Doctor's like, 'Oh, man.

229
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
 I don't know what else to do.

230
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
 I did one thing.

231
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,680
 I tried one thing, and it didn't work out.

232
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,180
 You guys will be fine."

233
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,440
 Two of them end up in critical condition, because they can't breathe.

234
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:26,760
 February 16th, dude is coughing into like a little tray, a little spit tray.

235
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,520
 And the nurse picks it up, and she goes, "Oh, yes.

236
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,320
 This is my favorite part of my job.

237
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,520
 I have a fetish for phlegm."

238
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,000
 She takes the tray of phlegm, and they're looking at it.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,880
 I'm sure, I don't know if they saw this with a naked eye, but what they discovered at this

240
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,680
 point, remember they ate the food on February 1st, or the first week of February.

241
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,960
 It's February 16th now.

242
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:58,320
 They find a worm in the phlegm, and he's coughing up.

243
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,600
 A four millimeter long worm.

244
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,160
 I'm just gonna say how big it was first to imagine a giant earthworm.

245
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
 You're like, "Nope."

246
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
 He set off the podcast.

247
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
 You're like, "I'm done."

248
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,040
 A four millimeter long worm just kind of squiggling around in his phlegm.

249
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,760
 The nurse goes, "Oh, I gotta tell the doctor about this."

250
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,960
 And the doctor's looking at it, and he goes, "Wow.

251
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,360
 Who would have thought that this worm would be inside a human?"

252
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,800
 What they found, what this worm was, was something known as the "ascaris sum."

253
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,160
 It's a round worm found in pigs.

254
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,680
 It lives in pig intestines.

255
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,880
 To giant roundworm, they grow to be about six to twelve inches long.

256
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
 They live in pig intestines.

257
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,880
 And the doctor's like, "You know, we've always had theories about these worms getting into

258
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,160
 humans, right?

259
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,560
 Because maybe if you ate enough pork products, you're eating so many hot dogs, you just

260
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,400
 start eating the life big, you're sucking their intestines up like a string of spaghetti

261
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,360
 and you ate all the eggs."

262
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,280
 So the doctor's like, "But this is still weird.

263
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
 We don't even know if it's possible.

264
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,160
 If it is possible, it's incredibly rare.

265
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160
 How did all these people eat pig intestines?"

266
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,080
 We didn't eat pig intestines, by the way.

267
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,400
 The patients are like, "You know what?

268
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:15,480
 Just to start to make sense, because our roommate worked at a parapsytology lab.

269
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,400
 He threatened to put parasites in our food."

270
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
 And the doctor's like, "Okay, that makes a little more sense."

271
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,680
 They start to do all these tests on the people and these four roommates, and they find the

272
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,280
 life cycle of this roundworm in these four dudes.

273
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,420
 What happens is there's microscopic eggs in their bloodstream that float out of the

274
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:42,280
 intestines into the bloodstream and then go into the lung.

275
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,680
 That's why they were having such trouble breathing.

276
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,160
 And part of the life cycle is you would cough up this larva because the egg hatches in

277
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,920
 your lungs, so now you've got this little worm in you and then you would cough it up

278
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,520
 along with all the other phlegm and sputum.

279
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
 Right?

280
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
 Apparently that's the thing.

281
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,960
 I think it's just a fancy word for phlegm, but I think it's like bloody phlegm.

282
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,540
 Like Jason, please, please just quit giving the visuals.

283
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,540
 They're coughing up these little worms, these little immature worms, and they climb up the

284
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,580
 trachea and then you swallow them back down and they go back into your stomach where they

285
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,700
 become mature worms.

286
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,860
 Out of your intestines, into your blood, into your lungs, coughing out of your lungs back

287
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
 into your stomach.

288
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,100
 The worms journey is complete.

289
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,880
 So what they did was they go, "We got to get rid of these worms," even though this

290
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,680
 is kind of cool scientifically.

291
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,080
 We got to get rid of the worms.

292
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,120
 The attending physicians started them on this treatment that's used to kill this type of

293
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,880
 parasite.

294
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,480
 Pretty much ends the infestation right there.

295
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,600
 But they have like, you figure, okay Jason, they have a couple worms.

296
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,840
 Big deal, big deal.

297
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,560
 They have a couple worms in them.

298
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:02,300
 One of the dudes was full of at least, at least, they probably lost count after a certain point.

299
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:12,340
 He had at least 400,000 larvae inside of him.

300
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,340
 400,000 wriggling little worms crawling through his body.

301
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,340
 He's only tickled all the time.

302
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,500
 He's like, "I didn't know it would be so fun."

303
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 Trying to throw him up.

304
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,000
 Dude, it was just coming out of his bowel movements.

305
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Just worms.

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 He's going poop.

307
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 A bunch of worms are coming out.

308
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,880
 I would rather be tickled by 400,000 worms than to have one worm come out of my butthole.

309
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,600
 The doctor said, "This is real serious."

310
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,880
 He goes, "One of these guys, one of these patients, he's going to have permanent lung

311
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
 damage."

312
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,600
 Like, these worms did such a number on him that he's going to have lung damage for the

313
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
 rest of his life.

314
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,340
 Eric, after the roommates and the friends started getting sick, he left Quebec.

315
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,340
 He ditched the place.

316
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,340
 He's like, "I'm done."

317
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:04,100
 And once his scheme was undone, right, once they figured out what had happened, they

318
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,780
 actually set out in a arrest warrant for attempted murder.

319
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,100
 On March 9th, 1970, he surrendered himself and they let him out on bail.

320
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,620
 They figured, you know, what's the worst he can do?

321
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,220
 What's the worst this guy can do?

322
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
 The supervillain.

323
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,960
 He can just infest the world with parasites.

324
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,200
 They let him out on bail.

325
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,120
 June 1971 is when the trial took place.

326
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,660
 And the prosecution was like, what evidence, what possible evidence do you need?

327
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,060
 He worked at a parapsytology lab.

328
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,580
 He had access to parasites.

329
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,640
 He threatened to give people parasites.

330
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,680
 People he didn't like had parasites.

331
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,600
 And here's a bunch of photos.

332
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,800
 X-rays of him boogying down in his dude's stomach.

333
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,320
 Case closed.

334
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,360
 Like who else could possibly do this?

335
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,860
 Now his defense lawyer said, "Your Honor, parasites, schmericides."

336
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,420
 He totally blew off the whole thing.

337
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,140
 He goes, "Listen, sure my client worked at a parasite lab, but who knows where they

338
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,140
 got these parasites?"

339
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,260
 It turns out that their kitchen sink was constantly full of sewage for some reason.

340
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,580
 I know college life was hard, but that's what the defense lawyer said.

341
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,600
 And the other roommates were like, "No, that's not true.

342
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 That's not true."

343
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
 They're like, "Shift from side to side."

344
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
 They're like, "Okay, it's a little true."

345
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,360
 But there wasn't so much sewage in our sink that we got parasites.

346
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,440
 And the defense lawyer was like, "Mm-hmm."

347
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,360
 And then the defense lawyer goes, "Okay, well maybe it's not the sewage theory.

348
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,520
 However, yes, my client did work at a parapsytology lab.

349
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,120
 But this could happen accidentally.

350
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,180
 You see, my client may have gotten some eggs on his clothes.

351
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,220
 Some microscopic eggs, you wouldn't even see him, right?

352
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,060
 He's walking around the lab in his blue jeans and his polo and a couple of roundworm eggs

353
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,980
 end up all over his clothes.

354
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,780
 It happens to the vestibulus.

355
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,580
 And then his roommates, maybe when they were kicking him out, I don't know, maybe they

356
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,860
 were going through his clothes.

357
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,300
 Maybe they were packing his bags for him.

358
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,820
 Who am I to say?

359
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,040
 It's possible that this guy who threatened to put eggs in people's food didn't actually

360
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
 do it.

361
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,360
 It was an accident from them handling his clothes.

362
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,520
 And Eric won the case.

363
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,160
 Eric was acquitted of this crime.

364
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,360
 He served no jail time for poisoning seven people.

365
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,640
 Some times they wrap up these true crime stories with some sort of lesson to be learned or

366
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,320
 some sort of look at the justice system and how corrupt it can be and how they can miss

367
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
 the mark.

368
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,300
 I don't know if there's anything like this.

369
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:47,860
 I think the moral of this story is if somebody ever threatens to poison you with parasites,

370
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,020
 do not eat their food.

371
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:58,100
 The fact that he got off is it should be shocking, but Canadian justice system is just awful.

372
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,700
 And this guy's still out there, right?

373
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,500
 He was 23 in 1970.

374
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 So that would make him.

375
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,980
 You're like, "Oh, great, Jason's going to try to do math."

376
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,560
 This is how I do math.

377
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,080
 They go 70 plus 90 is 20.

378
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,840
 So then he'd be 43 in 1990.

379
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,920
 And then he'd be 53 in 2000.

380
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,120
 This is really how I do math.

381
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,240
 This guy would be 75 years old now.

382
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,200
 He could still be out there.

383
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,360
 He could still be out there.

384
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
 He could be working at a local restaurant.

385
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
 You're at right now.

386
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,440
 Listen, it's at the spot, guys.

387
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,920
 You're still eating your noodles.

388
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,420
 I told you not to and then you look over and you see in the kitchen, there's a man standing

389
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:43,140
 there with a glimmer in his eye and a parasite coming out of his other eye.

390
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,700
 This guy's probably dead point now.

391
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,580
 This guy's messing around with parasites.

392
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,140
 This guy's constantly juggling roundworm eggs.

393
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,860
 He probably infested himself at some point, but it's crazy, bizarre, true crime story

394
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,740
 and absolutely disgusting and lesson or not, whether or not there's there's a moral to

395
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,260
 what I just wanted to share it with you.

396
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,480
 Great sweet golden goo.

397
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,760
 Grab that barf bag, get it over with, and I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbon

398
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,920
 acopter.

399
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,960
 We're leaving behind Quebec.

400
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,160
 We're headed all the way out to Martha's Vineyard.

401
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,280
 The year is 2002.

402
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,480
 It's a beautiful summer and we're spending it in Martha's Vineyard.

403
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,320
 Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.

404
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,100
 Now the story was posted online by someone going by the name, "You're doing great sweaty."

405
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,460
 I think they might have misspelled, sweetie.

406
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,460
 You're doing great sweaty.

407
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,900
 We're going to go ahead and call this dude Samuel.

408
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
 He tells a story.

409
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,060
 This actually happened back when he was between the ages of eight and 10, back in the year

410
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,060
 2002.

411
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,220
 He goes, "Listen, I've never told this story before.

412
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,380
 I've never told it to anybody except for my parents because they were there and they

413
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,400
 wanted answers."

414
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:05,880
 Back in 2002, Samuel's family, mom, dad, and him, took a vacation out to Martha's Vineyard.

415
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,560
 And he goes, "Listen, I was an excitable child.

416
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,000
 I was always running around and tugging on people's shirts and picking their pockets.

417
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,800
 I was a regular Aladdin.

418
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,200
 I was constantly wanting to explore nature and my parents were like, "Sure, Sam, go.

419
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
 Go away.

420
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,520
 Go away playing the bushes.

421
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
 Have fun."

422
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,780
 They're somewhere far away from us.

423
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,940
 So they fed into his need to explore.

424
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,780
 So when they went to Martha's Vineyard, they're actually on the beach.

425
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,500
 He believes this is somewhere near the Minimasha Hills Beach.

426
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,380
 They're at the beach just having a good time.

427
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,540
 Everyone's at the beach having a good time.

428
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,460
 It's really hard to be depressed at the beach.

429
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,540
 I mean, maybe you just got stung by jellyfish and you're watching somebody unzip their pants

430
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,740
 ready to pee on you.

431
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,740
 That's probably the most depressed you could be at the beach.

432
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,660
 But little Sam, he's running around.

433
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,560
 "Oh yeah, this is so much fun."

434
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,360
 And he sees there's this tall series of rocks that some of the teens are climbing up and

435
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,160
 jumping off the rocks into the water.

436
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,840
 And he's like, "Wow, that looks fun, but even being a little eight-year-old, I know that's

437
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,200
 extremely dangerous.

438
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,800
 I want to go exploring instead of risking paralyzation."

439
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,920
 So he decides, "I'm going to see what's on the other side of those rocks.

440
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,760
 I'll just go for a little kid journey."

441
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,060
 So he goes over the rocks.

442
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,820
 He's kind of walking along and he says, "I'm probably about a half a mile at this point,

443
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,100
 a half a mile from where my parents and everyone else is.

444
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,140
 I'm kind of alone at this point."

445
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,300
 I see these huge sand dunes.

446
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,980
 Now I actually looked, I couldn't find this exact location.

447
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,140
 I tried looking for this exact location on Google Earth, but I was looking at this beach

448
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:49,380
 area and it's interesting because you have beach and then immediately, like it's like

449
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,400
 sand and then heavy greenery.

450
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,200
 It's just like, goes from straight beach to grass.

451
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,000
 In California, it was never like that.

452
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,400
 Like you had the beach, then you had a bunch of rocks that you'd cut your feet on and then

453
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,640
 you had a bunch of paved stuff, usually referred to as a parking lot.

454
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,400
 And then you just had more kind of dusty mountains, kind of rocky mountains and not the rocky mountains,

455
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,280
 but you know, and it was kind of laid out like that, right?

456
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,680
 It was a clear definition between the biomes, but here it's not the case.

457
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,660
 It goes beach, then lush foliage.

458
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,900
 So he's climbing up these huge sand dunes.

459
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,700
 He says they're about 75 to 100 feet tall.

460
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,220
 That might be the exaggeration of an eight-year-old boy, right?

461
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,380
 Or to an eight-year-old, everything may seem that tall, but he's climbing these dunes and

462
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,700
 he gets up on the top one of these dunes and he goes, "I'm going to see if I can see my

463
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
 family.

464
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,860
 I'm going to get at the top of this dune and I'm going to see if I can see past the big

465
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
 rocks."

466
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:50,400
 And currently I have the vision of a superhero, see if I can see my family way, way over there.

467
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,520
 See if I can pick out my parents from a half a mile away.

468
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,200
 Now he gets at the top of the hill and he can't really see anyone.

469
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,360
 He can't see his parents.

470
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360
 He's pretty far away.

471
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,000
 But what he does see at the top of the sand dune, because again, it has this giant lump

472
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,960
 in the earth right next to it.

473
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,360
 Like, it's literally like in the sand, they're like budding up against each other, are these

474
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,940
 huge bushes?

475
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:22,660
 And he turns and he looks and in one of the bushes is a cave.

476
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,740
 Now not like the bush was on a mountain hiding a cave.

477
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:33,380
 He said, "It looked like someone actually cut a tunnel through a bush."

478
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,740
 He's sitting there and he's looking at him.

479
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
 He goes, "That's pretty weird.

480
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,300
 I've never seen anything like this before.

481
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:45,640
 It looks like someone actually took the time to bore a passageway through this bush."

482
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,360
 And as a young adventurer, he knew that he had to see what was going on.

483
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,840
 So he starts kind of squatting down and walking through this bush.

484
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,480
 It apparently is like a thorn bush.

485
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,520
 And this kid doesn't have his shirt.

486
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,000
 So he's being super careful.

487
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,320
 He's not throwing his arms up and going, "Wee, wee!"

488
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,280
 He's got to keep it up close to his body and kind of squatting through.

489
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,140
 And he's walking and then he sees a slide.

490
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,420
 Not an actual metal slide, but the earth again looks like it's been formatted as some sort

491
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,260
 of slope.

492
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:26,460
 Totally man-made.

493
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,580
 Begins to crouch through it and go down this slide.

494
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,060
 He said it had to be about 40 feet going down.

495
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:37,560
 40 feet, you know, gradual slope.

496
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,880
 And when he gets to the bottom of that, he is now standing in a clearing.

497
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,920
 There's greenery all around him.

498
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:50,400
 Now he's left the beach, which again is only maybe about 40 feet away.

499
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,280
 And he's in this lush greenery.

500
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,880
 And he says this was, again, it was a clearing.

501
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,840
 I'm standing in this clearing, but everything else was covered by plant life, including

502
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
 the sky.

503
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,840
 There is the canopy of bushes and vines, maybe not vines.

504
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,880
 He didn't specify vines, he didn't magically get transported to the Lost City of Gold in

505
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,000
 the Yucatan or anything.

506
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,920
 But he says, "Even the sky was blocked out by the greenery."

507
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:24,480
 And I'm looking around and it felt like someone had made a home inside of a giant bush.

508
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,160
 He sees another tunnel leading away from this clearing and he walks down that.

509
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,920
 And at that point he begins to hear voices.

510
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,040
 Can't tell what they're saying.

511
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,760
 Can kind of tell where they're coming from.

512
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:44,120
 It sounds like they're coming from the end of this tunnel, but his curiosity is peaked.

513
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,480
 He's a young boy who goes on adventures all the time.

514
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,160
 He wants to see, he goes, "I wanted to meet the King of the Fort."

515
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,680
 Like to him this was some sort of place, some hidden habitat.

516
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,920
 And there had to be a King and he was going to meet him, he was going to have so much

517
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,240
 fun with his new friends.

518
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,200
 So he's walking through this tunnel that's built into this foliage.

519
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,800
 And as he's getting towards the end of it, he sees another clearing, a larger clearing,

520
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,000
 and he sees what he describes as a campfire.

521
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,480
 But he goes, "I can't really say that I saw flames.

522
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,840
 What I saw was a white, yellow, orange light in this clearing.

523
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:40,480
 I assumed it was a campfire, but at this point he says his recollection begins to become blurry.

524
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,120
 He has a hard time remembering super concrete details, but this is what he does remember.

525
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,620
 He's looking through this tunnel, he sees the other clearing, and what he sees around

526
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,200
 it is a group of figures.

527
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,800
 A group of, he doesn't like using the word "people" to describe them.

528
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,840
 He kept putting people in air quotes or real quotes because it's typed out, but he wasn't

529
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,400
 comfortable using the word "people."

530
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,240
 They seemed like something else to him.

531
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,560
 And at this point is when he begins to feel fear.

532
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,920
 He was totally enthusiastic about meeting the King of the Fort until he gets a glimpse

533
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,360
 of who is in the clearing.

534
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,480
 Just a fleeting glimpse, right?

535
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,000
 Again, he can't specifically say they were human, but this is when fear begins to overtake

536
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 him.

537
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,200
 He starts to become terrified and specifically gets the thought that, "Oh my God, no one's

538
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,920
 ever going to see me again."

539
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,840
 And once he comes to that conclusion, once he comes to the conclusion, no one will ever

540
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,040
 find me again.

541
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:52,200
 He actually makes an audible gasp, and the figures turn to face him.

542
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,840
 He said, "One of them began running straight towards me, straight towards the tunnel I

543
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
 was in."

544
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,440
 And he goes, "Listen, it looked human."

545
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,960
 I'm not going to say that they were some sort of alien or monster, but they looked

546
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,840
 human, which is a very interesting wiggle word, right?

547
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,920
 It's like his soul, it's like his senses were telling them they're not human.

548
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,080
 They may look human, but they're not human.

549
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,600
 He said, "This one that's running towards me seems to be holding some sort of long object."

550
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:34,120
 He compared it to a staff or a spear, and he said this man was wearing a ceremonial

551
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
 headdress.

552
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,960
 He goes, "The best I can compare it to is a stereotypical headdress of a Native American."

553
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,160
 He goes, "I'm watching this guy run towards me.

554
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,360
 He's angry.

555
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
 He's running towards me.

556
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,360
 I'm standing in this tunnel.

557
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,200
 I turn and I run as fast as I can.

558
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:57,080
 I get to that first clearing, and then I realize that it's a 40-foot ascent, right?

559
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,040
 Up this slide, up this slope, and that tunnel is smaller.

560
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,800
 It's full of thorns.

561
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:11,520
 This young boy with no shirt begins to run up this slope as best as he can, squatting

562
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 when he can.

563
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:20,320
 But the bramble is scratching him, poking him, cutting him, leaving thin rivers of blood

564
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,040
 dripping out of the wounds across his body.

565
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,040
 He finally gets to the top of the tunnel, bursts out of the clearing, and at this point he's

566
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:35,280
 standing on the top of this sand dune, and he sees an older couple walking down on the

567
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,520
 beach.

568
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:44,400
 Now, he feels like this pursuer, the king of the forts, is right behind him.

569
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,280
 He doesn't turn to look.

570
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,800
 He just begins to run down the sand dune, screaming at the top of his lungs, waving his hands,

571
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,760
 looking for any sort of help.

572
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,520
 This is like, "You're at the beach, and you'll change viewpoint.

573
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,400
 You're at the beach with your lovely wife."

574
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,200
 And all of a sudden, a bloody eight-year-old boy comes bursting out of the bushes, running

575
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:14,840
 and probably rolling down a sand dune, screaming about something, was chasing him.

576
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,480
 What he figured, he goes, "I..."

577
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,840
 The way that I was so scared, the way that everything was going on, he goes, "Realistically,

578
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,080
 I was in the bushes for about five minutes."

579
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,480
 But the whole ordeal felt like it took a half hour.

580
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,080
 I know I wasn't in there for a half hour, but that was a level of fear that I hadn't

581
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,840
 ever come across.

582
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,640
 You're being pursued by something in an area you're not familiar with, running up the slope,

583
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,400
 all getting cut up, something like that.

584
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,400
 You know, it's the theory of relativity, but your hot hand on the stove, a second feels

585
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,960
 like a minute.

586
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,040
 Certainly he's reunited with his parents.

587
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,520
 They are furious.

588
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
 Furious.

589
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,400
 He'd been missing for almost three hours.

590
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,640
 You know, he left them.

591
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,040
 Like he always does, he goes off on these little exploring adventures.

592
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,040
 It took him a while to realize that he hadn't come back.

593
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,280
 It's been a little bit longer.

594
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,760
 They're vacationing in this area.

595
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
 He doesn't know the environment.

596
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,000
 Once they started looking for him, they began walking up and down the beach, looking for

597
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 him.

598
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,080
 For over two hours, the search continued until finally they found each other.

599
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,280
 When he told his parents what happened about the bush, about the man, they don't believe

600
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
 him.

601
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,000
 They 100% thought he was making it up because he knew he was in trouble for being gone so

602
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 long.

603
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 He couldn't figure that out.

604
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,280
 He was only gone for five minutes.

605
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,600
 He knew it wasn't that.

606
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,720
 I knew it definitely wasn't a couple hours.

607
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,520
 He said it felt like 30 minutes.

608
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,160
 I think it was really only five minutes.

609
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,280
 They were telling me I was gone for hours.

610
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,440
 That's not how it happened.

611
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,400
 He goes, "I just don't really know what to make of this whole experience."

612
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,640
 This happened back in 2002.

613
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,520
 He's posting about it 20 years later.

614
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,800
 He goes, "I really just don't know what to think about the whole thing."

615
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
 It happened.

616
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,520
 It was real.

617
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,600
 But what was it?

618
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:27,520
 He goes, "I've even been back to Martha's Vineyard multiple times since."

619
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
 Couldn't find the claring.

620
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
 Couldn't find the tunnel.

621
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,920
 Couldn't find him.

622
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,120
 Such an interesting story.

623
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,000
 A lot of people online when they were talking about this trying to tell sweaty, maybe it

624
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,920
 was the Faye.

625
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,000
 Maybe it was this fairy, "I don't like the Faye stuff.

626
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,200
 I just think it's kind of boring."

627
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,800
 The Faye, they're abducting children.

628
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,480
 They're holding spears and chasing children through the bushes.

629
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
 "I'm all boring.

630
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,960
 I have a bunch of tight-up kids.

631
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,480
 I was like, 'Ah, if you guys were abducted by aliens, then I'd save you.'

632
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
 Faye."

633
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
 Right?

634
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
 People are saying maybe it was the Faye.

635
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,480
 I think they're only getting that because those dummies live in bushes too.

636
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,200
 Some people thought they could have actually been humans, like actual Native Americans still

637
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:18,160
 living in the bushes around Martha's Vineyard, which actually sounds less plausible than

638
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
 the Faye.

639
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
 I did an episode a long time ago.

640
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,760
 I don't remember what episode it was, but I do think there probably is America so big.

641
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,000
 There might be one or two lost tribes in America that we've just never stumbled across.

642
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,800
 I actually think I said there might be a lost group of pilgrims somewhere in the middle

643
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,800
 of the United States, like a straight-up little house on the prairie town of maybe like 23

644
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,400
 people or whatever, in the middle of some godforsaken wilderness.

645
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,920
 They were just fine, right?

646
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,640
 But we don't know that they're there.

647
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,040
 There's places in America that have never been explored.

648
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:02,600
 But Martha's Vineyard, right on the coastline, it's less likely that it would be in a tourist

649
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,320
 destination like Martha's Vineyard.

650
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
 But possible, right?

651
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
 Could have been humans.

652
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,160
 But remember, he wasn't describing them as humans.

653
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
 They were human-like.

654
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,600
 They were "people."

655
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,360
 Inner-dimensional, maybe?

656
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,880
 Maybe they were people, but it was some sort of time distortion.

657
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,920
 The fact of that, let's say that it was some sort of like he traveled back in time.

658
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,320
 The fact that the bushes were kind of like the tunnel was made into the bushes, that,

659
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,520
 even I don't know how to classify this.

660
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,120
 Because if it was a time travel thing, he would have just walked around the corner and

661
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,440
 saw a bunch of Native Americans standing there and they're like, "Hey, what's up?"

662
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,280
 And then they chase it with the spear.

663
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,320
 The fact that it was a tunnel, it was almost like it was leading him down this passageway,

664
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
 right?

665
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,720
 It was almost like a hidden gateway into some place he shouldn't be.

666
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,720
 You're like, "Yeah, Jason, the fairies do that.

667
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,160
 I don't want to talk about fairies, man.

668
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,200
 I don't think it's fairies."

669
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,200
 What?

670
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,200
 Some sort of nature spirit that has wings?

671
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
 They have little wands and stuff like that and they grant wishes.

672
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
 "Forget the fairies.

673
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
 Forget the fairies.

674
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
 Forget the fairies.

675
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
 Forget the fairies."

676
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
 Could be...

677
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
 Here's the thing.

678
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
 I'll tell you exactly this.

679
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
 When I read the story the very first time, I thought...

680
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,800
 The first thing that popped into my head was they were real people and it was a cult.

681
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,600
 It was like a Mithras cult.

682
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:38,720
 It was like this old religion that's been long wiped from the history books, but yet

683
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,920
 people still worship this deity.

684
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
 That's what I...

685
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,120
 That was the feeling I got from it right away.

686
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,400
 Was that they were people.

687
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,240
 Like, the fact that he was having things like a blurry memory, the fact that he didn't actually

688
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,640
 say they were human.

689
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,440
 A lot of that stuff, I chalk up to him being eight, right?

690
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,760
 And being terrified.

691
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
 I was reading it.

692
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,520
 I said, "Let's look at it rationally."

693
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
 Right?

694
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
 Martha's Vineyard.

695
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,360
 A bunch of rich people.

696
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:18,840
 The elite who worship these old gods, who follow these pagan ways, are having a retreat

697
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
 in the bush.

698
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,840
 Okay, that sounds kind of tough too because everyone's like, "Hey, hey, George Soros, where

699
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
 are you going?"

700
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
 He's like, "I got some business in the bush, isn't there?"

701
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,320
 "What are you doing?"

702
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,680
 And then you see this old dude like crawling down.

703
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
 He's crawling down.

704
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
 He's crawling through the ramble here and...

705
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
 Oh, oh, oh.

706
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,680
 People are like, "What?

707
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,180
 That's super weird."

708
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,080
 I saw a couple of Rothschilds and a couple of Rockefellers going there.

709
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
 What?

710
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,040
 Why is Jeff Bezos taking his shirt off to go down that slide into that bush?

711
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,560
 Okay, so maybe the best place for the elite to meet, to worship an old pagan lord, where

712
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,680
 he is in a bunch of thorn bushes, straight off of a beach at Martha's Vineyard.

713
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,560
 But that was the first idea that I had.

714
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:07,040
 Was that not that I wanted to see Jeff Bezos with no shirt on, getting scratched up.

715
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,400
 It was that I thought this was human.

716
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,960
 It was some old cult.

717
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,120
 Or old religion, but new followers type of thing.

718
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,240
 That was the feeling I got.

719
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:26,160
 But whether it's something cool, like my idea, like my totally awesome idea that it's a cult,

720
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,440
 or something lame, like the Fae, the point is that it's creepy.

721
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,200
 Because it touches on all of our fears, right?

722
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,680
 The idea that you can go missing at any point, like he thought, "I'll never be seen again."

723
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,960
 We cover so many stories where people just disappear, missing 4011, that's pretty much

724
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,800
 all they talk about.

725
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,120
 The idea that you, or one of your loved ones, could walk outside and just never be seen

726
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,880
 again is terrifying.

727
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,600
 But it also touches on the fear of the other, right?

728
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,640
 This group holding these secret ceremonies just out of view.

729
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,760
 And us normal people who go about our lives, we don't realize that just maybe 500 yards

730
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,880
 underneath us, or 60 feet away in the bushes, or maybe in your own attic, maybe in your own

731
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,920
 attic, there are these secret rituals going on.

732
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,320
 There's these gatherings, there are these ceremonies taking place.

733
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,000
 They're just completely oblivious to it.

734
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,240
 It's creepy to think that these things may exist, and that this boy came across one of

735
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,800
 these, and probably did just barely escape.

736
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,240
 This story could have easily ended, well, it wouldn't have been a story, right?

737
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,240
 We never would have out here on the West Coast.

738
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,000
 Maybe we would have covered a story about a little boy who went missing back in 2002 at

739
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,240
 Martha's Vineyard, right?

740
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:56,160
 Maybe it could just be one of many missing persons cases that happen, and everyone but

741
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,440
 the family and friends of the victim, just forget about it and move on.

742
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:08,200
 Whether the story is paranormal, conspiracy, or true crime, right?

743
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,040
 It could have been any of those three, or all.

744
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:18,800
 It's still a reminder that as much as we want to believe it, we are not.

745
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,880
 We are not the masters of the domain.

746
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,920
 We are not the rulers of the earth.

747
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:33,280
 We're simply bystanders, participants.

748
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,600
 We don't make the rules.

749
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,720
 We only follow them.

750
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,000
 That is the way of this world.

751
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,880
 Whether we like it or not, you can only hope that if you ever come across a situation where

752
00:40:51,880 --> 00:41:00,400
 you're confronted by a king of the fort, you also can outrun him.

753
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,600
 Whether it's trying to find your way through a tunnel in a clearing of bushes, or booking

754
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:13,880
 it down a dark street as shadowy agents follow your every move.

755
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:21,680
 Whether it's standing at a bus stop late at night, and you can sense eyes staring at you

756
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:29,000
 from the alleyway across the street, or you're simply sleeping in your bed and you have no

757
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:43,720
 knowledge that some dark cult or some malignant entity has chosen you as its next sacrifice.

758
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,520
 The only thing you can hope for, the only thing any of us can hope for is that when

759
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:56,440
 our time comes, when we are put in a situation where we are confronted by this type of oppressor,

760
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,040
 the only thing we can hope for if we're ever put in such a dire circumstance, whether we

761
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,760
 looked for it or not, whether we went exploring in the bushes or in the safety of our own

762
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,560
 home.

763
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:34,720
 We can only hope that we survive to tell the tale.

764
00:42:34,720 --> 00:43:03,120
.

765
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
 Meet Zack.

766
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:09,400
 His life balance is anything but balanced, but when he gets on the bike he becomes...

767
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,920
 Zenzack.

768
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,600
 Zenzack exists outside of time.

769
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,120
 His heartbeat sounds like a mellow drum circle.

770
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,640
 The only notification he hears is the sound of the ocean, so if you want to reach him,

771
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,360
 talk to the ocean.

772
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,320
 Zenzack is so zen because he has 24/7 expert claim service with Geico, which is totally

773
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,320
 chill.

774
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
 Geico Motorcycle.

775
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,720
 Expert coverage for both your sides.
