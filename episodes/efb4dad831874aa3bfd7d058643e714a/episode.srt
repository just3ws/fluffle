1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,320
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,320
 A man is on the hunt for lizard people

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,320
 living underneath the streets of Los Angeles.

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,000
 And then we take a look at the legend of the guide trash,

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,200
 a black spectral dog, sometimes, it's a shapeshifter,

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,200
 that haunted parts of England for nearly 200 years.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
 Is this dog real?

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
 And by calling it just a dog is a little misleading.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
 It wasn't a dog.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
 There were hundreds of these things today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,080
 Hey, everyone.

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
 I'm having a great day.

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,360
 Just a quick reminder, if you missed yesterday's episode,

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,800
 we will be taking a break at the end of season two.

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,840
 And season two ends on Friday.

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,600
 So we're going to do our Friday episode.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,600
 And then we're going to take a break, and we will be back.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,160
 I don't have my glasses on so I can't see my calendar from here.

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,800
 But I think it's April 22nd, I think.

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,640
 But anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,400
 Now, our first story, we're going to go to sunny, sunny Los

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,480
 Angeles, place of movie stars.

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,000
 I think I've used this intro before,

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,080
 but place of movie stars and sexy, sexy people who don't

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,320
 happen to be movie stars.

42
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,600
 What is it about waitstwaiters?

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,760
 Not waiters.

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,680
 Let me back up here.

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
 What is it about waitresses that is so hot?

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,400
 Like, a lot of times you go in to a restaurant

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,680
 and you'll see some hot women dining there.

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
 But what is it about waitresses that make them so hot?

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,040
 Is there uniforms?

50
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,520
 Is it the fact that they're serving me?

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,800
 I don't know.

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 But waitresses are generally the hottest people in the building.

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,080
 But we're going that long segue side.

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,840
 We're going to sunny, sunny Los Angeles.

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,480
 So let's just walk there.

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,760
 Let's just walk.

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,720
 It's a nice walk from Oregon to California.

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
 We can do it.

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
 The settlers did it.

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,880
 They had horses and wagons.

61
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,280
 But let-- OK, that's enough.

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,080
 That's enough.

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,960
 Let's go to Los Angeles.

64
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,080
 And that is where we are going to explore the mystery of the man

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,720
 who tried to find reptiles underneath the city

66
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
 streets of Los Angeles.

67
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,160
 Back in the year-- imagine you are in the year 1934.

68
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,440
 You pick up a copy of the Los Angeles Times,

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,560
 the esteemed newspaper, the record for the city of Los

70
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,680
 Angeles.

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,840
 And you open it up.

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
 And on the front page, it reads this headline,

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,880
 "Lizard People's Catacomb City."

74
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,360
 You're like, what?

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,080
 Why is this in the front page of the Los Angeles Times?

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,200
 But this was actually an ongoing thing in this city.

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,760
 So what happened was there was this guy named George Warren

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,000
 Schufeld.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,320
 And he thought-- well, he believed.

80
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,120
 He didn't just think it.

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400
 He wasn't like, oh, I got a theory.

82
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,400
 He truly believed that there was a race of ancient humanoid

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,760
 lizards living underneath the city of LA.

84
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,080
 He had heard an old Native American legend

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,520
 from a friend of his.

86
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,800
 So I mean, that's always the best way

87
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,120
 to get your information.

88
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,480
 And he invented this device called a radio x-ray machine.

89
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,040
 So basically, he was taking it around town.

90
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,240
 And he said it was like a ground penetrating radar.

91
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,800
 But radar didn't exist.

92
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,760
 So he was just saying that this is what it does.

93
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
 It's going underneath the ground.

94
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,440
 And it's showing that there's these huge catacombs

95
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,480
 underneath the city.

96
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,440
 Now, nowadays, not only would that not

97
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,200
 be in the front page of the LA Times,

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,040
 that guy would be regarded as a total kook.

99
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,560
 He'd have his own website.

100
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,320
 But he would be regarded as a kook.

101
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,840
 It wouldn't get any mainstream press.

102
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,280
 But back then, people were--

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,800
 he went to the county border supervisors and said,

104
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
 hey, do you mind if I start digging up parts of LA

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,920
 to find the secret catacomb system?

106
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,400
 And they approved it.

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,720
 They said, yeah, sure, dude.

108
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,160
 There's nothing else going on.

109
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,960
 And now, to be fair, Los Angeles wasn't the booming city

110
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,480
 it is today.

111
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,040
 But it was still fairly large.

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,680
 But they gave him permission.

113
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,520
 They said, yeah, we don't want you digging up Hollywood

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,280
 and Vine.

115
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
 But you can dig up in certain areas

116
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,360
 where the business owners give you permission and stuff

117
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,640
 like that.

118
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
 We're totally fine with it.

119
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,760
 The reason why everyone was fine with it--

120
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,120
 and he was kind of going along with it,

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,360
 because George Warren was saying that--

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,600
 this was what he was told-- that a bunch of lizard people

123
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,720
 lived on Earth a long, long time ago.

124
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,400
 And then a bunch of meteorites started coming down.

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,520
 And they ran underground.

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,440
 They had this special chemical that melted rock,

127
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,720
 like hot butter.

128
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
 Hot butter doesn't melt.

129
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,960
 It melt rock like pouring hot water on butter, I guess,

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,120
 is what I was looking for.

131
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,840
 And the county border supervisors, like that analogy,

132
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,440
 makes no sense.

133
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,080
 And he's like, no, no, no, just go with it.

134
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,320
 But when they escaped down into the underground--

135
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,880
 and this city wasn't just in LA.

136
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,920
 It stretched all over Arizona and into Mexico

137
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
 and all that stuff.

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,560
 He said when they escaped, they took a bunch of gold with them.

139
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,360
 So everyone's like, oh, gold.

140
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,280
 Now I'm interested.

141
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,800
 Now I'll approve your digging procedure.

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,240
 He had a ton of people working for him.

143
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,600
 He had digging equipment.

144
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,400
 And according to who you believe as far as the record

145
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,520
 keeping goes, he dug between 250 feet down to 1,000 feet

146
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,440
 down looking for this stuff.

147
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,080
 So again, it wasn't a couple of guys out there

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,320
 with shovels and pickaxes.

149
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,640
 These guys were using boring equipment,

150
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,640
 which is actually quite exciting, to dig through the earth deep.

151
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,560
 Even 250 feet down is pretty deep in the middle of a city.

152
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,440
 Now, of course, he didn't find anything, at least that we know

153
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
 of, because if he had found something,

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,200
 then it would be big news, a giant lizard city underneath the city.

155
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
 And there's all this gold everywhere.

156
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,720
 But he ended up coming up empty handed.

157
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,280
 There's been a couple of things from this.

158
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,680
 One, some people think that the story that he heard

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,200
 was mistranslated because it was a Native American story.

160
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,920
 His buddy was Native American.

161
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,120
 There's a guy named Chief Greenleaf, which

162
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,080
 is who I used to buy my weed from.

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,960
 But they think that the story actually

164
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,320
 wasn't about lizard people.

165
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,880
 They think that something was mistranslated.

166
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,440
 And it was actually the story of Lemuria,

167
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,160
 the people leaving the island of Lemuria,

168
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,840
 coming to the continent of America and going underground.

169
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,640
 And that's interesting, because we just

170
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,040
 covered that in the Mount Shasta conspiracy.

171
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,800
 When we talked about the people leaving their island

172
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,240
 and going underground and living under Mount Shasta and having--

173
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,520
 so people say that he may have gotten the lizard part wrong,

174
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,400
 but the old legend of people fleeing from a continent

175
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,440
 because it was undergoing some sort of cataclysm going

176
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,200
 underground into America, that matches up to other legends

177
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
 that were in that area.

178
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,160
 The second thing to come from this story

179
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,280
 is that some people believe that this

180
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,880
 is where the idea of reptilians based on taking over the world

181
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,280
 comes from.

182
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
 They think that this guy may have been inadvertently

183
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,160
 of starting the rumor of shape shifting reptilians,

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,520
 of reptilians trying to dominate the planet,

185
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,120
 of a hidden race of humanoid reptiles.

186
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,560
 And they think that really it may come from this.

187
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,640
 Humanoid-- as far as I can remember,

188
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,120
 humanoid reptiles aren't super common in old school mythology.

189
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,120
 They may be a one off villain popping up here and there.

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,800
 They may be the guys at Hercules like,

191
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,880
 smashes their backs and breaks their spines and stuff like that.

192
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,240
 But overall, you'd have humans with a reptile head

193
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,960
 or talking snakes or creature like dragons.

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,880
 But the idea of an actual human, like a full on human looking

195
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,440
 like a reptile that stands upright like a human walks

196
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,120
 like a human, stuff like that, that's not super common.

197
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,560
 I may be wrong on that.

198
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,440
 And some people may say there is this example.

199
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,600
 There is this example.

200
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,320
 But overall, that's not a real common mythology.

201
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,200
 People who are part reptile, yes.

202
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,480
 Or reptiles with human characteristics, yes.

203
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,960
 But a humanoid reptile is not as common in folklore

204
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,560
 or in religion or myth or however you want to put it.

205
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,760
 So outside of maybe one or two, a few examples out there.

206
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,680
 So they're thinking that this may be why the reptile thing popped up.

207
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,440
 So I mean, some people think because this idea of there's

208
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,920
 a race of humanoid reptilians that are secretly trying

209
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,720
 to take over the planet is fairly recent.

210
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,960
 It had to come from somewhere.

211
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,680
 He was talking about this underground city.

212
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,440
 He never found any proof.

213
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,440
 He swore up and down there's reptiles living underneath LA

214
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,160
 and up and down all over the Southwest.

215
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,520
 This may have been the start of where eventually 80, 90 years

216
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,040
 later you have David Ike writing about shape shifting

217
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,520
 reptilians and tons of reptilians on YouTube.

218
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,120
 Not literally, videos about reptiles on YouTube.

219
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,160
 This may be where it started.

220
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,640
 But the big question I have from this is we know

221
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,960
 that you can find a city and I don't believe in shape shifting

222
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,360
 reptilians taking over the planet.

223
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
 But I do have one huge question about this.

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,040
 In that front page of the LA Times, by the way,

225
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,240
 I have to remind you, in that same edition, the January 29,

226
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,840
 1934 edition of the Los Angeles Times front page,

227
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,880
 right underneath this article saying that there may be reptiles

228
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,840
 living under the city of LA or at least their dead civilization.

229
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,240
 Here's a headline for you.

230
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,400
 Effort to save kite may cost child life.

231
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,080
 Little kid was flying his kite, got caught in a power line,

232
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,640
 went to go get it and got electrocuted.

233
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,600
 And the article in saying the child

234
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,000
 is in critical condition.

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,840
 What?

236
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,160
 Now I'll never know if that kid ever survived.

237
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
 That is a whore of-- that's a cliffhanger.

238
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,040
 I know we didn't find reptiles.

239
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,200
 I find it odd, again, talk about a slow news day in LA

240
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,360
 if that's on your front page.

241
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,040
 Tragic story, not making fun of the kid.

242
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
 Just bizarre that that would be front page news.

243
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
 And it also makes me think they definitely

244
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,440
 was a slow news day if that is on the front page,

245
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,440
 along with some guys digging in your backyard looking

246
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
 for reptile bones.

247
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,880
 But we're going to go ahead and leave LA.

248
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,960
 And I hope that kid's OK.

249
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
 But again, I'll never know.

250
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,120
 I don't think they have a follow up to it.

251
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,120
 I guess I could check the next day of the newspaper, actually.

252
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,840
 But it's daily podcast.

253
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,080
 I got a lot of stuff to do.

254
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,240
 You know, I'm wondering if that was in the newspaper,

255
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,200
 because how long had electricity been around,

256
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,400
 like power lines in cities?

257
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,360
 Maybe like 20 years?

258
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,560
 No, he's probably not the first kid who got his kite stuck

259
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,080
 in a power line.

260
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,960
 OK, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

261
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,200
 Now for the next story.

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,040
 But we leave sunny, sunny Los Angeles.

263
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,920
 You're like, that's weird.

264
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,960
 The auto quality changed.

265
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,760
 Yeah, that's because I recorded those segments

266
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,560
 at different times.

267
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,000
 But we leave sunny, sunny Los Angeles.

268
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,960
 We say goodbye to the beautiful waitresses

269
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,960
 that we met down there that served us so honorably

270
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,640
 and valiantly.

271
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,400
 It's not D-Day.

272
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,360
 They're just giving us food.

273
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,080
 But anyways, now it's off to England.

274
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,240
 That's why I saved the carpenter copter,

275
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,080
 because we really needed-- we can't walk across the ocean.

276
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,800
 As awesome as it would be to walk along the sea floor,

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,840
 we can't do that.

278
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,680
 But we are off to merry old England.

279
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,880
 We go a bit back in time to around--

280
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,600
 we're going to go back to the 18th century.

281
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
 So early 18th century, we're going to go back

282
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,760
 to when this started.

283
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,120
 Hop in the carpenter copter.

284
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,520
 [HUMMING]

285
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,280
 Go back in time.

286
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,560
 And now we're hovering over a little town.

287
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,800
 Now, again, it's Britain.

288
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
 I don't really know how their principalities are set up.

289
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,560
 I don't even know if that's the correct word.

290
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,080
 But we're flying over, let's say, Yorkshire.

291
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,360
 Yorkshire, I think, is a county.

292
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,560
 But anyways, we're flying somewhere over there.

293
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,160
 Hovering.

294
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,400
 We're in stealth mode.

295
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,920
 It's old, timey town beneath us.

296
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,480
 Everything's made of wood and brick.

297
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,240
 And we see the city street below us.

298
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,560
 And it's kind of bustling.

299
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,360
 You know, it's 7 o'clock at night.

300
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,240
 I'm surprised that this many people are out.

301
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,320
 But people are still wandering around the town.

302
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,600
 And you hear some guy go, oh, look over there

303
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
 what your people's going up.

304
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,200
 Look over there.

305
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
 And everyone's like, what's over there, a British dude?

306
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,160
 And he goes, it's a guy trash.

307
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
 And everyone runs away.

308
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,160
 And we're like, what?

309
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,840
 What's a guy trash?

310
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,600
 We're looking around.

311
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,240
 We don't see anything from our angle.

312
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,600
 We don't see anything at all.

313
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,240
 But we do realize something that whatever this thing is,

314
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,880
 they're scared of it.

315
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,040
 You superstitious people are very scared of this thing

316
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
 known as the guy trash.

317
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
 Now, a guy trash.

318
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,160
 This was an interesting one.

319
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,520
 This one was actually a recommendation on Facebook

320
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,080
 from Alexandra.

321
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,320
 Alexandra recommended this to me.

322
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,280
 She's actually in Britain.

323
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,320
 I don't know if she's in Britain right now.

324
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,000
 I don't, if you're listening to this podcast

325
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,080
 three years from now, if you go there looking for her,

326
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
 I don't know if you'll find her there.

327
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,520
 But she sent me this story

328
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,320
 and she sent me an interesting follow up

329
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
 after she sent me the story.

330
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,280
 We'll get to that.

331
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:54,160
 Now, the guy trash is basically your standard devil dog,

332
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,680
 your standard spectral spirit

333
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,200
 in the form of a big black dog.

334
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,920
 Those are fairly popular in Europe, specifically in England.

335
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,680
 And we even have a lot of legends like that

336
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,920
 over here in America.

337
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,480
 And thanks for the recommendation too.

338
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,440
 Thank you.

339
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,640
 But this one's actually a little more intriguing

340
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,440
 than just the ghost dog.

341
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,600
 Its abilities and features are quite odd.

342
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,640
 Now, a lot of times you'll hear stories about,

343
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,680
 oh, there's a black dog that's roaming around Virginia

344
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,800
 and eats chickens and poops on your lawn, whatever.

345
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,280
 It's just normal stuff that you would imagine

346
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,880
 a canine spirit to do.

347
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,080
 So you either go, well, it's a hoax

348
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,800
 and someone doesn't have a really good imagination

349
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,680
 or it's the ghost of a dog.

350
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,320
 And there's stories about hellhounds and stuff

351
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,680
 that are like these demonic type creatures.

352
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
 And then there's the dog creatures that I encountered

353
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,320
 when I was having my dealings with the shadow people.

354
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
 And I discussed that quite a few episodes back.

355
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,000
 I think it was like episode 97 or something like that.

356
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,240
 No, it was even further, 88 I think it was.

357
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,600
 But anyways, they all behaved like canines.

358
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 What's interesting about the guy trash

359
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,280
 is that its set of abilities far exceed anything

360
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,400
 that any dog could do.

361
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,320
 Even Scooby Doo would be hard pressed to beat this dude.

362
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,880
 And again, it's funny 'cause I'm gonna keep referring to it

363
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,080
 almost as a singular entity, but it's not.

364
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,720
 There's a lot of fascinating aspects to this.

365
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,280
 But let's go ahead and talk about what a guy trash is.

366
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,080
 And specifically in its dog form.

367
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,120
 It's a spectral black dog, so it's a phantom.

368
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,960
 It usually has a chain around its neck

369
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,920
 and it's the size of a small bear,

370
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,200
 which is quite huge, goes without saying.

371
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,120
 I mean, I don't think they're talking about like a cub,

372
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,920
 which would be kind of cute.

373
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,280
 A grown bear, but like a small one.

374
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,080
 That makes sense, like a normal bear,

375
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
 but he's like the runt of the litter,

376
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,480
 but he's not a cub.

377
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,400
 Which would match up again to the phantom dogs that I saw,

378
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,760
 which were easily bigger than me.

379
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,360
 And I'm like six foot seven, six foot eight.

380
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,480
 So I'm not really, but so that would be the size of a small.

381
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,200
 I'm often confused with the small bear myself.

382
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,180
 Like my friends call me Ursa Minor.

383
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,680
 It also had giant eyeballs like saucers.

384
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,120
 So I just imagined that it's perpetually startled

385
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,840
 like zoinks, like these giant round eyeballs.

386
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,140
 But it doesn't specifically say that.

387
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,320
 They're like bulging out of its head.

388
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
 Like it just saw a hot chick.

389
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,640
 Just so they're quite big.

390
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,140
 And it had a unique, technically the word was unusual roar,

391
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,520
 unlike that of any animal.

392
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,640
 So like, (howling)

393
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,080
 So you're thinking, okay, it's a monster.

394
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,640
 It makes a weird monster noise and has monster features.

395
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,120
 Okay, there's, now we're gonna get

396
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,240
 into the distinctive qualities.

397
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,040
 Now these, this description came from a dude.

398
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,400
 And I didn't know who he was.

399
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,960
 I kind of figured it out from his last name.

400
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,820
 There's this dude named Branwell Bronte.

401
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,860
 And I was like, oh, he must know Emily.

402
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,100
 He must be related.

403
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,780
 Emily Bronte wrote "Wuthering Heights."

404
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,860
 I'm pretty sure it was one of the Brontes.

405
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,580
 And I didn't know this while I was researching this.

406
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,820
 Him and his sister might have been banging each other

407
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,740
 or she wanted to bang him or something.

408
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,300
 Like there's this whole conspiracy theory

409
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,140
 that "Wuthering Heights," which again, I've never read.

410
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,700
 But I would have if I knew this,

411
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,820
 that Emily Bronte wanted to bang her brother.

412
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,780
 And so she wrote "Heat Cliff," who's in the book,

413
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,620
 not the cartoon character, but there's a guy,

414
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,980
 there's a romance character named Heath Cliff.

415
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,640
 He's in this book called "Wuthering Heights."

416
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,520
 And I don't know if Cliff is a pun on the heights.

417
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,360
 I'm assuming it's not.

418
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,780
 But anyways, Heath Cliff is trying to like,

419
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,960
 is like a total jerk to this chick in the book

420
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,820
 named Anna or something.

421
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,720
 And then I guess he digs up the corpse of his dead lover

422
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,360
 in the book, in the book, in real life.

423
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,480
 Heath Cliff digs up the corpse of his dead lover.

424
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
 What is in this book?

425
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,300
 I always was like, "Now I'd rather read

426
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
 a Dean Coons novel in high school

427
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,180
 'cause we got to pick our own books."

428
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,740
 But then it turns out that people think

429
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,460
 that she may have been trying to bang her brother

430
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,860
 that they did bang, and that's all based on,

431
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,700
 like her, she based her book on Heath Cliff.

432
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,340
 And then other people are saying, "No, that's not true."

433
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,620
 They didn't bang, but they wanted to.

434
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,780
 Super bizarre.

435
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,820
 Teachers need to say that stuff in high school.

436
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,540
 The teacher says, "Here, this book is called

437
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,380
 "Wuthering Heights.

438
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,580
 "We think the author banged their brother."

439
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,860
 I would have read it.

440
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,780
 Here, here's this book, "Animal Farm."

441
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,800
 The author was having sex with animals

442
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,880
 during this book as he was writing it.

443
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,560
 They need to tell us this backstory.

444
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,400
 I would have read it.

445
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,680
 But anyways, that's enough of probably

446
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,400
 50% correct Bronte history.

447
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,620
 Branwell Bronte wrote the description I just read you.

448
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,480
 Also, he was mentally ill and an alcoholic.

449
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,560
 So I should have told you that before this description.

450
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,920
 But he's not the only one who's seen these things.

451
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,480
 And this is where we get into the unusual features

452
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
 of the guide trash.

453
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,360
 When it walks, it makes a noise,

454
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,260
 which is incredibly unusual for any sort of ghost.

455
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,180
 Like, yes, ghost rattling chains, jingling doorknobs.

456
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,180
 But remember, this is such a common thing to see

457
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,220
 that these existed in almost every single town.

458
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,980
 And in some towns, they had multiple versions

459
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,980
 of these living on different streets.

460
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,340
 It was incredibly common.

461
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,020
 It wasn't like you have to go out to the graveyard

462
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,300
 and walk around a grave three times and say,

463
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,140
 you know, booga booga, and then something comes out.

464
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,340
 Like, you'd be going to go grocery shopping

465
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,840
 and you'd see one of these cross on the street

466
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,320
 and you'd turn around and go home.

467
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,160
 So these were everywhere.

468
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,040
 They were mostly in Northern England

469
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
 where these were situated.

470
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,840
 But anyways, I keep going off in tangents.

471
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
 There's just a lot of weird information.

472
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,560
 The, well, not the Bronte stuff, but I could have cut that.

473
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,720
 As it walks, it made a noise that went.

474
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,880
 (snoring)

475
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,120
 And the noise was so noticeable

476
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
 that one of the slang terms for it

477
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,520
 was called the padfoot or the padded foot.

478
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,760
 Because it would make the noise

479
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,840
 as if it was walking on pads.

480
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,700
 So it wasn't just one person heard the noise.

481
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,020
 They all heard the noise and some people said,

482
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,780
 they should call it the padfoot.

483
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,340
 And you think, why did they call it the guy trash?

484
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,020
 This is a weird detail as well.

485
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,620
 And Alexandra said, this was her favorite part of the story.

486
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,340
 The guy trash as it moves through the town,

487
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,420
 it would be watching you.

488
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,620
 But if you noticed it and started walking towards it,

489
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,220
 it would begin walking backwards,

490
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,180
 staring at you the whole time.

491
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,900
 You couldn't get close to the thing.

492
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,720
 Sometimes right when you looked at it,

493
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,040
 it would simply take off.

494
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,080
 And it would be noticed to jump into water.

495
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,800
 So it'll jump into a well,

496
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,680
 it'll jump into a river, a pond, anything.

497
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,480
 Your cup of noodles that you just cooked,

498
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,460
 you got a guy trash in it now.

499
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,360
 But the reason, and again, this was such an oddity

500
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,960
 to all that stuff, like seeing a spirit

501
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,840
 and having to jump in the water.

502
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,480
 Water is generally very connected to the spirit world.

503
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,040
 This was very interesting to me.

504
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,400
 And it kind of like, kind of trips you out

505
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,620
 when you think about reality.

506
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,980
 Sometimes the guy trash,

507
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,120
 instead of running to the nearest water source,

508
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,780
 would run towards you and then jump and dive

509
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,620
 right at your feet.

510
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,100
 So you think you're about to get mauled by this creature,

511
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
 but before it gets you,

512
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,860
 it would jump and dive right by your feet

513
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,380
 and it would disappear as if it was diving into water

514
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,180
 that you're standing on top of.

515
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,780
 And it did that so often

516
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,300
 that that's why it's named the guy trash.

517
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,660
 Some people say that's the reason

518
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,500
 why it's called the guy trash.

519
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,460
 Not that it would jump in there and guide trash would appear.

520
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
 'Cause that noise, guy trash.

521
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,320
 As it jumped and disappeared right at your feet,

522
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,140
 it would sound like someone dropped a heavy stone

523
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,480
 into a lake.

524
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,320
 Guy trash.

525
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,320
 That is so bizarre to have such a noisy spirit

526
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,220
 that is so common.

527
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,900
 'Cause we don't call ghosts chainies

528
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,380
 because they rattle chains all the time.

529
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,800
 You have other names for them.

530
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,980
 But this one, if that story is true,

531
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,000
 and they think that that's where the name guy trash comes

532
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,860
 from 'cause they can't really find any other evidence

533
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,500
 of why that name is that.

534
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,820
 Is that so many people had experienced that

535
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,100
 and it would jump and it would splash

536
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,860
 into the solid concrete at your feet

537
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,100
 as if it wasn't concrete back then it was dirt,

538
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,140
 but it would jump into the earth

539
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,100
 and it would make a noise.

540
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,820
 (imitates noise)

541
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,620
 And it happened so often people would be like,

542
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,740
 "What is that thing that's chasing us down the street?"

543
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,740
 And trying to go get some milk.

544
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,860
 That happened so often people just started calling it

545
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,940
 the guy trash.

546
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,820
 Super bizarre.

547
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,180
 It has a lot of elements that really set it apart

548
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,140
 from normal cryptids or normal ghosts.

549
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,380
 The fact that everyone can see them

550
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,300
 is not really known among cryptids.

551
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,700
 Normally they hide.

552
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,280
 They're, I mean, these things will disappear

553
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,420
 when you start to interact with them,

554
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,740
 but you know what I mean?

555
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,140
 It's kind of on the border between the fairy lore,

556
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,340
 the elves and stuff like that

557
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,500
 where people interacted with them

558
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,380
 and they were obviously harmful to people.

559
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,900
 Gnomes were creepy.

560
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,140
 It borders on the ghost

561
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,580
 because it has a ghostly presence

562
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,300
 that you're constantly referring it to as a specter.

563
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,220
 And then it borders on the modern day cryptid

564
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,220
 where it's a creature that defies all logical explanation

565
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,340
 and it's kind of living in that realm.

566
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,860
 And it's funny because it's happening at the time

567
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,180
 when society is becoming more industrialized.

568
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,180
 It's like the last phase of the fairy legends

569
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,620
 and moving to the cryptid legends.

570
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,260
 Very, very interesting creature.

571
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,340
 But you ask, okay, is the dog running around

572
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,800
 is making this weird noise?

573
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,640
 What does it do?

574
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,860
 Which was really my question

575
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,580
 when I was reading the article.

576
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,940
 I was like, okay, so what does this do?

577
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,780
 This is interesting,

578
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,700
 but if it just kind of like walks around town and splashes,

579
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,420
 that's just kind of a weird illusion.

580
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,580
 Well, it can attack you

581
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,540
 and it has been known to attack people.

582
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,140
 Ah, I got my people's governor.

583
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,720
 I can't see.

584
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,060
 But most likely seeing one is a bad omen.

585
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,580
 Now, I can't think of anything.

586
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,140
 I mean, it's pretty much a bad omen.

587
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,540
 If you get attacked by something,

588
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,460
 you're like, oh, I should have seen this coming.

589
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,180
 I saw the bad omen and then it attacked me.

590
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,060
 But generally it meant that you or someone in your family

591
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,020
 was going to experience something really bad.

592
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,160
 Most likely a death soon

593
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,620
 when you saw one of these creatures.

594
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,380
 And remember, these things are seen so consistently

595
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,320
 all over the place that people are constantly,

596
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,260
 it basically in a state of fear.

597
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,620
 Everyone seeing them,

598
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,880
 that stuff's happening all the time.

599
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,200
 It's really, really tough to live back then.

600
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,800
 Imagine if every time you opened the door,

601
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,280
 you saw a bad omen.

602
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,040
 But because these things were around for so long,

603
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,560
 they were seen between the 18th

604
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,200
 and 19th century.

605
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,120
 They really were able to kind of zone in on,

606
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,400
 it's almost like they were able to study these things

607
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,560
 from a zoological perspective.

608
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,880
 They were able to come down to,

609
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,040
 this is what it looks like,

610
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,160
 this is what it does,

611
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,020
 this is what happens when you startle it,

612
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,680
 this is what happens when you chase it.

613
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,000
 This is how it gets away.

614
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
 If there's no water available,

615
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,200
 this is how it gets away.

616
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,120
 It's very, I mean, it's quite detailed.

617
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,280
 We don't even know that stuff about Bigfoot.

618
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,980
 Like what do you do if you run into Bigfoot?

619
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,720
 What does a Bigfoot do when it runs into you?

620
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,540
 How does it get away?

621
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,080
 I mean, they can just go, well, he walks away.

622
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,900
 These ones actually have like exit routes for this thing.

623
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,480
 They've also been able to zone in

624
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,160
 exactly where it tends to show up.

625
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,000
 This is cool.

626
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
 I didn't know this phrase before

627
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,280
 until I read this article.

628
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,440
 It said that it shows up in liminal places,

629
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
 which are basically gateways.

630
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,280
 So it would show up at thresholds,

631
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,680
 it would show up at gates,

632
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
 it would show up at tunnels,

633
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,400
 it would show up outside like the gate of a graveyard

634
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,040
 or outside the archway of a church.

635
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,240
 It's very, very interesting.

636
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,920
 They were really able to go when they see it.

637
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,200
 You're like, hey,

638
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,440
 probably shouldn't have walked by that open doorway

639
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,160
 because I didn't want any bad omens tonight

640
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,760
 and there is a guy trash.

641
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,000
 Now it also, and you go,

642
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,880
 okay, well, just stay away from all arches,

643
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,960
 stay away from McDonald's,

644
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,800
 don't go anywhere near where there's an opening,

645
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,760
 but liminal also includes,

646
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,620
 I mean, liminal really is like borders.

647
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,440
 So it could show up at a street crossing.

648
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,880
 It could show up at a county line.

649
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,200
 You could be walking and you could cross your property line

650
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,600
 into your neighbor's property line

651
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,560
 and you look over there

652
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,560
 and there's this hulking black dog

653
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,140
 with giant eyeballs just staring at you.

654
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,680
 So that's why they were everywhere

655
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,760
 because boundaries is what makes up society

656
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,680
 and these creatures would be where there are boundaries.

657
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,640
 And so generally you would have,

658
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,320
 some towns had a guy trash

659
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,360
 and they would be like,

660
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,120
 and then there would be at the same time

661
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,000
 and other guy trash in a neighboring town.

662
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,840
 But like I said earlier,

663
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,200
 some of the towns were so populated by these things,

664
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,240
 individual streets had its own guy trash.

665
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,120
 So you could have someone seeing the main guy trash

666
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,480
 down at the city hall

667
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,800
 while there's just a guy trash

668
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,480
 that walks down your street,

669
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,320
 which is the worst.

670
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,400
 That means you basically live

671
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,840
 in the worst neighborhood possible

672
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,720
 where there is a bad omen constantly

673
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 just like hanging out in your front yard.

674
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,480
 He's also a shapeshifter,

675
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,280
 which again, isn't out of the realm of the fantasy

676
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,920
 and the 40 and stuff like that.

677
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,040
 But the shapes that this guy seems to take are quite odd

678
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,440
 'cause I was like, okay, he's a dog.

679
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,720
 Maybe he turns into a hot chick.

680
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,120
 Maybe he turns into a frog, something like that.

681
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,760
 These are the other forms then.

682
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,960
 I don't know how they knew it was the guy trash

683
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,680
 or a guy trash in this form.

684
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,800
 I'm assuming that it's the appearance that it took

685
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,320
 or the presence that it gave you

686
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
 'cause some of these are really weird.

687
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,880
 It showed up once as an evil cow

688
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,760
 and terrorized the people of this town

689
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,880
 to the point where their guy trash basically

690
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,360
 just always stayed as an evil cow.

691
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,520
 Once, and this was another,

692
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,160
 I think it was Bronte again

693
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,720
 in between being and his sister,

694
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,160
 he noticed that in his area,

695
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,000
 sometimes the guy trash would turn

696
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
 into a burning barrel rolling down a hill,

697
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
 which is so specific.

698
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,440
 And I imagine if you're in the middle of nowhere,

699
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,360
 which was basically how you would describe Eileen back then,

700
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,940
 and you looked out your window,

701
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,540
 if you saw a burning barrel rolling down the hill,

702
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,320
 the first thing you do is to roll over

703
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,200
 and wake up your sister and be like, hey, hey, wake up,

704
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,520
 Emily, look at this.

705
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,160
 And you would think it was a weird event.

706
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,400
 But if you kept seeing it

707
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,920
 and then you weren't seeing the normal spectral dog

708
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,960
 running around your neighborhood,

709
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,120
 you probably connect, hey,

710
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,440
 maybe that might be the guy trash.

711
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,720
 Maybe it started rolling up hill

712
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,600
 or doing weird stuff

713
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,240
 or chasing people around the neighborhood.

714
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,880
 And that is actually not as odd

715
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,440
 as the next form that it took.

716
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,680
 It also took a rabbit, so that's kind of cool,

717
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,520
 but it's not even the oddest form that it took.

718
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,040
 In one town, the guy trash became

719
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,040
 a dirty white rag on a branch.

720
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,080
 So it's just like a branch

721
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,400
 and there's a white rag hanging from it, dripping,

722
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,520
 and people are like, it's a bad old,

723
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,360
 and that's the guy trash.

724
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,480
 That's such a bizarre form for it to take.

725
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,280
 But the people believed in that area

726
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,200
 that that was the guy trash.

727
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,240
 But maybe it stayed up there for weeks or months.

728
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,160
 I don't know.

729
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,820
 It would seem, that to me, seems like pure superstition.

730
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,120
 The rag one, it could have actually been

731
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,320
 a shape-shifting creature,

732
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,280
 but that more seems like one day I looked out

733
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,960
 and I saw a white rag on a stick

734
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,520
 and I had bad luck.

735
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,920
 I fell and stung my toe the next day.

736
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,400
 Therefore, that might be the guy trash.

737
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,960
 And then no one wanted to take it down

738
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,880
 'cause they were afraid it was the mythical monster.

739
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,480
 That sounds a lot like a complete superstition.

740
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,720
 But the guy trash did eventually disappear.

741
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,240
 And some people say it was related

742
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,580
 to the people in the areas getting more educated.

743
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,780
 Some people say that it was related to electricity,

744
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,860
 more lighting in the neighborhoods, scared 'em off.

745
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,440
 It was no longer their hunting grounds.

746
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,680
 It's interesting to think that living in a,

747
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,600
 I know rural areas tend to get really dark at night,

748
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,960
 but it's interesting to think there was a time

749
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,920
 where there was masses of people living together

750
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,320
 and it was like, unless you're in front of a candle,

751
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,600
 it was pitch black.

752
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,280
 And then it was oddly enough, one author, not Bronte,

753
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,080
 but one author said that, he said that the guy trash,

754
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,360
 here's his quote here, "left Horton

755
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,560
 when the district was incorporated

756
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,600
 as it had grown jealous of the policemen."

757
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,440
 That's kinda weird.

758
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,520
 I didn't know it was like Batman.

759
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,960
 Maybe it figured the idea that the policemen

760
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,080
 were now patrolling the area,

761
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,160
 but the guy trash wasn't like a silent guardian,

762
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,000
 a dark knight.

763
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,160
 He was just like this jerk that kinda caused bad luck

764
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,020
 and would sometimes attack you.

765
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,840
 So you're like, okay, there is the legend of the guy trash,

766
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,680
 but what's interesting is there is actually

767
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,400
 a recent news article where a woman was taking a photograph

768
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,200
 of a man walking up a stairway into an NA tunnel.

769
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,240
 So it's like a tunnel that has a stairway into it

770
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,080
 for whatever reason.

771
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,640
 And she takes a photo of the guy for whatever reason.

772
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,160
 She's a total creeper, she has her own website.

773
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,480
 And in the corner of the photo,

774
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,480
 right at the threshold of the tunnel is a guy trash.

775
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,220
 Now, that's what the photographer says,

776
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,480
 and that's what the newspaper is claiming it to be.

777
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,520
 It looks like a pile of trash.

778
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,720
 It doesn't look like a spectral dog.

779
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,440
 I mean, I guess if you really squinted, you could see it.

780
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,800
 But I looked at the photo for quite a long time,

781
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,000
 and I just couldn't really make out the details.

782
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,560
 It was big and it was black and it was lumpy.

783
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,320
 And if that's what dogs look like over there,

784
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,080
 then I think they have bigger problems

785
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,200
 than mythical black omens running around.

786
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,360
 I wonder if spirits can go extinct.

787
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,240
 Now, and that's gonna sound like a weird thing,

788
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,400
 and I'm using the word spirits

789
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,960
 in kind of a general catch-all phrase.

790
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,200
 I think I've always been to the,

791
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,080
 I think I've always had the understanding

792
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,120
 that if elves were real and gnomes were real

793
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,720
 and all this stuff, that they did exist for a time

794
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,200
 alongside humanity and these little alcoves.

795
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,400
 And humans would run into one from time to time,

796
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,160
 and that's where a lot of these legends come from,

797
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,720
 little kids' babies being shape-shifted and stuff like that.

798
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,320
 And I just always assumed, and then they left.

799
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,760
 I have always had this idea

800
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,360
 that it's been this kind of Lord of the Rings thing,

801
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,500
 whereas basically once the age of man came,

802
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,560
 then they just set out his places and for us,

803
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,440
 and they either went deeper into hiding

804
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,320
 or they left our realm or whatever.

805
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,120
 If, assuming they existed, assuming they existed at all,

806
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,280
 I've always kind of had that childlike idea that

807
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,760
 maybe they just, you know, said,

808
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,680
 "Okay, we're gonna leave, we'll leave England now

809
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,960
 as little fairy folk,

810
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,440
 and we'll find another realm to live in, another dimension."

811
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,440
 Little fairy people and their black spectral dogs and gnomes.

812
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,380
 And unicorns, man.

813
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,500
 I never really thought about them going extinct.

814
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,760
 I never really thought like there was a last unicorn,

815
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,100
 which is a great movie, but I never really imagined,

816
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,500
 like there was a last unicorn that was like killed by a hunter.

817
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,140
 I imagined eventually the unicorns just left.

818
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,660
 And I don't know if that's very childlike of me,

819
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,620
 but it's funny to bring it back to this is like,

820
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,700
 imagine that the guide trash, these creatures were real,

821
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,460
 that it wasn't just mass hallucination

822
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,380
 from ergot poisoning.

823
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,040
 And then they lived there long before humans spread

824
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,360
 to that area, but no one was around to notice them.

825
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
 And then the humans built up their little towns there,

826
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,320
 and they're like, "We're not going anywhere."

827
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,160
 And they stayed there,

828
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,860
 and it was still technically their place.

829
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:59,160
 But then night time started to become daytime,

830
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,240
 and the darkness that was their home that comforted them

831
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,260
 was being taken away block by block by block.

832
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,160
 It's weird to think that out of all the species

833
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,880
 and all the civilizations that humanity has waged war against

834
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,120
 and the species have died off

835
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,020
 and those empires have fallen

836
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,760
 and their history completely forgotten,

837
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,920
 alongside all of that chaos,

838
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,920
 maybe there are like unknown graveyards of these creatures

839
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,300
 that either were slaughtered

840
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,360
 or simply just ceased to exist.

841
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,740
 I guess really the reason why I'm kind of having

842
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,520
 this realization now is until I really got to the guide trash,

843
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,540
 I never really thought of these things.

844
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,840
 They've always been more in the realm of fantasy

845
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,280
 than reality.

846
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,180
 And I'm not saying I believe the guide trash is real,

847
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,900
 but I find it interesting how much specific information

848
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,560
 they have on these things,

849
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,380
 as opposed to stuff like the Pombero or Unicorn

850
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,980
 or La Lorna or whatever.

851
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,180
 They're always just kind of these things that pop up

852
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,660
 and people make up a legend about it

853
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,140
 or they hear something and da da da da

854
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,780
 and everything's kind of left very vague.

855
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,900
 These things are so specific.

856
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,580
 It really makes me think that they could have existed

857
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,980
 in a logical fashion.

858
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,900
 And if that's true,

859
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,720
 then we may be responsible for the extinction

860
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,140
 of a species from another dimension,

861
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,680
 simply by turning our lights on.

862
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,000
 It really makes you wonder what the world was really like

863
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,680
 at night two, 300 years ago.

864
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,640
 When the sun set and the world fell dark,

865
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,460
 what lived in that darkness alongside humanity

866
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,700
 for hundreds of thousands of years

867
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,700
 that we now regard as simple fables and legends?

868
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,260
 It's hard to imagine even when you live

869
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,880
 in a rural area today,

870
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,880
 how dark the entire world was a short time ago.

871
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,960
 Did the darkness and the unknown

872
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,720
 create these myths and legends?

873
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,280
 Or were all these stories of creatures

874
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,260
 based on what people were really seeing

875
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,320
 on the edges of their civilization?

876
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,260
 I guess we'll find out

877
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,260
 if the lights ever do go out again.

878
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,580
 Some horrible catastrophe,

879
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,080
 some nuclear war,

880
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,520
 and once again power is removed from the planet.

881
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,660
 When the sun sets on that first night

882
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,200
