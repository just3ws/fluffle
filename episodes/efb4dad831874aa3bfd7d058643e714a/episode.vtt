WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.600
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.320
 A man is on the hunt for lizard people

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 living underneath the streets of Los Angeles.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.000
 And then we take a look at the legend of the guide trash,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.200
 a black spectral dog, sometimes, it's a shapeshifter,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 that haunted parts of England for nearly 200 years.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.800
 Is this dog real?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.000
 And by calling it just a dog is a little misleading.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.600
 It wasn't a dog.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 There were hundreds of these things today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.080
 Hey, everyone.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.320
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.960
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.360
 Just a quick reminder, if you missed yesterday's episode,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.800
 we will be taking a break at the end of season two.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.840
 And season two ends on Friday.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.600
 So we're going to do our Friday episode.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 And then we're going to take a break, and we will be back.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.160
 I don't have my glasses on so I can't see my calendar from here.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.800
 But I think it's April 22nd, I think.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.640
 But anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.400
 Now, our first story, we're going to go to sunny, sunny Los

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.480
 Angeles, place of movie stars.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.000
 I think I've used this intro before,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.080
 but place of movie stars and sexy, sexy people who don't

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.320
 happen to be movie stars.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.600
 What is it about waitstwaiters?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.760
 Not waiters.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.680
 Let me back up here.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.040
 What is it about waitresses that is so hot?

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.400
 Like, a lot of times you go in to a restaurant

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.680
 and you'll see some hot women dining there.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.000
 But what is it about waitresses that make them so hot?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.040
 Is there uniforms?

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.520
 Is it the fact that they're serving me?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.800
 I don't know.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.800
 But waitresses are generally the hottest people in the building.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.080
 But we're going that long segue side.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.840
 We're going to sunny, sunny Los Angeles.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.480
 So let's just walk there.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.760
 Let's just walk.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.720
 It's a nice walk from Oregon to California.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.520
 We can do it.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.800
 The settlers did it.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.880
 They had horses and wagons.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.280
 But let-- OK, that's enough.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.080
 That's enough.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960
 Let's go to Los Angeles.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.080
 And that is where we are going to explore the mystery of the man

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.720
 who tried to find reptiles underneath the city

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720
 streets of Los Angeles.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.160
 Back in the year-- imagine you are in the year 1934.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.440
 You pick up a copy of the Los Angeles Times,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.560
 the esteemed newspaper, the record for the city of Los

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.680
 Angeles.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.840
 And you open it up.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.480
 And on the front page, it reads this headline,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.880
 "Lizard People's Catacomb City."

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.360
 You're like, what?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.080
 Why is this in the front page of the Los Angeles Times?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.200
 But this was actually an ongoing thing in this city.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.760
 So what happened was there was this guy named George Warren

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.000
 Schufeld.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.320
 And he thought-- well, he believed.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.120
 He didn't just think it.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.400
 He wasn't like, oh, I got a theory.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.400
 He truly believed that there was a race of ancient humanoid

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.760
 lizards living underneath the city of LA.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.080
 He had heard an old Native American legend

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.520
 from a friend of his.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.800
 So I mean, that's always the best way

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.120
 to get your information.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.480
 And he invented this device called a radio x-ray machine.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.040
 So basically, he was taking it around town.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.240
 And he said it was like a ground penetrating radar.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.800
 But radar didn't exist.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.760
 So he was just saying that this is what it does.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.040
 It's going underneath the ground.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.440
 And it's showing that there's these huge catacombs

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.480
 underneath the city.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.440
 Now, nowadays, not only would that not

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.200
 be in the front page of the LA Times,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.040
 that guy would be regarded as a total kook.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.560
 He'd have his own website.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.320
 But he would be regarded as a kook.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.840
 It wouldn't get any mainstream press.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.280
 But back then, people were--

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.800
 he went to the county border supervisors and said,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.000
 hey, do you mind if I start digging up parts of LA

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.920
 to find the secret catacomb system?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.400
 And they approved it.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.720
 They said, yeah, sure, dude.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.160
 There's nothing else going on.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.960
 And now, to be fair, Los Angeles wasn't the booming city

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.480
 it is today.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.040
 But it was still fairly large.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.680
 But they gave him permission.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.520
 They said, yeah, we don't want you digging up Hollywood

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.280
 and Vine.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.280
 But you can dig up in certain areas

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.360
 where the business owners give you permission and stuff

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.640
 like that.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.920
 We're totally fine with it.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.760
 The reason why everyone was fine with it--

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.120
 and he was kind of going along with it,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.360
 because George Warren was saying that--

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.600
 this was what he was told-- that a bunch of lizard people

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.720
 lived on Earth a long, long time ago.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.400
 And then a bunch of meteorites started coming down.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.520
 And they ran underground.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.440
 They had this special chemical that melted rock,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.720
 like hot butter.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.920
 Hot butter doesn't melt.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.960
 It melt rock like pouring hot water on butter, I guess,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.120
 is what I was looking for.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.840
 And the county border supervisors, like that analogy,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.440
 makes no sense.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.080
 And he's like, no, no, no, just go with it.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.320
 But when they escaped down into the underground--

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.880
 and this city wasn't just in LA.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.920
 It stretched all over Arizona and into Mexico

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.800
 and all that stuff.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.560
 He said when they escaped, they took a bunch of gold with them.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.360
 So everyone's like, oh, gold.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.280
 Now I'm interested.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.800
 Now I'll approve your digging procedure.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.240
 He had a ton of people working for him.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.600
 He had digging equipment.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.400
 And according to who you believe as far as the record

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.520
 keeping goes, he dug between 250 feet down to 1,000 feet

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.440
 down looking for this stuff.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.080
 So again, it wasn't a couple of guys out there

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.320
 with shovels and pickaxes.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.640
 These guys were using boring equipment,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.640
 which is actually quite exciting, to dig through the earth deep.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.560
 Even 250 feet down is pretty deep in the middle of a city.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.440
 Now, of course, he didn't find anything, at least that we know

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.960
 of, because if he had found something,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.200
 then it would be big news, a giant lizard city underneath the city.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.480
 And there's all this gold everywhere.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.720
 But he ended up coming up empty handed.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.280
 There's been a couple of things from this.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.680
 One, some people think that the story that he heard

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.200
 was mistranslated because it was a Native American story.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.920
 His buddy was Native American.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.120
 There's a guy named Chief Greenleaf, which

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.080
 is who I used to buy my weed from.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.960
 But they think that the story actually

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.320
 wasn't about lizard people.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.880
 They think that something was mistranslated.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.440
 And it was actually the story of Lemuria,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.160
 the people leaving the island of Lemuria,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.840
 coming to the continent of America and going underground.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.640
 And that's interesting, because we just

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.040
 covered that in the Mount Shasta conspiracy.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.800
 When we talked about the people leaving their island

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.240
 and going underground and living under Mount Shasta and having--

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.520
 so people say that he may have gotten the lizard part wrong,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.400
 but the old legend of people fleeing from a continent

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.440
 because it was undergoing some sort of cataclysm going

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.200
 underground into America, that matches up to other legends

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.800
 that were in that area.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.160
 The second thing to come from this story

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.280
 is that some people believe that this

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.880
 is where the idea of reptilians based on taking over the world

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.280
 comes from.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.360
 They think that this guy may have been inadvertently

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.160
 of starting the rumor of shape shifting reptilians,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.520
 of reptilians trying to dominate the planet,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.120
 of a hidden race of humanoid reptiles.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.560
 And they think that really it may come from this.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.640
 Humanoid-- as far as I can remember,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.120
 humanoid reptiles aren't super common in old school mythology.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.120
 They may be a one off villain popping up here and there.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.800
 They may be the guys at Hercules like,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.880
 smashes their backs and breaks their spines and stuff like that.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.240
 But overall, you'd have humans with a reptile head

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.960
 or talking snakes or creature like dragons.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.880
 But the idea of an actual human, like a full on human looking

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.440
 like a reptile that stands upright like a human walks

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.120
 like a human, stuff like that, that's not super common.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.560
 I may be wrong on that.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.440
 And some people may say there is this example.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.600
 There is this example.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.320
 But overall, that's not a real common mythology.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.200
 People who are part reptile, yes.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.480
 Or reptiles with human characteristics, yes.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.960
 But a humanoid reptile is not as common in folklore

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.560
 or in religion or myth or however you want to put it.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.760
 So outside of maybe one or two, a few examples out there.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.680
 So they're thinking that this may be why the reptile thing popped up.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.440
 So I mean, some people think because this idea of there's

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.920
 a race of humanoid reptilians that are secretly trying

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.720
 to take over the planet is fairly recent.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.960
 It had to come from somewhere.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.680
 He was talking about this underground city.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.440
 He never found any proof.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.440
 He swore up and down there's reptiles living underneath LA

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.160
 and up and down all over the Southwest.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.520
 This may have been the start of where eventually 80, 90 years

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.040
 later you have David Ike writing about shape shifting

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.520
 reptilians and tons of reptilians on YouTube.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.120
 Not literally, videos about reptiles on YouTube.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.160
 This may be where it started.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.640
 But the big question I have from this is we know

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.960
 that you can find a city and I don't believe in shape shifting

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.360
 reptilians taking over the planet.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.440
 But I do have one huge question about this.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.040
 In that front page of the LA Times, by the way,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.240
 I have to remind you, in that same edition, the January 29,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.840
 1934 edition of the Los Angeles Times front page,

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.880
 right underneath this article saying that there may be reptiles

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.840
 living under the city of LA or at least their dead civilization.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.240
 Here's a headline for you.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.400
 Effort to save kite may cost child life.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.080
 Little kid was flying his kite, got caught in a power line,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.640
 went to go get it and got electrocuted.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.600
 And the article in saying the child

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.000
 is in critical condition.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.840
 What?

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.160
 Now I'll never know if that kid ever survived.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.320
 That is a whore of-- that's a cliffhanger.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.040
 I know we didn't find reptiles.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.200
 I find it odd, again, talk about a slow news day in LA

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.360
 if that's on your front page.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.040
 Tragic story, not making fun of the kid.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.600
 Just bizarre that that would be front page news.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.240
 And it also makes me think they definitely

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.440
 was a slow news day if that is on the front page,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.440
 along with some guys digging in your backyard looking

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.200
 for reptile bones.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.880
 But we're going to go ahead and leave LA.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.960
 And I hope that kid's OK.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.960
 But again, I'll never know.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.120
 I don't think they have a follow up to it.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.120
 I guess I could check the next day of the newspaper, actually.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.840
 But it's daily podcast.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.080
 I got a lot of stuff to do.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.240
 You know, I'm wondering if that was in the newspaper,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.200
 because how long had electricity been around,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.400
 like power lines in cities?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.360
 Maybe like 20 years?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.560
 No, he's probably not the first kid who got his kite stuck

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.080
 in a power line.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.960
 OK, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.200
 Now for the next story.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.040
 But we leave sunny, sunny Los Angeles.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.920
 You're like, that's weird.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.960
 The auto quality changed.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.760
 Yeah, that's because I recorded those segments

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.560
 at different times.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.000
 But we leave sunny, sunny Los Angeles.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.960
 We say goodbye to the beautiful waitresses

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.960
 that we met down there that served us so honorably

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.640
 and valiantly.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.400
 It's not D-Day.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.360
 They're just giving us food.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.080
 But anyways, now it's off to England.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.240
 That's why I saved the carpenter copter,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.080
 because we really needed-- we can't walk across the ocean.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.800
 As awesome as it would be to walk along the sea floor,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.840
 we can't do that.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.680
 But we are off to merry old England.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.880
 We go a bit back in time to around--

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.600
 we're going to go back to the 18th century.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.360
 So early 18th century, we're going to go back

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.760
 to when this started.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.120
 Hop in the carpenter copter.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.520
 [HUMMING]

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.280
 Go back in time.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.560
 And now we're hovering over a little town.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.800
 Now, again, it's Britain.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.800
 I don't really know how their principalities are set up.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.560
 I don't even know if that's the correct word.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.080
 But we're flying over, let's say, Yorkshire.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.360
 Yorkshire, I think, is a county.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.560
 But anyways, we're flying somewhere over there.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.160
 Hovering.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.400
 We're in stealth mode.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.920
 It's old, timey town beneath us.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.480
 Everything's made of wood and brick.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.240
 And we see the city street below us.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.560
 And it's kind of bustling.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.360
 You know, it's 7 o'clock at night.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.240
 I'm surprised that this many people are out.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.320
 But people are still wandering around the town.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.600
 And you hear some guy go, oh, look over there

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.360
 what your people's going up.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.200
 Look over there.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.200
 And everyone's like, what's over there, a British dude?

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.160
 And he goes, it's a guy trash.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.280
 And everyone runs away.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.160
 And we're like, what?

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.840
 What's a guy trash?

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.600
 We're looking around.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.240
 We don't see anything from our angle.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.600
 We don't see anything at all.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.240
 But we do realize something that whatever this thing is,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.880
 they're scared of it.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.040
 You superstitious people are very scared of this thing

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040
 known as the guy trash.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.040
 Now, a guy trash.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.160
 This was an interesting one.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.520
 This one was actually a recommendation on Facebook

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.080
 from Alexandra.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.320
 Alexandra recommended this to me.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.280
 She's actually in Britain.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.320
 I don't know if she's in Britain right now.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.000
 I don't, if you're listening to this podcast

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.080
 three years from now, if you go there looking for her,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.080
 I don't know if you'll find her there.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.520
 But she sent me this story

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.320
 and she sent me an interesting follow up

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.440
 after she sent me the story.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.280
 We'll get to that.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.160
 Now, the guy trash is basically your standard devil dog,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.680
 your standard spectral spirit

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.200
 in the form of a big black dog.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.920
 Those are fairly popular in Europe, specifically in England.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.680
 And we even have a lot of legends like that

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.920
 over here in America.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.480
 And thanks for the recommendation too.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.440
 Thank you.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.640
 But this one's actually a little more intriguing

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.440
 than just the ghost dog.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.600
 Its abilities and features are quite odd.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.640
 Now, a lot of times you'll hear stories about,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.680
 oh, there's a black dog that's roaming around Virginia

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.800
 and eats chickens and poops on your lawn, whatever.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.280
 It's just normal stuff that you would imagine

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.880
 a canine spirit to do.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.080
 So you either go, well, it's a hoax

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.800
 and someone doesn't have a really good imagination

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.680
 or it's the ghost of a dog.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.320
 And there's stories about hellhounds and stuff

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.680
 that are like these demonic type creatures.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.160
 And then there's the dog creatures that I encountered

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.320
 when I was having my dealings with the shadow people.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.480
 And I discussed that quite a few episodes back.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.000
 I think it was like episode 97 or something like that.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.240
 No, it was even further, 88 I think it was.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.600
 But anyways, they all behaved like canines.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.600
 What's interesting about the guy trash

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.280
 is that its set of abilities far exceed anything

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.400
 that any dog could do.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.320
 Even Scooby Doo would be hard pressed to beat this dude.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.880
 And again, it's funny 'cause I'm gonna keep referring to it

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.080
 almost as a singular entity, but it's not.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.720
 There's a lot of fascinating aspects to this.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.280
 But let's go ahead and talk about what a guy trash is.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.080
 And specifically in its dog form.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.120
 It's a spectral black dog, so it's a phantom.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.960
 It usually has a chain around its neck

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.920
 and it's the size of a small bear,

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.200
 which is quite huge, goes without saying.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.120
 I mean, I don't think they're talking about like a cub,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.920
 which would be kind of cute.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.280
 A grown bear, but like a small one.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.080
 That makes sense, like a normal bear,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.400
 but he's like the runt of the litter,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.480
 but he's not a cub.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.400
 Which would match up again to the phantom dogs that I saw,

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.760
 which were easily bigger than me.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.360
 And I'm like six foot seven, six foot eight.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.480
 So I'm not really, but so that would be the size of a small.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.200
 I'm often confused with the small bear myself.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.180
 Like my friends call me Ursa Minor.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.680
 It also had giant eyeballs like saucers.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.120
 So I just imagined that it's perpetually startled

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.840
 like zoinks, like these giant round eyeballs.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.140
 But it doesn't specifically say that.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.320
 They're like bulging out of its head.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.680
 Like it just saw a hot chick.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.640
 Just so they're quite big.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.140
 And it had a unique, technically the word was unusual roar,

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.520
 unlike that of any animal.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.640
 So like, (howling)

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.080
 So you're thinking, okay, it's a monster.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.640
 It makes a weird monster noise and has monster features.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.120
 Okay, there's, now we're gonna get

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.240
 into the distinctive qualities.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.040
 Now these, this description came from a dude.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.400
 And I didn't know who he was.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.960
 I kind of figured it out from his last name.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.820
 There's this dude named Branwell Bronte.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.860
 And I was like, oh, he must know Emily.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.100
 He must be related.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.780
 Emily Bronte wrote "Wuthering Heights."

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.860
 I'm pretty sure it was one of the Brontes.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.580
 And I didn't know this while I was researching this.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.820
 Him and his sister might have been banging each other

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.740
 or she wanted to bang him or something.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.300
 Like there's this whole conspiracy theory

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.140
 that "Wuthering Heights," which again, I've never read.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.700
 But I would have if I knew this,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.820
 that Emily Bronte wanted to bang her brother.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.780
 And so she wrote "Heat Cliff," who's in the book,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.620
 not the cartoon character, but there's a guy,

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.980
 there's a romance character named Heath Cliff.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.640
 He's in this book called "Wuthering Heights."

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.520
 And I don't know if Cliff is a pun on the heights.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.360
 I'm assuming it's not.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.780
 But anyways, Heath Cliff is trying to like,

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.960
 is like a total jerk to this chick in the book

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.820
 named Anna or something.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.720
 And then I guess he digs up the corpse of his dead lover

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.360
 in the book, in the book, in real life.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.480
 Heath Cliff digs up the corpse of his dead lover.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.600
 What is in this book?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.300
 I always was like, "Now I'd rather read

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.300
 a Dean Coons novel in high school

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.180
 'cause we got to pick our own books."

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.740
 But then it turns out that people think

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.460
 that she may have been trying to bang her brother

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.860
 that they did bang, and that's all based on,

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.700
 like her, she based her book on Heath Cliff.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.340
 And then other people are saying, "No, that's not true."

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.620
 They didn't bang, but they wanted to.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.780
 Super bizarre.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.820
 Teachers need to say that stuff in high school.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.540
 The teacher says, "Here, this book is called

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.380
 "Wuthering Heights.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.580
 "We think the author banged their brother."

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.860
 I would have read it.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.780
 Here, here's this book, "Animal Farm."

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.800
 The author was having sex with animals

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.880
 during this book as he was writing it.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.560
 They need to tell us this backstory.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.400
 I would have read it.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.680
 But anyways, that's enough of probably

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.400
 50% correct Bronte history.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.620
 Branwell Bronte wrote the description I just read you.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.480
 Also, he was mentally ill and an alcoholic.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.560
 So I should have told you that before this description.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.920
 But he's not the only one who's seen these things.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.480
 And this is where we get into the unusual features

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.480
 of the guide trash.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.360
 When it walks, it makes a noise,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.260
 which is incredibly unusual for any sort of ghost.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.180
 Like, yes, ghost rattling chains, jingling doorknobs.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:48.180
 But remember, this is such a common thing to see

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.220
 that these existed in almost every single town.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.980
 And in some towns, they had multiple versions

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.980
 of these living on different streets.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.340
 It was incredibly common.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.020
 It wasn't like you have to go out to the graveyard

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.300
 and walk around a grave three times and say,

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.140
 you know, booga booga, and then something comes out.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.340
 Like, you'd be going to go grocery shopping

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.840
 and you'd see one of these cross on the street

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.320
 and you'd turn around and go home.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.160
 So these were everywhere.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.040
 They were mostly in Northern England

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.040
 where these were situated.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.840
 But anyways, I keep going off in tangents.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.360
 There's just a lot of weird information.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.560
 The, well, not the Bronte stuff, but I could have cut that.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.720
 As it walks, it made a noise that went.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.880
 (snoring)

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.120
 And the noise was so noticeable

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.120
 that one of the slang terms for it

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.520
 was called the padfoot or the padded foot.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.760
 Because it would make the noise

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.840
 as if it was walking on pads.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.700
 So it wasn't just one person heard the noise.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.020
 They all heard the noise and some people said,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.780
 they should call it the padfoot.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.340
 And you think, why did they call it the guy trash?

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.020
 This is a weird detail as well.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.620
 And Alexandra said, this was her favorite part of the story.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.340
 The guy trash as it moves through the town,

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.420
 it would be watching you.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.620
 But if you noticed it and started walking towards it,

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.220
 it would begin walking backwards,

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.180
 staring at you the whole time.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.900
 You couldn't get close to the thing.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.720
 Sometimes right when you looked at it,

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.040
 it would simply take off.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.080
 And it would be noticed to jump into water.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.800
 So it'll jump into a well,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.680
 it'll jump into a river, a pond, anything.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.480
 Your cup of noodles that you just cooked,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.460
 you got a guy trash in it now.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.360
 But the reason, and again, this was such an oddity

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.960
 to all that stuff, like seeing a spirit

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.840
 and having to jump in the water.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.480
 Water is generally very connected to the spirit world.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.040
 This was very interesting to me.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.400
 And it kind of like, kind of trips you out

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.620
 when you think about reality.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.980
 Sometimes the guy trash,

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.120
 instead of running to the nearest water source,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.780
 would run towards you and then jump and dive

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.620
 right at your feet.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.100
 So you think you're about to get mauled by this creature,

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.100
 but before it gets you,

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.860
 it would jump and dive right by your feet

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.380
 and it would disappear as if it was diving into water

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.180
 that you're standing on top of.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.780
 And it did that so often

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.300
 that that's why it's named the guy trash.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.660
 Some people say that's the reason

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.500
 why it's called the guy trash.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.460
 Not that it would jump in there and guide trash would appear.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.460
 'Cause that noise, guy trash.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:11.320
 As it jumped and disappeared right at your feet,

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.140
 it would sound like someone dropped a heavy stone

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.480
 into a lake.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.320
 Guy trash.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:21.320
 That is so bizarre to have such a noisy spirit

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.220
 that is so common.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.900
 'Cause we don't call ghosts chainies

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.380
 because they rattle chains all the time.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.800
 You have other names for them.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.980
 But this one, if that story is true,

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.000
 and they think that that's where the name guy trash comes

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.860
 from 'cause they can't really find any other evidence

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.500
 of why that name is that.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.820
 Is that so many people had experienced that

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.100
 and it would jump and it would splash

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.860
 into the solid concrete at your feet

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.100
 as if it wasn't concrete back then it was dirt,

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.140
 but it would jump into the earth

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.100
 and it would make a noise.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.820
 (imitates noise)

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.620
 And it happened so often people would be like,

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.740
 "What is that thing that's chasing us down the street?"

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.740
 And trying to go get some milk.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.860
 That happened so often people just started calling it

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.940
 the guy trash.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:02.820
 Super bizarre.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.180
 It has a lot of elements that really set it apart

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.140
 from normal cryptids or normal ghosts.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.380
 The fact that everyone can see them

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.300
 is not really known among cryptids.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.700
 Normally they hide.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.280
 They're, I mean, these things will disappear

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.420
 when you start to interact with them,

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.740
 but you know what I mean?

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.140
 It's kind of on the border between the fairy lore,

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.340
 the elves and stuff like that

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.500
 where people interacted with them

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.380
 and they were obviously harmful to people.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.900
 Gnomes were creepy.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.140
 It borders on the ghost

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.580
 because it has a ghostly presence

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.300
 that you're constantly referring it to as a specter.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.220
 And then it borders on the modern day cryptid

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.220
 where it's a creature that defies all logical explanation

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.340
 and it's kind of living in that realm.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:47.860
 And it's funny because it's happening at the time

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.180
 when society is becoming more industrialized.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.180
 It's like the last phase of the fairy legends

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.620
 and moving to the cryptid legends.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.260
 Very, very interesting creature.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.340
 But you ask, okay, is the dog running around

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.800
 is making this weird noise?

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.640
 What does it do?

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.860
 Which was really my question

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.580
 when I was reading the article.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.940
 I was like, okay, so what does this do?

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.780
 This is interesting,

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.700
 but if it just kind of like walks around town and splashes,

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.420
 that's just kind of a weird illusion.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.580
 Well, it can attack you

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.540
 and it has been known to attack people.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.140
 Ah, I got my people's governor.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.720
 I can't see.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.060
 But most likely seeing one is a bad omen.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.580
 Now, I can't think of anything.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.140
 I mean, it's pretty much a bad omen.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.540
 If you get attacked by something,

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.460
 you're like, oh, I should have seen this coming.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.180
 I saw the bad omen and then it attacked me.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:39.060
 But generally it meant that you or someone in your family

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.020
 was going to experience something really bad.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.160
 Most likely a death soon

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.620
 when you saw one of these creatures.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.380
 And remember, these things are seen so consistently

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.320
 all over the place that people are constantly,

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.260
 it basically in a state of fear.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.620
 Everyone seeing them,

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.880
 that stuff's happening all the time.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.200
 It's really, really tough to live back then.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.800
 Imagine if every time you opened the door,

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.280
 you saw a bad omen.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.040
 But because these things were around for so long,

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.560
 they were seen between the 18th

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.200
 and 19th century.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.120
 They really were able to kind of zone in on,

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.400
 it's almost like they were able to study these things

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.560
 from a zoological perspective.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.880
 They were able to come down to,

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.040
 this is what it looks like,

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.160
 this is what it does,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.020
 this is what happens when you startle it,

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.680
 this is what happens when you chase it.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.000
 This is how it gets away.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.280
 If there's no water available,

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.200
 this is how it gets away.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.120
 It's very, I mean, it's quite detailed.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.280
 We don't even know that stuff about Bigfoot.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.980
 Like what do you do if you run into Bigfoot?

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.720
 What does a Bigfoot do when it runs into you?

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.540
 How does it get away?

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.080
 I mean, they can just go, well, he walks away.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.900
 These ones actually have like exit routes for this thing.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.480
 They've also been able to zone in

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.160
 exactly where it tends to show up.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.000
 This is cool.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.400
 I didn't know this phrase before

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.280
 until I read this article.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.440
 It said that it shows up in liminal places,

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.440
 which are basically gateways.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.280
 So it would show up at thresholds,

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.680
 it would show up at gates,

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.680
 it would show up at tunnels,

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.400
 it would show up outside like the gate of a graveyard

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.040
 or outside the archway of a church.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.240
 It's very, very interesting.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.920
 They were really able to go when they see it.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.200
 You're like, hey,

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.440
 probably shouldn't have walked by that open doorway

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.160
 because I didn't want any bad omens tonight

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.760
 and there is a guy trash.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.000
 Now it also, and you go,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.880
 okay, well, just stay away from all arches,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.960
 stay away from McDonald's,

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.800
 don't go anywhere near where there's an opening,

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.760
 but liminal also includes,

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.620
 I mean, liminal really is like borders.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.440
 So it could show up at a street crossing.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.880
 It could show up at a county line.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.200
 You could be walking and you could cross your property line

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.600
 into your neighbor's property line

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.560
 and you look over there

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.560
 and there's this hulking black dog

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.140
 with giant eyeballs just staring at you.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.680
 So that's why they were everywhere

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.760
 because boundaries is what makes up society

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.680
 and these creatures would be where there are boundaries.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.640
 And so generally you would have,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.320
 some towns had a guy trash

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.360
 and they would be like,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.120
 and then there would be at the same time

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.000
 and other guy trash in a neighboring town.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.840
 But like I said earlier,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.200
 some of the towns were so populated by these things,

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.240
 individual streets had its own guy trash.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.120
 So you could have someone seeing the main guy trash

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.480
 down at the city hall

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.800
 while there's just a guy trash

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.480
 that walks down your street,

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.320
 which is the worst.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.400
 That means you basically live

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.840
 in the worst neighborhood possible

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.720
 where there is a bad omen constantly

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.720
 just like hanging out in your front yard.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.480
 He's also a shapeshifter,

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.280
 which again, isn't out of the realm of the fantasy

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.920
 and the 40 and stuff like that.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.040
 But the shapes that this guy seems to take are quite odd

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.440
 'cause I was like, okay, he's a dog.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.720
 Maybe he turns into a hot chick.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.120
 Maybe he turns into a frog, something like that.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.760
 These are the other forms then.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.960
 I don't know how they knew it was the guy trash

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.680
 or a guy trash in this form.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.800
 I'm assuming that it's the appearance that it took

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.320
 or the presence that it gave you

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.760
 'cause some of these are really weird.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.880
 It showed up once as an evil cow

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.760
 and terrorized the people of this town

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.880
 to the point where their guy trash basically

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.360
 just always stayed as an evil cow.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.520
 Once, and this was another,

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.160
 I think it was Bronte again

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.720
 in between being and his sister,

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.160
 he noticed that in his area,

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.000
 sometimes the guy trash would turn

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.480
 into a burning barrel rolling down a hill,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.480
 which is so specific.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.440
 And I imagine if you're in the middle of nowhere,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.360
 which was basically how you would describe Eileen back then,

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.940
 and you looked out your window,

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.540
 if you saw a burning barrel rolling down the hill,

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.320
 the first thing you do is to roll over

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.200
 and wake up your sister and be like, hey, hey, wake up,

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.520
 Emily, look at this.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.160
 And you would think it was a weird event.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.400
 But if you kept seeing it

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.920
 and then you weren't seeing the normal spectral dog

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.960
 running around your neighborhood,

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.120
 you probably connect, hey,

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.440
 maybe that might be the guy trash.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.720
 Maybe it started rolling up hill

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.600
 or doing weird stuff

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.240
 or chasing people around the neighborhood.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.880
 And that is actually not as odd

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.440
 as the next form that it took.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.680
 It also took a rabbit, so that's kind of cool,

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.520
 but it's not even the oddest form that it took.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.040
 In one town, the guy trash became

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.040
 a dirty white rag on a branch.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.080
 So it's just like a branch

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.400
 and there's a white rag hanging from it, dripping,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.520
 and people are like, it's a bad old,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.360
 and that's the guy trash.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.480
 That's such a bizarre form for it to take.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.280
 But the people believed in that area

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.200
 that that was the guy trash.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.240
 But maybe it stayed up there for weeks or months.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.160
 I don't know.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.820
 It would seem, that to me, seems like pure superstition.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.120
 The rag one, it could have actually been

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.320
 a shape-shifting creature,

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.280
 but that more seems like one day I looked out

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.960
 and I saw a white rag on a stick

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.520
 and I had bad luck.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.920
 I fell and stung my toe the next day.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.400
 Therefore, that might be the guy trash.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.960
 And then no one wanted to take it down

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.880
 'cause they were afraid it was the mythical monster.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.480
 That sounds a lot like a complete superstition.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.720
 But the guy trash did eventually disappear.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.240
 And some people say it was related

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.580
 to the people in the areas getting more educated.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.780
 Some people say that it was related to electricity,

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.860
 more lighting in the neighborhoods, scared 'em off.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.440
 It was no longer their hunting grounds.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.680
 It's interesting to think that living in a,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.600
 I know rural areas tend to get really dark at night,

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.960
 but it's interesting to think there was a time

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.920
 where there was masses of people living together

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.320
 and it was like, unless you're in front of a candle,

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.600
 it was pitch black.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.280
 And then it was oddly enough, one author, not Bronte,

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.080
 but one author said that, he said that the guy trash,

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.360
 here's his quote here, "left Horton

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.560
 when the district was incorporated

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.600
 as it had grown jealous of the policemen."

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.440
 That's kinda weird.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.520
 I didn't know it was like Batman.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.960
 Maybe it figured the idea that the policemen

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.080
 were now patrolling the area,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.160
 but the guy trash wasn't like a silent guardian,

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.000
 a dark knight.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.160
 He was just like this jerk that kinda caused bad luck

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.020
 and would sometimes attack you.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.840
 So you're like, okay, there is the legend of the guy trash,

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.680
 but what's interesting is there is actually

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.400
 a recent news article where a woman was taking a photograph

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.200
 of a man walking up a stairway into an NA tunnel.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.240
 So it's like a tunnel that has a stairway into it

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.080
 for whatever reason.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.640
 And she takes a photo of the guy for whatever reason.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.160
 She's a total creeper, she has her own website.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.480
 And in the corner of the photo,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.480
 right at the threshold of the tunnel is a guy trash.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:26.220
 Now, that's what the photographer says,

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.480
 and that's what the newspaper is claiming it to be.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.520
 It looks like a pile of trash.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.720
 It doesn't look like a spectral dog.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.440
 I mean, I guess if you really squinted, you could see it.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.800
 But I looked at the photo for quite a long time,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.000
 and I just couldn't really make out the details.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.560
 It was big and it was black and it was lumpy.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.320
 And if that's what dogs look like over there,

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.080
 then I think they have bigger problems

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.200
 than mythical black omens running around.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:01.360
 I wonder if spirits can go extinct.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.240
 Now, and that's gonna sound like a weird thing,

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.400
 and I'm using the word spirits

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.960
 in kind of a general catch-all phrase.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.200
 I think I've always been to the,

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.080
 I think I've always had the understanding

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.120
 that if elves were real and gnomes were real

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.720
 and all this stuff, that they did exist for a time

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.200
 alongside humanity and these little alcoves.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.400
 And humans would run into one from time to time,

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.160
 and that's where a lot of these legends come from,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.720
 little kids' babies being shape-shifted and stuff like that.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.320
 And I just always assumed, and then they left.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.760
 I have always had this idea

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.360
 that it's been this kind of Lord of the Rings thing,

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.500
 whereas basically once the age of man came,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.560
 then they just set out his places and for us,

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.440
 and they either went deeper into hiding

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.320
 or they left our realm or whatever.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.120
 If, assuming they existed, assuming they existed at all,

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.280
 I've always kind of had that childlike idea that

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.760
 maybe they just, you know, said,

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.680
 "Okay, we're gonna leave, we'll leave England now

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.960
 as little fairy folk,

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.440
 and we'll find another realm to live in, another dimension."

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:07.440
 Little fairy people and their black spectral dogs and gnomes.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.380
 And unicorns, man.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.500
 I never really thought about them going extinct.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.760
 I never really thought like there was a last unicorn,

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.100
 which is a great movie, but I never really imagined,

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.500
 like there was a last unicorn that was like killed by a hunter.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.140
 I imagined eventually the unicorns just left.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.660
 And I don't know if that's very childlike of me,

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.620
 but it's funny to bring it back to this is like,

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:34.700
 imagine that the guide trash, these creatures were real,

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.460
 that it wasn't just mass hallucination

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.380
 from ergot poisoning.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.040
 And then they lived there long before humans spread

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.360
 to that area, but no one was around to notice them.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.840
 And then the humans built up their little towns there,

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.320
 and they're like, "We're not going anywhere."

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.160
 And they stayed there,

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.860
 and it was still technically their place.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:59.160
 But then night time started to become daytime,

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.240
 and the darkness that was their home that comforted them

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.260
 was being taken away block by block by block.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.160
 It's weird to think that out of all the species

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.880
 and all the civilizations that humanity has waged war against

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.120
 and the species have died off

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.020
 and those empires have fallen

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.760
 and their history completely forgotten,

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.920
 alongside all of that chaos,

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.920
 maybe there are like unknown graveyards of these creatures

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.300
 that either were slaughtered

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.360
 or simply just ceased to exist.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.740
 I guess really the reason why I'm kind of having

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.520
 this realization now is until I really got to the guide trash,

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.540
 I never really thought of these things.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.840
 They've always been more in the realm of fantasy

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.280
 than reality.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.180
 And I'm not saying I believe the guide trash is real,

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.900
 but I find it interesting how much specific information

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.560
 they have on these things,

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.380
 as opposed to stuff like the Pombero or Unicorn

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.980
 or La Lorna or whatever.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.180
 They're always just kind of these things that pop up

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.660
 and people make up a legend about it

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.140
 or they hear something and da da da da

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.780
 and everything's kind of left very vague.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.900
 These things are so specific.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.580
 It really makes me think that they could have existed

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.980
 in a logical fashion.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.900
 And if that's true,

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.720
 then we may be responsible for the extinction

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.140
 of a species from another dimension,

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.680
 simply by turning our lights on.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.000
 It really makes you wonder what the world was really like

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.680
 at night two, 300 years ago.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.640
 When the sun set and the world fell dark,

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.460
 what lived in that darkness alongside humanity

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.700
 for hundreds of thousands of years

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.700
 that we now regard as simple fables and legends?

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.260
 It's hard to imagine even when you live

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.880
 in a rural area today,

00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.880
 how dark the entire world was a short time ago.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.960
 Did the darkness and the unknown

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.720
 create these myths and legends?

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.280
 Or were all these stories of creatures

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.260
 based on what people were really seeing

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.320
 on the edges of their civilization?

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.260
 I guess we'll find out

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.260
 if the lights ever do go out again.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.580
 Some horrible catastrophe,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.080
 some nuclear war,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.520
 and once again power is removed from the planet.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.660
 When the sun sets on that first night

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.200
 and the world again is bathed in darkness,

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.720
 we will know then how true

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.800
 these stories of monsters and the dark really are.
