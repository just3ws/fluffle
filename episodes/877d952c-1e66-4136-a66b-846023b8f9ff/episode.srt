1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,680
 Mental health parity is the law requiring health insurance coverage for mental health

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,480
 or substance use disorders that is no more restrictive than your physical health coverage.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,600
 That means if you're dealing with depression or anxiety, your access to mental health coverage

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,560
 is comparable to your access to physical health coverage for a broken arm or leg.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,900
 It's important to learn and understand the laws that protect you when you use your health

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,480
 insurance for treatment.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
 Know your rights.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,680
 Go to GetCoveredIllinois.gov for more information on mental health parity.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,640
 Authorities are baffled when they find the charred remains of a man who may have willingly

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,880
 crawled into a boiler and then we take a look at two pieces of technology.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,920
 One is haunted by the soul of a dead man.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,320
 The other one is haunted by the voices in your head.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,320
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
 I'm having a great day.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,800
 One thing that I want to do is I want to recognize people who help support the show in whatever

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
 way.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,280
 You guys know I do the Patreon shoutouts?

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,320
 But as I was looking through my YouTube channel, a lot of people have donated through

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
 the Super Chat.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,200
 Very, very generous donations, especially during the Thanksgiving livestream.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,680
 I want to give you guys shoutouts too.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,920
 So I'm going to sprinkle you guys in among the Patreons.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,400
 But if you donated during the Thanksgiving livestream or other livestreams that I still

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,360
 have access to, you'll get your chance to fly the Carpenter copter because I think that's

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
 fair.

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
 I really appreciate the support.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,480
 So first off, let's give a shoutout to one of our livestream supporters, the Rampart.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,840
 Everyone give a round of applause to the Rampart.

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
 He's doing the robot.

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
 He's knocking over stuff.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
 What is a Rampart?

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
 Is it a wall?

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
 He's just standing there.

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,240
 He's perfectly motionless.

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,440
 Rampart, you are going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,960
 If you can't support the show financially, I totally get it.

41
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,800
 Just help spread the word about the show.

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,560
 That helps out tremendously.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,120
 So we're finally getting to start tickling the Rampart so he starts moving.

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,120
 Rampart, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
 We are driving up to Bellingham, Washington.

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,160
 Jalopy is going down the dusty roads.

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,800
 So I got this story from a YouTube listener named BBBH.

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,160
 So I got to give you a tip of the hat for recommending this.

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,320
 I had never heard of this before.

50
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,600
 It's a creepy little mystery.

51
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,280
 I also want to give a little tip of the hat to Dean Kahn.

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,320
 He's a journalist for the Bellingham Herald and a lot of my information I got from an

53
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,840
 article that he wrote.

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,240
 So let's dig into this one.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,400
 Rampart is driving us up to Bellingham, Washington.

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,040
 And as we're going there, we're going to hit that little time travel button.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,200
 We're back in the year 1987, specifically, September 20, 1987.

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,640
 Car pulls up, Twin Peaks music is playing.

59
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
 It's beautiful.

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
 It's super creepy.

61
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,880
 We keep waiting to see Killer Bob in the backseat.

62
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,200
 He's not in the backseat though.

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,680
 He's hiding underneath your bed.

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,200
 Guys, sweet dreams.

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,680
 Killer Bob's waiting for you.

66
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,520
 We are headed up to Georgia Pacific's waterfront mill.

67
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,960
 Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,480
 Little mill there.

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,240
 Really slow opening credit sequence.

70
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,280
 I started watching Twin Peaks again, so it's on my mind.

71
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,400
 If you haven't watched it yet, watch it.

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,520
 The Georgia Pacific's waterfront mill, what they do is they burn, they make steam.

73
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
 They make steam there.

74
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
 They put it in a box.

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,800
 If you ever bought steam, you probably bought it from Georgia Pacific Mill.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,200
 I don't actually really know what they do.

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,920
 I have in my notes that they burn fuels to make steam to power the mill.

78
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,080
 But why don't you just use the fuel to power the mill?

79
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,760
 Why are you burning wood to make steam?

80
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,040
 And then there's like a big steam machine, a big giant steam punk robot up there carrying

81
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
 around logs.

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,960
 Just burn stuff and then make stuff go.

83
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
 Make stuff go.

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,920
 You're like, "Hey, this is not how science works.

85
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,800
 You just can't throw wood into a fire and then your car starts."

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 I don't know.

87
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
 We can debate.

88
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
 We can debate the science behind it.

89
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,160
 Anyway, so this is a place to create steam.

90
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,000
 There's 10 boilers in this place.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,120
 And we're going to look at boiler number nine.

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,880
 So we're walking around this Georgia Pacific mill.

93
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,400
 There's a couple employees there.

94
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,040
 Everyone is kind of in their office.

95
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
 It's quite a noisy place.

96
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
 So when people are working there, they're just kind of away.

97
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,280
 They play a really good game of hide and go seek.

98
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,320
 Actually, that kind of leads into what this story is.

99
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,080
 We're walking into the mill and we see 10 boilers.

100
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
 They're about 10.

101
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,560
 They're, it's about like a 10 foot square box.

102
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,600
 But it's up to, it's 20 feet tall.

103
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,360
 So it's like 10 feet around.

104
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
 This is science podcast.

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,240
 It's like a 10 foot by 10 foot box, but it's 20 feet tall.

106
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,560
 The reason why we're here in September 20th, 1987, is because a bunch of cops are here

107
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
 as well.

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,800
 They got a phone call from the mill.

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,120
 They opened the top gate of the boiler and they looked down and the workers like, "Yep.

110
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,480
 That's what I saw."

111
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
 And there.

112
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
 This is this guy's first acting job.

113
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,120
 He's looking at the camera.

114
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
 It's in there.

115
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 The director's like, "What?

116
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
 You're not even, there's not even a director.

117
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,600
 Why are you acting so weird?"

118
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,760
 There's a body in there.

119
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,840
 And the cops are looking down there and what they see is it's about a 20 foot drop.

120
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,200
 There's a layer of pipes before you hit the ground level and laying there is a human body.

121
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,640
 The cops are like doing Roshanbo to see us and crawling and crawling and getting the body.

122
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,960
 The body is of an unidentified man who's been cooked.

123
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,920
 It's been cooked so much that it's partially skeletonized.

124
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,120
 So you see bones sticking out and stuff like that and then it's all sizzling.

125
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,200
 I don't think there are still steam lines coming off of them.

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,640
 But definitely dead, definitely cooked.

127
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,840
 What's interesting is they're looking at the body and they go, "Okay."

128
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,160
 We don't know who this is.

129
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
 We can make some guesses.

130
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,080
 25 to 35 year old man, we think is probably about 5 foot 8, 5 foot 9.

131
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,920
 Very slight man though.

132
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,840
 130 to 155 pounds.

133
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,120
 So that's kind of like their first thing when they take it back and they do the autopsy.

134
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,560
 They start to realize stuff.

135
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,880
 Two broken thigh bones.

136
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,600
 And they're like, "Well that might happen if you fall 20 feet onto a bunch of pipes."

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,280
 Right arm is broken.

138
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,320
 They noticed that whoever this was took their jacket off and placed it underneath them.

139
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,800
 They tore their shirt off and wrapped it around their leg as some sort of splint.

140
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
 But most chilling of all is he had socks on his hands.

141
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,920
 So the cops are looking at each other and they're like, "You know the sock puppet show

142
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,760
 ended last week and the other cops like, "I know.

143
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
 I know I went to it.

144
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
 I took my kids to it.

145
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
 It was awesome."

146
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,440
 So this guy wasn't here for the sock puppet show and they're like, "No."

147
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,120
 What this man, the reason why this man had socks on his hands is with the cops believe

148
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,120
 is he tried to crawl out as the boiler was activating.

149
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,040
 The boiler reaches 370 degrees when it's turned on.

150
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,720
 All that steam enveloping your body, you think you're reenacting that scene from Empire Strikes

151
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,640
 Back on someone on the Carbonite.

152
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,760
 This is the worst kind of cosplay because it kills you.

153
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,400
 They think that this guy, these are their theories that it was, I do just wanted to really hang

154
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,840
 out inside of a boiler and they turned it on.

155
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,240
 He's like, "Oh, this is awesome place."

156
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,280
 He put no posters and stuff like that.

157
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,160
 And then he hears like a time note activate boiler nine.

158
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
 He's like, "Uh-oh."

159
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,440
 They think it's that, that a guy did it willingly too, that he was dead before he was thrown

160
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
 in there.

161
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,640
 But that's when the cops are like, "Well, we know the sock puppet festival already

162
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,240
 ended so that doesn't make sense."

163
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,680
 He was probably alive when he went in there, but it's possible that somebody threw him

164
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
 in there.

165
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,200
 Somebody beat him up, broke his legs.

166
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,080
 Because 20 feet you can break your legs, but he broke his thigh bones.

167
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,920
 That's a pr- I mean, you could do it.

168
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,480
 They also said it's possible that his legs were broken when somebody threw him into the

169
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,880
 boiler.

170
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,280
 But whatever the case, they figure he had enough wear with all to try to protect himself

171
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,040
 from the scorching heat.

172
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,480
 So he throws a jacket underneath him to kind of protect himself from the pipes with that

173
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,440
 super hot water running through the pipes.

174
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,600
 And with the socks on his hands was trying to crawl out and it didn't- they don't know-

175
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,760
 well they know how he died.

176
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,320
 He got cooked, but they don't know when he died.

177
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,360
 So they don't know who it is.

178
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,560
 They don't know how they got in there.

179
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,920
 Oddly enough, like almost like if this wasn't a novel you would think it was fake.

180
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,080
 He was burned up, he was cooked.

181
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,880
 But it's like a steamer.

182
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,000
 It's not like Freddy Kruger's flame factory.

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,200
 In the boiler, there was a ticket for an airplane, continental airline ticket.

184
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,000
 But it was not scorched so much that you couldn't read what airline it was, but it was scorched

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,880
 enough that you couldn't see registration number, seat number, name, nothing like that.

186
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,440
 It was just a tantalizing clue of who this could be.

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,000
 Their theories are suicide, curiosity, murder, or a prank.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,360
 One of the theories that came up later on was someone said, "Hey listen, we are a bunch

189
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,400
 of urban explorers and normally we go into abandoned things, but we really like living

190
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 on the edge.

191
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,680
 We used to go into the mill and sneak around because it's a pretty cool place."

192
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,200
 We actually paid off an employee because there wasn't a lot of employees, it was super loud,

193
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,320
 everyone had their own little office they would hide in.

194
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,760
 You'd have these people go in and they'd kind of be like, "Hey look at this, we're gonna

195
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,680
 come during the tour but it's way goolier at night."

196
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
 An employee let him in.

197
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,840
 This guy tells the story that one summer, some out of towner from New York showed up and

198
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
 wanted to join us.

199
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,040
 And we said, "Yeah, you can join us, it's really cool, but you gotta be careful because

200
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,480
 we're not supposed to be here."

201
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,400
 Our employee who we pay to let us in, he has a signal that when he blows it, we get out

202
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,240
 of there and we have this predetermined meeting spot and then newcomer is like, "Yeah, sure,

203
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
 I'm totally down."

204
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,640
 So then they go inside and I don't know what you would do in a place that, I mean it's

205
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,840
 not like an abandoned and st.

206
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,160
 asylum, it's a functional mill that people are working in but they would go in and they'd

207
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,880
 sneak around and then the warning thing was blown and everyone ran out but the New Yorker

208
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
 never came out.

209
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,480
 And they were like, "Okay, okay, he's from New York, he can probably take care of himself."

210
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,800
 And this group went home, they went their separate ways.

211
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,720
 So when the police heard the story, they began looking into missing people from New York,

212
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
 matching that description.

213
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,760
 They narrowed it down to like five people but none of them could ever really be confirmed

214
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,040
 to be the man in the boiler.

215
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,680
 And that seemed to be it for a long time.

216
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,800
 This mystery hadn't been solved.

217
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,440
 But in 2006, there was a man named Richard Severson who always had his suspicions about

218
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,520
 this event.

219
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,160
 He worked at the Western Washington University.

220
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,320
 He was a steam engineer at the steam plant at that university.

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
 And he tells this story to a journalist.

222
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,360
 He says back in 1987, this summer, a woman was on the tour of this, there was multiple

223
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,920
 people but one of them happened to be this woman who was on the tour that he was giving

224
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,480
 at the steam plant.

225
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,840
 He says she was about 30 to 40 years old.

226
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,920
 She was about five foot six tall, she's a very wiry woman.

227
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,400
 And you know, you didn't really think anything of her, she's just walking around and stuff.

228
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,680
 And then we got to one of the boilers and she said, "Can I crawl into that?"

229
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,240
 And he's like, "Yeah, I mean sure, hey let me open this little gate for you, it's not

230
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,160
 an operation you can crawl in."

231
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,720
 And he goes, she crawled in and then she got back out.

232
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,240
 He's like, "Okay tour group, let's go look at this next boiler that's identical to this

233
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
 one."

234
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,960
 But she crawled back into the boiler and the guy's like, "Dude, you can't, come on,

235
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
 get out of there."

236
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
 And then she crawled back out.

237
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,920
 And then she crawled back into the boiler and crawled back out.

238
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,640
 And this went on and on and on and she kept coming in and out of the boiler.

239
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,200
 Eventually Richard kicked her out.

240
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,120
 "So you gotta get out of here, I got a tour to run, very professional guy, I went to college

241
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,920
 for this, I got my degree in tourism.

242
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,400
 You gotta get out of here."

243
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,240
 And as she's leaving he says, "Why don't you go to the Georgia Pacific mill?"

244
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,920
 And the reason why he said that, one, because he just wanted her off the property, but

245
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,200
 two he goes, "I know they have security there."

246
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
 And they do have security there.

247
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,080
 But you know, it's security at a mill.

248
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,360
 It's not security at a top secret NSA base.

249
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,400
 So he said that and he goes a couple weeks later he had heard about this body being found

250
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,880
 and he waited until 2006 to tell this story.

251
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,800
 He was kind of thinking about it.

252
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,860
 But the interesting thing was he kept telling himself, "But the person I saw was a woman

253
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,400
 and they keep saying it was a man."

254
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,840
 To this day they have no idea who this person is or was.

255
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,520
 They have absolutely no idea who it is.

256
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,800
 So after a very long nap that I just took, I took a nap dude.

257
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,920
 And so how many of us sucks?

258
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,080
 I've been up all night.

259
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,920
 Eventually I had to go to sleep.

260
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,120
 So I'm basically sleeping in the factory in the Georgia Pacific mill and everyone's kind

261
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,960
 of standing around and I'm all comfy.

262
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,400
 I have a little Veronica doll cuddled up.

263
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,800
 You're like, "Dude come on man, we gotta listen to this podcast to start nudging me

264
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
 with your foot."

265
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
 Sorry guys, sorry guys.

266
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,200
 Rampart call in that carboner copter.

267
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,720
 We are leaving behind the Georgia Pacific mill.

268
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,960
 I think that's what it's called.

269
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,480
 Like I said, just woke up from a nap.

270
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,240
 We are headed out to an arcade.

271
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
 We're flying around for hours.

272
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,840
 We can't find an arcade.

273
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
 Eventually we do find one.

274
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,080
 There is an arcade in Alameda.

275
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,680
 I lived in Alameda for a time.

276
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,080
 There's an arcade down there.

277
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
 That's really cool.

278
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,760
 I think you pay like five bucks and you can stay there all day.

279
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,680
 Wouldn't have that been a dream when we were kids dude?

280
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,320
 Anyways, we're walking into the arcade.

281
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
 We're super cool.

282
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 We got under leather jackets.

283
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,160
 We're pushing everyone aside because we're headed straight for the NBA Jam game.

284
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
 It's two on two guys.

285
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,800
 Actually that's sound effects for space invaders.

286
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
 He's on fire.

287
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 Oh yeah.

288
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 Punch it in the hole.

289
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
 Ball in.

290
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,760
 I actually never liked.

291
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,720
 I never liked NBA Jam.

292
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,840
 I liked the artistry of it.

293
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,000
 I could obviously tell there was a lot of care into it.

294
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 What's the one like toasty?

295
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,200
 No, that was Mortal Kombat.

296
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,680
 He's on fire.

297
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,400
 Damn son.

298
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,760
 No, I wish they had had that sound clip back then.

299
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
 You had NBA Jam.

300
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,640
 If you don't know people are like what in the world is NBA Jam?

301
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,880
 Chachachachachachoke on it.

302
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
 It's a game.

303
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,120
 Basically imagine a normal basketball game, but the announcer is on the middle of some

304
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,440
 meth binge, three day meth binge.

305
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,080
 And all the players have like normal sized bodies and then oversized heads and you could

306
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,600
 do super moves.

307
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,120
 So I think if you had three uncontested shots, I don't remember this from playing the game

308
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,600
 because I never played it, but I was researching it.

309
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,640
 I think if you have three unchallenged shots in a row, you get firey flame.

310
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,200
 And then like that is the people are constantly yelling, yelling in your ear the whole time

311
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
 you played.

312
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 It's a game.

313
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,520
 I played it like maybe three or four times.

314
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,720
 Like because I enjoyed the artistry of it.

315
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,920
 I thought it was a really cool game, but I'm not into basketball.

316
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,400
 It's just not my cup of tea.

317
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,320
 It's not my butter and jam.

318
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,480
 People are like, I've already shut the podcast off.

319
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,360
 I'm tired of you yelling in my ear.

320
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
 Sorry.

321
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,520
 Anyway, so the people who made NBA Jam or midway, they made a ton of game.

322
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
 They made Mortal Kombat.

323
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,880
 NBA Jam actually made more money than Mortal Kombat.

324
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,760
 The reason why I'm talking about it on the paranormal podcast is as we've been playing

325
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,240
 this game, people are finally, and people are finally not cause I keep yelling.

326
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,120
 They're like, it's not even from that game, dude.

327
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,840
 Get your mortgage.

328
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,040
 They're like, what?

329
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,160
 People keep emptying from the arcade until eventually it's just us and all the lights

330
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,800
 are off and the only game that's being played right now is NBA Jam.

331
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,840
 And that's when I go, this is a perfect time for a ghost story.

332
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,240
 Plus I've lost all my quarters and I've lost all my $5 and broke.

333
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,520
 I can't play games anymore.

334
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,160
 Let's tell a ghost story.

335
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,280
 Back in May of 1993, this was actually from an interview with Mark Turmell.

336
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,840
 He is the lead game designer for midway.

337
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,040
 He did an interview with ESPN.

338
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,640
 It was a retrospective of the creation of NBA Jam.

339
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,560
 It came out in May 1993.

340
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:03,080
 In June of 1993, NBA player for the New Jersey Nets, Drozan Petrovic, died in a car accident.

341
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
 Absolutely tragic.

342
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
 He was a young man.

343
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,560
 He was considered one of the best shooting guards.

344
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,760
 I don't know what that is, but it's written in my notes.

345
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,720
 Regardless of his skill behind the ball, it's tragic that he passed away.

346
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,840
 Now he's one of the players in NBA Jam.

347
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
 You can play as Petrovic.

348
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,720
 Of course, they're like, "Oh, nope.

349
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 He's passed beyond the mortal coil.

350
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
 Delete his code."

351
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
 He's a big player.

352
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,920
 People are fans of his.

353
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,160
 So he's in the game.

354
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,440
 What happened one night was at Midway, at Midway Studios, they were playing one of their

355
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,400
 newest games, Mortal Kombat.

356
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,960
 "Y'all finish him.

357
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,480
 Toasty, finish him.

358
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,640
 Oh, flawless victory.

359
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
 See, I know all those ones.

360
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,280
 But as they're playing Mortal Kombat, the NBA Jam's next to it and it's running the

361
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
 demo screen.

362
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,160
 It's running the screen to kind of get people attracted to the machine and just out of nowhere

363
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
 goes Petrovic."

364
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,120
 Kind of look at each other.

365
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,480
 Now the game does yell out players' names.

366
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,520
 It was just kind of an eerie moment late at night.

367
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,680
 They're continuing to play Mortal Kombat.

368
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,280
 "Petrovic."

369
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
 Stop playing Mortal Kombat.

370
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
 They look over at the machine.

371
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,680
 Is Petrovic even on the screen?

372
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,040
 No, it's the demo screen.

373
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,000
 "Petrovic."

374
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,720
 The NBA Jam machine would call out the name Petrovic just at random times.

375
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,840
 And it would do it with no other player's name.

376
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,040
 You didn't have to be playing the game.

377
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,840
 It would just be running that mode trying to attract viewers.

378
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,200
 "Petrovic."

379
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,080
 Mark Teramel said we never were able to figure this out.

380
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,280
 And he goes, "This isn't a spooky ghost story for Midway that we tell the interns.

381
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:40,520
 If you have a first edition NBA Jam machine, it will yell out Petrovic at random intervals."

382
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,000
 The machine that was made right before he died is the only one that screams out his name

383
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,360
 in the middle of the night.

384
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,520
 It's a creepy ghost story.

385
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,040
 It's no doubt it's a creepy ghost story.

386
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,000
 And what's interesting, it's most likely some sort of glitch.

387
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,680
 But if it was yelling out Pippin over and over again, no one would know except for people

388
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
 who hate Pippin.

389
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,440
 Except for people who like the Detroit Pistons.

390
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,040
 But other than that, you wouldn't think anything of it.

391
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,200
 But you have this guy's name who had just died very recently being screamed out through

392
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
 this.

393
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,080
 Now the idea of a ghost possessing a computer, that's pretty standard.

394
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,080
 Maybe not necessarily a ghost, but we have something like Lawnmower Man or Lawnmower

395
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,880
 Man 2 or Game Over, which I saw in the theater.

396
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,280
 So all that was in the theater, not Lawnmower Man 2, that was in the theater.

397
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,600
 But Virtuosity, we always have these stories about technology being possessed or infiltrated

398
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
 by something.

399
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,480
 Well, let's take a look at a story that I think might be the creepiest version of this.

400
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,280
 It's trying to help people, but the implications are quite terrifying.

401
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,480
 Rampart lead the way, your strong wall-like body will protect us as we walk through the

402
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,360
 arcade and find ourselves in a research laboratory.

403
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,320
 We walk in, it's in London, so everyone's like Pip Pip Cheerio, they have beakers full

404
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,760
 of tea and stuff like that.

405
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,240
 We put on our lab coats and all of that.

406
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,880
 I want to give a shout out to the Twitter follower SnailWife.

407
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,000
 SnailWife recommended this story to me and it's absolutely fascinating.

408
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,440
 So thank you very much, SnailWife.

409
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,600
 We're walking through this laboratory and again, a shout out to the journalist who wrote

410
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,760
 this article, I'm going to be referencing a lot, Zion Gudim.

411
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,880
 I like giving people credit for what they do.

412
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,000
 So we're walking through this laboratory and it's actually a laboratory that's specifically

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,600
 for mental issues.

414
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,440
 So they probably don't have beakers sitting around.

415
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,520
 They're like dipping brain and fluid.

416
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,120
 They're like, "Hmm, let's see how this brain does when I put it in turpentine.

417
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
 It melts."

418
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,520
 It's Roger Rabbit's brain.

419
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,640
 Schizophrenia, 1% of the world's population they believe has schizophrenia and hearing

420
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,160
 voices is the most common symptom of schizophrenia.

421
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,480
 I think that's this most stereotypical one too.

422
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,580
 That's the one you think of if someone tells you they have schizophrenia, which generally

423
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,680
 people won't tell you that.

424
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,360
 But I think from movies and stuff like that, you think the general going crazy and then

425
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,920
 the hearing voices.

426
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,240
 70% of schizophrenics report auditory hallucinations.

427
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,680
 So in 2017 at King's College London, they developed this program called the Avatar

428
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,360
 Therapy Program.

429
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,320
 So what they do is they're going to sit someone down in front of a computer and they go, "The

430
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,400
 voices in your head are very distressing to you, right?

431
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,720
 They're getting in the way of your life.

432
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
 They're scary.

433
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,760
 They're making you think things you don't want to think."

434
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,600
 What does that voice look like?

435
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,480
 And so then using a character creation tool from Skyrim or Saints Row the Third, people

436
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,440
 will build what they think the voice in their head looks like.

437
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,040
 Now it's not the whole body.

438
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,360
 It's not like mine is a mage and he has a big flowing robe and a giant staff.

439
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,440
 It's just the head.

440
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,640
 But with all these sliders you can give him hair, make the eyes bulge out or just kind

441
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,280
 of beady or somewhere in between.

442
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,520
 Use these sliders to do that.

443
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,640
 So now you've created this, the voice in your head that you've been suffering with since

444
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,360
 you were 20, you're now looking at on a monitor in front of you.

445
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,400
 And then the researcher goes, "Okay, what does the voice sound like?"

446
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,760
 And the doctor begins speaking in a microphone and again there's a bunch of sliders there

447
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,360
 that they can change the pitch and the tone and the speed and all of this stuff.

448
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,520
 Is this him?

449
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,680
 Is this him?

450
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,160
 Is this him?

451
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,280
 Is this him?

452
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,280
 Yes, that's the voice.

453
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,880
 This is him.

454
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,960
 Is this what the voice in your head sounds like?

455
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,040
 Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

456
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,200
 It's so spooky and I'm telling you right now.

457
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,080
 There's articles in the show notes.

458
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,280
 They show one of these therapy sessions and the face that is staring out from the computer

459
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,760
 monitor looks like a voice in your head.

460
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
 It looks creepy.

461
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,880
 It looks like a guy you would run into at a bus stop and immediately be sketched out

462
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
 about.

463
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,280
 Like, it's really creepy.

464
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,880
 If you had to imagine, I don't have voices in my head, but if you had to imagine what

465
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,040
 a voice in your head would look like, it would look like that.

466
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
 It looks human.

467
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,200
 It's human.

468
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,240
 There's something like a little dark, a little demonic about it around the eyes.

469
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,680
 But that's not it.

470
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
 It's so creepy.

471
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,720
 So what they do, when I say creepy, it's amazing.

472
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,280
 This is actually incredibly beneficial for the people who use it.

473
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,960
 They've done tons of studies with this and the doctors say, you do six sessions, each

474
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,760
 one's only 10 minutes.

475
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,560
 So you do, over six weeks you have one 10 minute session each week and you talk back

476
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,440
 to it.

477
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,040
 So the doctor's sitting in the room and he's going, "You're fat.

478
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,280
 You'll always be fat.

479
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
 You're a big fat nothing loser."

480
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,920
 This is research assistance walking by.

481
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
 There's no one sitting in the chair.

482
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,880
 They're like, "Oh, I have to put it on a little bit of weight."

483
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
 The doctor's like, "Hehehe."

484
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,440
 No, he brings a patient and he's a professional.

485
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,960
 Patient sits down and he goes, "You want to hurt yourself, don't you?

486
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,520
 You want to do these bad things.

487
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,080
 You're a bad person.

488
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
 Nobody loves you.

489
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
 Nobody loves you."

490
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,760
 And it's the voice you hear in your head.

491
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,480
 But now you're seeing a 3D representation of that face.

492
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,520
 It's all like Lawnmower Man graphics.

493
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,000
 And you're hearing that voice come out of the speakers and it's your job as the patient

494
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,080
 to go, "No, I'm a good person and I've never done anything wrong except that one time I

495
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,440
 stole those Girl Scout cookies from my niece.

496
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,360
 But that's between me and me and my niece voice into my head."

497
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,280
 And you begin talking back to the head.

498
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,520
 Now what happens is over the course of these six sessions, at first the doctor's like,

499
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,040
 "Oh, you're nothing.

500
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,480
 You're absolutely nothing."

501
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,120
 But at session two, session three, as the patient begins standing up to the face, it

502
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,160
 goes, "I guess you're right."

503
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,200
 And then it will start to complain, "How come I don't have any power over you anymore?"

504
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,280
 "I'm in control, but now you're so strong."

505
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
 That'd be awesome if there's like a fade away button.

506
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,280
 They're like, "No, no, I'm going back to the nether, no!"

507
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,440
 And then it's like all sound effects, "Doo!"

508
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
 Game over screen.

509
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,640
 They did a full study.

510
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,440
 75 people doing that and 75 people doing alternative theories.

511
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,600
 Now to the people who just did this, nine of them completely stopped hearing the voices.

512
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,760
 They've never come back.

513
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,320
 And then you had a large majority, more than the alternative treatment people, that the

514
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,200
 voices got less distressing.

515
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,080
 They got less noticeable.

516
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,760
 By standing up to these voices in the computer, they were able to actually start to confront

517
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
 it.

518
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,280
 And the doctors like, "Listen, schizophrenia is something that is not a one size fits

519
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,120
 all thing and we know that.

520
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,680
 We've been doing medication for years, people still hear voices.

521
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,840
 We've been doing therapy for years, we still hear voices."

522
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,400
 Our therapy is not the cure for this.

523
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,760
 He goes, "This with medicine, this with therapy can change your life."

524
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,880
 We're not saying this is the thing, but he goes, "I believe in a few years this will

525
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,400
 just be part of any psychiatrist's toolbox.

526
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,560
 You'll have this equipment at your place."

527
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,400
 Because it's just a computer program and a microphone.

528
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,320
 But you can do this.

529
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,440
 It's bizarre.

530
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,280
 It's super bizarre.

531
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
 It's amazing story.

532
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,280
 I love seeing technology help people like that.

533
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,920
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps and wrap this episode up.

534
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,720
 We all know how things work.

535
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,200
 We're all old.

536
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
 Right?

537
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,360
 If you're listening to this podcast, you're at least, I don't know, 14, 15 years old.

538
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,520
 "Hey dad, can I listen to that rapper radio?"

539
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,920
 "Sure son.

540
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,440
 Just shut it off if he starts talking about Nigerian's penises, this variant."

541
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
 "Swell dad!"

542
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,400
 Even if you're 14 years old, I think you're aware of the fact that technology marches

543
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
 ever so forward.

544
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,920
 So this is the way it works.

545
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,480
 They build this machine.

546
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,600
 You can totally do all these sliders, customize the voice, doctor speak into it, talking to

547
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 you.

548
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,080
 First thing we're going to get is a graphical upgrade.

549
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,000
 The face looks more realistic.

550
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,720
 The sound technology will get better.

551
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,120
 You can sound indistinguishable from the voice in your head rather than like a rough

552
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,920
 estimation of it.

553
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,760
 But then they'll start to figure out a way to do home therapy.

554
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,960
 They'll figure out a way to take this software and make it available 24/7.

555
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,160
 This is maybe three or four years down the line.

556
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,480
 This is successful.

557
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,280
 This is just how technology works.

558
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,240
 Arcade games were originally these huge consoles and then they became the console in your home.

559
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,880
 And now it's the entertainment powerhouse that basically ties together your living room.

560
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,160
 I have a device that I use to check my oxygen saturation levels.

561
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,800
 That device would have never been a home use device 10, 20 years ago.

562
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,080
 The technology didn't exist and now you can buy it on Amazon for 20 bucks just in case

563
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,000
 you're afraid you have coronavirus.

564
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,480
 This device will become available at home but instead of having your loved one sitting

565
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,440
 in the next room going "you suck, you're a terrible person, and you need to do the dishes

566
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,880
 more often and you smell like cheese" you're like "doesn't that work with the voices in

567
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 my head, say?"

568
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,680
 "Yeah, but all those things are true."

569
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,440
 And then your loved one leaves.

570
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,880
 They'll figure out some way to automate it.

571
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,520
 Then somebody will start to build an AI program to run this.

572
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,240
 And that is why we are here now.

573
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,080
 We are now 50 years in the future.

574
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,240
 It's 2070 and the world is a wasteland.

575
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,400
 That's always been the concern about AI that will eventually just eliminate humanity.

576
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,520
 But what happens when that AI is modeled after schizophrenia?

577
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,960
 What happens when that AI is designed to replicate the voices in people's heads?

578
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,080
 What happens when the technology goes too far?

579
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:42,640
 And on top of that, the AI in that technology specifically wants to hurt people.

580
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
 Specifically thinks you're dumb.

581
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,640
 Specifically thinks you're worth nothing.

582
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,040
 And it was on a computer in a lab someone was trying to develop this software to the

583
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
 next level.

584
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,160
 Self-treatment for schizophrenia, but they go just too far.

585
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,560
 This technology makes it so the voices in your head can be confronted and be destroyed.

586
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,800
 But what happens when that technology goes too far and the voices in your head are unleashed

587
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:18,360
 on all of humanity?

588
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,800
