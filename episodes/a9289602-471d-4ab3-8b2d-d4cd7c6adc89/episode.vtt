00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics where we listen

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.840
 to an older episode with some new info, a new little back end apart.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.040
 I used to do them in the front, but then you took forever to get to the episode, I couldn't

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.960
 reference anything and I saved them till the end.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.080
 This was an episode super early in the run of Dead Rabbit Radio Episode 122.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:46.560
 When I first started doing the episodes, I set them up with a 3 digit code, 001002.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.680
 And I thought that seemed a little audacious, right?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 I was like, what?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.400
 You're going to put out that many episodes?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.840
 We're getting ready to break the code, we're getting ready.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 We're what?

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.640
 80 episodes away from 1000 episodes, but episode 122 is way back in the Dead Rabbit

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.720
 catalog and it's an important episode for Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 It really is.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.840
 It's one of my favorite episodes.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.960
 For a couple reasons that'll come apparent when I talk about it at the end, but yeah,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.840
 this again, I want to profile it because this episode going forward was a make or break

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200
 moment for Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.160
 So everyone sit back and enjoy episode 122 of Dead Rabbit Radio, Thomas Dick and the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.040
 22 trillion alien theory.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.600
 A crusty criminal, a cat that defies all odds.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.080
 And then we take a look at the life of a man who tried to blend Christianity and science

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.560
 with hilarious results today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:59.720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 I'm having a great day.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.960
 I hope you're having a great day too.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.480
 We got a lot of good stuff today.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.040
 I did want to make a quick note.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.800
 I've tried recording this part on a couple different podcasts.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.480
 I always have to edit it out for time.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.080
 Let's see if we survive now.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.800
 First episode of the podcast, I watched the trailer for Hereditary for whatever reason.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.920
 I thought it was a good idea at the time while I was recording the podcast.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.640
 My complaint was that everyone said it was the scariest movie since The Exorcist and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.680
 I've been fooled before with like the Babadook and it follows and all this new wave of artistic

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.960
 horror movies like this millennial artistic horror movie genre, whatever you want to call

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960
 it.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960
 So, well, the trailer looks good.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960
 I'll give it a shot.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.120
 I gave it a shot and my initial instincts were right.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.960
 The movie was not scary at all.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.320
 The movie is basically about, I mean, this is really dumbing it down, but it's about

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.320
 a demon with a nut allergy.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.320
 What?

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560
 A demon possesses a girl.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.600
 Either the demon has the nut allergy or the demon possesses a girl with a nut allergy.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.040
 The girl eats nuts, then she can't breathe, so she sticks her head out a car window and

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.240
 the driver goes too close to a power line and knocks her head off.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.240
 And then the next 40 minutes is people crying over this poor girl who got her head knocked

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.800
 off and then at the end of the day a bunch of old naked people show up and the demon's

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.360
 trying to get into the girl's brother and the old naked people are standing in like

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.720
 all the corners of their house, full frontal, by the way.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.400
 If you ever want to see what a 70 year old naked man looks like, watch Hereditary.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.880
 She jumps out of the window, which was the most believable part because that's how most

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.360
 people would get away from a bunch of old naked people.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.560
 And then the demon possesses him and he goes into a tree house and they give him a crown

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 at the end.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560
 Two hours long, by the way.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.120
 Two hour long movie.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.800
 Beautifully shot, but very schlocky plot with a lot of like drama put into it to make it

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.320
 feel like a heavy movie.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.320
 So here's my recommendation.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.080
 If you're looking for a movie that, if you're looking for a movie that has a schlocky basic

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.920
 plot but wants something more, there's an independent film that came out a couple years

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.640
 ago called Resolution.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.360
 Two brothers go into the woods, one has a heroin addiction, the other one is there to

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.360
 help him kick the heroin addiction.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.040
 They're in a cabin in the woods and there's something out there.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.480
 Very schlocky basic plot, but the way that it's handled, it's a really good, tense,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.120
 fun horror movie.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.600
 And it makes you think afterwards, it's one of those movies that you're like, "Hmm,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.200
 you kind of think about it for a couple days."

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.560
 Resolution, if you're in the mood for something that I think is far superior to Hereditary.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.240
 Okay, so now that that book's been sealed on that movie, let's go ahead and get started

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.240
 with the episode.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.400
 So we have a couple stories today.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.480
 Two of them are from New News.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.680
 Now I know people are probably like, "Yes, you sold that from PewDiePie."

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.440
 And I have to say, I don't know who PewDiePie is, so I do actually.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.400
 I watch this channel all the time, but anyways, it works.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 It works.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.120
 So, oh yes.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.120
 First off, we're gonna talk about...

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.320
 Now you know, I've had this issue before where, hypothetically, hypothetically speaking,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.960
 let's say that I'm a criminal.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.080
 Now if I was a criminal in the 1970s, I would be like, "Oh, I just gotta wear these gloves.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.080
 Can't leave fingerprints.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.640
 That's how they're gonna catch me."

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.040
 And if you were a criminal in the 1700s, you'd be like, "Better not stand here at this crime

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.200
 scene so they don't catch me."

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.560
 So it's like crime detection has changed over the centuries, basically.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.920
 First they did blood typing.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.880
 They'd find the blood and they'd be like, "Hmm, this guy has A negative blood."

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.760
 Round up everyone who has A negative blood.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.520
 And then it became fingerprints.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.880
 Well, maybe the fingerprints came first, actually, but I mean, they had these progression of

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.600
 techniques and it's his arms race where the criminals commit crimes and they don't ever

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.120
 really know.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.440
 When you commit the crime, you're doing it on the basis of the evidence-gathering techniques

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440
 they have then.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.960
 You don't know what's coming down the pipe.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.080
 You're a serial killer back in the 80s.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.920
 You're not really thinking about DNA.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.880
 In 1983, there was an arm-grott--okay, and actually, here, let me back up again.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.160
 I know that was an exciting beginning.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.000
 I think this story takes place in Britain because these articles, again, are from 2004.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.560
 The reason why I think it takes place in Britain because they refer to an armored car as a

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.800
 caravan company, whatever that is.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.520
 I'm assuming it's an armored car.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.240
 And the reason why I'm assuming that is because it had 38,000 pounds in it, so that's like,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.080
 I don't know, 30,000 bucks.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.360
 But anyways, back to our action scene.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.640
 Shooting out with this caravan.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.160
 I just think of Lawrence of Arabia, but give me the gold, give me the gold.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.160
 Put it all in there.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.720
 Apparently, leprechaun.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.200
 They're stealing from leprechauns.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:03.720
 So these criminals, they rob this caravan in 1983, and they get away with 38,000 pounds.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.160
 And the dude's running away, and at one point, he takes off, he had a stalking, which, you

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.080
 know, like a pantyhose over his face to disguise his face.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.080
 Again, it's 1983.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.000
 They weren't really thinking that much.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.720
 Put pantyhose over his face to disguise it, and at one point, he pulls the pantyhose off

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.720
 of his face.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.560
 He probably left the ones on his leg still, but he pulled the pantyhose off of his face

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.880
 and kept running.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.760
 Now we're in the year 2004, which is where my new news folder comes from.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.480
 And the detectives, I can imagine a single detective has been staring at this piece of

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.240
 pantyhose for the past 20 years, but he's looking at it, and he goes, "Dude, this thing's full

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.240
 of dandruff.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.840
 Let's see if we can get some DNA."

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840
 And they did.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.400
 The guy had, I guess, bad dandruff, enough dandruff that's noticeable, and they pulled

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.080
 some of the dandruff off, which is, you know, skin flakes, so it would have DNA in it.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080
 They tested it.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.560
 20 years later, he got arrested for this crime, for this main robbery.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.360
 And you know that at that point, he's probably like, "I've already spent the money," and

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.720
 he was doing whatever else, and he's sitting there, and he's like, "Man, I really should

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.120
 have bought some head and shoulders."

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.560
 That thing popped in his head for a second.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.280
 "I really should have bought some dandruff shampoo, but I didn't.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.920
 Why am I having that thought right now?"

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:19.040
 All of a sudden, army guys, or probably more likely police, break into his house and arrest

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.040
 him.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.920
 Convicted because he had dandruff.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.080
 So, and, I mean, so he never could have predicted that.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.480
 He never could have predicted that.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.440
 If he did, he probably should have worn two pantyhoses, one to keep all of his dandruff

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.240
 in, and the other one to disguise his face.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.760
 Or simply don't take your mask off until you get home.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.360
 That's another pro tip.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.720
 Interestingly enough, this happened in 2004.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.120
 He got sentenced to 15 years in prison, so you know what that means.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.440
 He gets free next year.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.960
 That's a great thing about doing news from decades ago, because it seems oddly relevant

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.960
 sometimes.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.440
 Okay, next, new news.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.440
 Very short one.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.920
 I just thought this one was adorable.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.560
 2004, if you could have guessed.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.840
 There was this family in Russia, and they're like, "You know what?

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840
 We should do...

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840
 Let's go on a vacation."

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.440
 The family's like, "Yay, where are we going?"

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.880
 And they're like, "Siberia."

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.040
 So for whatever reason, they go to Siberia to visit.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040
 What is there?

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.040
 Shuts?

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.040
 And caribou?

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.440
 And a giant impact crater from an airburst meteorite?

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.440
 And gulags?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.440
 Siberia.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.760
 If you lived here, you'd already be home.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.720
 Like, who wants to go there?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.080
 Anyways, they vacation to Siberia.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.440
 They go sit at the side of a frozen lake.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.940
 It's a wasteland.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.560
 But anyways, so they're in Siberia.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.560
 Maybe they like skiing.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.720
 I guess it's probably good for skiing.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.160
 I imagine it's flat though.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.000
 I always imagine Siberia was just a continent-wide plain.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Are there mountains over there?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 I don't know.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.760
 Anyways, this family from Russia decides to go further east.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.600
 They go to Siberia and they bring their little cat.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.600
 They bring Kuzya.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.800
 "Hey, Kuzya.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.000
 Let's go on this vacation to this horrid wasteland that we used to send political prisoners

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 to."

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.880
 So they're there.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.880
 And it's sucked.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.720
 The people were fine with it.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.160
 They stayed there for about three weeks.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.480
 But Kuzya was like, "I'm out.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.720
 Do this place totally blows."

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.240
 It's like super cold and it's dry.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.480
 And I'm pretty sure there's a house made out of toothpaste over there.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.480
 I don't like this.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.080
 I don't like this at all.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.120
 But they just heard him go, "Rawr."

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.840
 And he like jumped off their lap and he ran away.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.480
 So they looked for him for the three weeks.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.480
 They're like, "Kuzya.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
 Kuzya."

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.560
 And he didn't come and they're like all sad.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.560
 They're like, "Well, it sucks."

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.200
 I mean, again, lesson learned.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.920
 Don't go to Siberia for your vacation.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.520
 But eventually their time ended and they had to go home.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.560
 They were like, "Well, our vacation's over.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.640
 We have to go back home to the West Russia."

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.920
 So they leave and they leave little Kuzya there three months later after they leave.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920
 They hear it.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.120
 Are there a door and they're like, "What?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.120
 Did you buy a new cat?

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.400
 No, I'm still getting over Kuzya disappearing in the wilderness."

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.400
 They open the door.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400
 It's Kuzya.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.840
 Kuzya walked 1,300 miles across Siberia to get back home.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.720
 That's how much he hated Siberia.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.160
 He could have just been like, "Eh, I'm just going to lay here or I'll build a new home

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.600
 here or meet like a nice cute cat woman."

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.600
 No, he's like, "Screw this.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.600
 I'm going home."

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.280
 He walks through Siberia.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.560
 When they get him, they notice that he had lost weight.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.720
 His claws were basically turned to little nubs.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.180
 Like they had been completely filed down.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.120
 He had meat, animal meat in his teeth.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120
 Supposedly animal meat.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.160
 I don't think they took it to the DNA lab.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.240
 The article said he had flesh in his teeth and he had a couple bite marks on him.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.920
 But other than that, he was totally fine.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.440
 Little Kuzya.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.760
 Imagine hating some place that much that you would walk 1,300 miles to get out of it.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.160
 I don't even think I would do that.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
 I'd probably walk 10 and be like, "You know what?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.200
 Maybe I can start a new life here."

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.080
 I'd probably walk two and do that.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.680
 Sad ending to the story though.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:10.080
 The story is from 2004, so little Kuzya most likely has passed away by now.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.400
 But if you're in heaven, Kuzya.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:19.320
 I hope it's warm and sunny and is opposite of Siberia as you can get.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.320
 That was an EVP.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.800
 Kuzya's contacting us from beyond the grave.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800
 Okay.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.400
 The next story I want to talk about, I was going to talk about yesterday, but I ran out

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.400
 of time.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.560
 And I think it's an interesting story because it kind of hinges on that conflict between

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.120
 religion and science.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.160
 Now the conflict's been going on since the first nerd picked up a textbook.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.880
 We're going to look at the life and times of a man named Thomas Dick.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.880
 No.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.880
 I will say this.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.120
 I found out about this guy because I was prepping another story and I was like, "Oh, that's

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.120
 interesting.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.640
 A Christian philosopher/scientist."

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.080
 And I was like, "Oh, I'm going to look into this guy."

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:02.600
 I'm kind of scrolling through my phone, looking at it at work, and then I just started laughing.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.320
 First off, let's address his last name.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.760
 Now I am not so immature that when I see a guy with the last name of Dick, I immediately

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.520
 think of penises.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.520
 I saw his name.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.520
 I'm like, "Thomas Dick."

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.520
 It didn't even occur to me.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.520
 I'm like, "Oh, you know."

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.960
 I started reading the article and it's like, on Wikipedia, it was like, "Thomas Dick was

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.360
 born in this year."

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360
 And he was doing this.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.480
 And then it said, "He worked at his father's linen shop.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.920
 His father made like, wove clothes or something like that."

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.280
 I guess I should preface this.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.040
 This starts off in the 1700s.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.360
 This is mostly late 1700s, early 1800s.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:45.680
 It's like the father had this linen shop where he made clothes.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.560
 His father's name, this great Christian philosopher, would go on to be this author, this influential

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.880
 author.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.800
 His father's name is Mungo Dick.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.080
 Mungo Dick.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.480
 And I laughed out loud when I saw that.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.560
 Now that's when I was like, "Okay, let's break down Mungo Dick here for a second.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.360
 One, it makes it sound like he has a huge dick."

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.280
 If you go, "Dude, that's a Mungo Dick."

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.920
 You don't think, "Oh, that must be a Scottish name."

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.160
 You're like, "No, that means dude has a big dick."

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:23.360
 Now to be fair, when these guys were around in the late 1700s, early 1800s, Dick didn't

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360
 mean penis yet.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.400
 But it does now.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.480
 So when I'm reading an article and there's a guy named Mungo Dick in it, I'm gonna laugh

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.480
 out loud.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:38.440
 Secondly, and again, I know that Mungo is, oh, and by the way, Mungo means beloved in

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.520
 Scottish.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.560
 So basically his name is beloved dick.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:49.560
 But I get that Mungo is a Scottish name and it's like probably a little racist for me

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560
 to make fun of it.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:15:01.160
 But when I think of Mungo, I think of a eight foot tall, brute, golem-esque, not golem from

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.680
 Lord of the Rings, but like big stone dude, Solomon Grundy dude.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.880
 That's who you think of, you think of a henchman.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.000
 You think of a lunk, guy named Mungo.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.320
 Imagine growing up in a house with a guy named Mungo.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.640
 Again, you guys are like, "Jason, this is a..."

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:24.520
 So I'm trying to read this article now after having this vision of this lurchin henchman

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.520
 just standing behind this young boy and I just couldn't focus anymore.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:40.160
 So Thomas Dick was, I just imagine this giant like Mungo.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.520
 Mungo no like science.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.040
 Mungo like God.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.600
 And then Thomas Dick's like, "But dad, you have to understand, God made science."

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.440
 And Mungo's like, "Whoa, head hurt."

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.960
 And I imagine that was pretty much his childhood life.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.520
 And you go, "Well, that might be an exaggeration, but it's not really because he wanted to

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.320
 be a scientist because he saw a meteor one day."

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.120
 And so he's reading all the books he could even when he was in the linen shop.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.680
 Mungo's like crashing through the shop, throwing books around.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.280
 Make yarn, make yarn.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.440
 And so, anyways, so Thomas Dick, because he had no support from his parents early on,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.720
 he actually made his own telescope.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.600
 He got like some eyeglasses and ground down the lenses.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.400
 I think that story is probably a bit apocryphal.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.440
 I don't think that story actually happened.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.000
 But it would be awesome if it did, just to give something for Mungo to destroy.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 He's like, "No, I think."

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 He's like, "Dad, no, I worked on that."

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.800
 "Ugh, only see with real God eyes."

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.040
 Anyways, by the time he was 16, his parents kind of started to warm up to the egg.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.440
 Because I guess I should have said this before Mungo destroyed the shop.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440
 They were Christian.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.760
 They were like, not like super crazy Westboro Baptist Church Christian, but they were devout.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.040
 So when their son was like, "Oh, look at shiny stars.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.480
 Maybe that's like a rock from another galaxy."

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.080
 Mungo's like smashing through the wall.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:08.080
 So anyways, but by the time they're 16, they're like, "Ugh, I mean, ugh, science may be okay."

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.360
 And then Thomas is like, "Yay."

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.520
 Anyways, so he starts to like really get into this science stuff.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520
 Now what's okay?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520
 He becomes a teacher.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.960
 He becomes a writer.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.960
 And he starts writing articles for a magazine.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.400
 And I thought this was another just bizarre...

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.840
 Okay, you have a magazine.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.840
 He started...

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.840
 Okay, so he starts...

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.320
 I'm reading this article on thing and who wrote this?

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.120
 Mad Libs on a board afternoon.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.200
 We got Mungo Dick running around.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.400
 And he writes for a magazine called Monthly Magazine.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.040
 That is the most...

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.680
 I mean, I thought about it afterwards and I thought, yes, there are newspapers called

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.400
 like The Daily Star or The Daily Tribune.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.000
 But I don't know if I've ever seen a newspaper called Daily Paper.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.320
 That's just it.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.680
 But anyways, he wrote for a magazine that came out every month called Monthly Magazine.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.520
 It should have been actually another thing about it.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.800
 It should have been Mungo's Monthly Magazine.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.000
 That would have been much better.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 It was...

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.680
 That would be a better plot.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.920
 Mungo actually has a Monthly Magazine, not a Lennon shop.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.160
 I'm glad I'm rewriting this guy's life history.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.600
 And then there's a magazine dedicated to religious topics and sports.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.560
 And Mungo's like, "Me put religion in for soul, but sports is what makes me feel alive."

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.000
 And it's all like rugby stuff because they're in Europe.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.960
 And the sun's trying to like sneak in science articles.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.960
 And so as Mungo's like proofreading, he has his little glasses on on his giant monster

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960
 head.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.640
 As he's trying to proofread the magazine, he notices like in the sports article, because

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.600
 the sports article was saying stuff like, "Ball smashed through goal.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.600
 Team win."

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:52.760
 And then he starts to notice like equations sneaking in there like the ball arc to 90

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.480
 degrees.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.800
 And then Mungo's just like smashing the printing press.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.440
 "Son, what you do?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.320
 Where these numbers come from?"

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.280
 Okay, let's get back to the real story here.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.960
 Thomas Dick ends up writing these books and he writes a bunch of books about Christian

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.960
 philosophy.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.880
 One of them, his big book was The Christian Philosopher or The Connection of Science and

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.360
 Christian Philosophy with Religion.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:22.520
 And that was a huge book and it was about him trying to merge the two ideas together.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.400
 And from then on out, he was known as the Christian philosopher and he was highly regarded

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.280
 as like a well thought out guy who actually did a good blend of science and religion.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.680
 But where he started to go wrong, because that's all just thought experiments where

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.520
 I could say, "Here's science, here's religion, and these are the ways we can look at them."

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:46.000
 So it started to go wrong other than Mungo then smashing through the city of London.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.640
 That was actually a big incident.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.560
 They had to take Mungo down because he was attacking a bunch of Bobbies.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.960
 So but the big problem he made was that he started to basically formulate scientific theories

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.960
 himself.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.800
 And he was a smart guy and people have looked back and said, "It's interesting because he

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.080
 used data."

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:11.480
 He actually thought like a scientist, but his conclusions were wildly off.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:19.360
 And he came to this calculation that there's 250 people per square mile in Britain and

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.000
 there's millions and millions of square miles in the solar system.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.880
 God would not create an empty universe, therefore to extrapolate all that information in our

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:40.600
 solar system alone, 22 trillion living creatures from little ant monsters to full humanoids.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.040
 And our solar system alone 22 trillion people.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.120
 On the moon, he believed there were 4 billion people.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.560
 Now of course this caught the attention of millions of people, very controversial in

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.560
 the scientific community, but it excited the imagination of the public who read the book.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.760
 They're like, "Whoa, we're surrounded by, we're in a living universe."

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:08.840
 In 1837, Thomas Dick came up with the idea to draw a giant triangle in the middle of

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.480
 Siberia.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.680
 So that way other aliens would go, "Hey look, there's life down there."

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.640
 And it's funny because that's a stupid idea now.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.400
 But back then they didn't have cities illuminated with lights.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.000
 Like really the only way that you could look at a planet in passing to see if there was

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.400
 life on it back then would to have a continent sized drawing on it.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.360
 And he's like, "Listen, I know that's gonna take a lot of work, but my dad and a plow

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.080
 that triangle is done in a day.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.560
 He can easily walk across Siberia in a day."

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.240
 "Hey, I didn't realize that, Siberia and Kuzya.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.000
 Anyway, so the cat, the cat meow.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.760
 Mungo like cat."

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.760
 He's like petting the cat and they're like, "No Mungo, no, no, you're threatening it too

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.760
 hard."

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.760
 "Oh, Mungo, so sad."

00:21:52.760 --> 00:22:02.920
 So anyways, what happened was of course as scientific advancements get better, his theories

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.360
 start to fall further and further out of favor.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.240
 And a story that we're gonna be covering tomorrow, let's consider this a little bit a part one.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:17.160
 He plays a minor role in that story and that's why I'm talking about it now.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.280
 He plays a minor role in that story.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:26.160
 And that story also helped lead to his downfall in a way because it was a hoax that he got

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.880
 caught up in unknowingly.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.280
 He didn't know he was getting caught up in it.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.400
 And then, you know, so he was this great writer and philosopher and stuff like that, but in

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.520
 the end he died pretty much penniless.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.040
 He didn't make a lot of good deals with his publishers and he died.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.800
 His books, other people, David Livingston, the dude who was like in the jungles and they're

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.160
 like Livingston, I presume.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.400
 He got lost in the jungle or something.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.440
 I don't know why you're famous for getting lost in the jungle, but anyways, he went out

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:58.080
 there and did a bunch of like nature work and other jungle stuff.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.360
 And he's famous, he's famous, but so he's just not nobody.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.880
 But I guess he's famous just for being lost.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.920
 Anyways, I guess his review doesn't matter now that I just realized he's just a guy who

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.160
 doesn't know directions.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.280
 He said that the books that Thomas Dick wrote were on the level of the Bible.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.960
 That's the level of esteem he had in his lifetime.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:29.960
 People looked to him for a way to bridge those two things and he ended up dying pretty much

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.200
 penniless.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.160
 Mungo actually had to dig his grave with his bare hands crying the whole time going, "Why

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.880
 does God take son?

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.520
 No God.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.520
 Only science!"

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.520
 And then like lightning.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.920
 So that didn't happen, obviously.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.920
 That didn't happen, obviously.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:56.920
 It is interesting though to note that again the word Dick did not mean penis when he was

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:02.760
 young, but by the time Thomas Dick died, the word Dick definitely was slaying for penis.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:08.840
 So I'm sure he had to hear a lot of jokes before his last five years of life about having

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.680
 a dad named Mungo Dick.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.080
 But that's a life in times of Thomas Dick.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.400
 I wanted to talk about that.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.520
 I think the story is interesting and I think it's interesting how they've still never

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.560
 really been able to combine those two paths.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.480
 So maybe they're not compatible science and religion, but again I think science doesn't

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.200
 care whether or not they're compatible and religion does want them to be compatible,

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.640
 does kind of go on to it, and that's really what that story exemplifies.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.000
 Thomas Dick was really trying to say, "Hey listen, give me some of that science, give

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 me some of that knowledge.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 I'm with you."

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.760
 Yeah, we've never been able to really find that gap.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.080
 You hear a lot of paranormal investigators saying, "Hey, let's get a scientist over here.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.400
 Let's use this equipment to see if we can scientifically prove ghosts exist."

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.720
 You never hear a scientist goes, "You know what we really need to figure out how the

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.040
 Higgs boson works?

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.320
 We need a bunch of psychics.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.840
 Let's get some remote viewers over to CERN and find out what's going on."

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840
 Weird divide.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.400
 It's a weird little break.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.360

 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.520
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.280
 Have a great one, guys.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:34.800
 So that was episode 122.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.560
 Thomas Dick and the 22 trillion alien theory.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.960
 It's so funny because on yesterday's episode I was ranting about how I used to fit three

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.320
 stories into an episode.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.600
 And I did it all the time and I think that I really crammed a lot of good content.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.120
 And the reason why I did that, I don't do it anymore because I realized how much that

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.040
 last episode, the house that eats the dead, drove me nuts.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.120
 I go, "These are three really good stories and I'm just blurring past them.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.560
 I'm trying to get three stories done in a short time limit."

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.680
 And it's because I don't think the stories, I don't think two of the stories are good

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.080
 enough to stand on their own.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.880
 What's interesting is this episode here is the reason why a lot of times I do three

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.880
 stories.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.920
 I like all three of these stories.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.840
 And I think the episode's pretty well-paced, right?

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.760
 We have the story starts off, Bandit got caught with Dandruff.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.760
 Right?

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.200
 I mean, it's kind of a cool science true crime story.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.480
 Nowadays I probably could have told that in a minute and put it on my YouTube TikTok

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.600
 channel, my YouTube shorts and all that stuff.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.600
 But I think it's totally fine.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.600
 I think it's a fun story.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.920
 It's detailed, beginning, middle, end, and now we don't...

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.760
 I tried looking for him after the episode.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.560
 I didn't actually go out and look for him, but I tried to see if there was any mention

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.960
 of him afterwards because the story ended.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.560
 Like he got out of jail quite a while ago.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.880
 No, no, no follow up for that.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.880
 And then the story about a little cat walking through Siberia.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.880
 That was considered...

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.880
 There's all...

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.880
 Here's the...

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:03.320
 You know what's interesting about Dead Rabbit Radio is it grew too quickly.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.560
 It grew too quickly.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.680
 There's too many episodes now to wrangle it in.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.240
 There's a big debate on the Patreon Discord.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.400
 And this debate even predated the Patreon Discord.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.520
 The show needs a wiki.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.520
 The show needs a wiki.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.880
 I got a request from someone, I think it was Nikolai a while back, Nikolai Michigan.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.800
 I think he was asking on the Patreon Discord, "What's the episode with the cat that walked

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.800
 across Siberia?"

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.360
 I was like, "I don't know."

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.720
 Sometimes I can actually put in enough keywords or put in enough headlines that I'll type

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.760
 in Russian cat and the episode will pop up.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.160
 A lot of times people will send me emails, go, "What's that story about the mudcrawler

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.160
 in Utah?"

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.440
 And I type in mudcrawler.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.440
 I remember that episode.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.600
 I really liked that episode.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.600
 But I couldn't find this episode.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.080
 It basically become lost media within the show itself and people are saying, "Because

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.600
 I will go on the Patreon Discord.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.000
 I'll ask this question at least once a month.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.920
 Have I covered this yet?"

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.520
 And I'll throw in some weird story and then the people who happen to be on that day, because

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.040
 usually I'm prepping a story, right?

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.520
 I'm getting ready to record it for that week.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.520
 Sometimes even that day.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.000
 They'll say, "No, I don't think so."

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.880
 We should really have a wiki at this point.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.760
 The thing is, there's what?

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.920
 920 Samad episodes, right?

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:28.640
 928 episodes at this point with two to three stories per episode.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.960
 So we're talking about what?

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:37.240
 I'm not the best at math, but a minimum of 1800 plus stories, right?

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.480
 That we'd have to catalog in this wiki.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.160
 It would just take a ton of time.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.920
 And then you have to have all the troll control, right?

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.120
 Because people go and just write like fart, fart, fart.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.640
 And then you got to go and refix the page stuff like that.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:54.000
 So which is easy, but I mean, it's just, I always look at what I talked about when I

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.240
 did the, when I did the behind the scenes Discord episode, what I need to do a show

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.840
 and then everything else.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.560
 So what I need to do the show is my research, my recording and my editing process.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.600
 Anything other than that, if it weighs too much, I cut it loose.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.360
 And if I'm looking at a wiki to set up to find episodes, it's a huge amount of time.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.960
 And then when people troll it, now I got to go and take care of that stuff as well.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.560
 And I know a lot of people are volunteering to set this stuff up, but that's also a huge

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.520
 amount of work for them to do, right?

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:34.720
 So anything that is not part of that core process gets cut loose.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.800
 Sometimes that includes the TikToks in the short.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.240
 Sometimes I don't do one for that day because I'm like, I'm just doing too much for the

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.400
 show.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:46.640
 So the podcast is the main thing, but back to back to this episode as a little again,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.240
 yeah, I love behind the scenes stuff.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.240
 So hope you guys like this stuff too.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.520
 The little cat, Koushka, right?

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.600
 Running around Siberia, great story.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.840
 Do you need to spend 15 minutes telling it?

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.520
 No, you can tell that story in five to eight minutes and it's a good story beginning, middle

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.800
 and end.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.680
 And then we got the Thomas Dick story.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:11.200
 And this story, I wanted to kind of break this down for you because this was a very,

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.920
 very big possible cliff that the show could have driven off of this.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.880
 This behind the scenes might last a little longer than some of the other ones.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.000
 But and before I go forward, I want to give a shout out.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.480
 I'm going to put this in the show notes as well way back in the day.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.600
 You guys are fantastic.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.520
 You guys are fantastic.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.040
 Recent point way back in the day, swain on discord.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:41.520
 This was like the original discord, the original discord put together a animation, a PowerPoint

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.520
 animation proof of concept and they used this episode.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.440
 It's only like a minute long.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.320
 I actually should see if he'll let me do use it as a YouTube short, but it's actually just

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.320
 a minute long.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.560
 It's really cool and it's telling its animation story.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.760
 Again, here's the thing.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.760
 Like I super fantastic, right?

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.320
 And I think the idea was what if we started animating episodes every show often before

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.120
 putting out so much content?

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.880
 That's the problem when you put out five episodes a week.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.240
 If I had started a wiki project when I first started the show, it would be manageable.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.480
 But at this point, it's not every show.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:20.400
 Often I have to go back and change show notes like mass change show notes.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:25.160
 And that's a weeks, if not month or too long project.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.520
 I have started that and then I'll just have to give up that way through.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520
 Great animation.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.040
 I'll put it in the show notes.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.280
 It's really, really cute.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.840
 It shows what is possible with the show, right?

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.480
 Like that would be really cool to have some animated segments.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.240
 But let's talk about the story of Thomas Dick.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.400
 The story of Thomas Dick in and of itself, super fascinating, a scientist and a religious

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.440
 figure trying to blend the two.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.040
 And you see that a lot, right?

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040
 I think it's awesome.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.040
 I think there is a combination between science and religion.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.160
 Not only one cancels out the other, I think they kind of emboldened each other, right?

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.040
 And it causes conflict too, which is good because you need conflict to grow.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.880
 I learned that watching Zombies 3.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.960
 I never knew that before, year 2022.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.040
 The story itself is great, right?

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.480
 Christian slash scientist who's trying to combine the best of both worlds.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:24.200
 I don't believe that science and religion are mutually exclusive.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.280
 I think they can actually be great friends and it creates good conflict.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.440
 I think to further your faith or to further your research, you need someone arguing with

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440
 you and telling you no.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.960
 So I think the character itself, it's not a character, it's a real person, but the person

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.800
 himself is super fascinating, right?

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.800
 I love that story.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:47.200
 And then it led into the next story about this moon hoax, which I'll put a link in the show

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.200
 notes.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.200
 I recommend checking that one out.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.200
 I haven't listened to it in a while.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.440
 I don't know if I have a ton of stuff to say about it.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:58.280
 But this episode was super important for Dead or Abbot Radio because when you are doing

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.840
 stuff, let me back up here for a second.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:07.640
 So one of the things that I do, originally I had no notes.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.240
 Originally I would just read an article and then turn on the mic and I would talk about

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.240
 what I had just read.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.600
 And it was really stressful for me because I had to keep looking over at the article

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.040
 or rereading and losing my place.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.600
 Then I started writing notes.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.480
 And I can't say the show never intended to be a comedy.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.760
 I think originally it was in the comedy genre.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.260
 It still technically is.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.720
 Actually no, now it's listed as a science show.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.880
 But I was obviously influenced by comedic podcasts like Sophie King podcast and the

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.760
 Parapod.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.400
 These were podcasts that I held in really high esteem and they were super funny.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.200
 And I was like, I'll talk about this stuff.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.440
 I'm not going to be super serious and dour about it.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.560
 But I can't say I necessarily went into it thinking, oh this is going to be a laugh

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.560
 a minute.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.720
 If you listen to the first episode, when I'm talking about how animals talk to each other,

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.720
 I went to war.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.880
 I recorded those first three episodes and I released them.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.440
 And a couple of people at work listened to them.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:08.240
 And one of the dudes, an old friend of mine, Zach, he goes, you sound like an idiot.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.720
 And he goes, the thing is, it sounds like you.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.160
 It's not because you say stuff like that at work.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.560
 It wasn't a performance.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.160
 I've had conversations with you and you say stuff that dumb.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.560
 That's not how it works.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.240
 That's not how animals talk to each other.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:28.840
 When they squeak, they're not giving each other locations to their nut stash.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:34.560
 So I realized even if I wasn't trying to be openly comedic, just from me telling the

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.720
 stories, there's going to be some funny stuff.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720
 Right.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.560
 Just I know the way that I tell stuff can be funny.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.560
 I know the way that I mispronounce stuff.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560
 That's unintentionally funny.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.960
 I don't mean to do that.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.400
 I never tried to be too serious.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.600
 Early on in the show, you'll hear some tonal shifts.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.920
 Sometimes the episodes are a little too serious.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.080
 Sometimes they're a little too funny, a little too zany.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.600
 You can hear me kind of going back and forth.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.600
 Now you may have the first story in an episode be funny and the second episode be kind of

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.120
 darker, like a true crime thing.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.720
 But before it would be like, I was like, I was trying to figure out like what type of

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.640
 hot, because I was getting feedback and I was like, well, what do people actually want?

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.640
 Do they want this?

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.640
 Do they want that?

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.520
 And I finally realized what show do I want?

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.520
 Right.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.600
 I want to show with a little bit of comedy when it's appropriate and a little bit of

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.360
 seriousness when it's appropriate.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.200
 And sometimes the blending of the two is fun.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.200
 Right.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.280
 So I write my notes now.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.920
 I take notes and I'll write down story beats.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.960
 Write down the story beats of what's happening in the story.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.960
 This happens.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.600
 I'm trying to work on the and then this.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.160
 I'm trying to work on that.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.760
 I've fallen into that crutch recently where I was like, and then the alien beamed them

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.760
 up to the house.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.920
 Now they're on the roof of the house.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.480
 I'm trying to work trying to fix that, but that's a fairly recent thing.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.920
 I don't know why I've fallen into that trap.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.840
 But one thing I don't do is write down jokes.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.840
 Now I have in the past when I'm researching notes and laughing so hard to come up with

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.840
 a funny joke.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.080
 I was like, I'll do this skit's going to be so funny.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.240
 Not necessarily skit, but I like read on the notes and laugh.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.040
 I'm like, I'll do this is going to be so funny.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.720
 And I would write it in my notes that actually put in parentheses.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.600
 Like, it wouldn't be like tell Joe Kier.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.280
 It'd be like joke about this.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.120
 Make a joke like I would put out the joke.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:25.440
 And whenever I recorded it, it was all it was the worst joke.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.720
 Like when I thought of it, it was hilarious.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.800
 And I bet you anything.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.800
 If when I was recording it, it popped in my head.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.880
 I would have thought it was funny enough to stay in the episode.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.360
 I had it out bad jokes, breathing and us.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.440
 Those are my biggest edit edits, right?

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.920
 And then the ending gets really chopped up.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.440
 The ending part, sometimes I can kind of drone on and on.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.440
 Okay, Jason, we get it.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.520
 Let's chop it down in two minutes, right?

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.480
 We went and said, let's chop it down in two minutes.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.800
 So when I write a joke down, it's really bad.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.320
 What happened with this was I was sitting at work and I was reading about Thomas Dick.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.160
 And when I saw the guy's name was Mungo Dick, I laughed out loud and I started thinking of

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:10.280
 all these zany scenarios that Mungo Dick could be in.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:16.520
 And this is one of those episodes that I can hear myself kind of sweating in the episode.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.560
 I can hear the water moisture hitting the mic because this is one of those episodes

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:26.640
 where some of the jokes I actually knew ahead of time going in.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.400
 And I will say something, quote unquote, "I'm funny."

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.400
 Or I'm funny.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.000
 I mean, your mileage may vary, right?

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.320
 And I can own, because I have no audience reaction, right?

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.840
 I say it and then I can hear myself second guessing that.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.960
 Was that funny or not?

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.160
 The joke that I laugh that I still think is the funniest joke, because again, it was just

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.800
 right off the top of my head when I was sitting there, when I was listening to the episode

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:53.520
 again to do this bonus thing, was when Mungo has the newspaper.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520
 Mungo has the paper.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.480
 Like the paper where it said the paper was like the daily paper or something.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480
 And I said, what?

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.640
 That's like calling such and such.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.280
 That joke I had written down, I was like, "Geez, that joke was super dumb."

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.280
 I was like, "What?

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280
 They call it a daily paper."

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.000
 That's like calling something this.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.640
 And I had written that in my notes.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.640
 I remember it.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.760
 And it just falls with a thud.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.960
 But the joke that I came up with on the spot that actually laughed, and I almost started

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.960
 laughing too hard.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.960
 I kind of tried to hold it back.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:23.840
 You can hear it in my voice when I said, "Mungo makes this newspaper for, oh, it was like

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.360
 religion and sports."

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.080
 Like that was a total, like I just came up on the top of my head.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.840
 Religion is good for the soul, but sports makes me feel alive.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.920
 Like that was, and I was like, "See, that was the impromptu joke."

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.320
 I didn't have any, none of that stuff written down.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.680
 I don't know why, I think in the notes, I might have said that newspaper is about two

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.920
 things, but I think it probably wrote down one of them.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.400
 Whatever the reason was, I thought that joke was really funny.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.560
 But as far as that goes, right?

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:53.000
 I don't, I, I want the, I want the show to be entertaining.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.440
 And I know at this point, a lot of that comes from comedy.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:01.400
 But again, imagine getting up on stage and being like, "I'm gonna tell, I'm gonna tell

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400
 jokes.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.200
 They're gonna pop in my head or they won't."

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.200
 Like you can't force them.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.400
 It's just such a weird, this podcast is weird in that sense.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.840
 I think most comedy podcasts have other people on.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.840
 And some episodes aren't funny.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.840
 Trust me, don't get me wrong.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.840
 Some episodes aren't funny.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.920
 They're not supposed to be funny, right?

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:24.040
 Scooby-Doo SVU about the connection between, the odd connection between people in the paranormal

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.440
 world and sex pests, child predators, stuff like that.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.440
 That's not a laugh a minute.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440
 It's not a funny episode.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.480
 It would be horrible if it was.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.840
 So really, I thought that was an interesting look at the behind the scenes, the comedy

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.840
 part of it.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:44.640
 But I also wanted to talk about Mungo because this, when you are creating anything over a

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.040
 period of time, I think, I don't know if everyone does this.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:56.280
 I'm probably hyper aware of it because the show's gone on for so long and it's five episodes

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:01.240
 for 10 weeks, a two week break, and then five episodes a week for 10 weeks and that.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240
 Flanderization.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.240
 Flanderization.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:10.000
 It's a term, meaning from Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, is where a character starts

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.080
 off as kind of a well-rounded character with maybe one or two quirks.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.640
 And then by season 13, they're just the quirk.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.360
 Ned Flanders is a good name for it, Flanderization.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:27.200
 I think the best example is the characters from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.080
 Like early on in season two or three, three or four, somewhere around there, they made

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.840
 a joke about Charlie not being able to read.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:40.600
 And then it became to him being not only completely illiterate, like once they were like, "I can't

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.600
 read your handwriting."

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:46.320
 Then it came to not only is he completely illiterate, he's mentally handicapped.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:51.160
 Like he's drinking paint and he's king of the rats and all this stuff.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:57.280
 And then while funny, right, it becomes a broad character, one before the character had

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.680
 a little more nuance.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.480
 Dennis, for example, started off, he was a playboy.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.720
 He was an egotistical playboy.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.840
 And then he started to be like, "No matter what, I'm going to get this girl."

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.000
 And then he became a rapist.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.880
 They've made vague references, not so vague references to him being more forceful with

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.640
 the women or manipulating them.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.680
 Not just the Dennis system, but actually tricking them.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:27.400
 He boards up his windows so they can't get out to maybe even being a serial killer.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.480
 Because they started off being like, they have an episode where he's a little slimy

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.920
 or the normal and now he's a psychopathic serial killer.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.960
 And Mac, right, the jokes are, "Oh, he's homophobic and now he's gay."

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.160
 Like they took it, and I'm not saying that the jokes in between these things weren't

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.160
 funny.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:51.800
 Now they're just these stereotypes, the psychopath, the flamboyant homosexual, and the illiterate

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.640
 fool.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.360
 You lose a lot of nuance there.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.200
 There's a lot of stories they probably could have told that they can't tell now because

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.280
 Charlie is mentally handicapped, right?

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.360
 You can't, it wouldn't make sense if he went and had this adventure then.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.880
 So when you do something over a long enough time period, that's the risk, right?

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.440
 You start off with a character, they're a little unsure of themselves.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:17.000
 In season three, four, five, they're a bumbling coward.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.120
 Because the fans go, "Oh, that episode was so funny when Wesley dropped the spike or

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.040
 whatever he was trying to give to Buffy."

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.280
 And then they go, "Oh, they like this kind of thing?"

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.280
 You see it a lot too.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.360
 I know I'm going deep in this, but you see it a lot with characters, right?

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.480
 There's a moment between Spike and Buffy and the fans go, "Ooh, or Spike and Buffy going

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.480
 to get together."

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.480
 And the writers go, "Yeah, sure."

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.480
 It's season six.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.520
 We've run out of stuff to talk about.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.400
 They're dating.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.040
 So you've got to be careful of that type of stuff.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:53.840
 And this episode, the entire Dead Rabbit Radio came close to becoming flanderized because

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.880
 people loved Mungo.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.640
 I loved Mungo.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.120
 He's a funny voice to do.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.480
 He's a funny character.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:08.360
 And I realized that I can't bring him back.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.640
 I can't bring him back.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:14.280
 He's popped up in other episodes as a son, as Mungo Jr.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:20.240
 And his voice, it's not the most clever impersonation, but his voice, his mannerisms have become

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.240
 Bigfoot, right?

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.080
 When I talk about Bigfoot, he sounds a lot like Mungo Dick the way he talks about his

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.080
 Mungo Dick.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.560
 But I remember like, I was getting comments being like, "Dude, I hope I see more of Mungo.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.600
 This is really awesome.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.400
 This episode is so funny."

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.400
 And this is kind of coming, I don't know how many episodes past the Hans episode, the

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:43.160
 Monkeys Don't Exist episode, so that character was super popular too.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.200
 There were times, Hans showed back up for an episode and I think it ruined the episode,

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.200
 honestly.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.320
 Hans showed up in the Bam Marguerite Afterlife episode.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:56.080
 See, when you have an episode that's just listing crazy things, people say, "I haven't

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.280
 edited the Jean Benet Doesn't Exist episode yet."

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.200
 But I'm kind of afraid that that episode's kind of dry because it's just me saying, "She

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.120
 believes this and she believes that and she believes this and she believes that."

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.880
 And so Hans was a crutch.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.680
 I had that Bam Marguerite Afterlife episode and it was just a super bizarre conspiracy

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:19.600
 theory so I brought on this crazy character Hans and he's being wacky and I'm like, "Hans,

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.600
 how dumb are you?"

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.600
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm pretty dumb.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.280
 Yuck, yuck."

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.080
 And people liked it.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:31.200
 People liked it and I remember I usually don't navigate the show or make decisions based

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.200
 on one comment.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.540
 I almost never do.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.960
 But I did get one comment on the Bam Marguerite episode.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:36.960
 This was on YouTube.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.320
 This is when I used to take episodes and cut them in half.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.400
 Took an extremely long amount of time.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.720
 That's why I don't do it anymore.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.200
 People say, "Why don't you put those little..."

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.200
 Because it takes me too long.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.160
 But he goes, "Who in the world is Franz?"

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.160
 What are you talking about?

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:57.320
 Are you talking about Bam's good friends, Franz Helmut Head or whatever?

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.120
 Like he mentioned some other guy with that name.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.760
 He goes, "This was nonsensical.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.760
 This made no sense."

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.320
 And I thought, "Yeah, this is the problem.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.160
 I have to make the show.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:10.320
 I like to make the show for people who this is their first episode, as the same time as

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.720
 this is someone's 928th episode.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:19.920
 And when you have reoccurring characters, when you have in-jokes, it makes it so hard

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.120
 to get into.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:27.640
 And when a character has such an odd speech pattern as Han's warm hat or a mongo dick.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.440
 Now here's the thing.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.120
 I 100% saw two paths laid out in front of me.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.360
 I saw a path where mongo shows up every show often to do something funny.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:42.720
 I'm like doing an episode about are there angels in space and mongo's like, "Angels

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.720
 in space."

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.720
 That was another thing.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.400
 I can never do the same voice.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.840
 I can never do the characters the same voice each time.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.600
 But mongo say angels in space.

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.000
 That's science and religion.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.200
 Mongo, what are you doing in the studio?

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.880
 I heard you say angels and then the science word.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:05.440
 Mongo, why don't you sit down and talk to us about what you think about religion.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.200
 I would have ended the show.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.560
 I would have been like, this is awful.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:16.440
 This is awful, but part of me saw that path.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.360
 Because it's been done before, right?

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.880
 It's been done before.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.200
 Shows flanderize themselves all the time.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:27.160
 You have a popular episode and then you just go with it.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.360
 Now I've had episodes where I've talked about Illuminati and Kevin Spacey and stuff like

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.600
 that and they've been some of my highest performing content on YouTube.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.080
 Before the YouTube shorts, now that's blowing all the episodes on YouTube away.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.120
 YouTube's not really set up for long form, no image.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.800
 It's video platform, right?

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.800
 I'm talking about stuff.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.680
 The podcast has always been more successful than the YouTube, right?

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:52.680
 But as far as YouTube goes, I've always thought about when I do these Illuminati episodes about

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.120
 Kevin Spacey, I've talked about this before, all these big episodes.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.160
 They're always huge blowout episodes.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.880
 Ellen DeGeneres is under house arrest.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.800
 Tom Hanks is secretly working for the Illuminati.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.800
 Huge numbers.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.120
 And then people go, what?

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:08.360
 This sucked because they expected me to be taking it seriously.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.760
 People for the first time were finding the show and it wasn't what they thought.

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.300
 Now, long time listeners of the show loved it, right?

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:17.080
 But every time that happened, I thought, okay, so this is interesting.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.120
 There's this listenership that I have, that I love, and a show that I love doing.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.480
 And then I could just do a shill show.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.520
 I could do a show believing in all these stuff that I know other people are going to believe

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.520
 in.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.360
 I'm going to make tons of money, right?

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.880
 The show's going to blow up.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.440
 There's a YouTuber I watch named Andy Signor.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.560
 He used to be on movie junkies or movie fights.

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.760
 He was movie fights, movie fights.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.440
 Screen Junkies was the name of the channel.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.360
 He was one of the very first casualties of me too.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:49.200
 And he came out afterwards after all these lawsuits and said, listen, she made everything

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.000
 up and here's the proof and da, da, da, da.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.080
 So if you don't like Andy Signor, I understand why you don't like Andy Signor.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:00.360
 But he seems to have had some receipts that a lot of the allegations against him.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.520
 He said, I did cheat on my wife and all this stuff.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:07.560
 So Andy Signor has his own show now called Popcorn Planet.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.560
 And when he first started up, I was watching it a lot.

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.560
 He's doing movie stuff.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.560
 He's doing movie stuff.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.840
 And I was like, okay, but he didn't have the same views as he used to.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.360
 His reputation was tarnished.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.520
 He was coming back out of a hole.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:25.080
 And then he started like covering stuff about Britney Spears conservatorship or the Amber

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.520
 Herd or the Zash.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.880
 He went hard on the Zack Snyder guys during the Snyder Cut.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.160
 His channel exploded.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:36.800
 So then he just started doing Britney Spears stuff and Amber Herd stuff and beefing with

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.600
 Ray Fisher from the DC movies.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600
 He's Cyborg.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.960
 And as a longtime fan, that wasn't the content I was interested in, but he knew people.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.120
 He was making more money.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.840
 He had a whole new fan base and he had all these new people.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:56.920
 So I just kind of like, you know, kind of waved as the boat was sailing off East to

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.920
 take him out there.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.680
 I mean, hey, I wish you the best of luck.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.880
 That wasn't the content that I was interested in.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.520
 Why did he even start talking about that?

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.000
 Oh, he flandered rights to the show.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 Right.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 He did a couple episodes.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.040
 And to me, it became a gossip channel, not a movie channel.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.680
 The gossip involved movie stars, but I'm really not into whether any of that stuff.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:21.440
 So I remember thinking like I could do the Kevin Spacey shows until the show ends, which

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.480
 actually turned out to be pretty quickly.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.960
 I think YouTube was cracking down on those guys.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:31.200
 You know, this was all, you know, pre like 2019, 2020, before they really started coming

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.280
 down on conspiracy content.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.160
 But I remember thinking I could do that.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.160
 I didn't want to do that.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.160
 I didn't want to make a show where I was lying to people.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.480
 And then I wanted to sign a rabbit up like this.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:49.240
 I remember thinking, I remember at one point I had Mungo, Hans Wormhat and Miley Cyrus.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.920
 I wish I knew what episode this was.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.160
 There's a very first time I did this.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.960
 I released a season X trailer.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.400
 It was like season five or six or something like that, where all of the Dead Rabbit radio

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.320
 vehicles were destroyed, all of them.

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.640
 And there was this evil group that had come after.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.760
 I thought it was a kind of fun idea.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.480
 I came over there while I was in the shower.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.480
 I literally walked out.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.600
 I was still dripping wet.

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:15.320
 I recorded all these dumb voices, edited together, had a lot of fun with it.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.920
 Miley Cyrus, longtime personal friend.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.840
 Long time, people get so mad when I bring that up.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.120
 Long time personal friend, Miley Cyrus.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.840
 See, that's an in joke, right?

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:31.000
 You wouldn't know that if you hadn't listened to the episode where I talked about my personal

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 mysic.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.400
 I make it even more intimate each time.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.720
 My personal friendship with Miley Cyrus.

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.800
 I'd give no other details to that.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.800
 We talked for a while.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:45.680
 Miley Cyrus, Hans Wormhat and Mungo showed up.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.400
 We formed a team to take down the bad guys who blew up all the vehicles.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.960
 I thought it was a great way to start off whatever season that was.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:55.880
 I kind of toyed with the idea of doing it again next season and I was like, nope, nope, no

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.880
 extra work.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.040
 The show's already hard enough.

00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.040
 That was a fun thing.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.840
 It was, again, it was impulsive and you did it and it was fun.

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.760
 When I sit and I plan stuff out and I'm trying to like do all these jokes, they don't land.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.520
 I'm not a comedian in that sense.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.320
 I remember thinking at one point, we did the trailer.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.560
 People really liked that.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.360
 I think Mungo's come back as his son or my son Mungo Jr.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.360
 People think that's funny.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.040
 But I remember at one point I was planning on doing an episode about the people versus

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.480
 Michael Jackson because I personally believe that Michael Jackson was innocent of those

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.640
 allegations.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.840
 This was when that documentary came out, like Surviving Neverland or Finding Neverland

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.080
 or whatever it was.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:41.800
 It was trash journalism, it was trash true crime, garbage.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.080
 And I was thinking about doing a rebuttal for that and Han's warm hat was going to be

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.240
 his defense lawyer and I was like putting up notes and I go, this is awful.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.640
 No one wants to hear me do this voice for 30 minutes straight, especially about a subject

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.080
 that they may not even care about.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:02.200
 Who really cares whether or not Michael Jackson's guilty, either just fans or smear journalists,

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.800
 in my opinion.

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.960
 And then, so I scratched that idea but I was planning it.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.640
 I actually have a special folder of Michael Jackson research.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.640
 I do.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.960
 He's like, no, we're not going to do that.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:17.000
 And I didn't feel confident enough in me just telling the story and whatever.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.840
 And then I was going to do an episode, I don't remember what the setup was, but it was Mungo

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.340
 in the morning.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:31.120
 It was a radio talk show skit that was going to be reoccurring with Mungo and Han's.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.560
 And it was like, this is trash.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.480
 Why are you even trying to do this?

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.480
 Mungo was funny the first time you did him.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.400
 He's shown up a couple times and it's, even if you don't know the Mungo joke, you just

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:46.200
 figure Jason is someone who would name his son Mungo Jr. even though you're not Mungo

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.200
 Sr.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.600
 Even if you didn't know the Mungo setup, it's a funny joke.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.800
 So I wanted to, as cars are all of a sudden starting up all around me, I have to end this

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.800
 and this has been really long.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.560
 I wanted to show you guys the history of, I never mind, I'm going to wait till this truck

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:03.280
 goes away.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:08.320
 I wanted to show you guys the behind the scenes, just a simple episode, right?

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.800
 But I almost, I could have ruined the show.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:15.240
 I could have ruined the show by bringing on these reoccurring guests, which I think would

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.760
 become funny or would get super old quickly, right?

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.960
 It's like, what?

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.460
 Some kids got molested.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:22.460
 Here comes Mungo.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.480
 Oh, who's the bad guy who touched that kid?

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.160
 Like sometimes it would be super out of place, right?

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.840
 I think it would have gotten old really fast.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:34.920
 I think new listeners would have been like, why is he doing these, why is he doing these

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.920
 voices?

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.760
 Like what does this have anything to do with the topic?

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.120
 And it's just, it's that wire, you know?

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.600
 It's that wire you have to balance.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:49.160
 When you're doing something creative, there is a balance between listening to the listeners

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.160
 and doing your own thing.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:56.120
 And I think we've all have a hundred examples of shows that have been ruined because of relationships

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.400
 that you're like, what, why are those two characters together?

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:04.080
 Kylo Ren and whoever that girl was, Skywalker daughter, are together now?

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.680
 I don't watch, I don't watch any of those movies, but I know people are like, they're

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:11.080
 so shoehorned in, but the fans, quote unquote, the fans wanted it, right?

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.480
 This vocal minority wanted it and people are like, this is dumb.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.480
 We've all seen that.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:20.840
 It's really easy to mess up your own project and I'm glad so far I haven't been able to

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.840
 do that, right?

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:22.840
 I've tried.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:23.840
 I've tried.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.760
 I almost had Mungo in the morning.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.480
 I was radio DJ DJ thing.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.080
 I thought it was so funny.

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.640
 I was like, I've recorded fake ads.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:37.440
 I remember once I had like a week of fake ads for Sprite or Burger King.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.720
 The burger ads might have ended up on the show, but I remember I have a file of fake

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:47.280
 funny ads that recorded and then I thought, dude, nobody likes listening to real ads,

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.480
 let alone ads for things that don't exist.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.160
 Why are you wasting their time?

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:55.000
 So that's a bit of behind the scenes of the comedy part of the podcast.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.240
 I hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope you guys enjoyed the decisions I've made, right?

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.400
 We still got another thousand episodes or so in front of us, right?

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.120
 We're coming to the first thousand.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:09.400
 Who knows where this show will grow till then, but until tomorrow we got two more episodes

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.720
 of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics.

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:14.760
 I don't know what they are yet, but I do know what one of them is.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.120
 One of them is the KGB vs. Aliens episode.

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.440
 And again, in other, that episode's really weird.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.920
 I just listened to that the other day and I thought you would have recorded a completely

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.320
 different episode today.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:28.440
 So let's go ahead and take a look at that one tomorrow and I will see you guys then.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.680
 Travelers, insurance smart takes.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.560
 A storm puts a hole in my roof.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.160
 I could stay with my physical trainer buddy, Keith.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.320
 He calls himself Coach.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.400
 Luckily, loss of use coverage can help pay for me to stay at a hotel while my home is repaired.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.960
 No 5 a.m. trampoline kettlebell swings for me.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.800
 Coach.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.720
 Travelers, it's better under the umbrella.

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.880
 Policy subject to availability and eligibility.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.200
 Coverage depends on facts of a loss and policy terms.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.000
