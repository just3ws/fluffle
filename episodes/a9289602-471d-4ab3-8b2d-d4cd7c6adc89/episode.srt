00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics where we listen

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,840
 to an older episode with some new info, a new little back end apart.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,040
 I used to do them in the front, but then you took forever to get to the episode, I couldn't

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,960
 reference anything and I saved them till the end.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,080
 This was an episode super early in the run of Dead Rabbit Radio Episode 122.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:46,560
 When I first started doing the episodes, I set them up with a 3 digit code, 001002.

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,680
 And I thought that seemed a little audacious, right?

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,680
 I was like, what?

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,400
 You're going to put out that many episodes?

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,840
 We're getting ready to break the code, we're getting ready.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
 We're what?

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,640
 80 episodes away from 1000 episodes, but episode 122 is way back in the Dead Rabbit

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,720
 catalog and it's an important episode for Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
 It really is.

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,840
 It's one of my favorite episodes.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,960
 For a couple reasons that'll come apparent when I talk about it at the end, but yeah,

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,840
 this again, I want to profile it because this episode going forward was a make or break

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,200
 moment for Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,160
 So everyone sit back and enjoy episode 122 of Dead Rabbit Radio, Thomas Dick and the

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,040
 22 trillion alien theory.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,600
 A crusty criminal, a cat that defies all odds.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,080
 And then we take a look at the life of a man who tried to blend Christianity and science

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,560
 with hilarious results today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:59,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
 I'm having a great day.

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,960
 I hope you're having a great day too.

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,480
 We got a lot of good stuff today.

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,040
 I did want to make a quick note.

30
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,800
 I've tried recording this part on a couple different podcasts.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
 I always have to edit it out for time.

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,080
 Let's see if we survive now.

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,800
 First episode of the podcast, I watched the trailer for Hereditary for whatever reason.

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,920
 I thought it was a good idea at the time while I was recording the podcast.

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,640
 My complaint was that everyone said it was the scariest movie since The Exorcist and

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,680
 I've been fooled before with like the Babadook and it follows and all this new wave of artistic

37
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,960
 horror movies like this millennial artistic horror movie genre, whatever you want to call

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
 it.

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
 So, well, the trailer looks good.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
 I'll give it a shot.

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,120
 I gave it a shot and my initial instincts were right.

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,960
 The movie was not scary at all.

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,320
 The movie is basically about, I mean, this is really dumbing it down, but it's about

44
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,320
 a demon with a nut allergy.

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
 What?

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,560
 A demon possesses a girl.

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,600
 Either the demon has the nut allergy or the demon possesses a girl with a nut allergy.

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,040
 The girl eats nuts, then she can't breathe, so she sticks her head out a car window and

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,240
 the driver goes too close to a power line and knocks her head off.

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,240
 And then the next 40 minutes is people crying over this poor girl who got her head knocked

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,800
 off and then at the end of the day a bunch of old naked people show up and the demon's

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,360
 trying to get into the girl's brother and the old naked people are standing in like

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,720
 all the corners of their house, full frontal, by the way.

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,400
 If you ever want to see what a 70 year old naked man looks like, watch Hereditary.

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,880
 She jumps out of the window, which was the most believable part because that's how most

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,360
 people would get away from a bunch of old naked people.

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,560
 And then the demon possesses him and he goes into a tree house and they give him a crown

58
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
 at the end.

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
 Two hours long, by the way.

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,120
 Two hour long movie.

61
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,800
 Beautifully shot, but very schlocky plot with a lot of like drama put into it to make it

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,320
 feel like a heavy movie.

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
 So here's my recommendation.

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,080
 If you're looking for a movie that, if you're looking for a movie that has a schlocky basic

65
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,920
 plot but wants something more, there's an independent film that came out a couple years

66
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,640
 ago called Resolution.

67
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,360
 Two brothers go into the woods, one has a heroin addiction, the other one is there to

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
 help him kick the heroin addiction.

69
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
 They're in a cabin in the woods and there's something out there.

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,480
 Very schlocky basic plot, but the way that it's handled, it's a really good, tense,

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,120
 fun horror movie.

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,600
 And it makes you think afterwards, it's one of those movies that you're like, "Hmm,

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,200
 you kind of think about it for a couple days."

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,560
 Resolution, if you're in the mood for something that I think is far superior to Hereditary.

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,240
 Okay, so now that that book's been sealed on that movie, let's go ahead and get started

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
 with the episode.

77
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,400
 So we have a couple stories today.

78
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,480
 Two of them are from New News.

79
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,680
 Now I know people are probably like, "Yes, you sold that from PewDiePie."

80
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,440
 And I have to say, I don't know who PewDiePie is, so I do actually.

81
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,400
 I watch this channel all the time, but anyways, it works.

82
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
 It works.

83
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,120
 So, oh yes.

84
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
 First off, we're gonna talk about...

85
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,320
 Now you know, I've had this issue before where, hypothetically, hypothetically speaking,

86
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,960
 let's say that I'm a criminal.

87
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,080
 Now if I was a criminal in the 1970s, I would be like, "Oh, I just gotta wear these gloves.

88
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
 Can't leave fingerprints.

89
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,640
 That's how they're gonna catch me."

90
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:33,040
 And if you were a criminal in the 1700s, you'd be like, "Better not stand here at this crime

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,200
 scene so they don't catch me."

92
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,560
 So it's like crime detection has changed over the centuries, basically.

93
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,920
 First they did blood typing.

94
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,880
 They'd find the blood and they'd be like, "Hmm, this guy has A negative blood."

95
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,760
 Round up everyone who has A negative blood.

96
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,520
 And then it became fingerprints.

97
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,880
 Well, maybe the fingerprints came first, actually, but I mean, they had these progression of

98
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,600
 techniques and it's his arms race where the criminals commit crimes and they don't ever

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
 really know.

100
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,440
 When you commit the crime, you're doing it on the basis of the evidence-gathering techniques

101
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
 they have then.

102
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,960
 You don't know what's coming down the pipe.

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,080
 You're a serial killer back in the 80s.

104
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,920
 You're not really thinking about DNA.

105
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,880
 In 1983, there was an arm-grott--okay, and actually, here, let me back up again.

106
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,160
 I know that was an exciting beginning.

107
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,000
 I think this story takes place in Britain because these articles, again, are from 2004.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,560
 The reason why I think it takes place in Britain because they refer to an armored car as a

109
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,800
 caravan company, whatever that is.

110
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
 I'm assuming it's an armored car.

111
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,240
 And the reason why I'm assuming that is because it had 38,000 pounds in it, so that's like,

112
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,080
 I don't know, 30,000 bucks.

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,360
 But anyways, back to our action scene.

114
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,640
 Shooting out with this caravan.

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,160
 I just think of Lawrence of Arabia, but give me the gold, give me the gold.

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
 Put it all in there.

117
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,720
 Apparently, leprechaun.

118
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,200
 They're stealing from leprechauns.

119
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,720
 So these criminals, they rob this caravan in 1983, and they get away with 38,000 pounds.

120
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,160
 And the dude's running away, and at one point, he takes off, he had a stalking, which, you

121
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,080
 know, like a pantyhose over his face to disguise his face.

122
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
 Again, it's 1983.

123
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,000
 They weren't really thinking that much.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,720
 Put pantyhose over his face to disguise it, and at one point, he pulls the pantyhose off

125
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
 of his face.

126
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,560
 He probably left the ones on his leg still, but he pulled the pantyhose off of his face

127
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,880
 and kept running.

128
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,760
 Now we're in the year 2004, which is where my new news folder comes from.

129
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:35,480
 And the detectives, I can imagine a single detective has been staring at this piece of

130
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,240
 pantyhose for the past 20 years, but he's looking at it, and he goes, "Dude, this thing's full

131
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
 of dandruff.

132
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,840
 Let's see if we can get some DNA."

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
 And they did.

134
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,400
 The guy had, I guess, bad dandruff, enough dandruff that's noticeable, and they pulled

135
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,080
 some of the dandruff off, which is, you know, skin flakes, so it would have DNA in it.

136
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
 They tested it.

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,560
 20 years later, he got arrested for this crime, for this main robbery.

138
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,360
 And you know that at that point, he's probably like, "I've already spent the money," and

139
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,720
 he was doing whatever else, and he's sitting there, and he's like, "Man, I really should

140
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,120
 have bought some head and shoulders."

141
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
 That thing popped in his head for a second.

142
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,280
 "I really should have bought some dandruff shampoo, but I didn't.

143
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,920
 Why am I having that thought right now?"

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:19,040
 All of a sudden, army guys, or probably more likely police, break into his house and arrest

145
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
 him.

146
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,920
 Convicted because he had dandruff.

147
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,080
 So, and, I mean, so he never could have predicted that.

148
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,480
 He never could have predicted that.

149
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,440
 If he did, he probably should have worn two pantyhoses, one to keep all of his dandruff

150
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,240
 in, and the other one to disguise his face.

151
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,760
 Or simply don't take your mask off until you get home.

152
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
 That's another pro tip.

153
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,720
 Interestingly enough, this happened in 2004.

154
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,120
 He got sentenced to 15 years in prison, so you know what that means.

155
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,440
 He gets free next year.

156
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,960
 That's a great thing about doing news from decades ago, because it seems oddly relevant

157
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
 sometimes.

158
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,440
 Okay, next, new news.

159
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
 Very short one.

160
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,920
 I just thought this one was adorable.

161
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,560
 2004, if you could have guessed.

162
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,840
 There was this family in Russia, and they're like, "You know what?

163
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
 We should do...

164
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
 Let's go on a vacation."

165
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,440
 The family's like, "Yay, where are we going?"

166
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,880
 And they're like, "Siberia."

167
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,040
 So for whatever reason, they go to Siberia to visit.

168
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
 What is there?

169
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
 Shuts?

170
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
 And caribou?

171
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,440
 And a giant impact crater from an airburst meteorite?

172
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
 And gulags?

173
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
 Siberia.

174
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,760
 If you lived here, you'd already be home.

175
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,720
 Like, who wants to go there?

176
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,080
 Anyways, they vacation to Siberia.

177
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,440
 They go sit at the side of a frozen lake.

178
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,940
 It's a wasteland.

179
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,560
 But anyways, so they're in Siberia.

180
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
 Maybe they like skiing.

181
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,720
 I guess it's probably good for skiing.

182
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,160
 I imagine it's flat though.

183
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,000
 I always imagine Siberia was just a continent-wide plain.

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Are there mountains over there?

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I don't know.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,760
 Anyways, this family from Russia decides to go further east.

187
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
 They go to Siberia and they bring their little cat.

188
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
 They bring Kuzya.

189
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,800
 "Hey, Kuzya.

190
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,000
 Let's go on this vacation to this horrid wasteland that we used to send political prisoners

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 to."

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,880
 So they're there.

193
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
 And it's sucked.

194
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
 The people were fine with it.

195
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,160
 They stayed there for about three weeks.

196
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,480
 But Kuzya was like, "I'm out.

197
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,720
 Do this place totally blows."

198
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,240
 It's like super cold and it's dry.

199
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,480
 And I'm pretty sure there's a house made out of toothpaste over there.

200
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
 I don't like this.

201
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,080
 I don't like this at all.

202
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,120
 But they just heard him go, "Rawr."

203
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,840
 And he like jumped off their lap and he ran away.

204
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,480
 So they looked for him for the three weeks.

205
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 They're like, "Kuzya.

206
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
 Kuzya."

207
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,560
 And he didn't come and they're like all sad.

208
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
 They're like, "Well, it sucks."

209
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,200
 I mean, again, lesson learned.

210
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,920
 Don't go to Siberia for your vacation.

211
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,520
 But eventually their time ended and they had to go home.

212
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,560
 They were like, "Well, our vacation's over.

213
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,640
 We have to go back home to the West Russia."

214
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,920
 So they leave and they leave little Kuzya there three months later after they leave.

215
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
 They hear it.

216
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,120
 Are there a door and they're like, "What?

217
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
 Did you buy a new cat?

218
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,400
 No, I'm still getting over Kuzya disappearing in the wilderness."

219
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
 They open the door.

220
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
 It's Kuzya.

221
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,840
 Kuzya walked 1,300 miles across Siberia to get back home.

222
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,720
 That's how much he hated Siberia.

223
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,160
 He could have just been like, "Eh, I'm just going to lay here or I'll build a new home

224
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,600
 here or meet like a nice cute cat woman."

225
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 No, he's like, "Screw this.

226
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
 I'm going home."

227
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,280
 He walks through Siberia.

228
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,560
 When they get him, they notice that he had lost weight.

229
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,720
 His claws were basically turned to little nubs.

230
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,180
 Like they had been completely filed down.

231
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,120
 He had meat, animal meat in his teeth.

232
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
 Supposedly animal meat.

233
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,160
 I don't think they took it to the DNA lab.

234
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,240
 The article said he had flesh in his teeth and he had a couple bite marks on him.

235
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,920
 But other than that, he was totally fine.

236
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,440
 Little Kuzya.

237
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,760
 Imagine hating some place that much that you would walk 1,300 miles to get out of it.

238
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,160
 I don't even think I would do that.

239
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
 I'd probably walk 10 and be like, "You know what?

240
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,200
 Maybe I can start a new life here."

241
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,080
 I'd probably walk two and do that.

242
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,680
 Sad ending to the story though.

243
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,080
 The story is from 2004, so little Kuzya most likely has passed away by now.

244
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,400
 But if you're in heaven, Kuzya.

245
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:19,320
 I hope it's warm and sunny and is opposite of Siberia as you can get.

246
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
 That was an EVP.

247
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,800
 Kuzya's contacting us from beyond the grave.

248
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 Okay.

249
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,400
 The next story I want to talk about, I was going to talk about yesterday, but I ran out

250
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
 of time.

251
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,560
 And I think it's an interesting story because it kind of hinges on that conflict between

252
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
 religion and science.

253
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,160
 Now the conflict's been going on since the first nerd picked up a textbook.

254
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,880
 We're going to look at the life and times of a man named Thomas Dick.

255
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
 No.

256
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
 I will say this.

257
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,120
 I found out about this guy because I was prepping another story and I was like, "Oh, that's

258
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
 interesting.

259
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,640
 A Christian philosopher/scientist."

260
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,080
 And I was like, "Oh, I'm going to look into this guy."

261
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:02,600
 I'm kind of scrolling through my phone, looking at it at work, and then I just started laughing.

262
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,320
 First off, let's address his last name.

263
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,760
 Now I am not so immature that when I see a guy with the last name of Dick, I immediately

264
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,520
 think of penises.

265
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
 I saw his name.

266
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
 I'm like, "Thomas Dick."

267
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
 It didn't even occur to me.

268
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
 I'm like, "Oh, you know."

269
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,960
 I started reading the article and it's like, on Wikipedia, it was like, "Thomas Dick was

270
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,360
 born in this year."

271
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
 And he was doing this.

272
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,480
 And then it said, "He worked at his father's linen shop.

273
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,920
 His father made like, wove clothes or something like that."

274
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,280
 I guess I should preface this.

275
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,040
 This starts off in the 1700s.

276
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,360
 This is mostly late 1700s, early 1800s.

277
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,680
 It's like the father had this linen shop where he made clothes.

278
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,560
 His father's name, this great Christian philosopher, would go on to be this author, this influential

279
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,880
 author.

280
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,800
 His father's name is Mungo Dick.

281
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,080
 Mungo Dick.

282
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,480
 And I laughed out loud when I saw that.

283
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,560
 Now that's when I was like, "Okay, let's break down Mungo Dick here for a second.

284
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
 One, it makes it sound like he has a huge dick."

285
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,280
 If you go, "Dude, that's a Mungo Dick."

286
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,920
 You don't think, "Oh, that must be a Scottish name."

287
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,160
 You're like, "No, that means dude has a big dick."

288
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,360
 Now to be fair, when these guys were around in the late 1700s, early 1800s, Dick didn't

289
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
 mean penis yet.

290
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,400
 But it does now.

291
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,480
 So when I'm reading an article and there's a guy named Mungo Dick in it, I'm gonna laugh

292
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
 out loud.

293
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,440
 Secondly, and again, I know that Mungo is, oh, and by the way, Mungo means beloved in

294
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,520
 Scottish.

295
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,560
 So basically his name is beloved dick.

296
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,560
 But I get that Mungo is a Scottish name and it's like probably a little racist for me

297
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
 to make fun of it.

298
00:14:50,560 --> 00:15:01,160
 But when I think of Mungo, I think of a eight foot tall, brute, golem-esque, not golem from

299
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,680
 Lord of the Rings, but like big stone dude, Solomon Grundy dude.

300
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,880
 That's who you think of, you think of a henchman.

301
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,000
 You think of a lunk, guy named Mungo.

302
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,320
 Imagine growing up in a house with a guy named Mungo.

303
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,640
 Again, you guys are like, "Jason, this is a..."

304
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,520
 So I'm trying to read this article now after having this vision of this lurchin henchman

305
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,520
 just standing behind this young boy and I just couldn't focus anymore.

306
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:40,160
 So Thomas Dick was, I just imagine this giant like Mungo.

307
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,520
 Mungo no like science.

308
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,040
 Mungo like God.

309
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,600
 And then Thomas Dick's like, "But dad, you have to understand, God made science."

310
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,440
 And Mungo's like, "Whoa, head hurt."

311
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,960
 And I imagine that was pretty much his childhood life.

312
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,520
 And you go, "Well, that might be an exaggeration, but it's not really because he wanted to

313
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,320
 be a scientist because he saw a meteor one day."

314
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,120
 And so he's reading all the books he could even when he was in the linen shop.

315
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,680
 Mungo's like crashing through the shop, throwing books around.

316
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,280
 Make yarn, make yarn.

317
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,440
 And so, anyways, so Thomas Dick, because he had no support from his parents early on,

318
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,720
 he actually made his own telescope.

319
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,600
 He got like some eyeglasses and ground down the lenses.

320
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,400
 I think that story is probably a bit apocryphal.

321
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,440
 I don't think that story actually happened.

322
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,000
 But it would be awesome if it did, just to give something for Mungo to destroy.

323
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 He's like, "No, I think."

324
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 He's like, "Dad, no, I worked on that."

325
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,800
 "Ugh, only see with real God eyes."

326
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
 Anyways, by the time he was 16, his parents kind of started to warm up to the egg.

327
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,440
 Because I guess I should have said this before Mungo destroyed the shop.

328
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
 They were Christian.

329
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,760
 They were like, not like super crazy Westboro Baptist Church Christian, but they were devout.

330
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,040
 So when their son was like, "Oh, look at shiny stars.

331
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,480
 Maybe that's like a rock from another galaxy."

332
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,080
 Mungo's like smashing through the wall.

333
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:08,080
 So anyways, but by the time they're 16, they're like, "Ugh, I mean, ugh, science may be okay."

334
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,360
 And then Thomas is like, "Yay."

335
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,520
 Anyways, so he starts to like really get into this science stuff.

336
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
 Now what's okay?

337
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
 He becomes a teacher.

338
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,960
 He becomes a writer.

339
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,960
 And he starts writing articles for a magazine.

340
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,400
 And I thought this was another just bizarre...

341
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,840
 Okay, you have a magazine.

342
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,840
 He started...

343
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
 Okay, so he starts...

344
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,320
 I'm reading this article on thing and who wrote this?

345
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,120
 Mad Libs on a board afternoon.

346
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,200
 We got Mungo Dick running around.

347
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,400
 And he writes for a magazine called Monthly Magazine.

348
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,040
 That is the most...

349
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,680
 I mean, I thought about it afterwards and I thought, yes, there are newspapers called

350
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,400
 like The Daily Star or The Daily Tribune.

351
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000
 But I don't know if I've ever seen a newspaper called Daily Paper.

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,320
 That's just it.

353
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,680
 But anyways, he wrote for a magazine that came out every month called Monthly Magazine.

354
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,520
 It should have been actually another thing about it.

355
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,800
 It should have been Mungo's Monthly Magazine.

356
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,000
 That would have been much better.

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 It was...

358
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,680
 That would be a better plot.

359
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,920
 Mungo actually has a Monthly Magazine, not a Lennon shop.

360
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,160
 I'm glad I'm rewriting this guy's life history.

361
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,600
 And then there's a magazine dedicated to religious topics and sports.

362
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,560
 And Mungo's like, "Me put religion in for soul, but sports is what makes me feel alive."

363
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,000
 And it's all like rugby stuff because they're in Europe.

364
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,960
 And the sun's trying to like sneak in science articles.

365
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,960
 And so as Mungo's like proofreading, he has his little glasses on on his giant monster

366
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
 head.

367
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,640
 As he's trying to proofread the magazine, he notices like in the sports article, because

368
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,600
 the sports article was saying stuff like, "Ball smashed through goal.

369
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 Team win."

370
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,760
 And then he starts to notice like equations sneaking in there like the ball arc to 90

371
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,480
 degrees.

372
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,800
 And then Mungo's just like smashing the printing press.

373
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,440
 "Son, what you do?

374
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,320
 Where these numbers come from?"

375
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,280
 Okay, let's get back to the real story here.

376
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,960
 Thomas Dick ends up writing these books and he writes a bunch of books about Christian

377
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
 philosophy.

378
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,880
 One of them, his big book was The Christian Philosopher or The Connection of Science and

379
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,360
 Christian Philosophy with Religion.

380
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,520
 And that was a huge book and it was about him trying to merge the two ideas together.

381
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,400
 And from then on out, he was known as the Christian philosopher and he was highly regarded

382
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,280
 as like a well thought out guy who actually did a good blend of science and religion.

383
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,680
 But where he started to go wrong, because that's all just thought experiments where

384
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,520
 I could say, "Here's science, here's religion, and these are the ways we can look at them."

385
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:46,000
 So it started to go wrong other than Mungo then smashing through the city of London.

386
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,640
 That was actually a big incident.

387
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,560
 They had to take Mungo down because he was attacking a bunch of Bobbies.

388
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,960
 So but the big problem he made was that he started to basically formulate scientific theories

389
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
 himself.

390
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,800
 And he was a smart guy and people have looked back and said, "It's interesting because he

391
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,080
 used data."

392
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,480
 He actually thought like a scientist, but his conclusions were wildly off.

393
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:19,360
 And he came to this calculation that there's 250 people per square mile in Britain and

394
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,000
 there's millions and millions of square miles in the solar system.

395
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,880
 God would not create an empty universe, therefore to extrapolate all that information in our

396
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:40,600
 solar system alone, 22 trillion living creatures from little ant monsters to full humanoids.

397
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,040
 And our solar system alone 22 trillion people.

398
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,120
 On the moon, he believed there were 4 billion people.

399
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,560
 Now of course this caught the attention of millions of people, very controversial in

400
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,560
 the scientific community, but it excited the imagination of the public who read the book.

401
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,760
 They're like, "Whoa, we're surrounded by, we're in a living universe."

402
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:08,840
 In 1837, Thomas Dick came up with the idea to draw a giant triangle in the middle of

403
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,480
 Siberia.

404
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,680
 So that way other aliens would go, "Hey look, there's life down there."

405
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,640
 And it's funny because that's a stupid idea now.

406
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,400
 But back then they didn't have cities illuminated with lights.

407
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,000
 Like really the only way that you could look at a planet in passing to see if there was

408
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,400
 life on it back then would to have a continent sized drawing on it.

409
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,360
 And he's like, "Listen, I know that's gonna take a lot of work, but my dad and a plow

410
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,080
 that triangle is done in a day.

411
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,560
 He can easily walk across Siberia in a day."

412
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,240
 "Hey, I didn't realize that, Siberia and Kuzya.

413
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,000
 Anyway, so the cat, the cat meow.

414
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,760
 Mungo like cat."

415
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,760
 He's like petting the cat and they're like, "No Mungo, no, no, you're threatening it too

416
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
 hard."

417
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 "Oh, Mungo, so sad."

418
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:02,920
 So anyways, what happened was of course as scientific advancements get better, his theories

419
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,360
 start to fall further and further out of favor.

420
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,240
 And a story that we're gonna be covering tomorrow, let's consider this a little bit a part one.

421
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,160
 He plays a minor role in that story and that's why I'm talking about it now.

422
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,280
 He plays a minor role in that story.

423
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,160
 And that story also helped lead to his downfall in a way because it was a hoax that he got

424
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,880
 caught up in unknowingly.

425
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,280
 He didn't know he was getting caught up in it.

426
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,400
 And then, you know, so he was this great writer and philosopher and stuff like that, but in

427
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,520
 the end he died pretty much penniless.

428
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,040
 He didn't make a lot of good deals with his publishers and he died.

429
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,800
 His books, other people, David Livingston, the dude who was like in the jungles and they're

430
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,160
 like Livingston, I presume.

431
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,400
 He got lost in the jungle or something.

432
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,440
 I don't know why you're famous for getting lost in the jungle, but anyways, he went out

433
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,080
 there and did a bunch of like nature work and other jungle stuff.

434
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,360
 And he's famous, he's famous, but so he's just not nobody.

435
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,880
 But I guess he's famous just for being lost.

436
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,920
 Anyways, I guess his review doesn't matter now that I just realized he's just a guy who

437
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,160
 doesn't know directions.

438
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:19,280
 He said that the books that Thomas Dick wrote were on the level of the Bible.

439
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,960
 That's the level of esteem he had in his lifetime.

440
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,960
 People looked to him for a way to bridge those two things and he ended up dying pretty much

441
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,200
 penniless.

442
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,160
 Mungo actually had to dig his grave with his bare hands crying the whole time going, "Why

443
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,880
 does God take son?

444
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,520
 No God.

445
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
 Only science!"

446
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,520
 And then like lightning.

447
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,920
 So that didn't happen, obviously.

448
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
 That didn't happen, obviously.

449
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:56,920
 It is interesting though to note that again the word Dick did not mean penis when he was

450
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,760
 young, but by the time Thomas Dick died, the word Dick definitely was slaying for penis.

451
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,840
 So I'm sure he had to hear a lot of jokes before his last five years of life about having

452
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,680
 a dad named Mungo Dick.

453
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,080
 But that's a life in times of Thomas Dick.

454
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,400
 I wanted to talk about that.

455
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,520
 I think the story is interesting and I think it's interesting how they've still never

456
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,560
 really been able to combine those two paths.

457
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,480
 So maybe they're not compatible science and religion, but again I think science doesn't

458
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,200
 care whether or not they're compatible and religion does want them to be compatible,

459
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,640
 does kind of go on to it, and that's really what that story exemplifies.

460
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,000
 Thomas Dick was really trying to say, "Hey listen, give me some of that science, give

461
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 me some of that knowledge.

462
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 I'm with you."

463
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,760
 Yeah, we've never been able to really find that gap.

464
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,080
 You hear a lot of paranormal investigators saying, "Hey, let's get a scientist over here.

465
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,400
 Let's use this equipment to see if we can scientifically prove ghosts exist."

466
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,720
 You never hear a scientist goes, "You know what we really need to figure out how the

467
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,040
 Higgs boson works?

468
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,320
 We need a bunch of psychics.

469
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,840
 Let's get some remote viewers over to CERN and find out what's going on."

470
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
 Weird divide.

471
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,400
 It's a weird little break.

472
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360

 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

476
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,520
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

477
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,280
 Have a great one, guys.

478
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:34,800
 So that was episode 122.

479
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,560
 Thomas Dick and the 22 trillion alien theory.

480
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,960
 It's so funny because on yesterday's episode I was ranting about how I used to fit three

481
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,320
 stories into an episode.

482
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,600
 And I did it all the time and I think that I really crammed a lot of good content.

483
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,120
 And the reason why I did that, I don't do it anymore because I realized how much that

484
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,040
 last episode, the house that eats the dead, drove me nuts.

485
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,120
 I go, "These are three really good stories and I'm just blurring past them.

486
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,560
 I'm trying to get three stories done in a short time limit."

487
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,680
 And it's because I don't think the stories, I don't think two of the stories are good

488
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,080
 enough to stand on their own.

489
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,880
 What's interesting is this episode here is the reason why a lot of times I do three

490
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
 stories.

491
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,920
 I like all three of these stories.

492
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,840
 And I think the episode's pretty well-paced, right?

493
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,760
 We have the story starts off, Bandit got caught with Dandruff.

494
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
 Right?

495
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,200
 I mean, it's kind of a cool science true crime story.

496
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,480
 Nowadays I probably could have told that in a minute and put it on my YouTube TikTok

497
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,600
 channel, my YouTube shorts and all that stuff.

498
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
 But I think it's totally fine.

499
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
 I think it's a fun story.

500
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,920
 It's detailed, beginning, middle, end, and now we don't...

501
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,760
 I tried looking for him after the episode.

502
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,560
 I didn't actually go out and look for him, but I tried to see if there was any mention

503
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,960
 of him afterwards because the story ended.

504
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,560
 Like he got out of jail quite a while ago.

505
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,880
 No, no, no follow up for that.

506
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,880
 And then the story about a little cat walking through Siberia.

507
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
 That was considered...

508
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
 There's all...

509
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
 Here's the...

510
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,320
 You know what's interesting about Dead Rabbit Radio is it grew too quickly.

511
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,560
 It grew too quickly.

512
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,680
 There's too many episodes now to wrangle it in.

513
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,240
 There's a big debate on the Patreon Discord.

514
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,400
 And this debate even predated the Patreon Discord.

515
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,520
 The show needs a wiki.

516
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
 The show needs a wiki.

517
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,880
 I got a request from someone, I think it was Nikolai a while back, Nikolai Michigan.

518
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,800
 I think he was asking on the Patreon Discord, "What's the episode with the cat that walked

519
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
 across Siberia?"

520
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,360
 I was like, "I don't know."

521
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,720
 Sometimes I can actually put in enough keywords or put in enough headlines that I'll type

522
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,760
 in Russian cat and the episode will pop up.

523
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,160
 A lot of times people will send me emails, go, "What's that story about the mudcrawler

524
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
 in Utah?"

525
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,440
 And I type in mudcrawler.

526
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
 I remember that episode.

527
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,600
 I really liked that episode.

528
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
 But I couldn't find this episode.

529
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,080
 It basically become lost media within the show itself and people are saying, "Because

530
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,600
 I will go on the Patreon Discord.

531
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,000
 I'll ask this question at least once a month.

532
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,920
 Have I covered this yet?"

533
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,520
 And I'll throw in some weird story and then the people who happen to be on that day, because

534
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,040
 usually I'm prepping a story, right?

535
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,520
 I'm getting ready to record it for that week.

536
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
 Sometimes even that day.

537
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,000
 They'll say, "No, I don't think so."

538
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,880
 We should really have a wiki at this point.

539
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,760
 The thing is, there's what?

540
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,920
 920 Samad episodes, right?

541
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,640
 928 episodes at this point with two to three stories per episode.

542
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,960
 So we're talking about what?

543
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,240
 I'm not the best at math, but a minimum of 1800 plus stories, right?

544
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,480
 That we'd have to catalog in this wiki.

545
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,160
 It would just take a ton of time.

546
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,920
 And then you have to have all the troll control, right?

547
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,120
 Because people go and just write like fart, fart, fart.

548
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,640
 And then you got to go and refix the page stuff like that.

549
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,000
 So which is easy, but I mean, it's just, I always look at what I talked about when I

550
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,240
 did the, when I did the behind the scenes Discord episode, what I need to do a show

551
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,840
 and then everything else.

552
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,560
 So what I need to do the show is my research, my recording and my editing process.

553
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,600
 Anything other than that, if it weighs too much, I cut it loose.

554
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,360
 And if I'm looking at a wiki to set up to find episodes, it's a huge amount of time.

555
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,960
 And then when people troll it, now I got to go and take care of that stuff as well.

556
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,560
 And I know a lot of people are volunteering to set this stuff up, but that's also a huge

557
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,520
 amount of work for them to do, right?

558
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,720
 So anything that is not part of that core process gets cut loose.

559
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,800
 Sometimes that includes the TikToks in the short.

560
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,240
 Sometimes I don't do one for that day because I'm like, I'm just doing too much for the

561
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,400
 show.

562
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,640
 So the podcast is the main thing, but back to back to this episode as a little again,

563
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,240
 yeah, I love behind the scenes stuff.

564
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
 So hope you guys like this stuff too.

565
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,520
 The little cat, Koushka, right?

566
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,600
 Running around Siberia, great story.

567
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,840
 Do you need to spend 15 minutes telling it?

568
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,520
 No, you can tell that story in five to eight minutes and it's a good story beginning, middle

569
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,800
 and end.

570
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,680
 And then we got the Thomas Dick story.

571
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:11,200
 And this story, I wanted to kind of break this down for you because this was a very,

572
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,920
 very big possible cliff that the show could have driven off of this.

573
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,880
 This behind the scenes might last a little longer than some of the other ones.

574
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,000
 But and before I go forward, I want to give a shout out.

575
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,480
 I'm going to put this in the show notes as well way back in the day.

576
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,600
 You guys are fantastic.

577
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,520
 You guys are fantastic.

578
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,040
 Recent point way back in the day, swain on discord.

579
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,520
 This was like the original discord, the original discord put together a animation, a PowerPoint

580
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,520
 animation proof of concept and they used this episode.

581
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,440
 It's only like a minute long.

582
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,320
 I actually should see if he'll let me do use it as a YouTube short, but it's actually just

583
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
 a minute long.

584
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,560
 It's really cool and it's telling its animation story.

585
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,760
 Again, here's the thing.

586
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
 Like I super fantastic, right?

587
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,320
 And I think the idea was what if we started animating episodes every show often before

588
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,120
 putting out so much content?

589
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,880
 That's the problem when you put out five episodes a week.

590
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,240
 If I had started a wiki project when I first started the show, it would be manageable.

591
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,480
 But at this point, it's not every show.

592
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,400
 Often I have to go back and change show notes like mass change show notes.

593
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,160
 And that's a weeks, if not month or too long project.

594
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,520
 I have started that and then I'll just have to give up that way through.

595
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
 Great animation.

596
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,040
 I'll put it in the show notes.

597
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,280
 It's really, really cute.

598
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,840
 It shows what is possible with the show, right?

599
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,480
 Like that would be really cool to have some animated segments.

600
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,240
 But let's talk about the story of Thomas Dick.

601
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,400
 The story of Thomas Dick in and of itself, super fascinating, a scientist and a religious

602
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,440
 figure trying to blend the two.

603
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,040
 And you see that a lot, right?

604
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
 I think it's awesome.

605
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,040
 I think there is a combination between science and religion.

606
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,160
 Not only one cancels out the other, I think they kind of emboldened each other, right?

607
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,040
 And it causes conflict too, which is good because you need conflict to grow.

608
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,880
 I learned that watching Zombies 3.

609
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,960
 I never knew that before, year 2022.

610
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,040
 The story itself is great, right?

611
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,480
 Christian slash scientist who's trying to combine the best of both worlds.

612
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,200
 I don't believe that science and religion are mutually exclusive.

613
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,280
 I think they can actually be great friends and it creates good conflict.

614
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,440
 I think to further your faith or to further your research, you need someone arguing with

615
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
 you and telling you no.

616
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,960
 So I think the character itself, it's not a character, it's a real person, but the person

617
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,800
 himself is super fascinating, right?

618
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
 I love that story.

619
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:47,200
 And then it led into the next story about this moon hoax, which I'll put a link in the show

620
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
 notes.

621
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
 I recommend checking that one out.

622
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
 I haven't listened to it in a while.

623
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,440
 I don't know if I have a ton of stuff to say about it.

624
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,280
 But this episode was super important for Dead or Abbot Radio because when you are doing

625
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,840
 stuff, let me back up here for a second.

626
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,640
 So one of the things that I do, originally I had no notes.

627
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,240
 Originally I would just read an article and then turn on the mic and I would talk about

628
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
 what I had just read.

629
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,600
 And it was really stressful for me because I had to keep looking over at the article

630
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,040
 or rereading and losing my place.

631
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,600
 Then I started writing notes.

632
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,480
 And I can't say the show never intended to be a comedy.

633
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,760
 I think originally it was in the comedy genre.

634
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,260
 It still technically is.

635
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,720
 Actually no, now it's listed as a science show.

636
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,880
 But I was obviously influenced by comedic podcasts like Sophie King podcast and the

637
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,760
 Parapod.

638
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,400
 These were podcasts that I held in really high esteem and they were super funny.

639
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,200
 And I was like, I'll talk about this stuff.

640
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,440
 I'm not going to be super serious and dour about it.

641
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,560
 But I can't say I necessarily went into it thinking, oh this is going to be a laugh

642
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
 a minute.

643
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,720
 If you listen to the first episode, when I'm talking about how animals talk to each other,

644
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
 I went to war.

645
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,880
 I recorded those first three episodes and I released them.

646
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,440
 And a couple of people at work listened to them.

647
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,240
 And one of the dudes, an old friend of mine, Zach, he goes, you sound like an idiot.

648
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,720
 And he goes, the thing is, it sounds like you.

649
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,160
 It's not because you say stuff like that at work.

650
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,560
 It wasn't a performance.

651
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,160
 I've had conversations with you and you say stuff that dumb.

652
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,560
 That's not how it works.

653
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,240
 That's not how animals talk to each other.

654
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,840
 When they squeak, they're not giving each other locations to their nut stash.

655
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,560
 So I realized even if I wasn't trying to be openly comedic, just from me telling the

656
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,720
 stories, there's going to be some funny stuff.

657
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
 Right.

658
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,560
 Just I know the way that I tell stuff can be funny.

659
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
 I know the way that I mispronounce stuff.

660
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
 That's unintentionally funny.

661
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,960
 I don't mean to do that.

662
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,400
 I never tried to be too serious.

663
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,600
 Early on in the show, you'll hear some tonal shifts.

664
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,920
 Sometimes the episodes are a little too serious.

665
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,080
 Sometimes they're a little too funny, a little too zany.

666
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,600
 You can hear me kind of going back and forth.

667
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,600
 Now you may have the first story in an episode be funny and the second episode be kind of

668
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,120
 darker, like a true crime thing.

669
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,720
 But before it would be like, I was like, I was trying to figure out like what type of

670
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,640
 hot, because I was getting feedback and I was like, well, what do people actually want?

671
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
 Do they want this?

672
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
 Do they want that?

673
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,520
 And I finally realized what show do I want?

674
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
 Right.

675
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,600
 I want to show with a little bit of comedy when it's appropriate and a little bit of

676
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,360
 seriousness when it's appropriate.

677
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,200
 And sometimes the blending of the two is fun.

678
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
 Right.

679
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,280
 So I write my notes now.

680
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,920
 I take notes and I'll write down story beats.

681
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,960
 Write down the story beats of what's happening in the story.

682
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
 This happens.

683
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,600
 I'm trying to work on the and then this.

684
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,160
 I'm trying to work on that.

685
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,760
 I've fallen into that crutch recently where I was like, and then the alien beamed them

686
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
 up to the house.

687
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,920
 Now they're on the roof of the house.

688
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,480
 I'm trying to work trying to fix that, but that's a fairly recent thing.

689
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,920
 I don't know why I've fallen into that trap.

690
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,840
 But one thing I don't do is write down jokes.

691
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,840
 Now I have in the past when I'm researching notes and laughing so hard to come up with

692
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
 a funny joke.

693
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,080
 I was like, I'll do this skit's going to be so funny.

694
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,240
 Not necessarily skit, but I like read on the notes and laugh.

695
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,040
 I'm like, I'll do this is going to be so funny.

696
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,720
 And I would write it in my notes that actually put in parentheses.

697
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,600
 Like, it wouldn't be like tell Joe Kier.

698
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,280
 It'd be like joke about this.

699
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,120
 Make a joke like I would put out the joke.

700
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:25,440
 And whenever I recorded it, it was all it was the worst joke.

701
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,720
 Like when I thought of it, it was hilarious.

702
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,800
 And I bet you anything.

703
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,800
 If when I was recording it, it popped in my head.

704
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,880
 I would have thought it was funny enough to stay in the episode.

705
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,360
 I had it out bad jokes, breathing and us.

706
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,440
 Those are my biggest edit edits, right?

707
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,920
 And then the ending gets really chopped up.

708
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,440
 The ending part, sometimes I can kind of drone on and on.

709
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
 Okay, Jason, we get it.

710
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,520
 Let's chop it down in two minutes, right?

711
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,480
 We went and said, let's chop it down in two minutes.

712
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,800
 So when I write a joke down, it's really bad.

713
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,320
 What happened with this was I was sitting at work and I was reading about Thomas Dick.

714
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,160
 And when I saw the guy's name was Mungo Dick, I laughed out loud and I started thinking of

715
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,280
 all these zany scenarios that Mungo Dick could be in.

716
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:16,520
 And this is one of those episodes that I can hear myself kind of sweating in the episode.

717
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,560
 I can hear the water moisture hitting the mic because this is one of those episodes

718
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,640
 where some of the jokes I actually knew ahead of time going in.

719
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,400
 And I will say something, quote unquote, "I'm funny."

720
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
 Or I'm funny.

721
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,000
 I mean, your mileage may vary, right?

722
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,320
 And I can own, because I have no audience reaction, right?

723
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,840
 I say it and then I can hear myself second guessing that.

724
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,960
 Was that funny or not?

725
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,160
 The joke that I laugh that I still think is the funniest joke, because again, it was just

726
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,800
 right off the top of my head when I was sitting there, when I was listening to the episode

727
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,520
 again to do this bonus thing, was when Mungo has the newspaper.

728
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
 Mungo has the paper.

729
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,480
 Like the paper where it said the paper was like the daily paper or something.

730
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
 And I said, what?

731
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
 That's like calling such and such.

732
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,280
 That joke I had written down, I was like, "Geez, that joke was super dumb."

733
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
 I was like, "What?

734
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
 They call it a daily paper."

735
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,000
 That's like calling something this.

736
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,640
 And I had written that in my notes.

737
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
 I remember it.

738
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,760
 And it just falls with a thud.

739
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,960
 But the joke that I came up with on the spot that actually laughed, and I almost started

740
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,960
 laughing too hard.

741
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
 I kind of tried to hold it back.

742
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,840
 You can hear it in my voice when I said, "Mungo makes this newspaper for, oh, it was like

743
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,360
 religion and sports."

744
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,080
 Like that was a total, like I just came up on the top of my head.

745
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,840
 Religion is good for the soul, but sports makes me feel alive.

746
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,920
 Like that was, and I was like, "See, that was the impromptu joke."

747
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,320
 I didn't have any, none of that stuff written down.

748
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,680
 I don't know why, I think in the notes, I might have said that newspaper is about two

749
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,920
 things, but I think it probably wrote down one of them.

750
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,400
 Whatever the reason was, I thought that joke was really funny.

751
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,560
 But as far as that goes, right?

752
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,000
 I don't, I, I want the, I want the show to be entertaining.

753
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,440
 And I know at this point, a lot of that comes from comedy.

754
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,400
 But again, imagine getting up on stage and being like, "I'm gonna tell, I'm gonna tell

755
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
 jokes.

756
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,200
 They're gonna pop in my head or they won't."

757
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
 Like you can't force them.

758
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,400
 It's just such a weird, this podcast is weird in that sense.

759
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,840
 I think most comedy podcasts have other people on.

760
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
 And some episodes aren't funny.

761
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
 Trust me, don't get me wrong.

762
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
 Some episodes aren't funny.

763
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,920
 They're not supposed to be funny, right?

764
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,040
 Scooby-Doo SVU about the connection between, the odd connection between people in the paranormal

765
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,440
 world and sex pests, child predators, stuff like that.

766
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
 That's not a laugh a minute.

767
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
 It's not a funny episode.

768
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,480
 It would be horrible if it was.

769
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,840
 So really, I thought that was an interesting look at the behind the scenes, the comedy

770
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
 part of it.

771
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,640
 But I also wanted to talk about Mungo because this, when you are creating anything over a

772
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,040
 period of time, I think, I don't know if everyone does this.

773
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:56,280
 I'm probably hyper aware of it because the show's gone on for so long and it's five episodes

774
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,240
 for 10 weeks, a two week break, and then five episodes a week for 10 weeks and that.

775
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
 Flanderization.

776
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
 Flanderization.

777
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:10,000
 It's a term, meaning from Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, is where a character starts

778
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,080
 off as kind of a well-rounded character with maybe one or two quirks.

779
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,640
 And then by season 13, they're just the quirk.

780
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,360
 Ned Flanders is a good name for it, Flanderization.

781
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,200
 I think the best example is the characters from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

782
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,080
 Like early on in season two or three, three or four, somewhere around there, they made

783
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,840
 a joke about Charlie not being able to read.

784
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:40,600
 And then it became to him being not only completely illiterate, like once they were like, "I can't

785
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
 read your handwriting."

786
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,320
 Then it came to not only is he completely illiterate, he's mentally handicapped.

787
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,160
 Like he's drinking paint and he's king of the rats and all this stuff.

788
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:57,280
 And then while funny, right, it becomes a broad character, one before the character had

789
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,680
 a little more nuance.

790
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,480
 Dennis, for example, started off, he was a playboy.

791
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,720
 He was an egotistical playboy.

792
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,840
 And then he started to be like, "No matter what, I'm going to get this girl."

793
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,000
 And then he became a rapist.

794
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,880
 They've made vague references, not so vague references to him being more forceful with

795
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,640
 the women or manipulating them.

796
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,680
 Not just the Dennis system, but actually tricking them.

797
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,400
 He boards up his windows so they can't get out to maybe even being a serial killer.

798
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,480
 Because they started off being like, they have an episode where he's a little slimy

799
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,920
 or the normal and now he's a psychopathic serial killer.

800
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,960
 And Mac, right, the jokes are, "Oh, he's homophobic and now he's gay."

801
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,160
 Like they took it, and I'm not saying that the jokes in between these things weren't

802
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
 funny.

803
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,800
 Now they're just these stereotypes, the psychopath, the flamboyant homosexual, and the illiterate

804
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,640
 fool.

805
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,360
 You lose a lot of nuance there.

806
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,200
 There's a lot of stories they probably could have told that they can't tell now because

807
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,280
 Charlie is mentally handicapped, right?

808
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,360
 You can't, it wouldn't make sense if he went and had this adventure then.

809
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,880
 So when you do something over a long enough time period, that's the risk, right?

810
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,440
 You start off with a character, they're a little unsure of themselves.

811
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,000
 In season three, four, five, they're a bumbling coward.

812
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,120
 Because the fans go, "Oh, that episode was so funny when Wesley dropped the spike or

813
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,040
 whatever he was trying to give to Buffy."

814
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,280
 And then they go, "Oh, they like this kind of thing?"

815
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
 You see it a lot too.

816
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,360
 I know I'm going deep in this, but you see it a lot with characters, right?

817
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,480
 There's a moment between Spike and Buffy and the fans go, "Ooh, or Spike and Buffy going

818
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
 to get together."

819
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
 And the writers go, "Yeah, sure."

820
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,480
 It's season six.

821
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,520
 We've run out of stuff to talk about.

822
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,400
 They're dating.

823
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,040
 So you've got to be careful of that type of stuff.

824
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:53,840
 And this episode, the entire Dead Rabbit Radio came close to becoming flanderized because

825
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,880
 people loved Mungo.

826
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,640
 I loved Mungo.

827
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,120
 He's a funny voice to do.

828
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,480
 He's a funny character.

829
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:08,360
 And I realized that I can't bring him back.

830
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,640
 I can't bring him back.

831
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,280
 He's popped up in other episodes as a son, as Mungo Jr.

832
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,240
 And his voice, it's not the most clever impersonation, but his voice, his mannerisms have become

833
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,240
 Bigfoot, right?

834
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,080
 When I talk about Bigfoot, he sounds a lot like Mungo Dick the way he talks about his

835
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,080
 Mungo Dick.

836
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,560
 But I remember like, I was getting comments being like, "Dude, I hope I see more of Mungo.

837
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,600
 This is really awesome.

838
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,400
 This episode is so funny."

839
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,400
 And this is kind of coming, I don't know how many episodes past the Hans episode, the

840
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,160
 Monkeys Don't Exist episode, so that character was super popular too.

841
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,200
 There were times, Hans showed back up for an episode and I think it ruined the episode,

842
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
 honestly.

843
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,320
 Hans showed up in the Bam Marguerite Afterlife episode.

844
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:56,080
 See, when you have an episode that's just listing crazy things, people say, "I haven't

845
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,280
 edited the Jean Benet Doesn't Exist episode yet."

846
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,200
 But I'm kind of afraid that that episode's kind of dry because it's just me saying, "She

847
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,120
 believes this and she believes that and she believes this and she believes that."

848
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,880
 And so Hans was a crutch.

849
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,680
 I had that Bam Marguerite Afterlife episode and it was just a super bizarre conspiracy

850
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,600
 theory so I brought on this crazy character Hans and he's being wacky and I'm like, "Hans,

851
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
 how dumb are you?"

852
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,600
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm pretty dumb.

853
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,280
 Yuck, yuck."

854
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,080
 And people liked it.

855
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,200
 People liked it and I remember I usually don't navigate the show or make decisions based

856
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
 on one comment.

857
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,540
 I almost never do.

858
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,960
 But I did get one comment on the Bam Marguerite episode.

859
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
 This was on YouTube.

860
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,320
 This is when I used to take episodes and cut them in half.

861
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,400
 Took an extremely long amount of time.

862
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,720
 That's why I don't do it anymore.

863
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,200
 People say, "Why don't you put those little..."

864
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,200
 Because it takes me too long.

865
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,160
 But he goes, "Who in the world is Franz?"

866
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
 What are you talking about?

867
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,320
 Are you talking about Bam's good friends, Franz Helmut Head or whatever?

868
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,120
 Like he mentioned some other guy with that name.

869
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,760
 He goes, "This was nonsensical.

870
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760
 This made no sense."

871
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,320
 And I thought, "Yeah, this is the problem.

872
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,160
 I have to make the show.

873
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,320
 I like to make the show for people who this is their first episode, as the same time as

874
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,720
 this is someone's 928th episode.

875
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,920
 And when you have reoccurring characters, when you have in-jokes, it makes it so hard

876
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,120
 to get into.

877
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,640
 And when a character has such an odd speech pattern as Han's warm hat or a mongo dick.

878
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,440
 Now here's the thing.

879
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,120
 I 100% saw two paths laid out in front of me.

880
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,360
 I saw a path where mongo shows up every show often to do something funny.

881
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,720
 I'm like doing an episode about are there angels in space and mongo's like, "Angels

882
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
 in space."

883
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
 That was another thing.

884
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,400
 I can never do the same voice.

885
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,840
 I can never do the characters the same voice each time.

886
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,600
 But mongo say angels in space.

887
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,000
 That's science and religion.

888
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,200
 Mongo, what are you doing in the studio?

889
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,880
 I heard you say angels and then the science word.

890
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,440
 Mongo, why don't you sit down and talk to us about what you think about religion.

891
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,200
 I would have ended the show.

892
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,560
 I would have been like, this is awful.

893
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,440
 This is awful, but part of me saw that path.

894
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,360
 Because it's been done before, right?

895
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,880
 It's been done before.

896
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,200
 Shows flanderize themselves all the time.

897
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,160
 You have a popular episode and then you just go with it.

898
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,360
 Now I've had episodes where I've talked about Illuminati and Kevin Spacey and stuff like

899
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,600
 that and they've been some of my highest performing content on YouTube.

900
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,080
 Before the YouTube shorts, now that's blowing all the episodes on YouTube away.

901
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,120
 YouTube's not really set up for long form, no image.

902
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,800
 It's video platform, right?

903
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
 I'm talking about stuff.

904
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,680
 The podcast has always been more successful than the YouTube, right?

905
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,680
 But as far as YouTube goes, I've always thought about when I do these Illuminati episodes about

906
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,120
 Kevin Spacey, I've talked about this before, all these big episodes.

907
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,160
 They're always huge blowout episodes.

908
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,880
 Ellen DeGeneres is under house arrest.

909
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,800
 Tom Hanks is secretly working for the Illuminati.

910
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
 Huge numbers.

911
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,120
 And then people go, what?

912
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,360
 This sucked because they expected me to be taking it seriously.

913
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,760
 People for the first time were finding the show and it wasn't what they thought.

914
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,300
 Now, long time listeners of the show loved it, right?

915
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,080
 But every time that happened, I thought, okay, so this is interesting.

916
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,120
 There's this listenership that I have, that I love, and a show that I love doing.

917
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,480
 And then I could just do a shill show.

918
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,520
 I could do a show believing in all these stuff that I know other people are going to believe

919
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,520
 in.

920
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,360
 I'm going to make tons of money, right?

921
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,880
 The show's going to blow up.

922
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,440
 There's a YouTuber I watch named Andy Signor.

923
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,560
 He used to be on movie junkies or movie fights.

924
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,760
 He was movie fights, movie fights.

925
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,440
 Screen Junkies was the name of the channel.

926
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,360
 He was one of the very first casualties of me too.

927
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,200
 And he came out afterwards after all these lawsuits and said, listen, she made everything

928
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,000
 up and here's the proof and da, da, da, da.

929
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,080
 So if you don't like Andy Signor, I understand why you don't like Andy Signor.

930
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,360
 But he seems to have had some receipts that a lot of the allegations against him.

931
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,520
 He said, I did cheat on my wife and all this stuff.

932
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,560
 So Andy Signor has his own show now called Popcorn Planet.

933
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,560
 And when he first started up, I was watching it a lot.

934
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,560
 He's doing movie stuff.

935
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,560
 He's doing movie stuff.

936
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,840
 And I was like, okay, but he didn't have the same views as he used to.

937
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,360
 His reputation was tarnished.

938
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,520
 He was coming back out of a hole.

939
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,080
 And then he started like covering stuff about Britney Spears conservatorship or the Amber

940
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,520
 Herd or the Zash.

941
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,880
 He went hard on the Zack Snyder guys during the Snyder Cut.

942
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,160
 His channel exploded.

943
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,800
 So then he just started doing Britney Spears stuff and Amber Herd stuff and beefing with

944
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,600
 Ray Fisher from the DC movies.

945
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,600
 He's Cyborg.

946
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,960
 And as a longtime fan, that wasn't the content I was interested in, but he knew people.

947
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,120
 He was making more money.

948
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,840
 He had a whole new fan base and he had all these new people.

949
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,920
 So I just kind of like, you know, kind of waved as the boat was sailing off East to

950
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,920
 take him out there.

951
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,680
 I mean, hey, I wish you the best of luck.

952
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,880
 That wasn't the content that I was interested in.

953
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,520
 Why did he even start talking about that?

954
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,000
 Oh, he flandered rights to the show.

955
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 Right.

956
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 He did a couple episodes.

957
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,040
 And to me, it became a gossip channel, not a movie channel.

958
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,680
 The gossip involved movie stars, but I'm really not into whether any of that stuff.

959
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,440
 So I remember thinking like I could do the Kevin Spacey shows until the show ends, which

960
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,480
 actually turned out to be pretty quickly.

961
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,960
 I think YouTube was cracking down on those guys.

962
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:31,200
 You know, this was all, you know, pre like 2019, 2020, before they really started coming

963
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,280
 down on conspiracy content.

964
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,160
 But I remember thinking I could do that.

965
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,160
 I didn't want to do that.

966
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,160
 I didn't want to make a show where I was lying to people.

967
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,480
 And then I wanted to sign a rabbit up like this.

968
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:49,240
 I remember thinking, I remember at one point I had Mungo, Hans Wormhat and Miley Cyrus.

969
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,920
 I wish I knew what episode this was.

970
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,160
 There's a very first time I did this.

971
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,960
 I released a season X trailer.

972
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,400
 It was like season five or six or something like that, where all of the Dead Rabbit radio

973
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,320
 vehicles were destroyed, all of them.

974
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,640
 And there was this evil group that had come after.

975
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,760
 I thought it was a kind of fun idea.

976
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,480
 I came over there while I was in the shower.

977
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,480
 I literally walked out.

978
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,600
 I was still dripping wet.

979
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,320
 I recorded all these dumb voices, edited together, had a lot of fun with it.

980
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,920
 Miley Cyrus, longtime personal friend.

981
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,840
 Long time, people get so mad when I bring that up.

982
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,120
 Long time personal friend, Miley Cyrus.

983
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,840
 See, that's an in joke, right?

984
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:31,000
 You wouldn't know that if you hadn't listened to the episode where I talked about my personal

985
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 mysic.

986
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,400
 I make it even more intimate each time.

987
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,720
 My personal friendship with Miley Cyrus.

988
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,800
 I'd give no other details to that.

989
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
 We talked for a while.

990
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,680
 Miley Cyrus, Hans Wormhat and Mungo showed up.

991
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,400
 We formed a team to take down the bad guys who blew up all the vehicles.

992
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,960
 I thought it was a great way to start off whatever season that was.

993
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,880
 I kind of toyed with the idea of doing it again next season and I was like, nope, nope, no

994
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,880
 extra work.

995
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,040
 The show's already hard enough.

996
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,040
 That was a fun thing.

997
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,840
 It was, again, it was impulsive and you did it and it was fun.

998
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,760
 When I sit and I plan stuff out and I'm trying to like do all these jokes, they don't land.

999
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,520
 I'm not a comedian in that sense.

1000
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,320
 I remember thinking at one point, we did the trailer.

1001
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,560
 People really liked that.

1002
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,360
 I think Mungo's come back as his son or my son Mungo Jr.

1003
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,360
 People think that's funny.

1004
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,040
 But I remember at one point I was planning on doing an episode about the people versus

1005
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,480
 Michael Jackson because I personally believe that Michael Jackson was innocent of those

1006
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,640
 allegations.

1007
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,840
 This was when that documentary came out, like Surviving Neverland or Finding Neverland

1008
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,080
 or whatever it was.

1009
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:41,800
 It was trash journalism, it was trash true crime, garbage.

1010
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,080
 And I was thinking about doing a rebuttal for that and Han's warm hat was going to be

1011
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,240
 his defense lawyer and I was like putting up notes and I go, this is awful.

1012
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,640
 No one wants to hear me do this voice for 30 minutes straight, especially about a subject

1013
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,080
 that they may not even care about.

1014
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:02,200
 Who really cares whether or not Michael Jackson's guilty, either just fans or smear journalists,

1015
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,800
 in my opinion.

1016
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,960
 And then, so I scratched that idea but I was planning it.

1017
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,640
 I actually have a special folder of Michael Jackson research.

1018
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,640
 I do.

1019
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,960
 He's like, no, we're not going to do that.

1020
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,000
 And I didn't feel confident enough in me just telling the story and whatever.

1021
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,840
 And then I was going to do an episode, I don't remember what the setup was, but it was Mungo

1022
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,340
 in the morning.

1023
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:31,120
 It was a radio talk show skit that was going to be reoccurring with Mungo and Han's.

1024
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,560
 And it was like, this is trash.

1025
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,480
 Why are you even trying to do this?

1026
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,480
 Mungo was funny the first time you did him.

1027
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,400
 He's shown up a couple times and it's, even if you don't know the Mungo joke, you just

1028
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,200
 figure Jason is someone who would name his son Mungo Jr. even though you're not Mungo

1029
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,200
 Sr.

1030
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,600
 Even if you didn't know the Mungo setup, it's a funny joke.

1031
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,800
 So I wanted to, as cars are all of a sudden starting up all around me, I have to end this

1032
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
 and this has been really long.

1033
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,560
 I wanted to show you guys the history of, I never mind, I'm going to wait till this truck

1034
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,280
 goes away.

1035
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,320
 I wanted to show you guys the behind the scenes, just a simple episode, right?

1036
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,800
 But I almost, I could have ruined the show.

1037
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,240
 I could have ruined the show by bringing on these reoccurring guests, which I think would

1038
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,760
 become funny or would get super old quickly, right?

1039
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,960
 It's like, what?

1040
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,460
 Some kids got molested.

1041
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,460
 Here comes Mungo.

1042
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,480
 Oh, who's the bad guy who touched that kid?

1043
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,160
 Like sometimes it would be super out of place, right?

1044
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,840
 I think it would have gotten old really fast.

1045
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,920
 I think new listeners would have been like, why is he doing these, why is he doing these

1046
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
 voices?

1047
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,760
 Like what does this have anything to do with the topic?

1048
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,120
 And it's just, it's that wire, you know?

1049
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,600
 It's that wire you have to balance.

1050
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:49,160
 When you're doing something creative, there is a balance between listening to the listeners

1051
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
 and doing your own thing.

1052
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,120
 And I think we've all have a hundred examples of shows that have been ruined because of relationships

1053
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,400
 that you're like, what, why are those two characters together?

1054
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,080
 Kylo Ren and whoever that girl was, Skywalker daughter, are together now?

1055
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,680
 I don't watch, I don't watch any of those movies, but I know people are like, they're

1056
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:11,080
 so shoehorned in, but the fans, quote unquote, the fans wanted it, right?

1057
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,480
 This vocal minority wanted it and people are like, this is dumb.

1058
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,480
 We've all seen that.

1059
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,840
 It's really easy to mess up your own project and I'm glad so far I haven't been able to

1060
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,840
 do that, right?

1061
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,840
 I've tried.

1062
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,840
 I've tried.

1063
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,760
 I almost had Mungo in the morning.

1064
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,480
 I was radio DJ DJ thing.

1065
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,080
 I thought it was so funny.

1066
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,640
 I was like, I've recorded fake ads.

1067
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:37,440
 I remember once I had like a week of fake ads for Sprite or Burger King.

1068
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,720
 The burger ads might have ended up on the show, but I remember I have a file of fake

1069
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:47,280
 funny ads that recorded and then I thought, dude, nobody likes listening to real ads,

1070
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,480
 let alone ads for things that don't exist.

1071
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,160
 Why are you wasting their time?

1072
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,000
 So that's a bit of behind the scenes of the comedy part of the podcast.

1073
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,240
 I hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope you guys enjoyed the decisions I've made, right?

1074
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,400
 We still got another thousand episodes or so in front of us, right?

1075
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,120
 We're coming to the first thousand.

1076
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:09,400
 Who knows where this show will grow till then, but until tomorrow we got two more episodes

1077
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,720
 of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics.

1078
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,760
 I don't know what they are yet, but I do know what one of them is.

1079
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,120
 One of them is the KGB vs. Aliens episode.

1080
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,440
 And again, in other, that episode's really weird.

1081
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,920
 I just listened to that the other day and I thought you would have recorded a completely

1082
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,320
 different episode today.

1083
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,440
 So let's go ahead and take a look at that one tomorrow and I will see you guys then.

1084
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,680
 Travelers, insurance smart takes.

1085
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,560
 A storm puts a hole in my roof.

1086
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,160
 I could stay with my physical trainer buddy, Keith.

1087
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,320
 He calls himself Coach.

1088
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,400
 Luckily, loss of use coverage can help pay for me to stay at a hotel while my home is repaired.

1089
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,960
 No 5 a.m. trampoline kettlebell swings for me.

1090
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,800
 Coach.

1091
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,720
 Travelers, it's better under the umbrella.

1092
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,880
 Policy subject to availability and eligibility.

1093
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,200
 Coverage depends on facts of a loss and policy terms.

1094
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,000
 The traveler's indemnity company and its property casualty affiliates.

1095
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,580
