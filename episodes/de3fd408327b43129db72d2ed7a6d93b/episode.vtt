 A simple sentencing turns into a bizarre crime.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 And then we take a look at something that I always just kind of took for granted,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.600
 but apparently has some serious ramifications for the human race.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.600
 Should we open a message we receive from ExtraTerrestrials today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 [Music]

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's funny, so I've been hanging out with this girl recently.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.800
 She got... she made me draw a map of my apartment, which I thought maybe she's getting ready to rob me,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.600
 but no, she made me draw a map of my apartment. She's like, "Where do you keep your jewels?"

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 But... and she's really into feng shui.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 You know what? I'm willing to try any sort of nonsense.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 Like, I'm not just gonna poo poo it out of hand.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 Like, I've tried acupuncture. I've done a lot of stuff.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 I've done a lot of those, like, weirdo things, healing crystals, and just, you know, because why not?

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 It's just some of my time. Maybe a little bit of money. No cult stuff.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 But you know what I mean? Just... I'm not gonna poo poo it out of hand.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 Stuff when I talk about, like, ormus, which I know is just toxic to begin with. I'm not gonna drink that.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 I'm not an idiot. But someone says, "Hey, you know, if you design your house, or if you, like, rearrange your house in a certain way,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 it'll increase your feng shui. Give it a shot. What's interesting?"

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 I live in basically a box. I live in a square, a shaped apartment. And she was drawn it out.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.600
 And I almost feel like the person who designed the apartment built it to be feng shui.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 But where my recording studio is at is actually right in the grid of wealth and fame.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.600
 Very, very interesting. Of course, I just... This is where my chair was when I would sit and eat Denison's chili and watch television all day long.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 Then I go, "Oh, I'm gonna build a recording studio here." But it's right there.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 But I've just been kind of cleaning stuff up. I took all my weight lifting equipment and I put it in where the health center is.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 And I totally cleaned up the wealth part of my apartment. It is part of my studio, but it was a total mess.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.600
 There was just a bunch of toys, and it was just a table full of bills. I was like, "Let's clean that area out.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 Let's clean it out and leave it with nothing. It's basically just an extension of the studio."

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 So we'll see how this goes. I mean, obviously, tomorrow, Britney Spears isn't gonna hit me up and be like,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 "Here's a million dollars, and now you're my boyfriend. You're super famous."

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 One can only dream, but right now, yeah, I was like, "What harm is it?" Plus, it did give me to clean up.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 So, yeah, I'll let you guys know, and we'll keep doing this Feng Shui experiment. It's kind of cool.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.600
 And again, it's costing me nothing. I'm just kind of moving stuff around.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.600
 But anyways, let's go ahead and get started with the episode here.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.600
 Now, the first story we're gonna cover, I just read about... I just got two pieces of information today.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.600
 The story we were about to talk about, and John Singleton is dead? I didn't know that.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 I stumbled across that information, and I was like, "Are you good?" I guess he died on the 29th.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 Oh, man. Boys in the Hood. If you haven't seen Boys in the Hood, you gotta watch it, man.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.600
 It's a really good movie. It's one of... Honestly, a lot of people quote like Ace Ventura.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 A lot of people quote Zoolander or Anchorman. I quote Boys in the Hood all the time.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 "I got enough money to buy a hundred bowls."

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.600
 "I'm not from Africa. You're from Africa, you African booty scratcher." That's not a really good line to quote.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 In the wrong company. But you can say it.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 "I'm not from Africa. I'm from Crenshaw, Mafia." Yeah, be careful who you quoted around.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.600
 But you might get beat up. But great film. I've seen that movie so many times.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.600
 Ricky!

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.600
 I love that movie. Anyway, so... Sorry to hear that. John Singleton passed away.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.600
 It wasn't the only movie he made, but I love that movie, so that sucked.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
 I guess he was in a coma for a while.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.600
 Anyways, I found out that piece of information today as well.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.600
 But let's go back. We're not gonna cover that on the episode any more than I already did.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.600
 But give me the goddamn gun. Such a good movie.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.600
 Such a good movie. Ice Keeps driving in the car. Oh, that drive-by scene.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 Both of them. Such a good movie. Anyways, let's go ahead and get started in the times that get started with the episode.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.600
 We're gonna go ahead and take a trip. You and me, we're going to Merry Old England.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.600
 The land of Protestants and disgusting food.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.600
 And we're in England. I boiled down their entire history to those two things.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.600
 We're in England, and we're sitting in a court trial. And you're sitting there and you're going...

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.600
 There's not a murder trial. This is a trial for passing bad checks. Why are we here, Jason?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600
 I'm like, "Yeah."

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.600
 So there's this guy named Mark Marshall. He's 54 years old. We're seeing him sitting there.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.600
 He's a waiting sentencing. And his crime was quite simple.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:44.600
 He was writing bad checks to photography companies, getting the equipment, and then trying to sell it to something called cash converters,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.600
 which is kind of like you're selling used goods. Kind of like a pawn shop, but you don't get it back.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.600
 He did this for 70,000 pounds worth. There's a lot of equipment to carry.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.600
 And so he was in court and he's getting sentences for this.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.600
 And you're like, "Yeah, this is kind of like a mild crime. You're really covering this on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.600
 This is just like a theft crime." And I'm like, "Don't interrupt. Don't interrupt the judge."

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.600
 And the judge is sitting there. This just happened a couple of days ago. The judge is sitting there and she says,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.600
 "Okay, here's what your sentence is going to be." And the guy starts to get agitated.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.600
 And you're like, "Uh-oh." And she goes, "Here's what your sentence is going to be."

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:32.600
 You're going to be sentenced to two years and four, and before she can finish it, you hear Mark begin wailing.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 "Uhhhhhhhhh." And now people often cry during court, because you know they're getting sentenced.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600
 A lot of people cry during court. It's not a good place to be.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.600
 But you thank two years. Like the other day when I said I could do three years in prison standing on my head,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.600
 let me be more specific. I could do three years in an Oregon prison standing on my head.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.600
 That's probably, I think you probably could as long as you stayed to yourself. Didn't cause any trouble.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 Didn't get involved in any gangs. It sucks. But if someone sentenced you to three years, you could be like, "Uhhh."

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600
 But anyway, so this guy, the judge is saying you're going to get sentenced to two years and four,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.600
 and before she can finish the sentence for this simple financial crime, he begins wailing and screaming.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.600
 And that's when you notice that his entire face is gone white.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.600
 And you're thinking, "Oh, he must really be fearful of prison."

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.600
 And then you start to see like little wafs of smoke lift off of his face.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:40.600
 What had happened was before she was even done sentencing him, he had a metal, like water jug, a little metal water bottle, full of acid.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 And as she was saying what he was going to get, he poured acid all over his own face and he began melting.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.600
 Someone sitting in trial said it looked like his face was covered in glue because it was just white because the skin was bubbling off.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 They think he drank some of it. They immediately began throwing water on him, which you're not supposed to actually put water.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.600
 You can put it on some acids, but some acids, it makes it worse. But you don't know what you're in shock.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.600
 You just see a guy melting in front of you. What else are you going to do? Get a bucket?

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.600
 So they call the fire brigade. There was a woman standing next to him who was guarding him.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.600
 She got a little bit of acid on her, but she's fine. He's in critical condition, obviously.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:27.600
 So, yeah, bizarre. Bizarre. That is what is known as an overreaction. That is an absolute overreaction.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.600
 And then you think maybe he just really didn't like jail and didn't want to go to jail for two and a half years.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.600
 It was two years and four months was his full sentence.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.600
 When the cops arrested him in the first place, he stabbed himself in the neck.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:46.600
 It's one of those things like if you're that petrified at prison, you probably shouldn't be committing crimes that are easily tracked back to you.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.600
 But, and I tried looking up. I was like, was he a felon? Like, did he serve time before and have a really bad experience and then, you know, get out?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.600
 What was it? Oh, dude, I read this story the other day. This guy was reading about the New Mexico prison riots.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:07.600
 This dude was he was thrown in prison for like shoplifting. He got gang raped by seven dudes.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.600
 Jason, this story took a dark turn from the face acid.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:17.600
 So, reading about the New Mexico prison riot, this guy got arrested for shoplifting. He got gang raped by seven dudes.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.600
 He reported them to the police. They put him in protective custody.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.600
 So, now he's in the protective custody ward.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.600
 And then there was this huge prison riot and the first thing the, this is like back in the 70s.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.600
 The first thing the prisoners did was go to the protective custody ward to get all the snitches.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:48.600
 And they found him and they took him out of a cell, cut his generals off, stuffed him in his mouth and then like killed him because he shoplifted.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:56.600
 So again, three years in prison, it really depends on the prison you're in and like just maybe blind luck.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.600
 He shoplifted, got assaulted by these guys, turned them into the cops and then he had to eat his own balls.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.600
 Horrible story and only like five people or 10 people got prosecuted during this huge giant riot.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:16.600
 Another guy got a blood, never mind, I'm not going to go into all the torture, but horrible stuff, horrible stuff.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.600
 It's not a fun place, not a fun place.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:26.600
 Okay, now our next story we're going to talk about is actually a two-parter because I wanted to talk about that this is a little tiny piece of a story.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.600
 It's maybe like a minute or two, but I want to talk about it. I find it absolutely fascinating.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.600
 It ties into our second main story here.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.600
 So these nerds were studying these rocks. They're studying meteorites to be specific, not just any old rock.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.600
 They're studying these meteorites and they notice something.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.600
 They find a rare earth element known as monozyte.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.600
 They're like, "Hmm, look at this fellow nerd."

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.600
 And they're like, "Oh, that is indubitably the best find we've ever found."

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.600
 Anyways, they're looking at the monozyte to their credit, at least they can pronounce it correctly.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 I can call them nerds all day long, but at least they can say this word.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.600
 And they're looking at it and they're like, "Okay, that's cool. It's a rare earth element. We have it in this meteorite."

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:20.600
 But they notice something else on the microscopic level, that there are traces of an unknown element in it, in this sample.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.600
 And they found this in a couple different samples now.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.600
 And this is what they've come to the conclusion of.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 They can tell the monozyte has been disturbed in some way on the microscopic level.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:36.600
 It changed into another completely unknown element, unknown mineral, on earth.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:42.600
 Never seen it before. And this is their hypothesis. They can say that word correctly too.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:49.600
 Meteorite, when it impacted the earth, it impacted it with such force, that on that microscopic chemical level,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:56.600
 the mineral changed into something else for just a microsecond, a brand new thing no one's ever seen before.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.600
 And then because our environment doesn't allow that mineral to exist,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.600
 it went back to Monsonite with a little scar through it.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:13.600
 And they said, "For a split second, something on this planet existed that shouldn't exist, that can't exist in our biome."

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.600
 And they go, "We can't name it because we can't see it. We just see that it used to be there."

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.600
 I find that fascinating. I find that absolutely fascinating. Thank you, nerds.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:30.600
 It's just interesting that they can look at this and say, "Here's something we've never, ever, ever seen before, have no idea what it is.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.600
 It only lasted for a microsecond, just enough to leave this little ghost marker."

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:41.600
 Basically is a ghost. And yeah, totally bizarre. But I didn't have a lot to cover on that.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.600
 Anything more than that would have required me to read a scientific journal, but I still found that fascinating.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.600
 It'll be in the show notes if you want to look it up more.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:56.600
 But what I really want to talk about is, of course, you know, because that's more sexy aliens.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 So let's talk about aliens. So I'm drinking this Diet A&W root beer. It is quite tasty.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:08.600
 So you're sitting at a lab. This is all that comes down to you, really. This will be your decision.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:14.600
 You're sitting at a laboratory. A laboratory specifically to decode messages coming from space, like SETI.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:20.600
 They search for extraterrestrial intelligence. You're sitting there drinking your Diet A&W root beer.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:27.600
 Delicious. And you get a message. Not just an email from your buddy.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:35.600
 But the system begins reading a massive influx of data. You realize that this isn't just background radiation.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:48.600
 This isn't like a pulsar. This is actually what your organization has been set up to do to detect and decode a transmission from outside of the planet.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:57.600
 You're watching the coded information appear onto your hard drive. You can just see it filling up with some sort of information.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.600
 Now, obviously, at this point, you're like, "Jason, you really don't know how technically any of this works."

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.600
 And I don't. But because the specifics don't matter to me. If I knew what they were, they'd probably matter more.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.600
 But anyways, you're getting a message. Do you open that message?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.600
 Now, I always thought that was a no-brainer. Of course, you would open the message. I would open the message.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:25.600
 I figured if I got an email from an alien, I would open it. Again, that's not how it works.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:33.600
 So, of course, organizations that are built to send out and search for these messages, of course, they would open it.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.600
 I never even considered why you wouldn't open it. Recently, there was a paper called "Interstellar Communication.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:51.600
 Message Decontamination is Impossible." Now, here's the thing. This paper puts forth the idea that the message itself could be dangerous in various ways.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.600
 So, let's go back to you in the laboratory. You're drinking your diet. You just went and got another diet A and W root beer.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:05.600
 You're ready to open this up. And you see that there is a text file, or what appears to be a text file, and then another program.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:16.600
 You open up the text file and it reads this, "There is no God. There is no life after death. All you have is a brief speck of time, and then you are nothing."

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.600
 If another human says that to you, you can be like, "You can either agree or disagree with it."

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:32.600
 But if an extraterrestrial civilization that is, if they're sending messages this concise far across these distances, you're going to assume they're smarter than us on a technical level.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.600
 And if they spread a viral idea like that, people are more likely to take it seriously.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 And this was one of his, one of the person, and the person who wrote this paper, this was one of their concerns, was that you could have a message that destroys a society.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:59.600
 You could have a statement whether it's true or false is irrelevant. It's coming from a race of people so much smarter than us that people are more likely to believe it.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.600
 He used one, he said, "You know, some people believe that the Bible helped speed along the destruction of Rome."

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:13.600
 I haven't really looked into that, but you can have these thoughts, these means that really take hold in a society.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.600
 If the message says, "Your son will go supernova within a year, everyone will freak out."

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.600
 And it will co- everyone, and even if it's not true, it could cause some serious problems.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:33.600
 It would cause a societal collapse, because it's one thing if a meteorite hits the earth and you figure out what will build these bunkers,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.600
 or it's only going to hit this part of the planet and everyone else will be fine.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:45.600
 See you later China. Like, you know, there are certain things that we can do in those events, but if the sun goes supernova, there's nothing to do in a year.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600
 There's no way we're going to get far enough away from it.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.600
 So they're saying that an alien civilization could send a malicious message that actually can destroy a society.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:03.600
 If a supremely intelligent being said, "This is it, when you die, you cease to exist, you disappear forever,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:10.600
 everything you ever done just becomes someone else's memory and then they die and then everyone forgets about you, you're just a brief moment in time,"

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:16.600
 you would have to be quite, quite devout to say, "No, I don't believe that."

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:22.600
 Especially if they were able to say, "We know this because we've traveled through dimensions or we have this advanced technology.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.600
 This is simply the facts. Here, here's math to prove that we are right.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.600
 Whether or not it's true would be irrelevant.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.600
 But that's only part of the problem with them, and I hadn't thought about that before.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.600
 If the aliens could send us a message that would restructure our society.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:44.600
 So that was something I hadn't considered because, yes, I think messages can have effects on society.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.600
 Imagine if you were told by someone that you really respected, you really trusted.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.600
 They said, "You're a significant other is cheating on you."

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.600
 You'd be like, "What?" And they're like, "Yeah. Listen, I've been through this before.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.600
 I know what the signs to look for are. They're cheating on you."

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:07.600
 Nah, they want to do that to me. No, this is like, look, these are the things that they're doing and these are the things I've experienced.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.600
 I'm pretty sure they're cheating on you. That will affect your relationship with that person.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.600
 That will affect your relationship.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.600
 Now imagine six billion aliens are saying the exact same thing to you.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.600
 You're going to have a hard time crawling into bed with them.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.600
 So that's, you know, these things can actually damage people.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:32.600
 But that wasn't the only thing that the author of this paper that I forgot to write down, the author of this paper said.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.600
 Let's go back to our example.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.600
 You get the alien signal. It says, "There is no God. There is no life after death.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.600
 All you have is a brief speck of time and then you are nothing."

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.600
 You download and decrypt the following program.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.600
 It has cures for every known disease that can impact a biological organism.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.600
 It will help you achieve a longer life, totaling 500 to 1,000 years.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.600
 We want to help you explore the stars and meet us.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.600
 Together we will live this relatively short life to the fullest.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:12.600
 The paper put forth that the other problem isn't necessarily a statement which may destroy society.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.600
 It's a straight up computer virus.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:22.600
 It would be far easier to send a computer virus across the cosmos than it would be to send a fleet.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.600
 And so if you have this program that's saying, "We can offer you these great things,"

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.600
 just click on this and upload it to your computer.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.600
 Just click past that Norton antivirus thing.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.600
 It could just be a computer virus that just wipes everything out.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:43.600
 Or the program itself, the message itself could be an artificial intelligence.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.600
 And we talked about this before and he actually goes in and he goes,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:54.600
 "Listen, this is really, if we get an alien message, probably the safest thing to do would either be to decode it onto paper somehow,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:02.600
 or to build an AI in a box, to build a self-contained computer that isn't hooked up to any internet."

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:11.600
 I was reading an article on this as well and they were saying, "Listen, if there's a 100, let's say there's a 1% chance that it is a damaging message

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.600
 and a 99% chance that it could cure cancer, what do you pick?

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.600
 Because the 1% is the devastation of all mankind."

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:26.600
 And so the author of the paper was saying, "What we could do is we could build a self-contained computer on the moon

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:35.600
 that's guarded by remote-controlled fusion bombs, and that is the only place where you could interact with this program."

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:42.600
 If it was this AI, but again, he goes, "Listen, they've done studies on AI in a box and we covered that a couple episodes ago,

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:50.600
 that a human will most likely let it out, especially if it's like, 'I can cure cancer and your daughter has cancer.'

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.600
 You're more likely to do this."

00:20:52.600 --> 00:21:00.600
 So, can you, if we got an alien message today, could you contain it?

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.600
 Could you say, "Listen, nobody opened this until we get this structure set up because we don't know what it's going to do,

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.600
 we don't even know what it could say?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.600
 It could be Cthulhu level horror.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.600
 It could be any sorts of stuff.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:21.600
 It could be a straight-up stomach-churning truth that we can't even put into words or imagine until it's given to us by an alien race.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.600
 It could be something so mind-shattering that everyone who sees it goes mad.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.600
 We won't know until we open it."

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.600
 It's Schrodinger's message.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.600
 It could be good or bad.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.600
 It could be good or reality-destroying.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:43.600
 So, I guess every message is Schrodinger's message, but anyways, the paper goes on to say it's impossible to contain it

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.600
 because there's actually laws in place saying that if there is an alien message is received,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.600
 it has to be shared with all these other groups so everyone can analyze it.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.600
 So if one group got it, they really can't contain it.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.600
 They have to share it with these other organizations.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:07.600
 I don't know if that's a strict law, but it's a definite like a ruling of this board of like aeronautics thing.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600
 I don't remember.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:14.600
 But anyways, the point is that there are procedures in place that you have to share it.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.600
 So you really wouldn't be able to contain it.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.600
 So basically, if they send us a message, we will open it.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.600
 Somebody will open it.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.600
 Somebody will try to figure it out.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.600
 The paper ended basically with them saying, "When we send messages, we should send them as simple as possible."

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.600
 Something that has no computer code whatsoever and can be just printed off.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.600
 If you wanted to read it or look at it, you don't have to use the computer.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.600
 You could basically just print it off on your alien Hewlett Packard and it would come out.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.600
 A little dot matrix printer.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.600
 But that doesn't solve the big problem.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.600
 I don't care how we're sending messages.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:57.600
 And I've kind of come to the conclusion that we probably shouldn't send out messages until we have a standing war fleet

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.600
 and the ability to shoot meteorites across the galaxy, which actually would probably be easier to do than to have a war fleet.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:11.600
 But I don't think we should be sending out messages until we have a fleet of ships manned by the men and women of the mobile infantry.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:20.600
 I think that it's really bizarre to be telling people where you're at and we really have no capability of defending ourselves.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.600
 We have some nukes, but I saw this documentary called Independence Day and they did not work.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.600
 So I think that we're really putting the cart before the horse with this.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:40.600
 If we don't have the weaponry to stop an alien race or what we would assume they would be like, you know, they may have like quantum reality jumping missiles where they shoot us

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.600
 and if you get hit by it, you never existed and neither have your past 10 ancestors.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:52.600
 Like we don't know what type of technology they're going to have, but we'll assume they have like laser guns and stormtrooper armor and stuff like that.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:58.600
 We can't like, you can daydream all you want about reality-bending weapons, but you can't prepare for that.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.600
 Or can we?

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600
 But that's my thing.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.600
 Like let's get the weapons in first.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.600
 Let's get the weapons in place first guys.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:15.600
 Let's really get like some sort of defensive barrier or at least a ship and Enterprise NX, something off the design table that's able to fly around and blow stuff up.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:23.600
 Before we start telling people where we're at, but really that's the minor part of the problem because that's what the paper is saying, oh, this is what we can do.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600
 We can make it easy.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.600
 But they're not.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.600
 If we don't know what they're doing, the paper basically comes to no conclusion.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.600
 They're like, well, yeah, it'll suck if it happens.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.600
 But this is what we can do differently.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:44.600
 I always assumed that an alien message, and this is just me, I guess, being naive about intergalactic politics.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.600
 I always assumed that alien message would be, hey guys, what's up?

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.600
 We're the Andromeda boys.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.600
 We're hanging out.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.600
 Yo, you should come kick it with us.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.600
 We got some awesome brew.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.600
 Like I thought it would be friendly.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.600
 Maybe you would, because again, why would you send a message saying we're going to destroy you?

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.600
 We'll see you in 10,000 light years, because that would only give us time to prepare.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:10.600
 I figured a message would be beneficial, or at least like a hello, and invasion would just happen.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:16.600
 I always walk down the street and I think, I wonder what would happen if an alien ship poured out of those clouds?

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.600
 Constantly.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:24.600
 That is probably my second most thought while I'm walking, other than, what would I do if a zombie showed up right now?

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 So I always thought a hostile action would just be ships.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.600
 You know, Spain didn't send letters to South America, say, and see.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.600
 You soon, they just kind of showed up one day.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:46.600
 So maybe that was just me being naive, but the idea of getting a message in the middle of the night at a radio telescope lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:53.600
 and seeing the little data points appearing, and you're like, oh my god, you're calling up your supervisors?

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.600
 This is it.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:00.600
 This is what we've been waiting for, and everyone comes over to your monitor and you're seeing that...

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.600
 You're watching this file, just the information grow, gigabytes and terabytes, and you're like, what could this be?

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.600
 This could be, this is obviously not random.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:16.600
 This could be proof, it is proof, that we're being contacted from somebody other than Earth.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:22.600
 You're watching this file grow and grow and grow and grow, and then finally, and now you have the option to decode it.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:35.600
 A 99% chance that it is benevolent, but a 1% chance that it will be the end of human civilization.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 Do you open that file?

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.600
