00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.900
 A temple in India holds riches and curses.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.700
 Then are we on the cusp of a modern-day zombie outbreak?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.200
 Seriously, seriously.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.200
 You guys are like nothing serious, but no, no, that's an interesting one.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.700
 And then, we find a man who can eat anything.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.300
 Yes, anything.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:50.500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.500
 I'm having a great day.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.100
 I hope you're having a great day too.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 This is take four.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.100
 It's been the past hour here doing different takes.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.300
 Driving me nuts.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.100
 My needs are actually really hard to do because I've been out of practice for a while and I'm like,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 "Grrrrrr."

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.500
 But so goes the world of podcasting.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 There is a guy on YouTube.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.600
 Not a YouTuber as far as I know, but they're one of my listeners on YouTube.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.400
 I love you to death, dude.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 You suggested that I do a story and I thought, "Oh yeah, that'd be an interesting one."

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 Because I had a vague knowledge of it.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.800
 But Pondroll.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.600
 Pondroll.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.800
 I know, I've seen you pop up on a couple different videos.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.200
 I've seen you commenting on a few of my podcast videos on YouTube.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 And I know you listen to the show.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 So when you suggested this story, you knew the torment you were about to unleash on my audience.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 Because I have a hard time pronouncing cities in America.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.100
 And Pondroll suggested a story that takes place in India.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.600
 Now, the story is...

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.900
 [Sigh]

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.200
 The Padman Abbaswamy Temple.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.100
 I'm not even gonna try that one again.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.800
 The temple.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.900
 And it is this...

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.800
 Pondroll, really, I love you and I'm...

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.300
 Thanks so much for listening.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.900
 Thanks so much for the suggestion.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.100
 But there's this temple in India.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.800
 That...

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.400
 There's this temple in this India that there was always this legend that it was full of treasure.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400
 This is gonna be a fairly short story.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.800
 But there was always this rumor that there was this treasure in this temple.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.900
 And back in...

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.200
 What was it?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.500
 20...

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.400
 So, but back in 2011, the government said,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.200
 "You know what? We should...

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.700
 Let's go through and find out actually what's in this temple.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.900
 We should catalog it."

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.800
 Because it's been there since like 3 A.D.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.100
 And they're like, "Hey, finally getting around to it, right?"

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.900
 "Let's do this."

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.300
 While they were snooping around the temple, they found six...

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.300
 Hidden doors that they never knew was there.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.700
 And we'll get into that in a second.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.100
 Because that's an interesting thing.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.800
 You find these six hidden doors.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.100
 And they basically labeled them A through F.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.700
 Now, I don't think they used the English letters, but it was basically just like,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.700
 "This is door A, this is door B, so it's C, so on."

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.900
 But in Indian letters.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.800
 And so, they start opening the doors.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.100
 And they find...

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.900
 Amazing riches.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.500
 Gold, ancient gold coins, diamonds, gems,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.700
 diamond necklaces and cased in gold.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.500
 With gems, I don't know, just these amazing artifacts.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.100
 And they're like, "Oh my God!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.400
 We're rich!"

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.200
 I mean, we're the government, so we're rich anyways, but we have this untold, unheard of fortune

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.300
 just laying in this temple.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.300
 And they're opening the doors and they're like,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.300
 "Doo-lululoo!"

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.800
 Like, just these sparkly gold nuggets.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.200
 Hanging out.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.500
 The gold coins are winking at them.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.900
 And a little thumbs up, finally finding them.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.400
 But door B can't be opened.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.400
 Door B is sealed shut.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.200
 Now, they were all technically sealed shut.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.400
 And they were all hidden.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.500
 But door B is impenetrable.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.700
 They've tried opening it several times.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.000
 You know, like, jiggle the knob, whatever.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.600
 They've tried seeing what's behind door B.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.600
 But the problem is, is that door B has a legend behind it.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.900
 Now, back in the 1930s, that region was super, super poor.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.400
 And they were actually going there having like a starvation issue.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.000
 Which I mean, I guess it's just starvation.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.900
 That's the issue.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.800
 They didn't have enough food.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.200
 Now, this is what I thought was weird, because in 2011, they said,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.400
 "Let's go see what's in this temple."

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.300
 But in the 1930s, they go, "Hey, we're pretty sure there's a bunch of winking gold coins in that temple.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.000
 Let's go in there."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.600
 And for whatever reason, the first door they tried to open was door B.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.400
 And, sorry, that didn't happen in 1930.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.900
 That happened a hundred years ago.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.300
 So in 1900, the region was, something else happened in 1930.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.200
 So in about 1900, the region's super poor and they're starving and everything like that.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.800
 They go to open door B, and they hear a curious sound on the other side of door B.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.000
 A sound you shouldn't hear on the other side of any door in existence.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.900
 That's the sound of the ocean.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.300
 And they're like, "Eh, let's not open this.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.900
 Let's not go here."

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.200
 And they thought this door must lead to the Arabian Ocean,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.400
 which actually I figured would be closer to Saudi Arabia, but apparently it's also close to India.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.900
 They have big coastlines, but anyway, so they didn't.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.800
 And then they just a bunch of people starved.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.300
 I don't know why they didn't try the other doors.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.000
 Maybe they didn't know the other doors were there because they were so well hidden.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.700
 In the 1930s, some burglars were like, "Hey, dude, sometimes when I'm walking by that temple,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.000
 I hear the sound of coins winking at me."

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.500
 So they try to open door B and a bunch of snakes jump out of the door and chase them off.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.000
 Noxious snakes is the term.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.700
 So a smelly snake.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.400
 Unless the word means something else that I don't know of.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.400
 To this day, that door has never been open.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.600
 Door B has never been open.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.600
 And the legend is that only a cleric or a high level saint can open it.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.100
 So break out your Final Fantasy VII saves and see if you...

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.400
 I don't know if there are saints in that.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.800
 But anyways, break out your role-playing game.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.400
 Whatever role-playing game you do, level up your saint.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.400
 Try to open this door because they believe that it is sealed by magic.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.000
 And unless the seal is broken, even though the door they believe can be open with modern technology,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.700
 i.e. dynamite,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:16.700
 they think that opening the door without removing the magic will cause great catastrophe to the region.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.100
 Like a giant Neuravian Ocean emptying into the middle of India.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.100
 I think it's interesting because the door has the images of snakes on it.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.900
 And it had images of something else I couldn't pronounce.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.400
 Again, thanks, Ponderall.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.700
 And those images are associated in Indian mythology or Indian culture as being warning signs.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.200
 I mentioned once before that there was a group of people who were trying to design a warning logo

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.900
 that could be interpreted 10 million years in the future.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.600
 Because we want to bury all this nuclear waste in Nevada.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.400
 But they don't want anyone stumbling across it, you know, long after we're gone and opening the doors

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.300
 and irradiating the entire western half of the United States.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.000
 So they go, "What type of image can we come up with?"

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.100
 That millions of years from now people will not interpret as anything other than dangerous.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.800
 A skull, a lot of times that represents religious.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.900
 So if archaeologists in the future stumbled across a giant skull in the middle of a desert on a door

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.900
 they may not necessarily equate that with death.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.000
 For the most part it hasn't been equated with death.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.500
 For a long time in human history, skulls meant rebirth or religion.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.400
 But they're saying that this is a warning, do not open this door.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.400
 I think that's really interesting because who knows what's behind it.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.600
 Is it more gold? Diamonds? The size of an infant?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.900
 Is it something, is it some magical portal to somewhere else?

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.100
 Is it a super weapon that was hidden there?

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.000
 Or is it just an empty room? We don't know.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.200
 And it's funny because the Indian government is in no hurry to figure it out.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.500
 So that is the story of the temple I can't pronounce.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.700
 Indiana Jones and the Temple I Can't Pronounce.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:01.300
 You know what's so funny is that intriguing is the story is it delves a lot into Indian mythology

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.300
 and I just can't pronounce the words. And I'm not going to put you through that.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.300
 So we're leaving India. We'll probably be back to India at some point

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.300
 because they do have a lot of cool mythology.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.000
 It's just the language barrier. I just can't pronounce that stuff.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And I don't like to give foreign places nicknames like

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.900
 Padahamata Tapak Castle. We'll just call it Paddy. I don't like to do that.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:31.600
 But anyways, so we're off. Now we're going from India and the legends involving that

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.400
 to Africa, modern day Africa. Now we're in the Congo.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.900
 Now this is an interesting story because this just popped up in the news.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.000
 They're having an Ebola outbreak again. It's not just any Ebola outbreak.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 This is the second biggest Ebola outbreak in history.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.600
 Now they've had them and it's been fairly restricted to villages.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.000
 And they go, "Okay, that's not like a good thing." And I'm like, "Yay, just villages."

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.800
 But it could have been a lot, lot worse. And the problem is that we might be there now

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.800
 because they have this city. It's called Butembo in the Congo.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.700
 And it has a population, it's a city. It has a population of over a million people.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:18.100
 And Ebola has not hit a major city yet. And we're starting to see outbreaks in the suburbs

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:24.500
 and in outlying communities. Ebola, if you don't know, is incredibly contagious

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:30.400
 and has a kill rate between 50% and 90%.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.900
 It can be transmitted through a drop, a drop of sweat or blood.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.500
 So people riding on the subway that are sweaty.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.700
 You just want to stay away from them anyways. But they're like, "Woohoo, shaking their head.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.900
 Like a dog, it's flying everywhere." It's like Beethoven, but Ebola infected.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.600
 And it can take up to nine days before you start to become symptomatic.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.800
 So you can have it and spread it and not know it.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.300
 And then you start pooping out blood. Basically, you liquefy from the inside out.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.300
 That's what ends up killing you.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.300
 You'll start to get like, some people get rashes, some people get bloodshot eyes.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.900
 Some people, it starts off with confusion and things like that.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.900
 But the end result that will kill you is massive blood loss.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.500
 Your organs liquefy. And then you throw up and you poop out blood until you die.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.100
 It's very brutal. I've seen some photos of people dying from it.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.200
 They're alive. I saw a photo of a guy sitting in the middle of a street.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.700
 He's just blood all on the ground underneath his butt.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.500
 He's laying down. He's sitting.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.100
 But you just see a puddle of blood because he's pooping out blood

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.000
 and he's reaching out for help.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.700
 And everyone else in the photo has given him like a 10-foot radius.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.700
 Because he's dead. There's nothing you can do.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.000
 And part of the problem is not only is Ebola highly contagious,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.900
 but the burial rituals in the Congo and in other regions of this area,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.800
 they require the people to clean the body, to wash the bodies off.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.800
 And if they're a very famous person, sometimes you'll lay on the body.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.400
 You'll be like, "Oh, Elvis, such great music. Let me lay on your body."

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.900
 Which gives you Ebola.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.400
 And then you die and then your loved ones wash your body, clean your body, things like that.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.300
 I read an interesting article where the person says,

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.700
 "Imagine having a millennial old tradition and all of a sudden

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:23.100
 a couple guys show up in hazmat suits and say, 'Just throw it in a bag and burn it.'"

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.900
 And that's the problem they're having over in these regions.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.600
 They've been having these burial practices for hundreds, hundreds of years.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.300
 And now people are showing up in pretty much space suits saying,

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.700
 "No, can't say goodbye. Just throw it in a bag."

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.600
 That's it. Can't touch it.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.600
 Now it's hitting a city.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.900
 Like I said, it's only outskirts. It hasn't gotten to the main part of town.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.700
 But it seems like it's only a matter of time.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.700
 And here's the problem.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:54.900
 Merrick, the group that makes the Ebola, it's an experimental Ebola vaccine.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.700
 So they're not entirely for sure that it works.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.600
 They're pretty sure that it works.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.600
 They give it to people and it seems to work,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.600
 but they've only dealt with basic "minor outbreaks."

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.900
 The biggest outbreak was around 11,000 people.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:16.400
 So they go, "Okay, well, let's stockpile 300,000 doses of this vaccine."

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.200
 It takes months to prepare.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.800
 They go 300,000. That's a good starting point.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:28.300
 But with over a million people in the city, it's not even half that can be vaccinated from this.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:38.400
 You could have a city full of skyscrapers and restaurants and coffee shops and skate parks,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.800
 a wash in blood by next summer.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.100
 It would be like a zombie movie.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.800
 And the weirdest part about this vaccine—

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.100
 and they don't know what they're going to do.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.000
 Merrick has said, "We don't know if we can have enough vaccines ready to go."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.700
 Another thing with this outbreak is people are coming down with Ebola

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.000
 and they don't know where they got it from.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.900
 Normally, you would have one person go, "Well, yeah, I was holding hands with that dude."

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.500
 And that's how I got Ebola.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.500
 But now people are showing up and they're like, "Well, do you know anyone who died of Ebola?"

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.400
 And they're like, "No, I don't know anyone who died of Ebola."

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.200
 So it may already get spread in that droplet form.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.200
 All it takes—I mean, this was the big controversy a couple of years ago—

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.500
 is for it takes nine days for someone to get on a plane and go to another country.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.800
 But they don't have enough vaccines to inoculate an entire city.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.000
 They don't know how some people are catching it, which is very worrying.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.700
 But the vaccine—I remember reading about this a couple of years ago—

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.300
 the vaccine itself—so Merrick is a company.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.000
 And a company's goal is to make profit.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.100
 Companies tend to have secondary goals.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.600
 Walmart's goal is to make profit.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.900
 And Sam Walton's goal, at least—you can argue whether or not Walmart's still about it—

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:58.000
 but Sam Walton's goal was to give customers low-price items.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.600
 That was—I mean, he wanted to make money and keep the company going.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.200
 But his secondary goal was to allow people to buy stuff at the lowest price possible.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.800
 That's an admirable goal.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.200
 Merrick, their main goal is to make money, and their secondary goal is to help people.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.700
 But when you come—and most corporations are like that—

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.100
 Amazon's like, "Hey, we want you to have access to all the entertainment you want to,

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.700
 but we also—our main goal is to make money."

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.500
 There's a little capitalism side note there.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.500
 Merrick said, "Listen, we can make this Ebola vaccine,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.600
 but the truth of the matter is that Ebola is quite rare.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.100
 So the amount of money that we put into making this vaccine, we have to recoup."

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.400
 Not just the research and development, but the making—producing the actual physical vaccine itself.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.100
 It's quite rare. It'll take us forever to recoup a profit from making this.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:52.200
 And then someone—some genius there, probably Max Brooks or George Romero, said,

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:58.800
 "You know what else is rare? That we have a vaccine for, that we can stockpile,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.800
 but it's so rare it doesn't really make it cost-effective for us to make all this vaccine for?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.400
 And we can combine them together and they're like, "Yes, Mr. Romero, what's your suggestion?"

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.700
 And he goes, "Rabies. Rabies is a vaccine that is needed that we have,

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.900
 but it doesn't make sense for us to make a separate rabies vaccine.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:24.000
 What if we took—this is 100% true—what if we took the rabies vaccine and the Ebola vaccine,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.700
 combined them into a single vaccine so we can give it to either person?"

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.500
 And people are like, "Yay, clapping, having no—"

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.800
 You ever wonder why people in zombie movies act like they've never seen a zombie movie?

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.700
 Because people in our planet act like they've never seen a zombie movie.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.700
 Why would you invent something?

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:50.900
 Because remember, a vaccine tends to have a element of the disease in the vaccine.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.900
 That might not hold true across all vaccines, but like the flu vaccine, they're like,

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.600
 "Oh yeah, it has a little bit of the flu vaccine. You might get sick. You might find a little—"

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.300
 You're gonna give me rabies if I have Ebola?

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.500
 Or if I have rabies, you're gonna inject me with something that has Ebola in it?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:12.900
 You're—you've basically created a crazy, blood-spewing monster

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.100
 who's just gonna run around spitting blood at everybody and doesn't care because he has rabies.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.400
 Why would you combine those two?

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.500
 Why don't you combine Ebola and like, I don't know, anti-depression medicine

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.400
 or something that makes you sleepy?

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.800
 Anything else! I guess people who have depression don't want to be injected full of Ebola, but

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.700
 those are the two—those—ugh—that's like at the beginning of "I am Legend" the movie.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.300
 They invent the cure for cancer and it turns everyone into a vampire.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.700
 I don't know if I would take that vaccine.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.300
 And I don't know if I would hang out with anybody who took that vaccine.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:54.100
 Because again, you've now created a crazy, a 28 days later, rage-infected monster.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.900
 No! Put something else in that vaccine, Merrick.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:07.600
 But 300,000 doses of that rabies/Ebola vaccine is on its way to a major city in Africa.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:13.200
 Okay, the last story we're gonna talk about—it's funny because I heard about the story when I was a kid

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.300
 because I've always been reading this weird stuff.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:22.100
 And as I was researching this, I realized the version I heard as a kid was heavily edited.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.100
 So we're going to France. We will take—well, hop in the Carpenter copter,

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.100
 because I want to get out of the Ebola city of Congo.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.500
 We're gonna fly above just right—like they're—

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.800
 [makes a loud noise]

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.100
 They're like running towards a helicopter.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.700
 Get on! Get on! Get on!

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.300
 Many guns are out of ammo.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:38.900
 Get on!

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.000
 [makes a loud noise]

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.100
 That's not you making that noise. That's the zombies behind you.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.600
 You hop into the helicopter—it's so funny.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.400
 I get accused of racism all the time for this podcast.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.900
 This isn't helping, but anyways—

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.400
 [makes a loud noise]

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.500
 They're chasing us down.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.500
 Jump in the helicopter.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.800
 They're forming like a human pyramid to try to get us.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 [makes a loud noise]

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.400
 Take off.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.900
 Just as we start to see the nuke coming towards the city.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.100
 Anyways, we're gonna go to France.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.600
 We're gonna go back in time so you won't have to worry about zombies.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:35.700
 [makes a loud noise]

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:40.600
 Now, again, I had to talk about this during the India segment earlier.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.900
 You should know by now that I can't pronounce my R's either,

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.000
 so if you don't know what I'm saying, he's a French guy,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.400
 and his name is Thaure.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:47.900
 Thaure.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.900
 So anyways, Thaure—

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.000
 [sighs]

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.200
 Thaure—I don't know why I picked these stories to go all the same episode.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.800
 Thaure is this French guy.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.500
 We look at him and we're like, "That is a skinny man!"

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.500
 "That is a skinny man!"

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.000
 He is of normal height.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.300
 Whatever that may be.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.600
 He's 100 pounds.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.900
 He looks to be 100 pounds.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.200
 You're like, "Oh, man, you didn't eat something."

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.800
 100 pounds for being in your 20s is quite slender.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.400
 That's when he lifts up his shirt and billows of loose skin just—

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.000
 [makes a loud noise]

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.300
 and like deflated balloon just kind of like sloped towards the ground.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:27.700
 And you notice that even though he's only in his 20s, his face is super wrinkly.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:34.700
 He looks like a 100-pound man whose skin is just melted jello.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.900
 Now, Thaure was a medical freak.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:43.100
 There's a few other people who have this condition, but Thaure is the most notable.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.900
 When he was a kid, his appetite was insatiable.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.300
 He couldn't stop eating.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.400
 And eventually, he literally—

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.100
 not literally, but he ate them out of house and home.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.900
 He didn't eat the house.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.000
 He was like, "You know what?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.400
 Actually, he would have.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.500
 We'll get to that in a second."

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.500
 He actually would have given the chance.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.200
 And so his parents kicked him out because they're like,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.100
 "Oh, we saw you eyeing the floorboards."

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.900
 They kicked him out because they couldn't afford to keep him.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.700
 And he ends up joining like a bunch of circus freaks.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:12.000
 And his show was, "Let me eat whatever you got in your pockets."

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 "Hey, hey you. What do you have in your pockets?"

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.100
 And he's like, "I don't know. Like a couple shillings."

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.900
 And he's like, "Well, that's weird. This is France.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:20.700
 You should have francs."

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.400
 And he's like, "Oh, yes, that's what I meant, francs."

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.800
 So he'd eat the francs.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.600
 And he goes, "What do you have?"

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.000
 And the person's like, "I have this potted plant in my purse."

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.200
 And he's like, "Give it to me."

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.500
 "Aah, he'd eat it."

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.100
 Now his jaw didn't just stand and he ate a whole pot.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.900
 But he would eat cats.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.100
 He'd be like, "Hey, hey, cat lady. Can I borrow one of those?"

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.800
 And she's like, "Uh, sure."

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.600
 And he's gonna pet it.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.200
 And he's like, "Some pet it from the inside."

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.200
 He'd rip its stomach open and eat the guts.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.800
 And then he would eat everything but the bones.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.800
 And then he'd throw up the fur and the skin.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.200
 And then at that point, everyone kind of just applauded.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.800
 At one point, he was doing this act and he got an obstruction in the stomach

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.400
 and the other circus performers had to take him to the doctor.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.600
 And the doctor was like fixing him up.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.800
 And he goes, "Hey, you know, I do this act."

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.400
 This is your story.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.600
 He goes, "You know, I do this act where I can eat anything."

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.400
 The doctor's like, "Really?"

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.100
 He's like, "Hey, let me eat your gold watch."

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.300
 He couldn't stop eating stuff.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.100
 And the doctor said, "If you ate my watch, I'm gonna cut you open and get it out."

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.200
 To which I imagined Terare, like, grabbed the collar of his shirt and went, "Gulp."

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.700
 But anyways, he couldn't stop eating stuff.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.300
 Eventually, he joined the military, which considering that that life is so regimented,

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.800
 it seemed like a bizarre choice, but maybe just doing his civic duty.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.400
 And he would eat all of his rations and then he would do chores around the camp

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.100
 to eat other people's rations.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.600
 And then he started eating food out of the garbage.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.500
 And that's nothing compared to what's coming.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.000
 He started eating food out of the garbage.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 And the army was like, "Dude, seriously."

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.300
 And when he'd eat, like, all of his loose skin would inflate like a balloon.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.500
 He could actually fill his body up with food.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.700
 And then as it would dissolve, his skin would get super loose again.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.800
 And finally, there was this dude at the camp, the commander, and he goes,

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.400
 "This guy's driving me nuts, but I have a plan."

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:10.400
 I'm gonna make him swallow little, like, wooden boxes with battle plans on them.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.000
 And then he'll just walk across enemy lines.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.600
 No one will notice him, 'cause he just looks like a normal dude.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.800
 And then he'll poop out the plans to somebody else.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.500
 And so they do a test.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.500
 They give him a little wooden box and put a piece of paper in it, and he swallows it.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.300
 And then a couple days later, he poops it out, or a couple hours later, whatever,

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.400
 and poops it out, and the box was fine.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.100
 And they're like, "Oh, this plan's gonna work."

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.600
 Now, let me tell you a little bit more about Tarare.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.300
 This was his description.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.200
 He had an abnormally wide mouth and near-invisible lips.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.300
 Now, I don't think that meant they were like the invisible woman that you could see through me.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.700
 I think they just meant that he had super, super thin lips.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.800
 Like I said, his face was super wrinkly, his skin hung super low.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.500
 His skin, like, if you touched him, it was hot.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.800
 He was hot to the touch. It's probably a big part of his metabolism.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.400
 And he was described, this is a quote,

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:06.000
 "He stunk to such a degree that he could not be endured within the distance of 20 paces."

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.100
 So just a super stink bag.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.100
 You didn't want to be near him.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.200
 And that was normal.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.100
 When he ate, he smelled worse.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.500
 He had constant diarrhea, constant diarrhea.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.800
 And that gives a new angle to the story of them, like, waiting around for him to poop out the box.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.400
 And then it's all, "Pffft!"

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.800
 Just like a huge puddle.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.600
 And they're like, "Okay, let's get a private in here to dig through this stuff, 'cause I'm not."

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:36.900
 He had chronic diarrhea, and it was, and again, quote, "fedded beyond all conception."

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.200
 So they should add a poet in the room, 'cause you hear that phrase,

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.800
 they should send a poet to space.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.000
 They should have had a poet.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:53.600
 Beyond all conception, beyond what great ideas lay out in the universe they cannot use to describe the smell of his diarrhea.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.800
 And I don't know, I don't know how this is possible.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:05.500
 But they said that you could look at him and vapor, like, stink lines came out of his skin.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.200
 You could see a visible vapor around him.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.000
 They're just the stench.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.100
 Now let's go back to that plan about using him as a spy.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.500
 You want someone to walk across enemy lines.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.600
 France was at war with pressure at this point.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:27.400
 You pick a guy who has big, big, flabby cheeks, stinks from 20 meters away,

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.800
 has visible vapor lines coming off of him, and constantly has to stop to have diarrhea.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.100
 Needless to say, the plan didn't really work.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.100
 Eventually, when he went back, he's like, "He didn't want to do any more army stuff, so he volunteered to go to hospital."

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:46.400
 The doctors are like, "Oh my God, this is amazing. We can't wait to see how this dude works."

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.800
 They tried curing him.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.100
 One of the cures was soft-boiled eggs.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.700
 Let's give him as many soft-boiled eggs as we can.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.900
 And he's like, "Go, go, go, go, go."

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.100
 Didn't work out too well.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:04.100
 One of the things was they had a meal spread, a table spread for 15 laborers who were working to the hospital at that time.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.500
 So they had all this food laid out, and they go, "Hmm."

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:13.500
 The doctors are like, "Hmm. I wonder what will happen if we give him food that is set aside for 15 able-bodied men."

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.300
 He ate it all. He ate it all.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.500
 He complained about hunger all the time.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.000
 If he wasn't eating, he was constantly exhausted.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.100
 So it wasn't just like this circus freak, "Let me swallow anything."

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.800
 He was constantly hungry. He had to eat. That's why he was digging through the garbage.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.700
 So they saw him eat all that food, and they're like, "Okay, okay, enough fun, guys. Let's go back to trying to cure him."

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.900
 And they would put him on these regulated diets.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:40.000
 But the problem is, is that he wouldn't stick to them. He would break out of the hospital, or just walk out of the hospital at night.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.700
 And there was a butcher shop that, you know, they throw all their scraps in the dump and the garbage behind the butcher shop.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.800
 I imagine it's like, "The lady in the tramp. There's just a bunch of spaghetti back there."

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.600
 He would go through that, but so would stray dogs.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.000
 So he had to fight stray dogs for food every night just to get some extra food.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.800
 In this hospital, because we're in the 1700s, bloodletting was a thing. They had a bloodletting ward.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.400
 "Hmm, you're sick. Let's take as much blood out of you as possible. That might cure you."

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.800
 He would drink their blood. He would go in there and he'd be like, "Gulp, gulp, gulp."

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:20.100
 And you can imagine like a nurse was walking through the hospital and saw like a silhouette crouched over with like a hose in his mouth.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.400
 And she's like, "Tar-Rare, what are you doing out of your room?" And he's like, "Gulp."

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:31.400
 And then they caught him. No joke, because imagine having a hunger that's on the level of a heroin addiction.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.800
 Like, you have to eat. You have to eat.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.600
 They caught him in the morgue trying to eat corpses.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.300
 And they're like, "Tar-Rare." No, at that point they were really concerned about.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.800
 So the end of his hospital stay, the end of all the experiments ends like this.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:53.700
 Tarare's in the hospital and he's probably sitting there and he has like an odd shaped lump in his stomach.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:59.300
 I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's true, but okay, let me try and stick to the fact.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.300
 The fact, okay, the fact of the story is...

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:09.300
 The fact of the story is Tarare is in the hospital and it was a fully functional hospital.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:17.900
 So they had like the bloodletting ward and the morgue and other stuff going on there, including a maternity ward.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.500
 Oh wait, this baby wouldn't be there because this baby was 14 months old, but they did have a maternity ward.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.700
 So not the maternity ward because this baby's too old. This baby's graduated.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:32.400
 The baby's there for some checkup. French measles. They want to make sure the baby doesn't have French measles.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:41.100
 So, but one day the mom's like, "Here baby, 14 month old baby, I'm gonna set you down on this chair while I read this old timey wood carving magazine."

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:49.000
 She's like getting splinters reading this wood carving magazine and she turns back, "Baby's gone. Baby's gone."

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.700
 Now I don't know that exact sequence of events happened either.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:28:00.100
 The point is, is that Tarare was in a hospital and a 14 month old baby went completely missing.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:06.100
 They never, ever found the kid and the fur- they didn't go, "Oh Tarare!"

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.900
 This time they're like, "That dude ate a baby. That guy straight up ate a baby."

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.100
 And he took off. He ran out. That's the end of that story.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:22.600
 I was like, there has to be another answer. It has to be that they found the baby later, but from all accounts, he ate a living baby.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.800
 Which isn't far from the other stuff he's done.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:33.100
 We know he's eaten live cats and live dogs and he's tried eating humans, so I mean, babies kind of look like food.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:38.000
 They look like little rolls. Now I would never eat a baby, but they look puffy.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.300
 And so Tarare, as hungry as he is, he could just be like, "Ah, it'll probably taste like dinner rolls and marshmallows."

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.700
 I don't know. That's super disgusting, but anyways.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.900
 Actually, you think they would have found the bones because he doesn't eat that.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:54.800
 He runs out of the hospital. Eventually though, at age 26, died very, very young.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:02.500
 He goes and he says, he goes to this other doctor and he's like, "Oh, hi, I'm Tarare. You might know me from the baby eating scandal."

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:08.200
 But I ate a gold fork a while ago and I think it's still in me and I'm super sick.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.700
 Now the doctor is looking at this saggy, fetid, gross diarrhea monster.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.600
 And he's thinking, you know, a guy who ate a gold fork, that's not the weirdest thing about you.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.600
 But let's take a look.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:27.500
 So he starts treating him and he goes, "No, you don't have... You may or may not have eaten a golden fork, but you have tuberculosis."

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.800
 Advanced tuberculosis.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.100
 And Tarare's like, "No, trust me, dude, I ate a gold fork. It's in my stomach. It really hurts."

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.100
 I've eaten tons of stuff, but for some reason that's not sitting well with me.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.700
 The fact that it's a four-pronged metal object, he eventually does die though.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:47.900
 And in his last moments, like the last couple hours of his life, ten times the worst diarrhea.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.200
 He was pooping out pus, pus and blood-filled diarrhea.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.000
 And then he dies.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.200
 A fitting way to end to a man who had diarrhea his entire life.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.000
 He had to tie, he had to one-up it.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.700
 And so one of the doctors who treated him at the baby-eating hospital came to this hospital because they called him up and they're like,

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.200
 "Hey, remember that baby-eating scandal?"

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.200
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, we have that guy here."

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.400
 He says he ate a gold fork.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.900
 And you can imagine the doctor at the other hospital.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:19.200
 By that time, the phone's already like hanging off the desk and he's in his jalopy to get to this hospital.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.200
 Or a horse, because they didn't have cars back then.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.400
 But he to get there, because he's like, "Dude, I need to find it.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.500
 I want to find this guy because this guy was like a medical marvel."

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.400
 And he gets there and the body's just laying there and is super stinky.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.500
 And none of the doctors want to do an autopsy.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:37.000
 And the baby-eating hospital doctor says, "I'll do it.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.400
 I need to find out what made this guy tick."

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.500
 So they cut him open.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:45.900
 His throat cavity was so huge that if you opened his mouth, you could look down into his stomach.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.800
 His body cavity was filled with pus.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.600
 Like his liver was covered in pus and just like an ocean of mucus in there.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.700
 And his stomach all over the inside of his stomach were ma-

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.600
 And his stomach was huge, by the way, like his actual stomach cavity.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.300
 But all over the inside of his stomach were these massive, gross, disgusting tumors.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.100
 I don't- It wasn't in the description. They were gross and disgusting.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.300
 But I'm sure they were.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.400
 I don't think that's a stretch of the imagination.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.200
 And no golden fork.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.500
 So the question is, did he really eat the golden fork? Probably.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.600
 For whatever reason, because he's terrarium.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:30.200
 But did he poop it out at some point or was his stomach acid so intense he can actually melt metal or gold?

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.900
 I guess gold is a metal, but that's the story of terrarium.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.600
 Now, like I said, when I read the story when I was a kid, it was like,

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.700
 "There's this goofy guy named Terrare. He'd eat anything."

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.700
 He was a circus performer and he ate corks and screws.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.800
 And once he even ate a cat.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:50.100
 And then he turned the page and it's like about the two-headed wolf girl or something like that.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.100
 Nothing about eating babies.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.000
 Nothing about puss filled diarrhea.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.400
 None of that stuff.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.200
 But I remembered that story as a kid looking through like,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.200
 Ripley's Believe It or Not or some crazy person like,

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.100
 "Crazy people in history book."

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.000
 They took out all the good stuff.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.900
 That's why I found it for you guys on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:10.700
 There we go.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.300
 I liked that take. Took me four tries.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.400
 But we got it.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.000
 It takes a while to warm up on Mondays.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.900
 It's weird because I have those two days where I don't do anything, but...

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:26.700
 I went and took a shower and I was like, "I gotta do it. It's my job. I gotta do it."

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.300
 But we had a good one. I really like this episode.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.000
 Now. Now I like this episode.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.800
