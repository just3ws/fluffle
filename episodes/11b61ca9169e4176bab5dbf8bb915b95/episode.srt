 A temple in India holds riches and curses.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,700
 Then are we on the cusp of a modern-day zombie outbreak?

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,200
 Seriously, seriously.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,200

00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,300
 Yes, anything.

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:50,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,500
 I'm having a great day.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,100
 I hope you're having a great day too.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,500
 This is take four.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,100
 It's been the past hour here doing different takes.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,300
 Driving me nuts.

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,100
 My needs are actually really hard to do because I've been out of practice for a while and I'm like,

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,100
 "Grrrrrr."

23
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,500
 But so goes the world of podcasting.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,100
 There is a guy on YouTube.

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,600
 Not a YouTuber as far as I know, but they're one of my listeners on YouTube.

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,400
 I love you to death, dude.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,600
 You suggested that I do a story and I thought, "Oh yeah, that'd be an interesting one."

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,700
 Because I had a vague knowledge of it.

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,800
 But Pondroll.

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,600
 Pondroll.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,800
 I know, I've seen you pop up on a couple different videos.

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,200
 I've seen you commenting on a few of my podcast videos on YouTube.

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
 And I know you listen to the show.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,200
 So when you suggested this story, you knew the torment you were about to unleash on my audience.

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,700
 Because I have a hard time pronouncing cities in America.

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,100
 And Pondroll suggested a story that takes place in India.

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,600
 Now, the story is...

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,900
 [Sigh]

39
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,200
 The Padman Abbaswamy Temple.

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,100
 I'm not even gonna try that one again.

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,800
 The temple.

42
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,900
 And it is this...

43
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,800
 Pondroll, really, I love you and I'm...

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,300
 Thanks so much for listening.

45
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,900
 Thanks so much for the suggestion.

46
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,100
 But there's this temple in India.

47
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,800
 That...

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,400
 There's this temple in this India that there was always this legend that it was full of treasure.

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
 This is gonna be a fairly short story.

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,800
 But there was always this rumor that there was this treasure in this temple.

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,900
 And back in...

52
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,200
 What was it?

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,500
 20...

54
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,400
 So, but back in 2011, the government said,

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
 "You know what? We should...

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,700
 Let's go through and find out actually what's in this temple.

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,900
 We should catalog it."

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,800
 Because it's been there since like 3 A.D.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,100
 And they're like, "Hey, finally getting around to it, right?"

60
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,900
 "Let's do this."

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,300
 While they were snooping around the temple, they found six...

62
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,300
 Hidden doors that they never knew was there.

63
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,700
 And we'll get into that in a second.

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,100
 Because that's an interesting thing.

65
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,800
 You find these six hidden doors.

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,100
 And they basically labeled them A through F.

67
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,700
 Now, I don't think they used the English letters, but it was basically just like,

68
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,700
 "This is door A, this is door B, so it's C, so on."

69
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,900
 But in Indian letters.

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,800
 And so, they start opening the doors.

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,100
 And they find...

72
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,900
 Amazing riches.

73
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,500
 Gold, ancient gold coins, diamonds, gems,

74
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,700
 diamond necklaces and cased in gold.

75
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,500
 With gems, I don't know, just these amazing artifacts.

76
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,100
 And they're like, "Oh my God!

77
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,400
 We're rich!"

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,200
 I mean, we're the government, so we're rich anyways, but we have this untold, unheard of fortune

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,300
 just laying in this temple.

80
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
 And they're opening the doors and they're like,

81
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,300
 "Doo-lululoo!"

82
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,800
 Like, just these sparkly gold nuggets.

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,200
 Hanging out.

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,500
 The gold coins are winking at them.

85
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,900
 And a little thumbs up, finally finding them.

86
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,400
 But door B can't be opened.

87
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
 Door B is sealed shut.

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,200
 Now, they were all technically sealed shut.

89
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
 And they were all hidden.

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,500
 But door B is impenetrable.

91
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,700
 They've tried opening it several times.

92
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,000
 You know, like, jiggle the knob, whatever.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,600
 They've tried seeing what's behind door B.

94
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,600
 But the problem is, is that door B has a legend behind it.

95
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,900
 Now, back in the 1930s, that region was super, super poor.

96
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,400
 And they were actually going there having like a starvation issue.

97
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,000
 Which I mean, I guess it's just starvation.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,900
 That's the issue.

99
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,800
 They didn't have enough food.

100
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
 Now, this is what I thought was weird, because in 2011, they said,

101
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,400
 "Let's go see what's in this temple."

102
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,300
 But in the 1930s, they go, "Hey, we're pretty sure there's a bunch of winking gold coins in that temple.

103
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,000
 Let's go in there."

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
 And for whatever reason, the first door they tried to open was door B.

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
 And, sorry, that didn't happen in 1930.

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,900
 That happened a hundred years ago.

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,300
 So in 1900, the region was, something else happened in 1930.

108
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,200
 So in about 1900, the region's super poor and they're starving and everything like that.

109
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,800
 They go to open door B, and they hear a curious sound on the other side of door B.

110
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,000
 A sound you shouldn't hear on the other side of any door in existence.

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,900
 That's the sound of the ocean.

112
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,300
 And they're like, "Eh, let's not open this.

113
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,900
 Let's not go here."

114
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,200
 And they thought this door must lead to the Arabian Ocean,

115
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,400
 which actually I figured would be closer to Saudi Arabia, but apparently it's also close to India.

116
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,900
 They have big coastlines, but anyway, so they didn't.

117
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,800
 And then they just a bunch of people starved.

118
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,300
 I don't know why they didn't try the other doors.

119
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,000
 Maybe they didn't know the other doors were there because they were so well hidden.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,700
 In the 1930s, some burglars were like, "Hey, dude, sometimes when I'm walking by that temple,

121
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,000
 I hear the sound of coins winking at me."

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,500
 So they try to open door B and a bunch of snakes jump out of the door and chase them off.

123
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,000
 Noxious snakes is the term.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,700
 So a smelly snake.

125
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,400
 Unless the word means something else that I don't know of.

126
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
 To this day, that door has never been open.

127
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
 Door B has never been open.

128
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,600
 And the legend is that only a cleric or a high level saint can open it.

129
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,100
 So break out your Final Fantasy VII saves and see if you...

130
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,400
 I don't know if there are saints in that.

131
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,800
 But anyways, break out your role-playing game.

132
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,400
 Whatever role-playing game you do, level up your saint.

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,400
 Try to open this door because they believe that it is sealed by magic.

134
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,000
 And unless the seal is broken, even though the door they believe can be open with modern technology,

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,700
 i.e. dynamite,

136
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:16,700
 they think that opening the door without removing the magic will cause great catastrophe to the region.

137
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,100
 Like a giant Neuravian Ocean emptying into the middle of India.

138
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,100
 I think it's interesting because the door has the images of snakes on it.

139
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,900
 And it had images of something else I couldn't pronounce.

140
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,400
 Again, thanks, Ponderall.

141
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,700
 And those images are associated in Indian mythology or Indian culture as being warning signs.

142
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,200
 I mentioned once before that there was a group of people who were trying to design a warning logo

143
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,900
 that could be interpreted 10 million years in the future.

144
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,600
 Because we want to bury all this nuclear waste in Nevada.

145
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,400
 But they don't want anyone stumbling across it, you know, long after we're gone and opening the doors

146
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,300
 and irradiating the entire western half of the United States.

147
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,000
 So they go, "What type of image can we come up with?"

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,100
 That millions of years from now people will not interpret as anything other than dangerous.

149
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,800
 A skull, a lot of times that represents religious.

150
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,900
 So if archaeologists in the future stumbled across a giant skull in the middle of a desert on a door

151
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
 they may not necessarily equate that with death.

152
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,000
 For the most part it hasn't been equated with death.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,500
 For a long time in human history, skulls meant rebirth or religion.

154
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,400
 But they're saying that this is a warning, do not open this door.

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
 I think that's really interesting because who knows what's behind it.

156
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,600
 Is it more gold? Diamonds? The size of an infant?

157
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,900
 Is it something, is it some magical portal to somewhere else?

158
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,100
 Is it a super weapon that was hidden there?

159
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,000
 Or is it just an empty room? We don't know.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,200
 And it's funny because the Indian government is in no hurry to figure it out.

161
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,500
 So that is the story of the temple I can't pronounce.

162
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,700
 Indiana Jones and the Temple I Can't Pronounce.

163
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:01,300
 You know what's so funny is that intriguing is the story is it delves a lot into Indian mythology

164
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,300
 and I just can't pronounce the words. And I'm not going to put you through that.

165
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,300
 So we're leaving India. We'll probably be back to India at some point

166
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,300
 because they do have a lot of cool mythology.

167
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,000
 It's just the language barrier. I just can't pronounce that stuff.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And I don't like to give foreign places nicknames like

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,900
 Padahamata Tapak Castle. We'll just call it Paddy. I don't like to do that.

170
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:31,600
 But anyways, so we're off. Now we're going from India and the legends involving that

171
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,400
 to Africa, modern day Africa. Now we're in the Congo.

172
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,900
 Now this is an interesting story because this just popped up in the news.

173
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,000
 They're having an Ebola outbreak again. It's not just any Ebola outbreak.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 This is the second biggest Ebola outbreak in history.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,600
 Now they've had them and it's been fairly restricted to villages.

176
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,000
 And they go, "Okay, that's not like a good thing." And I'm like, "Yay, just villages."

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,800
 But it could have been a lot, lot worse. And the problem is that we might be there now

178
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,800
 because they have this city. It's called Butembo in the Congo.

179
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,700
 And it has a population, it's a city. It has a population of over a million people.

180
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:18,100
 And Ebola has not hit a major city yet. And we're starting to see outbreaks in the suburbs

181
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,500
 and in outlying communities. Ebola, if you don't know, is incredibly contagious

182
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,400
 and has a kill rate between 50% and 90%.

183
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,900
 It can be transmitted through a drop, a drop of sweat or blood.

184
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,500
 So people riding on the subway that are sweaty.

185
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,700
 You just want to stay away from them anyways. But they're like, "Woohoo, shaking their head.

186
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,900
 Like a dog, it's flying everywhere." It's like Beethoven, but Ebola infected.

187
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,600
 And it can take up to nine days before you start to become symptomatic.

188
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,800
 So you can have it and spread it and not know it.

189
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,300
 And then you start pooping out blood. Basically, you liquefy from the inside out.

190
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
 That's what ends up killing you.

191
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,300
 You'll start to get like, some people get rashes, some people get bloodshot eyes.

192
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,900
 Some people, it starts off with confusion and things like that.

193
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,900
 But the end result that will kill you is massive blood loss.

194
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,500
 Your organs liquefy. And then you throw up and you poop out blood until you die.

195
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,100
 It's very brutal. I've seen some photos of people dying from it.

196
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,200
 They're alive. I saw a photo of a guy sitting in the middle of a street.

197
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,700
 He's just blood all on the ground underneath his butt.

198
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
 He's laying down. He's sitting.

199
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,100
 But you just see a puddle of blood because he's pooping out blood

200
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,000
 and he's reaching out for help.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,700
 And everyone else in the photo has given him like a 10-foot radius.

202
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
 Because he's dead. There's nothing you can do.

203
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,000
 And part of the problem is not only is Ebola highly contagious,

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,900
 but the burial rituals in the Congo and in other regions of this area,

205
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,800
 they require the people to clean the body, to wash the bodies off.

206
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 And if they're a very famous person, sometimes you'll lay on the body.

207
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,400
 You'll be like, "Oh, Elvis, such great music. Let me lay on your body."

208
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,900
 Which gives you Ebola.

209
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,400
 And then you die and then your loved ones wash your body, clean your body, things like that.

210
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,300
 I read an interesting article where the person says,

211
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,700
 "Imagine having a millennial old tradition and all of a sudden

212
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,100
 a couple guys show up in hazmat suits and say, 'Just throw it in a bag and burn it.'"

213
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,900
 And that's the problem they're having over in these regions.

214
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,600
 They've been having these burial practices for hundreds, hundreds of years.

215
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,300
 And now people are showing up in pretty much space suits saying,

216
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,700
 "No, can't say goodbye. Just throw it in a bag."

217
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,600
 That's it. Can't touch it.

218
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
 Now it's hitting a city.

219
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,900
 Like I said, it's only outskirts. It hasn't gotten to the main part of town.

220
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,700
 But it seems like it's only a matter of time.

221
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
 And here's the problem.

222
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:54,900
 Merrick, the group that makes the Ebola, it's an experimental Ebola vaccine.

223
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,700
 So they're not entirely for sure that it works.

224
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,600
 They're pretty sure that it works.

225
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 They give it to people and it seems to work,

226
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,600
 but they've only dealt with basic "minor outbreaks."

227
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,900
 The biggest outbreak was around 11,000 people.

228
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,400
 So they go, "Okay, well, let's stockpile 300,000 doses of this vaccine."

229
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,200
 It takes months to prepare.

230
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,800
 They go 300,000. That's a good starting point.

231
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:28,300
 But with over a million people in the city, it's not even half that can be vaccinated from this.

232
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:38,400
 You could have a city full of skyscrapers and restaurants and coffee shops and skate parks,

233
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,800
 a wash in blood by next summer.

234
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,100
 It would be like a zombie movie.

235
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,800
 And the weirdest part about this vaccine—

236
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,100
 and they don't know what they're going to do.

237
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,000
 Merrick has said, "We don't know if we can have enough vaccines ready to go."

238
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,700
 Another thing with this outbreak is people are coming down with Ebola

239
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,000
 and they don't know where they got it from.

240
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,900
 Normally, you would have one person go, "Well, yeah, I was holding hands with that dude."

241
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,500
 And that's how I got Ebola.

242
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 But now people are showing up and they're like, "Well, do you know anyone who died of Ebola?"

243
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,400
 And they're like, "No, I don't know anyone who died of Ebola."

244
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,200
 So it may already get spread in that droplet form.

245
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
 All it takes—I mean, this was the big controversy a couple of years ago—

246
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,500
 is for it takes nine days for someone to get on a plane and go to another country.

247
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,800
 But they don't have enough vaccines to inoculate an entire city.

248
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,000
 They don't know how some people are catching it, which is very worrying.

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,700
 But the vaccine—I remember reading about this a couple of years ago—

250
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,300
 the vaccine itself—so Merrick is a company.

251
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,000
 And a company's goal is to make profit.

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,100
 Companies tend to have secondary goals.

253
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,600
 Walmart's goal is to make profit.

254
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,900
 And Sam Walton's goal, at least—you can argue whether or not Walmart's still about it—

255
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:58,000
 but Sam Walton's goal was to give customers low-price items.

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,600
 That was—I mean, he wanted to make money and keep the company going.

257
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,200
 But his secondary goal was to allow people to buy stuff at the lowest price possible.

258
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
 That's an admirable goal.

259
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,200
 Merrick, their main goal is to make money, and their secondary goal is to help people.

260
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,700
 But when you come—and most corporations are like that—

261
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,100
 Amazon's like, "Hey, we want you to have access to all the entertainment you want to,

262
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,700
 but we also—our main goal is to make money."

263
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,500
 There's a little capitalism side note there.

264
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 Merrick said, "Listen, we can make this Ebola vaccine,

265
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,600
 but the truth of the matter is that Ebola is quite rare.

266
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,100
 So the amount of money that we put into making this vaccine, we have to recoup."

267
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,400
 Not just the research and development, but the making—producing the actual physical vaccine itself.

268
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,100
 It's quite rare. It'll take us forever to recoup a profit from making this.

269
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:52,200
 And then someone—some genius there, probably Max Brooks or George Romero, said,

270
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,800
 "You know what else is rare? That we have a vaccine for, that we can stockpile,

271
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 but it's so rare it doesn't really make it cost-effective for us to make all this vaccine for?

272
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,400
 And we can combine them together and they're like, "Yes, Mr. Romero, what's your suggestion?"

273
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,700
 And he goes, "Rabies. Rabies is a vaccine that is needed that we have,

274
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,900
 but it doesn't make sense for us to make a separate rabies vaccine.

275
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:24,000
 What if we took—this is 100% true—what if we took the rabies vaccine and the Ebola vaccine,

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,700
 combined them into a single vaccine so we can give it to either person?"

277
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,500
 And people are like, "Yay, clapping, having no—"

278
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,800
 You ever wonder why people in zombie movies act like they've never seen a zombie movie?

279
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,700
 Because people in our planet act like they've never seen a zombie movie.

280
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
 Why would you invent something?

281
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:50,900
 Because remember, a vaccine tends to have a element of the disease in the vaccine.

282
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,900
 That might not hold true across all vaccines, but like the flu vaccine, they're like,

283
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,600
 "Oh yeah, it has a little bit of the flu vaccine. You might get sick. You might find a little—"

284
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,300
 You're gonna give me rabies if I have Ebola?

285
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,500
 Or if I have rabies, you're gonna inject me with something that has Ebola in it?

286
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,900
 You're—you've basically created a crazy, blood-spewing monster

287
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,100
 who's just gonna run around spitting blood at everybody and doesn't care because he has rabies.

288
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,400
 Why would you combine those two?

289
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,500
 Why don't you combine Ebola and like, I don't know, anti-depression medicine

290
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,400
 or something that makes you sleepy?

291
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,800
 Anything else! I guess people who have depression don't want to be injected full of Ebola, but

292
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,700
 those are the two—those—ugh—that's like at the beginning of "I am Legend" the movie.

293
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,300
 They invent the cure for cancer and it turns everyone into a vampire.

294
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,700
 I don't know if I would take that vaccine.

295
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,300
 And I don't know if I would hang out with anybody who took that vaccine.

296
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:54,100
 Because again, you've now created a crazy, a 28 days later, rage-infected monster.

297
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,900
 No! Put something else in that vaccine, Merrick.

298
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:07,600
 But 300,000 doses of that rabies/Ebola vaccine is on its way to a major city in Africa.

299
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,200
 Okay, the last story we're gonna talk about—it's funny because I heard about the story when I was a kid

300
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,300
 because I've always been reading this weird stuff.

301
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:22,100
 And as I was researching this, I realized the version I heard as a kid was heavily edited.

302
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,100
 So we're going to France. We will take—well, hop in the Carpenter copter,

303
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
 because I want to get out of the Ebola city of Congo.

304
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,500
 We're gonna fly above just right—like they're—

305
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,800
 [makes a loud noise]

306
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,100
 They're like running towards a helicopter.

307
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,700
 Get on! Get on! Get on!

308
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,300
 Many guns are out of ammo.

309
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,900
 Get on!

310
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,000
 [makes a loud noise]

311
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,100
 That's not you making that noise. That's the zombies behind you.

312
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,600
 You hop into the helicopter—it's so funny.

313
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,400
 I get accused of racism all the time for this podcast.

314
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,900
 This isn't helping, but anyways—

315
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,400
 [makes a loud noise]

316
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,500
 They're chasing us down.

317
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 Jump in the helicopter.

318
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,800
 They're forming like a human pyramid to try to get us.

319
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,800
 [makes a loud noise]

320
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,400
 Take off.

321
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,900
 Just as we start to see the nuke coming towards the city.

322
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,100
 Anyways, we're gonna go to France.

323
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,600
 We're gonna go back in time so you won't have to worry about zombies.

324
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:35,700
 [makes a loud noise]

325
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,600
 Now, again, I had to talk about this during the India segment earlier.

326
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,900
 You should know by now that I can't pronounce my R's either,

327
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,000
 so if you don't know what I'm saying, he's a French guy,

328
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,400
 and his name is Thaure.

329
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,900
 Thaure.

330
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
 So anyways, Thaure—

331
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,000
 [sighs]

332
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,200
 Thaure—I don't know why I picked these stories to go all the same episode.

333
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
 Thaure is this French guy.

334
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,500
 We look at him and we're like, "That is a skinny man!"

335
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
 "That is a skinny man!"

336
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,000
 He is of normal height.

337
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,300
 Whatever that may be.

338
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,600
 He's 100 pounds.

339
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,900
 He looks to be 100 pounds.

340
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,200
 You're like, "Oh, man, you didn't eat something."

341
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,800
 100 pounds for being in your 20s is quite slender.

342
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,400
 That's when he lifts up his shirt and billows of loose skin just—

343
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
 [makes a loud noise]

344
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,300
 and like deflated balloon just kind of like sloped towards the ground.

345
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,700
 And you notice that even though he's only in his 20s, his face is super wrinkly.

346
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:34,700
 He looks like a 100-pound man whose skin is just melted jello.

347
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,900
 Now, Thaure was a medical freak.

348
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,100
 There's a few other people who have this condition, but Thaure is the most notable.

349
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,900
 When he was a kid, his appetite was insatiable.

350
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,300
 He couldn't stop eating.

351
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,400
 And eventually, he literally—

352
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,100
 not literally, but he ate them out of house and home.

353
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,900
 He didn't eat the house.

354
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,000
 He was like, "You know what?

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
 Actually, he would have.

356
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,500
 We'll get to that in a second."

357
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 He actually would have given the chance.

358
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,200
 And so his parents kicked him out because they're like,

359
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,100
 "Oh, we saw you eyeing the floorboards."

360
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,900
 They kicked him out because they couldn't afford to keep him.

361
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,700
 And he ends up joining like a bunch of circus freaks.

362
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,000
 And his show was, "Let me eat whatever you got in your pockets."

363
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 "Hey, hey you. What do you have in your pockets?"

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,100
 And he's like, "I don't know. Like a couple shillings."

365
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,900
 And he's like, "Well, that's weird. This is France.

366
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,700
 You should have francs."

367
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,400
 And he's like, "Oh, yes, that's what I meant, francs."

368
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,800
 So he'd eat the francs.

369
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,600
 And he goes, "What do you have?"

370
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,000
 And the person's like, "I have this potted plant in my purse."

371
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,200
 And he's like, "Give it to me."

372
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,500
 "Aah, he'd eat it."

373
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,100
 Now his jaw didn't just stand and he ate a whole pot.

374
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,900
 But he would eat cats.

375
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,100
 He'd be like, "Hey, hey, cat lady. Can I borrow one of those?"

376
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,800
 And she's like, "Uh, sure."

377
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,600
 And he's gonna pet it.

378
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,200
 And he's like, "Some pet it from the inside."

379
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
 He'd rip its stomach open and eat the guts.

380
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,800
 And then he would eat everything but the bones.

381
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 And then he'd throw up the fur and the skin.

382
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,200
 And then at that point, everyone kind of just applauded.

383
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,800
 At one point, he was doing this act and he got an obstruction in the stomach

384
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,400
 and the other circus performers had to take him to the doctor.

385
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,600
 And the doctor was like fixing him up.

386
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,800
 And he goes, "Hey, you know, I do this act."

387
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,400
 This is your story.

388
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,600
 He goes, "You know, I do this act where I can eat anything."

389
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,400
 The doctor's like, "Really?"

390
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,100
 He's like, "Hey, let me eat your gold watch."

391
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,300
 He couldn't stop eating stuff.

392
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,100
 And the doctor said, "If you ate my watch, I'm gonna cut you open and get it out."

393
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,200
 To which I imagined Terare, like, grabbed the collar of his shirt and went, "Gulp."

394
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,700
 But anyways, he couldn't stop eating stuff.

395
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,300
 Eventually, he joined the military, which considering that that life is so regimented,

396
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,800
 it seemed like a bizarre choice, but maybe just doing his civic duty.

397
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,400
 And he would eat all of his rations and then he would do chores around the camp

398
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,100
 to eat other people's rations.

399
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,600
 And then he started eating food out of the garbage.

400
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,500
 And that's nothing compared to what's coming.

401
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,000
 He started eating food out of the garbage.

402
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And the army was like, "Dude, seriously."

403
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,300
 And when he'd eat, like, all of his loose skin would inflate like a balloon.

404
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,500
 He could actually fill his body up with food.

405
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,700
 And then as it would dissolve, his skin would get super loose again.

406
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,800
 And finally, there was this dude at the camp, the commander, and he goes,

407
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,400
 "This guy's driving me nuts, but I have a plan."

408
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,400
 I'm gonna make him swallow little, like, wooden boxes with battle plans on them.

409
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,000
 And then he'll just walk across enemy lines.

410
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,600
 No one will notice him, 'cause he just looks like a normal dude.

411
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,800
 And then he'll poop out the plans to somebody else.

412
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,500
 And so they do a test.

413
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 They give him a little wooden box and put a piece of paper in it, and he swallows it.

414
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,300
 And then a couple days later, he poops it out, or a couple hours later, whatever,

415
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,400
 and poops it out, and the box was fine.

416
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,100
 And they're like, "Oh, this plan's gonna work."

417
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,600
 Now, let me tell you a little bit more about Tarare.

418
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,300
 This was his description.

419
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,200
 He had an abnormally wide mouth and near-invisible lips.

420
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,300
 Now, I don't think that meant they were like the invisible woman that you could see through me.

421
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,700
 I think they just meant that he had super, super thin lips.

422
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,800
 Like I said, his face was super wrinkly, his skin hung super low.

423
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,500
 His skin, like, if you touched him, it was hot.

424
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,800
 He was hot to the touch. It's probably a big part of his metabolism.

425
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,400
 And he was described, this is a quote,

426
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:06,000
 "He stunk to such a degree that he could not be endured within the distance of 20 paces."

427
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,100
 So just a super stink bag.

428
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
 You didn't want to be near him.

429
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,200
 And that was normal.

430
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,100
 When he ate, he smelled worse.

431
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,500
 He had constant diarrhea, constant diarrhea.

432
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,800
 And that gives a new angle to the story of them, like, waiting around for him to poop out the box.

433
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,400
 And then it's all, "Pffft!"

434
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,800
 Just like a huge puddle.

435
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,600
 And they're like, "Okay, let's get a private in here to dig through this stuff, 'cause I'm not."

436
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,900
 He had chronic diarrhea, and it was, and again, quote, "fedded beyond all conception."

437
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,200
 So they should add a poet in the room, 'cause you hear that phrase,

438
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
 they should send a poet to space.

439
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,000
 They should have had a poet.

440
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:53,600
 Beyond all conception, beyond what great ideas lay out in the universe they cannot use to describe the smell of his diarrhea.

441
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,800
 And I don't know, I don't know how this is possible.

442
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:05,500
 But they said that you could look at him and vapor, like, stink lines came out of his skin.

443
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,200
 You could see a visible vapor around him.

444
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,000
 They're just the stench.

445
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,100
 Now let's go back to that plan about using him as a spy.

446
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,500
 You want someone to walk across enemy lines.

447
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,600
 France was at war with pressure at this point.

448
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:27,400
 You pick a guy who has big, big, flabby cheeks, stinks from 20 meters away,

449
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,800
 has visible vapor lines coming off of him, and constantly has to stop to have diarrhea.

450
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,100
 Needless to say, the plan didn't really work.

451
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:41,100
 Eventually, when he went back, he's like, "He didn't want to do any more army stuff, so he volunteered to go to hospital."

452
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,400
 The doctors are like, "Oh my God, this is amazing. We can't wait to see how this dude works."

453
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,800
 They tried curing him.

454
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,100
 One of the cures was soft-boiled eggs.

455
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,700
 Let's give him as many soft-boiled eggs as we can.

456
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,900
 And he's like, "Go, go, go, go, go."

457
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,100
 Didn't work out too well.

458
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:04,100
 One of the things was they had a meal spread, a table spread for 15 laborers who were working to the hospital at that time.

459
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,500
 So they had all this food laid out, and they go, "Hmm."

460
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:13,500
 The doctors are like, "Hmm. I wonder what will happen if we give him food that is set aside for 15 able-bodied men."

461
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,300
 He ate it all. He ate it all.

462
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,500
 He complained about hunger all the time.

463
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,000
 If he wasn't eating, he was constantly exhausted.

464
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,100
 So it wasn't just like this circus freak, "Let me swallow anything."

465
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,800
 He was constantly hungry. He had to eat. That's why he was digging through the garbage.

466
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,700
 So they saw him eat all that food, and they're like, "Okay, okay, enough fun, guys. Let's go back to trying to cure him."

467
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,900
 And they would put him on these regulated diets.

468
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:40,000
 But the problem is, is that he wouldn't stick to them. He would break out of the hospital, or just walk out of the hospital at night.

469
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,700
 And there was a butcher shop that, you know, they throw all their scraps in the dump and the garbage behind the butcher shop.

470
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,800
 I imagine it's like, "The lady in the tramp. There's just a bunch of spaghetti back there."

471
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,600
 He would go through that, but so would stray dogs.

472
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,000
 So he had to fight stray dogs for food every night just to get some extra food.

473
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,800
 In this hospital, because we're in the 1700s, bloodletting was a thing. They had a bloodletting ward.

474
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,400
 "Hmm, you're sick. Let's take as much blood out of you as possible. That might cure you."

475
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,800
 He would drink their blood. He would go in there and he'd be like, "Gulp, gulp, gulp."

476
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:20,100
 And you can imagine like a nurse was walking through the hospital and saw like a silhouette crouched over with like a hose in his mouth.

477
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,400
 And she's like, "Tar-Rare, what are you doing out of your room?" And he's like, "Gulp."

478
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,400
 And then they caught him. No joke, because imagine having a hunger that's on the level of a heroin addiction.

479
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,800
 Like, you have to eat. You have to eat.

480
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,600
 They caught him in the morgue trying to eat corpses.

481
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,300
 And they're like, "Tar-Rare." No, at that point they were really concerned about.

482
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,800
 So the end of his hospital stay, the end of all the experiments ends like this.

483
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:53,700
 Tarare's in the hospital and he's probably sitting there and he has like an odd shaped lump in his stomach.

484
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,300
 I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's true, but okay, let me try and stick to the fact.

485
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,300
 The fact, okay, the fact of the story is...

486
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:09,300
 The fact of the story is Tarare is in the hospital and it was a fully functional hospital.

487
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:17,900
 So they had like the bloodletting ward and the morgue and other stuff going on there, including a maternity ward.

488
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,500
 Oh wait, this baby wouldn't be there because this baby was 14 months old, but they did have a maternity ward.

489
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,700
 So not the maternity ward because this baby's too old. This baby's graduated.

490
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,400
 The baby's there for some checkup. French measles. They want to make sure the baby doesn't have French measles.

491
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:41,100
 So, but one day the mom's like, "Here baby, 14 month old baby, I'm gonna set you down on this chair while I read this old timey wood carving magazine."

492
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:49,000
 She's like getting splinters reading this wood carving magazine and she turns back, "Baby's gone. Baby's gone."

493
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,700
 Now I don't know that exact sequence of events happened either.

494
00:27:52,700 --> 00:28:00,100
 The point is, is that Tarare was in a hospital and a 14 month old baby went completely missing.

495
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:06,100
 They never, ever found the kid and the fur- they didn't go, "Oh Tarare!"

496
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,900
 This time they're like, "That dude ate a baby. That guy straight up ate a baby."

497
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,100
 And he took off. He ran out. That's the end of that story.

498
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:22,600
 I was like, there has to be another answer. It has to be that they found the baby later, but from all accounts, he ate a living baby.

499
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,800
 Which isn't far from the other stuff he's done.

500
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:33,100
 We know he's eaten live cats and live dogs and he's tried eating humans, so I mean, babies kind of look like food.

501
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,000
 They look like little rolls. Now I would never eat a baby, but they look puffy.

502
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,300
 And so Tarare, as hungry as he is, he could just be like, "Ah, it'll probably taste like dinner rolls and marshmallows."

503
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,700
 I don't know. That's super disgusting, but anyways.

504
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,900
 Actually, you think they would have found the bones because he doesn't eat that.

505
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,800
 He runs out of the hospital. Eventually though, at age 26, died very, very young.

506
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:02,500
 He goes and he says, he goes to this other doctor and he's like, "Oh, hi, I'm Tarare. You might know me from the baby eating scandal."

507
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,200
 But I ate a gold fork a while ago and I think it's still in me and I'm super sick.

508
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,700
 Now the doctor is looking at this saggy, fetid, gross diarrhea monster.

509
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,600
 And he's thinking, you know, a guy who ate a gold fork, that's not the weirdest thing about you.

510
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
 But let's take a look.

511
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:27,500
 So he starts treating him and he goes, "No, you don't have... You may or may not have eaten a golden fork, but you have tuberculosis."

512
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,800
 Advanced tuberculosis.

513
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,100
 And Tarare's like, "No, trust me, dude, I ate a gold fork. It's in my stomach. It really hurts."

514
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,100
 I've eaten tons of stuff, but for some reason that's not sitting well with me.

515
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,700
 The fact that it's a four-pronged metal object, he eventually does die though.

516
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:47,900
 And in his last moments, like the last couple hours of his life, ten times the worst diarrhea.

517
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,200
 He was pooping out pus, pus and blood-filled diarrhea.

518
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,000
 And then he dies.

519
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,200
 A fitting way to end to a man who had diarrhea his entire life.

520
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,000
 He had to tie, he had to one-up it.

521
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,700
 And so one of the doctors who treated him at the baby-eating hospital came to this hospital because they called him up and they're like,

522
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,200
 "Hey, remember that baby-eating scandal?"

523
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, we have that guy here."

524
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
 He says he ate a gold fork.

525
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,900
 And you can imagine the doctor at the other hospital.

526
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:19,200
 By that time, the phone's already like hanging off the desk and he's in his jalopy to get to this hospital.

527
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
 Or a horse, because they didn't have cars back then.

528
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,400
 But he to get there, because he's like, "Dude, I need to find it.

529
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,500
 I want to find this guy because this guy was like a medical marvel."

530
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,400
 And he gets there and the body's just laying there and is super stinky.

531
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,500
 And none of the doctors want to do an autopsy.

532
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,000
 And the baby-eating hospital doctor says, "I'll do it.

533
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,400
 I need to find out what made this guy tick."

534
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,500
 So they cut him open.

535
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,900
 His throat cavity was so huge that if you opened his mouth, you could look down into his stomach.

536
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,800
 His body cavity was filled with pus.

537
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,600
 Like his liver was covered in pus and just like an ocean of mucus in there.

538
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,700
 And his stomach all over the inside of his stomach were ma-

539
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,600
 And his stomach was huge, by the way, like his actual stomach cavity.

540
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,300
 But all over the inside of his stomach were these massive, gross, disgusting tumors.

541
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,100
 I don't- It wasn't in the description. They were gross and disgusting.

542
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,300
 But I'm sure they were.

543
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,400
 I don't think that's a stretch of the imagination.

544
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,200
 And no golden fork.

545
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,500
 So the question is, did he really eat the golden fork? Probably.

546
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,600
 For whatever reason, because he's terrarium.

547
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:30,200
 But did he poop it out at some point or was his stomach acid so intense he can actually melt metal or gold?

548
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,900
 I guess gold is a metal, but that's the story of terrarium.

549
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,600
 Now, like I said, when I read the story when I was a kid, it was like,

550
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,700
 "There's this goofy guy named Terrare. He'd eat anything."

551
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,700
 He was a circus performer and he ate corks and screws.

552
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,800
 And once he even ate a cat.

553
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,100
 And then he turned the page and it's like about the two-headed wolf girl or something like that.

554
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
 Nothing about eating babies.

555
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,000
 Nothing about puss filled diarrhea.

556
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
 None of that stuff.

557
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,200
 But I remembered that story as a kid looking through like,

558
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,200
 Ripley's Believe It or Not or some crazy person like,

559
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,100
 "Crazy people in history book."

560
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,000
 They took out all the good stuff.

561
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,900
 That's why I found it for you guys on Dead Rabbit Radio.

562
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,700
 There we go.

563
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,300
 I liked that take. Took me four tries.

564
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,400
 But we got it.

565
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,000
 It takes a while to warm up on Mondays.

566
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,900
 It's weird because I have those two days where I don't do anything, but...

567
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:26,700
 I went and took a shower and I was like, "I gotta do it. It's my job. I gotta do it."

568
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,300
 But we had a good one. I really like this episode.

569
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,000
 Now. Now I like this episode.
