WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.600
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.600
 A series of strange letters leads us into the world of gang stalking.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 And then we take a look at a small race of cannibal humanoids

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 that live in the woods.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 They have a terrifying reputation, but their name is anything but terrifying.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 Today, we take a look at the melon heads on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 [music]

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 Hey, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 We got a lot to get through today.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 So we're going to go ahead and get started.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 Now, so the first story we're going to look at,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 the first way we're going to start off the first story,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 comes from the conspiracy iceberg.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 It's about middle tier in the conspiracy iceberg.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
 We got to go to Jolly Old England.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 So let's hop in the carpenter copter.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 It's fired up.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 It's me hitting switches.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 I always think it's amazing.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.600
 Like, when you look at a helicopter in real life,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 you just see like the circle, because the rotors are,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 but when you film a helicopter,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 sometimes the rotors look like they're moving real slow.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 It's kind of weird looking.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 But anyway, so we're in the carpenter copter.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 [humming]

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 We're flying over England right now.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 Now, it's funny because I always refer to England as like,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 it's just one big city, but that's because I don't know any better.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 We're in-- wait, no, England is a city.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 Wait, no, is England the country?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 England is a city.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 Anyways, I don't know what city this takes place in,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 so we're just going to hover over England until we see

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 a proper young gentleman go to retrieve his mail.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 This chap, this Jolly Old chap, his name is Trevor Silverwood.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600
 He's actually a member of parliament.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600
 So he's pretty high up in the government,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 equivalent of the US Senate.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
 So Trevor is out, sipping his tea,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 he's wiping little crumpet crumbs off of his tie.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600
 He's a very dapper man.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 He goes to his mailbox.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 We see him retrieve a letter.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600
 We're looking overhead.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600
 He doesn't look up.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 He doesn't hear the incredibly noisy and loud helicopter above him,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600
 but he gets a letter.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 He looks at it and we just see him kind of slump as he opens it up.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.600
 He knows what the letter is going to say.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600
 It's always a little crazy.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 It's always a little weird, and it is always correct.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 From 1969 to 1979,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 Trevor Silverwood would get letters delivered to him.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 He'd open it up and it would say,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 "Hey Trevor, you had a great day yesterday, didn't you?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.600
 I saw you walking down the street in your gray P-coat,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.600
 your black shoes.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.600
 You seemed like you were a man on a mission.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 Hope you had fun.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600
 See you again."

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 There was never a signature except for a little drawing of the saint,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.600
 a little stick man with a halo over his head.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.600
 It was a television show around the time.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600
 He would get,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 Trevor Silverwood would get letters explaining what he wore the previous day,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.600
 or in the past, because some of the letters take a while together,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.600
 but they would explain what he was wearing,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600
 what he was doing, who he was with.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.600
 These letters were postmarked from all over the world.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.600
 He would get a letter from India saying,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 "Nice shoes the other day.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600
 Look like you polished them.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 Look like you were really trying to set some sort of fashion trend, Mr. Silverwood."

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.600
 And of course, after the first couple of letters,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.600
 he ends up getting the police involved.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 They could never figure it out.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.600
 What they think was someone was spying on him in England,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.600
 and then they would mail the letter to an accomplice in another country

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600
 who would then mail it back.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 Sometimes the letters came from his neighborhood.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.600
 Not all the letters came from foreign countries,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 but they could never track down who it was.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 Now, this story was first told in this book called "Truly Bizarre,"

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.600
 which was published in 1979,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.600
 and they were stating he was still receiving the letters at the time the book was being published.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.600
 And this has always been kind of a quirky conspiracy.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.600
 And there was a forum where they were talking about the strange letters.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.600
 That's what it's known as, the strange letters,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600
 and that's how it's listed on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.600
 There was a forum talking about how crazy it was that no one could ever figure it out,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.600
 and in 2011, someone claiming to be Trevor Silverwood's son went onto the forum.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.600
 'Cause you know, you Google your dad, you Google your name.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 It's not bizarre to think that this guy would find it.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 And he said the story was absolutely true as well.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 He said that the story was true.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 My father did get these letters.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 He saved them, actually.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.600
 He saved them, and he told us a story about it,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.600
 and eventually they did peter out.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.600
 People on the forum asked him, "Can you take photos of the letters?"

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.600
 And he's like, "No, I don't feel comfortable doing that."

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.600
 So, may have been a lark, may have truly been his son,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.600
 but the stories were reported,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600
 and the police were involved in all these things, and it's a true story.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.600
 Now, that's that for that conspiracy.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.600
 But it's a lead-in to a topic that is kind of a mainstay of conspiracy theory,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600
 and that's the thing called gangstalking.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 Now, let me give you a brief overview of gangstalking.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.600
 Gangstalking is not a police investigation.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.600
 Gangstalking is not you owe money to the mob, and they're coming after you.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.600
 Gangstalking is not you're the witness of a crime and a street gang's getting you.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.600
 Gangstalking is this bizarre conspiracy belief.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 So, there are TIs, which are considered...

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.600
 Not the rapper, there are TIs which are considered targeted individuals,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.600
 and these people who are otherwise completely normal in the world

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.600
 are being stalked by some sort of shadowy government or Illuminati-esque organization.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.600
 So, you, if you were a targeted individual, you would walk outside,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.600
 and let's say that if you saw...

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.600
 Okay, let me put it this way.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.600
 If I walked out to my house and every day there was a Pacific power van outside my house,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.600
 the first thing I'm gonna think is, it must be having problems with the power lines,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.600
 but after three or four days, my personal thing is, I'm gonna think there's feds in there.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.600
 They're investigating someone, possibly me.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.600
 There's cops in that van.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.600
 But it's gonna take a while for me to come to that conclusion.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.600
 If you start seeing black SUVs with tinted windows driving through your street at the same time at night,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.600
 I'm gonna think that's some sort of drug running operation.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.600
 That's not what we're talking to. That's not...

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.600
 That's not where gangstalking...

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.600
 That's not where targeted individuals think gangstalking is.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.600
 Here's some ways you can tell, according to this young woman,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.600
 and everyone has their own way, but there's some key things.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.600
 This young woman wrote on a forum about gangstalking.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 This is the way she knows that she is being stalked by a shadowy organization.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.600
 Tell me if any of those things have happened to you, you might be gangstalked as well.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 You go to a store and it's crowded, and people get in your way.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.600
 You might be being gangstalked, according to her.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.600
 If you're at home, and let's say you're milling about in your yard, you're raking your leaves,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.600
 here's a way. This is a way to tell that you are a target of a shadowy organization.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.600
 People will mow their lawns, or weed-wack them, to annoy you with the noise.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.600
 See, they're trying to break you down.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.600
 Trying to break down the targeted individual.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.600
 They will chop or chainsaw their firewood. I have no idea where this woman's living.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.600
 I...

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 What neighborhood do you live in where people can both weed-wack mow their lawns and chop firewood?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 I guess something in the suburbs, but maybe she's living in the boonies or something like that?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.600
 Here's another thing. If your neighbor is "improving their home's facade,"

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.600
 you might be being gangstalked. See, the point is, is they're causing all this noise, I guess,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 to drive you nuts.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 Rev their car engine. If they yell at their animals or yell at each other,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.600
 or if it's dark out and they have flashlights.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.600
 These are all signs of people who are working for a shadowy organization that is targeting you.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.600
 And that's where the insanity comes from. These are all things that normally happen.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:24.600
 I live in an apartment complex downtown, and I will wake up sometimes to a loud lawnmower.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.600
 And I'm like, "Who is mo- What lawn is possibly being mowed right now?"

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.600
 Everyone has, like, a foot of lawn. Why am I waking up to-

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:41.600
 It's not because there's gangstalkers, it's because somebody decides their foot of grass is too high.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.600
 I've always thought mowing lawns was the biggest waste of time.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.600
 I honestly think that mowing lawns is a conspiracy.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.600
 I think that everyone was fine with their lawns until someone invented a lawnmower

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.600
 and then marketed it saying, "Your lawn is gross."

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600
 Just like no one had a problem with body odor until deodorant was made,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.600
 and then everyone was told that body odor was gross.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.600
 I think it's the same thing with lawnmowers. I do not think that people need to mow their lawns.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:17.600
 You can weed it? Fine. But actually, mowing a lawn, I think it is the industrial lawnmower complex.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.600
 I do not believe that mowing the lawn is needed at all.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.600
 No one ever thought about it until lawnmower was invented.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:31.600
 Anyways, that's my rant. That's according to this woman. That's the level of paranoia we're talking about.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.600
 There's a famous video, a gangstalking video, of a woman walking up to a mailman and jumping into-

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.600
 Not like she- You know how mail in America, mail vans have an open door that the mail person can get in and out?

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.600
 She basically forces her camera through the door and says, "Quit following me!"

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.600
 And the guy's like, "What?" She's like, "Quit following me!" Because she sees him all the time,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.600
 because he's delivering the mail? She thinks that she's being stalked by him.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.600
 This woman writes a letter to her. Imagine you get this letter from a family member.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.600
 Imagine you get this letter from a family member. I'm not going to yell at it even though it's in all caps.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.600
 But you get this letter from- This is your strange letter you get for the day.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:21.600
 The same people who leave wet baby wipes in my car and leave dead tissue-wrapped spiders in my toilet?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.600
 What? So she's thinking these gangstalkers are leaving-

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:33.600
 I don't- Listen, I don't know how she's getting wet baby napkins in her car or wrapped spiders in a toilet.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.600
 But I don't think it's the government. And I don't think it's some shadowy organization.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.600
 But she does. Why? Why would they do that?

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.600
 Okay, and loosen my doorknobs and dresser poles. I'm glad she basically lives in Kevin McAllister's house.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.600
 Her whole house is basically booby trapped at this point.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.600
 The same people who change my porch light? That's kind of nice.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.600
 Your porch light burns out and the government secretly changes it for you.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 And break the leg off my toaster oven? What? First off, who uses those? Secondly, kind of dangerous.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.600
 Like, if you're gonna sabotage someone's house, you can do something more than that.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.600
 But again, that's just normal stuff that happens. But I guess she came in, her toaster oven was broken,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.600
 and she opened it up and a bunch of spiders popped out of it. I don't know.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.600
 It is the people who show up in the middle of nowhere when I walk the dog.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.600
 The people who sit in their cars or stand in front of my house with strange devices in their hands,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.600
 probably cell phones, or unusually heavy-looking bags.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.600
 Okay, maybe there's smaller gangstalkers in there? I don't know.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.600
 It's the same people who drive the wrong way down one-way streets where I'm working,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.600
 and the same people who drive down the cul-de-sac I'm working in just to turn around and drive back by.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.600
 First off, if these guys are sneaky enough to sneak in your house, kill the spider,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.600
 actually, that sounds very nice. If I walked into my house and all the spiders in my house were dead,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.600
 and in my toilet, I would think the gangstalkers, I would be like, "Thank you."

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.600
 Oh, and the porch light. Thank you for changing that as well.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.600
 Driving down the wrong side of the street, that's either idiot drivers,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 or, and driving in the cul-de-sacs are made to drive down and turn around.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.600
 So, imagine getting that letter. Imagine getting that letter,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.600
 and knowing that this person who is your loved one is completely bonkers at this point.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:28.600
 Because they're- you- yes, it would be bizarre if I came home and every spider in my house was dead flowing in my toilet.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.600
 That would be really weird. And I would think- obviously, I would think someone must have broken into my house,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.600
 but then I would- I would be more concerned if someone broke into my house

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.600
 and was installing, like, listening devices and things like that.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.600
 Not killing my bugs. That- what on here is unhelpful? Yes.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.600
 What- leave what baby wipes in my car. That's pretty gross.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.600
 And loosening my door knobs and dresser poles. That's actually kind of funny.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.600
 Like, that's something that I would do to my friend.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:03.600
 But this is just a small- a little small window into how- and it's kind of sad.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.600
 I'm making fun of it, but it's kind of sad, because this is how targeted individuals live their entire life.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:17.600
 Really. And this is probably one of the fastest growing conspiracy theories that I've seen in my time-

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.600
 probably in the past 10 years. I've seen gangstalking explode in popularity.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:30.600
 I think it makes the victim feel important. It makes the victim feel like they have a bit of control

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 because they have this hidden knowledge they can see the patterns no one else can.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.600
 But the reason why it's exploding is because the internet.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.600
 It used to just be one paranoid person on one street who would come home,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:48.600
 find a McDonald's rapper laying by their car, and think, "I don't need a McDonald's.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 How did this rapper get next to my car? A spy must have put it here."

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.600
 And yeah, it would just be like, "Oh, that's crazy Archie. Crazy Archie living in the streets,

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.600
 always running around talking about door knobs and dead spiders."

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.600
 But now Crazy Archie can go online and meet people from all over the world

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 who are finding these inconsequential clues and they're building their own delusional web.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.600
 Massive amounts of people believe they are targeted individuals.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.600
 This to me is a bigger threat than people who believe in Flat Earth.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.600
 100%. People can have all sorts of loony scientific conspiracy theories that they want.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.600
 This one, someone believes in Flat Earth, it doesn't matter. They still go to work and it's not a big deal.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.600
 They pay their taxes, they go out and have a good time, they have friends, stuff like that.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.600
 They just have one wacky conspiracy theory.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:48.600
 People who believe in this believe that the world is their enemy and they may see you as their enemy as well.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.600
 We'll go a little bit more into gangstalking in a future episode

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.600
 because I have found people who are dedicated to taking the fight to the gangstalkers.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.600
 We've had at least one mass shooting connected to gangstalking already.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:08.600
 This is a serious problem, it's only going to get worse because people are always going to find dead spiders,

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:14.600
 people are always going to find busted light bulbs, people are always going to find McDonald wrappers by their car.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:22.600
 And it's just a matter of time before these people in mass start really feeling like they only have one way out of this situation.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.600
 Let's go ahead and move on to a topic that's a little more lighthearted.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:35.600
 It does involve cannibalism, it does involve mutants, but it's still a little more lighthearted than just mass psychosis.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:43.600
 And what we're going to be talking about right now is the story of an interesting little cryptid known as the Melonhead.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 So who are the Melonheads? I just love that name, the Melonheads.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.600
 Now it's a very evocative phrase.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:57.600
 Bigfoot, the name tells you right there, has Bigfoot. Or people can think of the creatures actually a Bigfoot.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.600
 There are some cryptids, the name is just perfect.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.600
 Bigfoot, Shadow People, Bloody Mary, Melonhead.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.600
 You go right there, the dude must have a head shaped like a melon and you're 100% correct, but these guys are even better than that.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.600
 Not only do they have big old heads, they got tiny little bodies.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.600
 They got like baby bodies, big old Melonhead.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.600
 And you think, there's always, I have this thing, it's called, I call it the Chucky Conundrum.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.600
 Where you try to do that new Chucky movie looks amazing by the way, that new, oh man that trailer looks great, but.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.600
 So the Chucky Conundrum.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.600
 Is there a point where a killer becomes so timey that it doesn't become threatening?

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.600
 Chucky Scary? Like I've never been scared of Chucky, but the idea of Chucky Scary.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:49.600
 The fetish doll from that old movie trilogy of terror, absolutely terrified me for like decades.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.600
 Very, very scary, that thing's only like a foot tall.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:17:04.600
 Would you rather be chased by a cannibalistic dwarf with a baby body and a big old Melonhead, or an adult sized serial, oh I guess they're both bad, but.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:13.600
 Is it scary because it's tiny? And I think there might be a point where it's not, where it's too tiny, maybe like microscopic Chucky wouldn't be scary.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.600
 But there are a lot of people who go, "Ah Chucky doesn't scare me, I just kick him over."

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:22.600
 I think, let's get into the Melonheads and then we'll go more into combat strategy.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:31.600
 The Melonheads are a cryptid/urban legend that's mostly in the states of Connecticut, Michigan, and Ohio.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.600
 It's a rural story, or suburban story of these creatures.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:43.600
 And it's interesting because we're going to look at three different urban legends, and some of the details are the same, some of the details are different,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:52.600
 and that makes me think one, there's either was based on some sort of truth, or some kids who used to live in Connecticut ended up moving to Michigan,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.600
 and then later told their kids in Ohio, like that's also going to be how it's spread.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.600
 Oh, and I should say this before I get into the gruesome stories that are followed.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.600
 Melonhead is also a term for a fan of the Los Angeles Rams, I found that out.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.600
 We're not talking about them, they may eat people, they may have tiny baby bodies, I don't know, I don't watch sports.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.600
 Connecticut, the year is 1960.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.600
 You got like a fog rolling through the city.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:26.600
 In other parts of the country, people are wearing bell bottoms, people are protesting the Vietnam War, did that start yet?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.600
 1960, they're protesting a war because they think something's going to happen.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:36.600
 Everyone's just grooving, people are practicing their kung fu fighting for when they might have to start moving as fast as lightning,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:44.600
 but in Connecticut in 1960, on a dark stormy night, there is an asylum for the criminally insane.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:50.600
 A bunch of inmates are trapped in there rattling their chains.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:19:02.600
 Doctors walking through the darkened halls, oh man, these sane people, they're driving me nuts, why did I take this job?

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:08.600
 But you know, you got to make a living, right? Everyone's like, yeah, I got to make a living.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:18.600
 Lightening strikes, somehow, some reason, luck or curse, a fire breaks out in the insane asylum.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.600
 Doctors like, ah, ah, ah, ah, actually I don't know if he burned to death, but he doesn't get mentioned anymore.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.600
 However, 10 to 20 inmates escape.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.600
 Let's break out boys, let's go.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:40.600
 They go into the surrounding forest around this asylum for the criminally insane.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.600
 They're out there and they go, oh no, we're insane, we don't have any survival skills.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.600
 So then they begin eating people for food, not just for fun, maybe a little bit fun.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:57.600
 And because they're out in the middle of nowhere and they're insane and they're cannibals and tinder doesn't exist yet,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:08.600
 they begin to interbreed and their babies are born with hydrocephalus, hydrocephalus, which is basically water on the brain.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:15.600
 When you're a little baby and you get it, your brain, your skull actually gets distended and then you look like you have a melon head.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.600
 You look like you have a big old head.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:23.600
 So the idea is that they were interbreeding with each other, they were inbreeding with each other, the crazy people were inbreeding with each other.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:31.600
 Their babies were deformed with these melon heads and to this day, the babies are still running around, jumping out of the woods, eating people.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:42.600
 Or the other version of the Connecticut story is there was a family from the colonial era that was accused of witchcraft, ran into the woods, started banging each other,

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600
 and their babies had melon heads.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.600
 That story, both stories are kind of ridiculous, but that story actually makes more sense because that would give,

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.600
 you just can't bang your sister and have a mutant baby.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:59.600
 It doesn't, it can, but it generally tends to happen the farther, like, you bang your sister and you have a baby,

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:05.600
 and then one of you, like, bangs the baby when it grows up and then that's the mutant, that's the mutant baby.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:11.600
 So it's not like you would just break out of jail, inbreed with the inmate who was next to you from the insane asylum.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:16.600
 Like, it would take a couple generations for you to start to produce mutated babies.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.600
 But anyways, that's the Connecticut version of the story.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.600
 Now we're going to go to Michigan. Here's the Michigan version of the story.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.600
 Insane Asylum. That's a common theme with this story.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:33.600
 And I think it's because insane asylums tend to be scary, because they're basically just buildings full of crazy people,

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.600
 but an insane asylum inside the Felt Mansion.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.600
 Now Felt Mansion is this giant building.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.600
 It looks like Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. It's this beautiful building.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.600
 It was founded by this guy named Dorfelt, which is kind of a dope name.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.600
 Dorfelt's successful businessman, very well known, very well liked in the area.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:02.600
 He was an inventor, and now all the only thing the Felt Mansion is associated with is really, is melon heads.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:12.600
 Like, all of his life's work gone into building his business, and now his house is the headquarters of cannibalistic children.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:19.600
 So, but he was long dead. The Felt Mansion ended up turning into insane asylum, where there was an evil doctor there,

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.600
 who was, this guy wasn't just walking down the hallway saying how much he hated his job.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:29.600
 He actually kind of liked his job, because it gave him an opportunity to abuse and torture the inmates.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.600
 He was just having fun. He loved showing up at work. He's like, "Oh dude, I can't wait to go to work.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.600
 Man, I got all these new tools I'm going to use to abuse these people."

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.600
 Woo! His wife's like, "What? Why are you talking about?"

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.600
 He's like, "Oh, nothing, honey." He gets, the doctor gets in his car.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.600
 I don't know why I'm building up the backstory. The point is, the doctor works at the hospital in insane asylum.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.600
 He's torturing these people. They finally get tired of being tortured. They attack him.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.600
 They rip him to pieces and hide different pieces of his body all over Felt Mansion.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:04.600
 Then the little people, they're not little yet, the insane asylum people, again, escape from the insane asylum,

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:11.600
 and hide in the local cave system. Now, they also jump out and eat you, the Mellonheads.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.600
 And people have said that if you break into Felt Mansion, you can see the ghost of Mellonheads

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:23.600
 and see the murder of the doctor reenacted. That story's a little bizarre, because if the Mellonheads are running around in the forest,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.600
 I don't know why their ghosts are also in the mansion, but that's the story from Michigan.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:37.600
 Now we're going to Ohio, which was really the story that I was like. Someone heard, someone used to live in Connecticut

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.600
 and then moved to Michigan and thought, "You know what? I'm moving to Ohio. I'm going to add my own spin.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.600
 I'm going to give the Mellonhead story a dark reimagining."

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:52.600
 We're in Ohio. We're specifically in the Cleveland suburb of Kirtland. Kirtland.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.600
 If anyone's from Kirtland, I'm sure they know about this. And this is why I think this story is definitely,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:05.600
 this story was crafted by someone who is a mwah connoisseur of the Mellonhead legend.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:14.600
 In the suburb of Kirtland, there is a mansion in the San asylum, but it was like a hidden in San asylum.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:22.600
 It's like it was a normal house in the basement. This guy kept prisoners. Kept these prisoners, right?

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:32.600
 Now his name was Dr. Crow, but he went by another name. He went by the name Dr. Mellonhead.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:40.600
 So I don't know if his name was like James Mellonhead. And that was like his family's name.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:45.600
 He comes from a long line of Mellonheads. And that's how they got the name Mellonhead.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.600
 But again, that's what I'm saying. It's almost like a gritty reboot. Like they had to explain.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.600
 This is his Han Solo, how Han Solo got his name. This is that of Urban Legends.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.600
 This is how the Mellonheads got their name, because they are actually the byproduct of Dr. Mellonhead.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:07.600
 So Dr. Mellonhead worked with kids with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.600
 So he was basically saying, "I will take care of your baby."

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.600
 "Oh, your baby has water on the brain and their skull is all big."

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.600
 "I will take care of them." And the parents are like, "Well, thank you because we can."

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.600
 And you're a doctor. "Thank you, Dr. Mellonhead." And he's like, "Uh, yes. Dr. Mellonhead, MD."

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:31.600
 Anyways, so Dr. Mellonhead goes to work. But what he does is he doesn't treat the baby.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.600
 This is this is this Urban Legend. I'm not making this up.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:42.600
 Dr. Mellonhead does not treat the babies. He instead wonders, "What would happen if I inject more liquid into their brain?"

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:51.600
 So he begins to inject fluid into these babies' brains, making their heads even more melon-like.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:26:00.600
 I'm not a scientist, but if a child is suffering from a horrible disfigurement, I don't think the answer is.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.600
 The question should not be, "I wonder what will happen if I make them more disfigured?"

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:15.600
 Because you know the answer to that. They will become more disfigured. But apparently Dr. Mellonhead really was a fan of water on the brain.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:21.600
 He began injecting these kids, these babies, with more liquid.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.600
 If I was six years old and I heard the story of Bloody Mary, which I did, totally terrified me.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.600
 If I was six years old and my older brother tried telling me this version of the Mellonhead story,

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.600
 I would probably have become a skeptic on the spot, because the story is just so ridiculous.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:46.600
 Injects them with more liquid. Eventually, though, these mutated Mellonheads, these even more Mellony than their brothers in Connecticut and Michigan,

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.600
 these are the super Mellonheads, they also end up killing the doctor.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.600
 But these Mellonheads, again, gritty reboot, they run into the forest.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.600
 [makes gritty sounds]

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.600
 Now, scamper off. Big Mellonheads bouncing along.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:10.600
 These ones are also cannibals, but that's not good enough for Ohio. Cannibalism is so Michigan.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.600
 These ones specifically enjoy the taste of babies.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.600
 So, you know, like, put your baby down.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:28.600
 [mimics baby singing]

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.600
 And from the closet, you see, like, a pair of yellow eyes.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.600
 The mom's swaddling the baby. Whatever that word means!

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.600
 Wraps it up in a blanket. I think that's what it means.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.600
 Kisses the baby on the head, leaves the room.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:50.600
 Closet door slowly pushed open. It doesn't use its hand, it just slowly leans its head forward.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:56.600
 The Mellonhead pushes against the door. Luckily, the doorknob is loose because a gangstalker was in there,

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.600
 so it moves silently out of the closet.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.600
 [mimics baby singing]

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.600
 Towards the baby's crib.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:12.600
 Oh, and also in Ohio, the version of the story, this baby might actually be safe because the Mellonheads

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:19.600
 have terrible vision because of all the extra liquid in their brain, so they can't, if you wear red or black,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.600
 they won't attack you because they can't see you, but if you wear white, they'll attack you.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.600
 So, moral of the story is, don't put your baby in white clothes.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.600
 You shouldn't do that anyways, because your baby's gonna be totally messy, it's gonna make stains everywhere.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.600
 But also because the Mellonheads will get them.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.600
 So, this is the interesting thing about the Mellonhead story.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:45.600
 Felt Mansion was never an insane asylum. They've never been able to track down, so that part of the story we know is false.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:51.600
 The asylum for the criminal insane that burnt down in Connecticut, that may or may not have happened at some point,

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.600
 but I couldn't find a name for any insane asylum there.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:04.600
 There were stories that Dr. Crow did not go by the name Dr. Mellonhead, but did perform illegal abortions in the area,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.600
 but that is also probably a retcon, urban legend type of thing.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:13.600
 There's a bridge in that area they call Cry Baby Bridge, because apparently you can hear babies crying underneath it,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:19.600
 and that's either because Mellonheads are eating babies and throwing their bodies into the bridge,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.600
 under the bridge, not into it, you're driving by, you're driving over the overpass and a baby comes flying at you,

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.600
 or that he was dumping the bodies of aborted babies there.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.600
 Here's the thing, I don't think the Mellonheads exist.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.600
 I think, and I'm not going to go into this whole thing like, because we think they exist, they exist,

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:44.600
 I think this is an interesting idea of an urban legend that there probably was a kid with a horrible disfigured head

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:50.600
 in one of these areas at some point, just statistically, and this rumor started.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:30:00.600
 That's fairly likely, and I think it's interesting how it's fairly in this geographical region.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.600
 You don't have stories about Mellonheads in California, you don't have stories about Mellonheads in New York.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:12.600
 Well, you do have them in California, they're the Los Angeles Ram fans, but it's not like Bloody Mary where it's a universal urban legend.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.600
 The Mellonheads is really restricted to these areas.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:22.600
 These areas are one of the creepiest areas really in America, because it's the suburbs bordered by forests,

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.600
 is generally where these creatures exist.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:33.600
 They're areas that are fairly well traveled, but not civilized, and I think growing up, that's always a scary thing,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.600
 because you have a perfectly manicured neighborhood, or maybe even just like a trailer park,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.600
 but then you have a place where you're totally familiar with all the sights and the sounds and the people there,

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:53.600
 and then bordering that is a forest full of creatures and wonder and mystery and darkness and weird noise that you don't understand.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.600
 And I think that's why urban legends like this are so catchy.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:04.600
 It's this idea of the familiar budding up against the unfamiliar and the alien.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:12.600
 So if in an environment like that, added with someone telling you once that they went to school with someone with a Mellonhead,

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.600
 Dr. Mellonhead, they knew him in elementary school, these stories get mixed up,

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:26.600
 and again, I think it's most likely that kids from one state made up the story or heard the story from their uncles or whatever,

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.600
 and when they began moving or changing high schools and things like that, the story spread.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:37.600
 It changed because you had a new group of people to entertain, but the key component stayed.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.600
 Tiny little cannibals with Mellonheads is really the key component in it.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:49.600
 But that all being said, that all being said of where I think the Mellonhead legend came from,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.600
 we can go even farther back, a couple states away.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:03.600
 But in the state of Idaho, there was an old Native American legend of these things called the Auehi Mountain Dwarves.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:09.600
 The Auehi Mountains is a physical place, but there is an old legend of these two feet tall creatures

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.600
 that specifically fed on children.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:19.600
 Is it possible that a subset of a creature like that, of a cryptid like that, still exist today?

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:25.600
 We're in the realm of the mystical, these guys had tails that would wrap around their body to give them some sort of body armor,

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.600
 and they were quite cunning and cruel, but if we accept things like Bigfoot, this is really no different.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:38.600
 So we have a little bit of urban legend, a little bit of Native American tales, literally.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.600
 Haha, that wasn't intended, but where is the truth in that?

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.600
 Were these stories just completely made up by a drunk uncle one night?

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:54.600
 Was there really a Dr. Mellonhead who was performing obscene experiments on the bodies of babies?

00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:04.600
 Was there a race of cannibalistic dwarves that once prowled the mountainsides and spilled out and moved into other parts of the country?

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.600
 Who knows? Who knows?

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:14.600
 But, if you do have a child, make sure you check the closet and look under the bed.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:21.600
 Make sure the window's locked before you kiss them goodnight and shut the light off tonight.
