1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,240
 roads, streets, lanes, alleys. You may know these as places to walk, but in the world

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,400
 of the paranormal, they mean so much more than that. First off, we're gonna take a

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,320
 look at the story of a woman who's walking through Russia. Now that's not

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,960
 abnormal, people do it all the time, but this woman is weird. She shouldn't be

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,800
 doing that. And then we take a look at a man who's chasing a sister's

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,040
 witch stories of people walking. Hold on, let me get through the intro. And then we

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,000
 take a look at the story of an old farm out in the middle of nowhere. They're

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,640
 having a good old time in the Hootenanny until a stranger walks up to the house.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,560
 And then we take a look at a bizarre musical mystery. When a folk singer goes

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:03,420
 missing, people think suicide, people think the mob, but to this day his fans

11
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,920
 proclaim he was taken by the aliens today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,920
 [music]

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,320
 Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,120
 This episode is actually being recorded in just minutes. After yesterday's episode,

16
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,080
 because I'm getting ready to wrestle a hog and I want to be in fighting shape,

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,600
 and I want to have all my episodes recorded. In case I get horribly injured, I

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,520
 just have to edit them. The recording process is the most problematic part of

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,240
 it, because it's where things can go wrong. The performance can be bad, the

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,080
 mic can be bad. I can run out of things to say all sorts of stuff. So this is the

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,200
 technically the hardest part. Once this part's done, I can kind of just hit

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,440
 buttons and edit and then interact with you guys. And speaking of interacting

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,960
 with you guys, let me give a shout out, starting off right now, to our legacy

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,040
 Patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command flying Frisbees.

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,760
 Frisbees everywhere, that's what he's into, I guess. Paul Martinez, he's hovering on a Frisbee as

26
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,240
 he's throwing Frisbees around at us. He's playing a little bit of that Frosh Paul.

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,160
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot's episode. If you guys hate Frisbee

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,320
 Cough or you guys can't spread the Patreon, that's fine too. Just helps

29
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,240
 spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot. You'll also see

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,680
 that it is. Fan Art Friday, and today's selection for Fan Art Friday, is from

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,840
 Super Awesome Robot. So give everyone a robot clap for the Super Awesome Robot.

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,520
 Thank you so much for Fan Art Friday. So Paul is now wearing a full-on Tron

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,040
 Legacy outfit. He's now throwing data discs around. It's super cool. I now have

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,760
 on my Tron Legacy outfit, I'm Renzler. But after him Cosplaying is one of the

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,720
 most underrated sci-fi films. Let's go ahead Paul. I'm gonna toss you the keys

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,840
 to the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,480
 headed out to Siberia. We were actually just in Russia yesterday. So Paul is

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,520
 flying us out in the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're headed out to Siberia. The year is

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,600
 2017. And we're headed out to a place called the Road of Bones. No, it's not

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,760
 your big brother's D&D supplemental manual from 1983. This is an actual place.

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,360
 It was called that because it was built by prison labor during Soviet Russia and

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,720
 they basically were like, "You prisoners, we don't care what happens to you." In the

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,220
 construction of this road in Siberia, they estimate between 250,000 to 1

44
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,120
 million people died building this road, or as it's known in Soviet Russia,

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,680
 Tuesday. When you were building this road and you died, you basically fell down on

46
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,560
 the ground, which tends to happen when you die, right? But the soil was too frozen

47
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,320
 to bury you. Plus, they don't have time. You're building this road, you got

48
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,200
 deadlines to meet. Get it? Deadlines? Because everyone's dying?

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,840
 Maybe I should have taken more of a break between episodes. It's called the

50
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,960
 Road of Bones because for a while there were bones littering the highway. The

51
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,440
 government has now apologized for that whole program, but that was the case.

52
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,960
 That's why they called it the Road of Bones. Now it's known as officially the

53
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,640
 Kolyema Federal Highway. In 2017, a woman is sighted walking down the road.

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,840
 Again, not unusual. People are allowed to walk down the roads all over the place,

55
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,480
 but truck drivers are driving by. See a girl walking on the side of the road.

56
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:31,440
 Cars driving by. Girls walking by. Truck drivers are like doing their routes

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,420
 coming back the other way. She's still walking. "Breaker, breaker, do you see that

58
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,880
 young lady walking on the side of the road? Spooky bear? Do you see that?" "Oh yes,

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,160
 pile of bones, pile of bones. I see that. I'm coming up here." This woman is sighted

60
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,720
 on this road making a 1200 mile walk. She's sighted between Yaksduk and

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,840
 Magadan. Apparently she has made this 1200 mile walk multiple times because

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,320
 she's been seen all along the length of it multiple times. So you're like, "Jason,

63
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,360
 is this a phantom? Did she get in the backseat of Smokey Bear's big rig?"

64
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,560
 And then he takes her to the prom and then they get there and the backseat's

65
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,800
 empty. Nothing but a wet raincoat? No. There's a photo of this woman. Not a blurry

66
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,680
 photo late at night. That's the jump scare photo. There's a photo of this woman

67
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
 walking on the street. It is a real woman that has been documented. The police

68
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,640
 have actually talked to this woman. "What are you doing walking?" It's a free country,

69
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,920
 isn't it? And their eyes shift from side to side. They're like, "Yeah, kind of. Nowadays."

70
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,840
 50 years ago it wasn't. She's like, "Yeah, bug her off." Truck drivers have stopped.

71
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,960
 "Hey, you need a ride?" She doesn't engage with anybody. She'll answer questions for

72
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,880
 the police because you kind of have to, but she just keeps walking. The police go,

73
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,440
 "She's not breaking any laws. You are allowed to walk down the street." People who

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,480
 have like, "Hey, miss. You need a ride? You need a ride?" Eventually they think

75
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,920
 she's mentally ill. They'll grab her. She freaks out. She starts screaming

76
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,520
 incoherently. "You got to run. You get in your car. Now she's in your backseat with

77
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,080
 a wet coat. She's strangling you with it." She's not equipped for winter travel.

78
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,480
 See, if you saw someone in a big park with a sled and a bunch of snow dogs, you'd be,

79
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,600
 "Oh, that's fine. It's a little weird. It's a little weird. It's like holding up traffic."

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,720
 But whatever. But she's walking. She's wearing, they said she's wearing a white

81
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,120
 jacket and blue jeans. And then she has like, on like a coat. Not like a big old

82
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:33,240
 GI Joe winter soldier coat. Just a coat. She's never seen in a populated area. And

83
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,040
 oddly enough, no one has ever seen her eat. Which I'm sure she's like going off

84
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,880
 into the bushes eating berries and stuff like that. Squirrels. She's grabbing the

85
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,640
 rogue squirrel and taking a bite out of it. Trucks and cars are seeing her walk all

86
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,240
 this time. They've never seen her get to a destination. They've never seen her

87
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,440
 kick her feet up at a McDonald's. They have no idea why she's doing this walk.

88
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,680
 She's just seen walking. She was first reported in 2017. The last report I

89
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,040
 could find was in April of 2018. So it had at least a year, if not more. She may

90
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,240
 still be doing it now. It's just old news over there. They're like, "Woman walks."

91
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
 It's super great news the first time. And now people are like, "Yeah." I got that from

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,360
 the 40 and map too. That's a really cool resource. That's gonna be in the show

93
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,680
 notes. You guys can look around. See if you find anything odd. But it's real. This

94
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,960
 isn't a phantom. This isn't the ghost of a girl trying to get home

95
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,120
 after a drunk driving accident. This is a real woman walking 1200 miles multiple

96
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,040
 times through Siberia photographed and nobody knows why. Obviously it's

97
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,080
 probably some sort of mental illness, but it's just a weird story and it's one

98
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,000
 of those things that no one will ever know the answer for. We did that one story

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,960
 a long time ago about the guy in France who was just walking through the bushes

100
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,560
 dressed in a gas mask and everyone is trying to follow him around and then

101
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,000
 the newspaper published a story on him and he took all of his gear off and left

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,280
 it on a rock and said, "Now I'm dead." So we do have and we covered the flout, the

103
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,960
 floutest, the guy who was playing the recorder in Brazil. We do have these

104
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,000
 weird people kind of hanging out. I met Joe Trombone in San Leandro. He's one of

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,920
 the greats. The rapping crazy man who'd get on a bus and rap for you. I think

106
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,880
 these people are always interesting when we run into these anomalies of humankind,

107
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,960
 people who are outside the edges, but not in like an edgy way. Not like an annoying

108
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,440
 way. Not like the person who's playing my chemical romance at top volume while

109
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,160
 you're trying to talk to the girl at the party. Just like in a cool weird way.

110
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,120
 But this woman might also be into my chemical romance, so stay away. Stay away.

111
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,680
 If she gets in your vaccine, she reaches for your radio. Be prepared for Black

112
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,040
 Parade for 1200 miles. Listen to that album for 1200 miles. Paul, let's go

113
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,880
 ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy. Let's give her a ride. She wants to ride with

114
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,500
 us because she's super cool. She has on all the mascara. Yes, we will listen to

115
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,080
 Black Parade for the rest of the journey. The rest of the journey. Hope you guys

116
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,320
 are into that. Paul, take us out of Siberia. We are headed back to the United

117
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,080
 States. We are specifically going to Canada. I don't know what's wrong, but

118
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,160
 that's near the United States. It's the United States little brother. We're headed

119
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,600
 up to Canada. Jason Jalopy's driving on the road. We get to Camperville. That's in

120
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,040
 Manitoba, Canada. The year is 1930.

121
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:23,240
 The winter storm pauses to take a deep breath. It's winter. It's late at night.

122
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,920
 The snow is falling. It's super cold outside. It's below 30 degrees and this

123
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,840
 family is fast asleep. They're wearing their PJs. They got their thermal socks

124
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:40,680
 on. Winter storm is wrapping around the building. Outside their dogs are going

125
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,600
 nuts. The dad wakes up, "Huh? What? What's going on?" And he goes and he looks out

126
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,520
 the window and the dogs are like, "Ahhhhh!" They're now no longer barking. They look

127
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,520
 like they're rabbits. It's just like foam coming out of their mouths.

128
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,000
 "Ahhhhh!" Apparently they also sound like a man. The dog sounded like a 44 year old

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,640
 man trying to record a podcast without waking up his neighbors. It was crazy. The

130
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,840
 dad's standing there. The rest of the family is looking through the window and

131
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,600
 they see a man standing in their front yard. Now the winter storm is pelting the

132
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,480
 building with snow. It's also hitting the stranger. He's not immune to the

133
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:27,160
 weather, but he's dressed like he is. He's wearing a tuxedo. He's just standing out

134
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,640
 in the snow.

135
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:40,480
 The dogs are still just out of it. So the dad and the older brother, they open

136
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,720
 the door. "Ahhhhh!" Super, super spooky door opens up. "I need to fix that," the dad

137
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,800
 says. He walks out with his son and the man is just standing there in the

138
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,840
 tuxedo. "What do you want? What's going on here? Why are you bugging my dogs? Why are

139
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
 you making them sound like a 44 year old man trying to record a podcast late at

140
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,040
 night?" The man just stands there in the snow. He's like, "What does that even mean?"

141
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,760
 He's just standing there. So the father and his son begin to approach the man and

142
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,360
 the man takes a step backwards and they get closer to him and he takes another

143
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,240
 step backwards. And they're like, "Okay, well now it's on. This guy's obviously just

144
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,040
 kind of being a jerk. No one walks backward on my property." They keep walking

145
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,480
 towards him. He keeps walking backwards. Now he's walking backwards one step at a

146
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,280
 time. The men speed up. They start jogging towards him. He continues to take one step

147
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,240
 back. And that's when the men realize, and even the people witnessing this from

148
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:43,080
 the house, no matter how fast the men move towards this figure, they can never

149
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:51,360
 close the distance. And the man is constantly just taking one step backwards.

150
00:11:51,360 --> 00:12:00,360
 They're running towards him. He takes one step backwards. They're still 20 feet away.

151
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,600
 They follow him up to a hill and then they just stop. And he's still just

152
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:17,760
 walking backwards. He walks backwards down the road and is soon swallowed by the

153
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,360
 winter storm.

154
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:30,280
 That's Dead Rev Radio creepypasta hour. Now I actually got that from thinkaboutadox.com

155
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,360
 They got it from paranormal.com back in June 2003. I give a lot of credit to

156
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,520
 thinkaboutadox.com when they report stuff. I haven't been led wrong yet.

157
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,880
 So this story does sound a lot like creepypasta. I've never heard it before.

158
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,080
 I think it's really interesting. I think it's a creepy visual. Anything that

159
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,640
 plays with time and space like that. And it's so funny because when I was reading

160
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,600
 the story, I imagine him as like a tall, lanky guy. Doesn't actually say that in

161
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,560
 the notes. Never says that he's tall and lanky. But I think that's just kind of how

162
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,000
 you get it. It's interesting because the only visual description they don't say

163
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,760
 and he had a creepy grin and real life blood was pouring out of his eyeballs.

164
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,200
 It was just that it was a guy in a tuxedo which makes it creepier. You fill in

165
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,120
 your own details. I filled it in as like a lanky guy in a tuxedo. But as a man in a

166
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,160
 tuxedo and no matter how fast they move towards him, he was always able to stay

167
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,560
 away from him. He's just walking one step at a time. It's very very simple

168
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,240
 story. Very very simple story. Wasn't an alien intruder, some sort of phantom, a

169
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,560
 demonic entity, interdimensional traveler. You pretty much choose whatever you want

170
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,520
 with it. Very very simple story, frightening visual, and the fact that it

171
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,640
 doesn't have an ending where it's like I'll be back to take your firstborn. It

172
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,160
 doesn't have an implication of why the creature was there. It makes it that

173
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,440
 creepier. So we cover stories about some crazy kid in Brazil like we did earlier

174
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,200
 in the week who's beaten up chickens. You just go, "I don't have chickens. I'm not

175
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,680
 living in Brazil. I'm not worried about this Dennis the Menace-esque character

176
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,880
 messing up my life." This guy came out of nowhere, had no goal, and left. And that

177
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,040
 could happen to any of us. You could be walking to your car later tonight and you

178
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,240
 just see a figure standing there next to your car. I mean there's nothing they did

179
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,800
 to start this and there was nothing they did to finish it, so you don't know why

180
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,320
 it was there. Those type of stories are fine. Very unsettling. Also park underneath

181
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,040
 the street lights. Park underneath the street lights. But sometimes that doesn't

182
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,320
 even help, right? You're walking towards the car and your street lights like

183
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,120
 and every time it flickers black you see a figure standing there, but then the

184
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,320
 lights back and it's gone. Paul's like, "Tingya Jason! I have to go to bed after listening to this part of guys."

185
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,360
 It's okay. It's okay Paul. Let's go ahead and leave behind the Jason Jalopy. We're

186
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,240
 gonna hop in the carboner copter. We are headed out to one more story that

187
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,400
 involves walking. You like this theme episode? You like this walking theme

188
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:16,000
 episode? We are leaving behind Canada. Paul, I want you to take us out to Los

189
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,480
 Angeles. We're in the 1960s, so we're dressed up. We got really cool clothes on

190
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,120
 and stuff like that. As opposed to the lame clothes we're wearing today. We got

191
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,560
 really cool clothes on. We're walking around LA. We're sitting at these cool

192
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,960
 nightclubs. We're hanging out with a bunch of old stars, but they weren't old

193
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,840
 back then. They were young. There's a man on stage and he's tuning his guitar and

194
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,120
 this band's getting ready and Debbie Reynolds is sitting next to me and she

195
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,920
 goes, "Hey dude, you won't believe this dude is dope. This guy's super

196
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,320
 awesome." I was like, "Who is it?" Debbie Reynolds goes, "This is the only old star I can think of

197
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,040
 off the top of my head because I just watched singing from the rain a couple

198
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,520
 weeks ago. I never saw it before." Debbie Reynolds goes, "Yeah, dude, this guy's killer.

199
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,920
 His name is Jim Sullivan." He's sitting there and he gets his little

200
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,880
 pedestal ready. He starts playing a jaunty little tune and all of these rich,

201
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,000
 powerful people at LA are mesmerized by this simple folk singer singing simple

202
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,440
 folk songs. He was one of those guys. Jim Sullivan was one of those guys who

203
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,120
 wanted to make it. We all want to make it, right? Whatever your career could be.

204
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,760
 You want to make it as a stockbroker or you want to make it as an artist. You

205
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,520
 want to make it as a mechanic. Everyone has dreams and aspirations, which is

206
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,880
 great. You got to have those. You got to keep moving forward. Jim Sullivan was

207
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,480
 just like us. His aspiration was music and he actually kind of lucked out

208
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,920
 because his wife worked for Capital Records. Now, she wasn't a producer. She

209
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,040
 was like a staff member there. She did her best to try to get his music in

210
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,040
 front of the people at Capital Records, but it just wasn't successful. She

211
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
 couldn't get them to really pick up the album. So you go, "Okay, you know, he's

212
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,200
 trying his best." He had this weird way of mesmerizing people where his first

213
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,760
 gigs were at very, very prestigious nightclubs. He's playing these songs.

214
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,960
 Now, this is the 1960s, so folk music is huge right now. And the audiences are

215
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,680
 full of musicians. They're full of actors. They're full of these powerful

216
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,680
 people. And they're like, "Oh my god, this is really, really good music. This guy

217
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,360
 needs an album deal." He's like, "Yeah, I'm working on it. You know, my wife's

218
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,120
 trying to pull strings, but Capital Records won't listen to it." He had a bunch

219
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,760
 of celebrity friends pool their money together. They pool their money together

220
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,680
 to get him studio time. And not only studio time, he's just a simple man with a

221
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,600
 guitar who's writing these songs. They have to get backing musicians for him.

222
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,720
 They get him studio time with the Wrecking Crew. The Wrecking Crew were studio

223
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,920
 musicians for some of the biggest acts at the time. This cost serious money. His

224
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,480
 friends really, really believed in Jim Sullivan. They got him the studio. They

225
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,120
 got him the Wrecking Crew. They got him the best of the best. And his first album

226
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:08,400
 was entitled UFO. Didn't take off, though. It was pure folk music, but it just

227
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,840
 didn't take off. 1972, he does get signed to a record label. He gets signed to

228
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,000
 Playboy Records, the Playboy company, decides to actually get into the music

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,040
 business. And one of the very first acts, because this guy had such a great

230
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,680
 reputation, to launch their record company, they picked Jim Sullivan. But that

231
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:33,480
 album also flops. You can have the best music out there, the best art out there,

232
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,360
 and it just doesn't line up. And that's what happened to Jim Sullivan. His

233
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,600
 marriage started a fall apart. He had a child. That's the one. The marriage started

234
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,320
 a fall apart. He's like, Barney, the reason why we're raking up is you know,

235
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,280
 they had a kid, but the marriage was starting to fall apart. He started a

236
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,160
 drink, which is never going to make things good. He starts to drink very, very

237
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,840
 heavily. And he says, you know what, okay, maybe Los Angeles isn't the place for me

238
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,040
 to be. I'm gonna try my luck in Nashville. So, honey, Barney, he gives

239
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,920
 sign to Barney. He almost broke me and me and your mom up. He goes, I'm gonna go to

240
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,760
 Nashville. I'm gonna try to make it there, and then I'll bring you guys out with me.

241
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,120
 Or get a divorce, you know. One or the other, this marriage isn't going so great.

242
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,040
 But he did still talk to his wife into this adventure we're going on. So he

243
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,720
 goes, I'm gonna go to Nashville. It's March 4th, 1975. At this point, he is loading

244
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,600
 up his Volkswagen Beetle, and he's gonna make the trip from Los Angeles to

245
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,360
 Nashville. On the way out there, he stops at a motel in Santa Rosa, New Mexico.

246
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,280
 Goes in, gets a room, buys some vodka. Not a great thing to do, especially when

247
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,520
 you're on a road trip, but that's what he does. He's in for the night. He gets a

248
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,600
 hotel room, he buys some vodka. He calls his wife from the hotel room, and he goes,

249
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,640
 I'm alright. You know, I'm down here in New Mexico. I'm not in Nashville just yet.

250
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,600
 The journey just began. What do you expect? What do you expect? No, he goes, I'm still

251
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,800
 headed there, but... And the wife's like, what's going on? Like, she could tell

252
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,320
 something was off. She could tell something was off. She thought it was

253
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,880
 weird because when he called, he told her, I'm alright. Everything's okay. And she

254
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,400
 thought, well, yeah, you just left your New Mexico. You just left a couple hours

255
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,440
 ago. What could go wrong between LA and New Mexico? She thought that was weird. She

256
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,600
 could tell something was wrong, so she starts pressing them for stuff. He goes,

257
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,880
 quote, you want to believe if I told you, unquote. She asked him then, Jim, what's

258
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,680
 the matter? Is anything wrong? And he replied, quote, forget it. Just forget I

259
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:41,240
 said anything. I'll call you from Nashville, unquote. Next day, 26 miles away from

260
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:48,160
 the hotel, he's seen walking near a remote ranch. He's walking away from a

261
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,320
 parked car. He was never seen again. When he didn't get to Nashville and he didn't

262
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,680
 call his wife, they started a missing persons case on this. And what they

263
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,880
 figure out is that he got the hotel, but he never slept there. He got the

264
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,960
 motel room. He left his key in the motel room, never slept in the bed. He must have

265
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,160
 driven out that night. The last time he was seen was walking around that ranch,

266
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:19,720
 26 miles away. In his car, they found money. They found clothes. They found like

267
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,480
 luggage. They found a box of unsold records. And they found his guitar. And

268
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,440
 that's when his wife goes, okay, something's wrong because I'll tell you

269
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,760
 right now, he would leave all of that stuff, but he would never leave that

270
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,280
 guitar. If he ever needed to make money, you'd probably take the cash too, but she

271
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,520
 goes, he needs that guitar to make money. That's his life. With that guitar, he can

272
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,000
 make it anywhere. So the fact that he left the guitar really, really made her

273
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,520
 afraid that something bad happened. Now, the police were looking at the obvious.

274
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,800
 One suicide. He got out of his car, just walked into the wilderness, and died on

275
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,040
 purpose. The other one was that the car maybe had some trouble, and he walked to

276
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,800
 go get help and died of exposure. There was no reports of the car having trouble,

277
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 though, so that puzzled them. Then there's things like foul play, that he was

278
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,960
 forced to go out there, that somebody kidnapped him, that somebody murdered him,

279
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,560
 and his bleached bones are somewhere in the wilderness that would show evidence

280
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,480
 of him being murdered. But of course, because his first album was titled UFO,

281
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:33,000
 the story that really took hold was the Space Brothers took him home. That he

282
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,360
 went out into the middle of nowhere, New Mexico, which is home of Roswell, and he

283
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,000
 got abducted by aliens. One of his best friends, Al Dobbs, this old famous actor

284
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 who actually was one of the guys who helped raise money for him, he says,

285
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,320
 "Listen, I think it's really poetic to think that he's out there wandering

286
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,040
 somewhere, but I think something bad happened to the guy. I don't think that

287
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,360
 he got picked up by aliens, or he's wandering the wilderness or anything

288
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,360
 like that." That was his take on it. But the fans of his, they're like, "How

289
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,240
 did Dobbs you big old party pooper?" Let's say that he went and hung out with

290
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:15,000
 aliens, because we don't know. And his album wasn't a success, his follow-up

291
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,920
 album wasn't a success, and it became a collector's item for decades. In the

292
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,440
 underground folk music scene, people would talk about Jim Sullivan, and this

293
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,200
 mystery would be part of it. They're like, "Yeah, he recorded this album about UFOs.

294
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,840
 He recorded the song he goes on talking about just walking." The songs are

295
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,400
 really interesting song. The song UFO is basically about, like, the alien

296
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,240
 brotherhood. And if you saw UFO, would you believe it was Jesus, or would you

297
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,600
 believe Jesus was a UFO? It's a really interesting song. The album, I'll tell you

298
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,200
 this right now, the album is great. You guys who know that I listen to music,

299
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,800
 everyone listens to music, but I listen to West Coast 90s gangster rap, and I

300
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,400
 listen to pop music. And that's why I don't do a dead rabbit, recommends music,

301
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,000
 because you guys don't want to hear me recommend Spice Ones 1996. It's a great

302
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,800
 album, it's a great album. But you guys are gonna listen to 1996 or Holo Tip,

303
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,040
 Taking No Shorts, or any of that stuff. You guys should. It's great. You guys aren't

304
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,520
 gonna listen to Taylor Swift's 1989, unless you guys listen to it already.

305
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,200
 There isn't why I don't do dead rabbit recommends for music, because music is

306
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,160
 such a personal thing. But my music tastes are pretty specific. I like

307
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,880
 Bubblegum Pop and 90s West Coast gangster rap, in equal amounts. My mp3

308
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,280
 player is almost a 50/50 split of those two. So when I was researching this story,

309
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,840
 I put in Jim Sullivan's UFO album. I don't know how many times I listen to it.

310
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,680
 It's like a half hour album, and it is so mellow and cool. You feel cool listening

311
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,760
 to it. And I've, it's a really cool album to research to, because it's so mellow

312
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,320
 and just kind of underneath everything. And you guys know that's not my type of

313
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,880
 music. So I really recommend that in the show notes both albums are in there. You

314
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,720
 can listen to them on YouTube. And sure, you can buy them as well. Because what

315
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,840
 happened was, it was this Colt collector's item. There was only so many copies of

316
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,520
 these albums pressed. It was a vanity press the first time. The second time it

317
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,360
 was a flop album from Playboy Records. And in 2010, this guy who had heard this,

318
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,720
 he's like, dude, this album is great. This guy is an amazing musician, and his

319
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,880
 story is just bonkers. He just walked into the desert. Whether or not he got

320
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,880
 abducted by aliens, he did just disappear without a trace. So this guy was able to

321
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,560
 buy the rights of both albums and reissued them in 2010, and they became a big

322
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,920
 hit. And you know why they became a big hit? Because the story of Jim Sullivan

323
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:47,080
 was covered on Coast to Coast AM. It's an interesting story. It's actually kind of

324
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:53,600
 heartwarming. And it does suck that he's passed on or walked away or lost or

325
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:01,440
 anything like that. But his music lived long past him. Like his legacy lived on.

326
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,080
 And it lived on through Coast to Coast AM, because he had this album called UFO.

327
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,120
 And he very well might have been abducted by aliens. We don't know. If he had

328
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,960
 walked off willingly, he would have taken his guitar. And if it was some sort of

329
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,200
 mob hit, you figured they would have taken the cash. So what was going on? What

330
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,320
 did he see? And he told his wife, "Ah, forget it. Forget it. Forget I said

331
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,720
 anything." Did he see something in the sky? Was that simple song that he wrote

332
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,840
 about UFOs and contactees and spiritual enlightenment involving extraterrestrial

333
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,320
 space brothers? Did that trigger something? Maybe Jim Sullivan couldn't find an

334
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,280
 audience on Earth, but he found an audience that was out of this world. And

335
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:55,160
 then, because his story involved aliens, 50 years later, it was reported on an

336
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:03,360
 alien radio show and gained the earthly audience that he deserved all along. The

337
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,160
 story of Jim Sullivan transcends just a man walking into the desert and walking

338
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:15,280
 into mystery. It's a story of an artist who struggled but never gave up. Never

339
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:23,200
 gave up. He was just a man who would hit a barrier, readjust, and try again. So

340
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,080
 whether or not Jim Sullivan was abducted by aliens, and hopefully he was.

341
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,920
 Hopefully he wasn't murdered or he just didn't walk into the desert. Maybe he

342
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,640
 walked into a portal. Hopefully it's something like that.

343
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,800
 It wasn't happy or endings, because unfortunately he is missing. I can't just

344
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:42,240
 make him reappear. But hopefully he did pass on into some great grand cosmic

345
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,880
 adventure. But regardless of that, I think Jim Sullivan is a perfect example for

346
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,800
 us and our current 90 days to a better you challenge. Right now we're all

347
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,560
 spending the next 90 days to be better than we are today. And Jim Sullivan is

348
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,400
 one of those people. It wasn't perfect. He had a drinking problem, his marriage was

349
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,160
 falling apart. None of our lives are perfect, but he kept having a goal and

350
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,200
 when he was stymied he would simply readjust and keep shooting for that goal.

351
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:20,240
 He wanted to be a musical legend so much that even his disappearance from the

352
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:27,120
 mortal world couldn't stop his drive. And here we are today in the year 2021

353
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:35,440
 talking about a man who dreamed of being a music legend.
