11

 The number one fear in America right now is transmorphine.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
 Turning into things against your will.

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,040
 You're like, "Seriously, the only person who has this fear. Why do you always bring this up?"

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,480
 Well, today we're going to talk about four stories involving people who have been shifted

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,000
 into things, other people, monsters against their will.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,040
 And yes, it's an interactive episode.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,000
 It's morphin' time today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, or I'm having a great day.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,560
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,080
 I hope you guys had a lot of fun.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,800
 We're going to go ahead and get started here because we got a ton of stuff to cover.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,280
 It's basically all the same versions of the same story, but they're spooky.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,320
 This is spooky.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,320
 I guess I should give a little bit of an introduction about why I think this stuff's so spooky.

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,240
 But first off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
 Someone who changes into many things, but he's always my friend.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
 Give it up for Pitlepoo.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
 Yeah, yeah, come on in Pitlepoo.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,520
 Come on in, buddy.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,720
 He's actually an old friend of mine back from my Sacramento days.

33
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,000
 Pitlepoo, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,240
 Just helps spread the word about the show.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,400
 That really, really helps out a lot.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,480
 Now, Pitlepoo, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,240
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,560
 We're going to fly all the way out to our first story, which takes place in Pennsylvania.

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,240
 [Fart noise]

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,680
 Now, as we're flying out there, I want you to think of a number between one and four.

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,720
 And you pick that number.

43
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
 Remember the number you picked.

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
 Write it down if you have a bad memory.

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,440
 Put it on your hand.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,440
 One through four.

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,320
 And that is going to be the number that will decide your fate in this transmorphine challenge.

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,160
 I have this irrational fear of turning into stuff against my will.

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
 And it can be all sorts of things.

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,880
 I could be turned into a tree.

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,480
 Like, there's no way you could be turned into a tree.

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,080
 I know, but it's still spooky.

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,280
 Like, imagine if I turned into a tree and like my face is sticking out.

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,760
 And then like as I got older, like more and more bark is covering up my face.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,960
 So now I can't even see before I could at least look out into the forest in front of me.

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,280
 But now I'm just like, "There's more than one thing for this time in my life."

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,760
 That's spooky, right?

58
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,000
 And then I think that's scary.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,160
 And then I remember once hearing about this old urban legend about this dude

60
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,160
 who's, I should have made this one a number.

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,200
 If you pick number five, this happens to you.

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,960
 I remember hearing this old urban legend about this guy,

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,280
 him and his wife are vacationing in a foreign country and his wife goes missing.

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
 And he can't find her anywhere.

65
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,160
 And he's like contacting the authorities and there's this huge search for her,

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,800
 but they never find his wife.

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,800
 And so he goes back to his home country, a broken man.

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,280
 And then after a couple years, he goes, "I need a vacation.

69
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,320
 A vacation back to that country where my wife disappeared."

70
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,560
 So he goes to this back to the country.

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,080
 It's all, it's a universal urban legend.

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
 So it always changes where the stories take place.

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,680
 He goes back to this country and he's walking around and he sees a tent labeled freak show.

74
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,520
 He's like, "You know what? That'll really cheer me up."

75
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,960
 Down in the doldrums watching him, watching someone else suffer,

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
 always cheers me up.

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,040
 He goes into the freak show and there he sees a woman whose limbs have been chopped off

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,920
 and like her bones have been broken and then rehealed in like this really animalistic way.

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,600
 And she's like digging through the dirt and like she's been lobotomized

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,200
 and she just has this glazed look on her eye and she's eating like worms

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,320
 and people are throwing at her.

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,920
 He brought his own worms.

83
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,280
 He's like, "Oh, I love going to the freak show."

84
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
 Better stop by the bake shop first.

85
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,480
 He's throwing worms at this woman and then she turns

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,640
 and she looks and it's his wife.

87
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,240
 And so the idea was that she was kidnapped and then they severely beat her

88
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,400
 and traumatized her and broke her bones because they needed a new attraction for the freak show.

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
 That story terrified me and just to put it into perspective,

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,200
 the first time I heard that story I was 17 years old.

91
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,920
 I was like, "Ew!"

92
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,080
 Being transformed into a beast, right?

93
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
 Turning into something against your will.

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,520
 I find it absolutely terrifying and for whatever reason,

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,920
 I have this irrational fear of this.

96
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,120
 For whatever reason, I'll just be watching a random movie and it'll pop up.

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
 It'll be like Top Gun, Top Gun Maverick at the ending.

98
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,120
 When they're like, "Top Gun, you sure did a good job fighting those dudes."

99
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,280
 And he's like, "Thank you, but I guess it's time to retire."

100
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
 And the military's like, "Uh-uh."

101
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,640
 And they start turning him into a jet.

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,080
 He's like, "No, no."

103
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,960
 And then the ending, he's like painted on the side of a jet

104
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
 like a 1950s bombshell model.

105
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,160
 I love that movie.

106
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,280
 Top Gun Maverick was great.

107
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
 That would have made the movie even better because it was just so awesome.

108
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,960
 But anyway, I always try to figure out the origin of it.

109
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,800
 On recent episodes, I've said, I think it was from a Doctor Who episode

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
 where a man turned into a statue.

111
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,360
 But I think it's actually younger than that.

112
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,760
 I think it was something wicked this way comes.

113
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,120
 It was a Disney horror movie about people turning in and people making a deal with the devil

114
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,640
 and then the deal would be twisted and they would turn into these things.

115
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,520
 Going all the way up to movies like Wishmaster where you make a wish

116
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,760
 and this evil demon gives you the wish.

117
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,240
 And he's constantly doing that to people.

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,360
 He's constantly turning, this one woman goes, "I hope I'm beautiful forever."

119
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,600
 And he goes, "As you wish it."

120
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,960
 She turns into a statue.

121
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:29,760
 My point is, I literally do an entire podcast of just times I've seen

122
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
 people turned into things against their will.

123
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,880
 It terrifies me.

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
 Absolutely terrifies me.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,480
 So I have four stories along that vein and you've picked your number.

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,160
 We are ready to go.

127
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,920
 Pitilpoo land this dead rabbit dirgeable in Lancaster County.

128
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,720
 Now what is so interesting about this story?

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,080
 I have to keep double checking because I'm like, I might have done this before.

130
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
 I might have done this before, but I didn't.

131
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,960
 Let's go ahead and set this story up.

132
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,320
 Back on episode 318.

133
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,080
 Doesn't seem like a long time ago, dude.

134
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,120
 318, the Amish first Bigfoot.

135
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
 Fairly short story.

136
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:13,120
 In 1973, these three Amish men saw a naked man running from a neighboring farm to their area.

137
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560
 And they said he was covered in dark hair.

138
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
 He's like a Bigfoot type character.

139
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,000
 And he was running over and he was yelling and jumping around.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,040
 Bigfoot's running around their farm right there.

141
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,320
 That's a pretty cool story.

142
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,160
 But he was wearing a pair of tattered boxers, like boxer briefs.

143
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,600
 And that terrified me because I thought, what if a human turned into Bigfoot?

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,520
 We've actually covered that a couple times on this show.

145
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,080
 People who seem to be turning into Bigfoot.

146
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
 And that would be the only reason why Bigfoot would be wearing boxers.

147
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,200
 There's very few, there's more than one, but there's very few incidents of Bigfoot wearing clothes.

148
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,160
 So I remember reading that.

149
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,600
 And then to finish that story, the three Amish men they run and they hide.

150
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,080
 And an elderly Amish woman comes out and she sees this Bigfoot wearing boxers,

151
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,680
 tattered dirty boxers and the Bigfoot creature sat down and started with the sky.

152
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,520
 And then the three men came on a hiding and they went to go talk to him.

153
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,200
 And they said he just reeked of this rotting meat smell.

154
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,920
 And as they were trying to talk to him, he stood up and started to walk away.

155
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,480
 And then he faded into nothingness.

156
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,520
 Like that's a dope Bigfoot story.

157
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
 That's a really, really cool Bigfoot story, right?

158
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
 I love coming across stuff like that and sharing it with you guys.

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,440
 So when we're back in Lancaster County, I had to pull that episode up.

160
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,680
 I was like, is this the same story?

161
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,840
 Is it just another telling of it?

162
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,800
 But I believe this is a secondary story because this story takes place in 1979.

163
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,680
 We're still in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

164
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,120
 It's August, 1979.

165
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,040
 There's four Amish men working on this farm.

166
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,080
 And they recently hired Jericho to hang out,

167
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
 helped Brother Malachi build this barn.

168
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,960
 And then the other two guys, I don't know what their names are.

169
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,920
 But anyways, you have four Amish men working at this farm.

170
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,880
 And then all of a sudden, a naked hairy man starts jumping towards them.

171
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,920
 Be creepy enough if he was walking slowly.

172
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,400
 But jumping, there's something creepy about that, right?

173
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,080
 He was bouncing like a kangaroo, boing, boing, boing, coming towards you.

174
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
 Tell me that would not be 100 times more intimidating.

175
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,440
 If you were walking down the street and a gangbanger came out

176
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,040
 and started jumping towards you like a kangaroo, it would be way worse.

177
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,800
 This one, he had light colored hair.

178
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
 They said it was kind of a sandy hair covering his entire body.

179
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,400
 It's the same thing.

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
 It's this Sasquatch type creature.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,920
 And he got within 100 feet of this quartet.

182
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,600
 These four Amish men have stopped working.

183
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,680
 This creature's gotten within 100 feet of them.

184
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,400
 And then one of them, Brother Malachi, these are made of names, right?

185
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,680
 I don't know their actual names.

186
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:55,520
 Anyways, Malachi all of a sudden feels an electrical jolt shoot throughout his entire body.

187
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,840
 And everything hurts.

188
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,720
 Everything is stabbing him at once.

189
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,360
 And then he said it felt like there was something else inside of me.

190
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:18,640
 I could feel another presence in me, but not like a demonic possession.

191
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,120
 He goes, I actually could feel my thought patterns, my brain waves,

192
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,720
 my nervous system changing.

193
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,080
 I was morphing.

194
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,560
 He didn't actually use that word.

195
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,880
 He actually used that word, but he was morphing.

196
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,840
 He was changing into something and he goes to scream for help.

197
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,520
 Trying to get his brothers to help him out.

198
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,200
 And he goes, what the hell?

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
 [MAKING NOISES]

200
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
 And he realizes he can't speak English anymore.

201
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,920
 He's speaking in this bizarre guttural language.

202
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,160
 He's trying to ask for help, but he hears his own voice.

203
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,880
 [MAKING NOISES]

204
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,520
 And then the creature turns to Malachi and goes,

205
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,200
 [MAKING NOISES]

206
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,280
 Begins speaking that same language.

207
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,440
 And Malachi doesn't know what he's saying, but the creature understood him.

208
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,560
 At that point, the brown-haired Sasquatch-esque monster took off,

209
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,320
 running at a superhuman speed into the nearby forest, and Malachi returned to normal.

210
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,680
 So the stories are different enough.

211
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,760
 When I was first alive, I was like, did I cover this already?

212
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,880
 Did I cover this already?

213
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,200
 The creature description is different enough.

214
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,440
 It's almost a decade apart, six years apart.

215
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
 And the first one, the dude just kind of faded away all peaceful,

216
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,080
 looking up at the sky, contemplating existence.

217
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,440
 The dude ran away.

218
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,720
 He's somehow infesting this dude, almost like he's procreating.

219
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
 This is how these creatures form more creatures.

220
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,360
 And it's so interesting because, I mean, again, I'm covering these almost 600 episodes apart.

221
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,200
 So these stories have not been connected before this podcast, as far as I know.

222
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
 Because I read the first one, I think, on phantomsandmonsters.com, which is a great website.

223
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,880
 This other one I came across on ThingAboutItDocs.com just randomly,

224
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,720
 looking through the year 1979.

225
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,400
 Each season I pick a year of ThingAboutItDocs.com and just go through it.

226
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,920
 Sometimes I go through two years.

227
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,360
 And they got it from a book called America's Nightmare Monsters by Philip L. Reif.

228
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
 Absolutely terrifying.

229
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,720
 And it connects to the first one, as in I thought this was a human who turned into a bigfoot.

230
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,960
 And all of his clothes were rotting off.

231
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,920
 The last piece of his humanity was his tattered boxers.

232
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,480
 And this creature we see in 1979 appears to be a different creature.

233
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,960
 The fur, the hair is a different color.

234
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,240
 And he's bouncing more.

235
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,080
 The first one was kind of walking around.

236
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,160
 I know they said he was jumping, but it's more like jumping for joy because he saw some people.

237
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,400
 This one, he was actually his main form of transportation was hopping like a king.

238
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,000
 Terrifying though, right?

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,520
 Like is this how these creatures replicate?

240
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
 They take over humans.

241
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,200
 Because if you think of the bigfoot as some sort of interdimensional phenomenon,

242
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
 that would track.

243
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,360
 If it's, you know what I mean?

244
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,800
 Like if they can hop through a portal, I think they can hop into you.

245
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,960
 That's how science works.

246
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,520
 So if you picked the number three, you are walking through Lancaster, Pennsylvania right now,

247
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,800
 humming a John T. Toon.

248
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,600
 And you hear something in the bushes.

249
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,680
 And then I'm not going to repeat what just happened to this guy.

250
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,960
 All this stuff happened to you.

251
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,000
 You're building a barn.

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,800
 All of a sudden you're like, what?

253
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,320
 I'm almost now too.

254
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,960
 You're building a barn and you feel this electrical jolt shoot through your body.

255
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,840
 You can feel your mind getting taken over.

256
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,040
 You can feel everything getting rewired.

257
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,240
 Everything changing.

258
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,680
 And then the worst part, I think, your soul would still be the same.

259
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,840
 Like if I turned into a monster, like the girl in the freak show, he got lobotomized.

260
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,160
 Like I'm saying it's okay if you break their brains.

261
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,840
 But the thing of me being trapped in the tree, becoming a tree,

262
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,760
 is that if I remember that I'm Jason, I was like, oh dude, I could totally be watching Deep Space Nine

263
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,160
 right now.

264
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,200
 But instead I got to watch all these squirrels like walk and stuff like that.

265
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,560
 And when winter comes, nothing happens during the winter.

266
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,800
 Be super boring.

267
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,480
 Multiply that by 400 years as I'm just growing roots on the ground.

268
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,720
 But I turned into a tree and didn't remember being Jason.

269
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,160
 And I always was a tree.

270
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,120
 I wouldn't really care.

271
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
 But you're a monster man and you're like, oh, you're running around.

272
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
 And then you go home.

273
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,160
 You look at your watch.

274
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
 That's the only thing that didn't change.

275
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
 Somehow your entire body transmorgified and you're this giant monster.

276
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
 But you have one normal sized wrist.

277
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,760
 You look at your watch.

278
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,800
 You're like, I better get home.

279
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,200
 And you run home.

280
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
 You just fade away.

281
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
 You just sit there and then you fade away.

282
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
 And then your family's at home eating dinner.

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,880
 Then all of a sudden you fade into the living room.

284
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,920
 And everyone's like totally freaked out.

285
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,120
 And you're like talking in that annoying voice that I do.

286
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,480
 And no one can understand you.

287
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 You just want to hug.

288
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
 But they're running away from you.

289
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,880
 You're like, and then you go to Del Taco and you get some burritos and stuff like that.

290
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
 And then you're just walking through the street.

291
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,320
 And no one can understand you.

292
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,280
 You're a big old monster.

293
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,800
 And actually going to Del Taco would be totally fine.

294
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,440
 Right?

295
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,960
 Going to Del Taco would be awesome.

296
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,280
 But people would be trying to kill you.

297
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,560
 And you would constantly be having to make the decision.

298
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,560
 Maybe if I let that A&E Bigfoot show, Hunting Bigfoot, shoot me.

299
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,200
 Then this torment will be over.

300
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,720
 The darkness that I've been trapped in this prison of this giant body.

301
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,040
 Like Jason, I really think you're missing the plot on this one.

302
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,800
 You've become like an eight foot tall, hairy monster man.

303
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,560
 I guess I don't think you would be walking all alone from a Del Taco eating a cup of fries.

304
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,280
 You probably should like join the military or become a professional wrestler.

305
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,200
 You go to the WWE.

306
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,680
 You're like picking people up and you're throwing them down and stuff like that.

307
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,120
 And that's just for the interview.

308
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,640
 You haven't even gotten into the ring yet.

309
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,080
 You're bringing people's backs.

310
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,960
 Men's Big Bands all.

311
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,760
 You're hired.

312
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,240
 And then you, I guess you could probably do some cool stuff.

313
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,720
 As a Bigfoot, you could probably like meet some hot girls and you turn them into monsters and stuff like that.

314
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
 I'm really into you.

315
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,960
 Literally.

316
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,720
 And then you start sending jolts through their body and their personality starts changing.

317
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,880
 Now you got all these hairy women following you around.

318
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,040
 But you're into that now because you're also super hairy.

319
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,440
 I guess you could probably make the best of it if you turned into a monster man.

320
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,760
 You could probably make a better life in modern day America than you could in the 1970s in Lancaster County.

321
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,000
 Because it's just a bunch of Amish people, right?

322
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 You have all the butter you want.

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
 But other than that, there's not much to do.

324
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,920
 But nowadays you can get your own reality show.

325
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,800
 Being Bigfoot on the Discovery Channel.

326
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,560
 And it's just you sitting around, you're constantly turning the cast and the crew into Bigfoot.

327
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,720
 They're like, listen, the show has really good ratings.

328
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
 A bunch of trancemorgaphy to the entire camera crew.

329
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,120
 This stuff isn't set up to be held by an eight foot tall monster.

330
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,760
 So if you picked number three, I think you got off pretty lightly.

331
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,480
 I mean, it is my worst fear of all time.

332
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,120
 But out of the other stories we're going to cover,

333
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,000
 that one was probably the one you could probably make the best living out of.

334
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,960
 You could actually turn it into some sort of money making venture.

335
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,600
 Pittlepoo, let's go ahead and put you on the bunny bicycle.

336
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,560
 We're going to leave behind Lancaster County.

337
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,600
 We're going to ride all the way out to Portugal.

338
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,840
 [Panting]

339
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,920
 Pushing those pedals, getting all the way out there.

340
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,640
 We're leaving behind all the number threes.

341
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,360
 They're just monster, making millions of dollars now.

342
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,400
 But the rest of us are riding bicycles all the way down to Portugal.

343
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,880
 I found this story post on the line.

344
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,440
 We don't have the name of the person who told it.

345
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,960
 We're going to go ahead and call him Johnny.

346
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,560
 But we do have a pretty good time period.

347
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,280
 This was posted in May of 2022.

348
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,400
 And he said it just took place a couple of months before that.

349
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,360
 So fairly recent story for this one.

350
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,400
 Johnny said him and his buddies were out late one night drinking in the country of Portugal.

351
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
 They're walking around, they're drinking beers.

352
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,560
 And then it's time to go home.

353
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,920
 They're like, "I'm pretty sure my dad's earned into a Bigfoot."

354
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,360
 And he wants to talk to me about something.

355
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,840
 Oh, it doesn't try turning me into a Bigfoot again.

356
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,320
 Johnny and his friends are walking home.

357
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,720
 They decide to take a shortcut down a dark alley.

358
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,960
 And they start walking down this alley.

359
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,640
 And right when they're just into it,

360
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,160
 Johnny and his friends are standing there.

361
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,720
 And they see at the other end of the alleyway, somebody standing there.

362
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,960
 And they can't really see much.

363
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,920
 It just looks like this human, right?

364
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,720
 You're not automatically thinking it's going to be something bizarre.

365
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,280
 He said this person was probably about five feet tall.

366
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
 And it was waddling back and forth.

367
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,040
 Back and forth.

368
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,000
 Now, not towards them.

369
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,160
 It's just kind of wandering and waddling in this small area that it's standing at

370
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,680
 at the other end of the alleyway.

371
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,360
 And it's making these slurry noises.

372
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:20,880
 He described it as it sounded like a drunk man slurring his words.

373
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
 And they don't understand what this guy's saying.

374
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
 He's just standing there.

375
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,160
 He's slurring his words.

376
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,920
 And really, he's blocking their path.

377
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,000
 So they got to get past this guy.

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,120
 This is supposed to be a shortcut.

379
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,520
 Now it's turning into an obstacle.

380
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,600
 And as the friends are trying to figure out, I mean, this is all happening so quickly,

381
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,400
 but as they're standing there and they're seeing this guy standing at the other end

382
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,440
 of this alleyway slurring his words, Johnny starts to realize that this person,

383
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,920
 this person, isn't just slurring their words.

384
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,560
 It sounds like, he goes, it's hard to describe it.

385
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:59,360
 It sounded like if you took a drunk mumbling man and then pitched up the audio.

386
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,320
 And then warped the speed back and forth.

387
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:19,360
 So we're going to put my audio editing skills to the test.

388
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,560
 It's making that noise.

389
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,200
 If I was able to edit it correctly, it was making that noise.

390
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
 Johnny's friends, they're all impatient, right?

391
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,880
 They're drunk as well.

392
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,480
 This group of friends is drunk as well.

393
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,200
 They're trying to get home.

394
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,240
 So Johnny's friend starts yelling at the person, "Get out of the way.

395
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,880
 Get out of the way.

396
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,240
 Man, we're trying to walk through this alley."

397
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,400
 And this thing isn't even talking to them.

398
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,720
 It's just muttering to itself.

399
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,560
 So the friend pulls out his phone and activates the flashlight.

400
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,400
 And he starts walking towards the guy.

401
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,440
 And he's going to kind of just like, bully him out of the way.

402
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,680
 And as the friend starts walking towards him and he shines the flashlight on this bum,

403
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,240
 he sees that this is not a human.

404
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 But it might have been at one point.

405
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,120
 He said, "The first thing you notice is that when you saw this five-foot tall figure,

406
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
 it looked like it had a big belly.

407
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,240
 It looked like it was quite overweight.

408
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,520
 But once the flashlight shone on it, he said the stomach was bifurcated.

409
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,080
 He said like, you could see the top part came down and then there was like this groove in it.

410
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,680
 And then it had a bigger gut coming out of its torso, reaching all the way down to its knees.

411
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,600
 They also notice all of this stuff is that the person at the end of the alleyway

412
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
 might have a messed up stomach, right?

413
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,320
 But also it has hooves for hands.

414
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,480
 Little hooves.

415
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,400
 And then slowly shine the flashlight up to this thing's face.

416
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,640
 It was a pig person.

417
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,240
 It was a person with a face of a pig.

418
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720
 It didn't have like big pig ears.

419
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
 It wasn't an actual pig standing up.

420
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,080
 But it had like the head of a human with a face of a pig.

421
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,680
 And why?

422
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,920
 You think maybe that's just a cryptid, right?

423
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,880
 Maybe that was just a cryptid that wandered into the city,

424
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,400
 wherever city they're at in Portugal.

425
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,800
 But what makes this a transmorphine story is its clothing.

426
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,480
 This pig man standing at the edge of this alleyway,

427
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,280
 Johnny described it as it looked like he had collected clothes at random.

428
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,760
 So he had a cowboy hat.

429
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
 He had a shirt that didn't fit.

430
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,880
 And it was written in English.

431
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,960
 The whatever was written on it wasn't English.

432
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,120
 So that was odd in and of itself.

433
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,920
 Because they're in Portugal,

434
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,960
 they have a shirt that has English writing on it, the cowboy hat.

435
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,080
 And the creature had a purse.

436
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,880
 A small purse over its shoulder.

437
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,600
 I actually don't know if it was a white key.

438
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,800
 I'm just trying to build a picture because I don't obviously have a picture of this thing.

439
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,840
 It's making this slurring noise sound.

440
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,000
 And it now notices the group of people standing at the end of the alleyway.

441
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,440
 And the friend is much closer to this creature than they are.

442
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,000
 And when this pig person turns and looks at the friend,

443
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,520
 they notice that there's vomit, like dried vomit staining this creature's face.

444
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,720
 And it begins to waddle towards the group of boys.

445
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,600
 [Makes noises]

446
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
 Waddling towards them.

447
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,120
 So these guys react in probably, I would say,

448
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,080
 legally, legally the most inappropriate way,

449
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
 but realistically very appropriate.

450
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,360
 They beat them up.

451
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,760
 They found this creature from beyond reality.

452
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,640
 And they jumped it.

453
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
 It terrified them so much they all ran forward and they started punching it.

454
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,160
 And then the Johnny goes,

455
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,680
 this dude went down super fast.

456
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,440
 Like he thought because he was so big, had so much mass to him.

457
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,600
 He thought because he had a cowboy hat.

458
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,040
 He was a rodeo boy.

459
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,960
 No, they said pretty much legally, legally they should have left him alone.

460
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,640
 But pretty much one punch knocked this creature to the ground.

461
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,720
 And then they started kicking it on the ground.

462
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,960
 They began kicking it over and over again.

463
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
 You'll see why this person didn't post a real name when telling the story.

464
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,200
 They began kicking this creature over and over again until it stopped moving.

465
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
 And kicked it a little bit more.

466
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,440
 And then as they were walking away from it,

467
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,080
 they kept looking back to make sure it wasn't getting up.

468
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,920
 It's possible that this person posted about a murder online.

469
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,880
 But what happens is they leave the area.

470
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,760
 Because the police are obviously going to be looking for these guys.

471
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
 They just beat somebody into a coma.

472
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,680
 They have not killed them or pig monster.

473
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,640
 I mean, still against the law.

474
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,320
 As they're leaving the scene, one of the friends holds up the purse.

475
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,400
 He grabbed the purse from this creature when it fell to the ground.

476
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,440
 Because, you know, all of this stuff is happening so quickly.

477
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,880
 All of this stuff is happening so quickly,

478
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,040
 but they still had no idea what it was.

479
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,160
 So the friend said, "I took the purse so maybe we could figure out who we just murdered."

480
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,960
 And when they opened the purse up, it was completely empty.

481
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,520
 Except for a few kernels of corn.

482
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,800
 And Johnny said, "Honestly, it looked like someone was eating corn."

483
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,160
 And then putting corn in their purse to save for later.

484
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,960
 So if you picked number two, you're walking through the city one day and you're like,

485
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
 "All right, looking at your watch, you're like,

486
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,440
 'Cause I have a normal size wrist and it didn't turn into a monster yet."

487
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,960
 You're walking through the street and you see these street vendors.

488
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,720
 They have these food carts and they're like,

489
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,000
 "Who wants a slice of pizza?

490
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,520
 Slice a pizza. Two dollars."

491
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,720
 And you're like, "I know I'm good with that."

492
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,800
 And then this other food cart comes up and they're like,

493
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,440
 "Meatballs! Meatballs! Meatballs!

494
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,040
 Two dollars per meatball."

495
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,320
 And they're like, "No, I'm cool with that."

496
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,680
 And then you see, you turn a corner and you see someone selling that entire roasted pig.

497
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,240
 It has like the spike through it and everything and the apple in its mouth.

498
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,040
 And there's this old lady and she's turning the pig on the rack.

499
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,080
 And you're like, "Man, I really want to eat some roasted pig right now."

500
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,680
 And you go, "Hey, how much for a piece of roasted pig?"

501
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,880
 And she goes, "What is this? Is it for sale? This is my front yard."

502
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,520
 And I'm cremating my favorite pig.

503
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,640
 This was my pet, Dolores, and she just died today.

504
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,040
 And you're thinking, "Well, you know, that's sad. Your friend died."

505
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,840
 "Your friend smells really good."

506
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:28,080
 So then when the old lady goes inside to answer the phone,

507
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,480
 you see another three days waiting for someone to call her.

508
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,760
 You're waiting to make your move.

509
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,400
 You're like, "Does she not have any friends? How come no one's calling her?"

510
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,800
 Finally, she gets a call from the local bridge club.

511
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,240
 It's time to play.

512
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,600
 You sneak in and you take a bite of this pig that's been roasting for three days.

513
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,000
 You're just that hungry.

514
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,760
 You could have went back and got some pizza, but nope.

515
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,120
 You take a bite of this roasted pig.

516
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,880
 You eat a part of Dolores.

517
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,760
 And as you're running away because you have such horrible food poisoning,

518
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,400
 you're like, "Where's the nearest hospital? I didn't know Salmonella."

519
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
 I hit that quickly.

520
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,440
 I just took a bite two seconds ago.

521
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,960
 As you're running away, the old lady's yelling at you, "You're cursed.

522
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,240
 You're cursed."

523
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,520
 Then you're like, "Yeah, I know. I know."

524
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,640
 I'm basically evacuating my bowels as I'm running down the street.

525
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,600
 But that's not the curse.

526
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,040
 See, if you pick number two, you wake up in the next day and you're all sweaty and stuff.

527
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,520
 You're like, "Man, I was really... I probably shouldn't have been three-day old pork.

528
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,040
 Probably shouldn't have done that."

529
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,000
 And then you get up out of bed and you go, "Man, that's weird.

530
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,320
 My bed is a lot bigger than it used to be."

531
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,440
 Like, it's taller because you don't realize now that you're only five feet tall.

532
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,640
 And then you're walking to your bathroom and you're like, "That's weird.

533
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
 I didn't look at any part of your body at this point."

534
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,480
 You're just looking straight ahead.

535
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,440
 You're like, "That's weird.

536
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,400
 I feel like I'm waddling a bit more than I usually do."

537
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,440
 I don't know.

538
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,360
 And then you walk into the bathroom and you don't look in the mirror.

539
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
 You start brushing your teeth and you're like, "That's weird.

540
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,880
 My tusks.

541
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,040
 My tusks are a lot sharper than they used to be."

542
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,520
 And then you look and you have hooves.

543
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,400
 You're a pig person.

544
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,960
 You're a pig person now.

545
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,720
 Now, I would argue being a pig person is far worse than being a bigfoot.

546
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,760
 I don't think anyone would disagree with me on that.

547
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,880
 Maybe Bennett.

548
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,600
 Bennett is our official pig man official not-to-all-this-podcast.

549
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,720
 He sent me a list of all 50 states of pig man in each state.

550
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,000
 I'm still going through that list.

551
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,640
 Thanks, Bennett.

552
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,120
 It's a fun list.

553
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,160
 But what can you do economically wise as a pig person?

554
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,720
 Right?

555
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,480
 You can go join the Freak Show.

556
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,560
 I guess probably we're going to wait all these on how much money you can make being this monster.

557
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,640
 Bigfoot, you could rake it in.

558
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,200
 Right?

559
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,040
 You could either make money officially like being a pro wrestler or having a reality show

560
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,800
 or you could just rob banks.

561
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,120
 Right?

562
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,680
 But as a pig person, the only thing I can imagine you doing is joining a Freak Show or

563
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,800
 like having sex with other pigs, like not pig people.

564
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:08,000
 Like you actually resorted to having sex to other pigs and then you could sell the babies

565
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,840
 to a food company.

566
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,600
 Like that's the only thing I can think of.

567
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,800
 You are basically selling your children to Oscar Meyer.

568
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,480
 You're like, "Kids, it's your first day of school.

569
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,800
 You got like 50 kids in the back of your car."

570
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,160
 And you take them down to the Oscar Meyer factory and they're like, "What?

571
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,280
 Where are the desks, Dad?

572
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,240
 Where are all the books?"

573
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,080
 And you're like just kicking them out one after the other.

574
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,160
 You're like, "Oh, you'll find those books eventually."

575
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,280
 Look for the loudest machine covered in blood.

576
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,320
 That's where the library is.

577
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,960
 That's the only way I could think you could do it.

578
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,480
 But again, I don't even think this pig person knows what money is.

579
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,680
 This pig person is just collecting clothes from around town.

580
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,040
 And the reason why I think it's not just a cryptid but a transmogrified human,

581
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,960
 it was that it was still trying to retain some semblance of its humanity.

582
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,240
 That's why I was wearing the clothes.

583
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,840
 It might have even been wearing the clothes to kind of disguise itself.

584
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,080
 Right?

585
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,680
 But turning into a pig person would be the worst because that's truly like a beast.

586
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,520
 At least Bigfoot can look up and enjoy the sun and fade away, just...

587
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,680
 And kind of do cool stuff.

588
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,440
 The pig person won't fight and it's probably dead.

589
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,800
 The next day the garbage crew probably came out and they're like,

590
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,640
 "Well, look at this course.

591
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,040
 Who murdered this poor pig person?"

592
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,000
 And the other guy's like, "Don't worry about it, Marcus.

593
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,640
 Just throw it in the back like all the other trash."

594
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,560
 And they're like, "I guess the police don't need to be notified of this murder."

595
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,040
 And as you pick up this pig person's corpse and you throw it into the back of the garbage truck

596
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,800
 and it's covered in empty cup of noodle containers and there's some soy sauce spilling all over it

597
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,880
 from some leftover Chinese food, as you throw it into the back of the garbage truck,

598
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
 all of a sudden you get super hungry.

599
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,680
 You're like, "Hmm.

600
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
 I wonder if anyone will know."

601
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,600
 And you take a bite out of its giant belly.

602
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,520
 You go, "Nope.

603
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,360
 I think I got away with that Scott."

604
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,880
 And you start turning into a pig.

605
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,240
 So that is the pig person of Portugal.

606
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,640
 A crazy story about someone who got transferred.

607
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,800
 We got two more people.

608
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,160
 I'm like, "Come on, Jason.

609
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,960
 Come on.

610
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,760
 We got two more.

611
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,280
 I know this episode is going to run long.

612
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,680
 I don't get to do a lot of these multiple choice episodes.

613
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,720
 I really do enjoy them.

614
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,600
 Piddle poo.

615
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,920
 Let's go ahead and give you the hair hang glider.

616
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,280
 We're leaving behind Portugal.

617
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,360
 We're going to glide all the way out

618
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,440
 to a small town in America."

619
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,000
 I found the story online kind of same setup, right?

620
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,200
 We don't know the person's name.

621
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,720
 They posted it anonymously.

622
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,120
 We're going to go ahead and call this person Aaron.

623
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,360
 So Aaron, he's 13 years old, and he's actually hanging out with his pops.

624
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,920
 His dad has a job in this small town.

625
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,440
 This isn't where he grew up.

626
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,720
 But he's traveling with his dad.

627
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
 His dad has some business in this small town.

628
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,600
 And that's why he's here.

629
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,960
 And he says, "We're going to do a small town."

630
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,640
 And he's like, he has to emphasize,

631
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,400
 this is a small town.

632
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,720
 He goes, "The entire place was just a couple streets."

633
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,840
 And there weren't a lot of people around.

634
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,120
 And it felt creepy.

635
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,880
 One, he's not familiar with the city, right?

636
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,400
 He's not familiar with the town.

637
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,520
 Also, he's 13 years old,

638
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,920
 so it doesn't have true control over his environment.

639
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,000
 But then the fact that you add on top of it,

640
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,440
 it seems to be abandoned.

641
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,360
 It's not really abandoned,

642
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,840
 but there's no people kind of walking around the town.

643
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
 He leaves them with an eerie feeling.

644
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,080
 He compares it to being in the twilight zone.

645
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,160
 And his dad, while he's on this trip,

646
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,440
 he goes, "Oh, you know what I need to do?

647
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,720
 I need to buy a tie.

648
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,920
 I need to buy a tie."

649
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,320
 So he goes into a store to buy a tie.

650
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,400
 And Aaron's like, "This trip's already super boring.

651
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,880
 I didn't think you could get any more boring."

652
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,480
 And now you're tie shopping.

653
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,840
 Dad, I'm going to hang out outside.

654
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,200
 And Dad's like, "Yeah, sure, go ahead."

655
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
 13 years old, you're allowed to kind of wander around.

656
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,440
 So Aaron walks out of the store,

657
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,880
 and he's kind of looking up and down the street.

658
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,080
 It's just empty.

659
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,520
 Doesn't seem to be anything going on.

660
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,080
 Nothing of an interest to a 13-year-old boy.

661
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,040
 And he turns, and he looks, and there's an alleyway

662
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,920
 in between the store that his dad's at and the next building.

663
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,040
 And he sees this alleyway,

664
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,840
 and he sees a dumpster in the alleyway.

665
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,040
 And on the other side of the dumpster,

666
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:06,320
 he sees a pair of legs sticking out.

667
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
 Not like sticking out of the dumpster,

668
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,440
 like there's a body in there,

669
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,760
 but as if someone is slumped against the wall

670
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,320
 on the other side of the dumpster.

671
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,680
 So he can't see anything about them.

672
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,840
 All Aaron can see is this figure's pants.

673
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,720
 Sitting down in this prone position,

674
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,320
 and he realizes something.

675
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
 He goes, "That's a nice pair of pants.

676
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,160
 That's a nice pair of clean gray slacks.

677
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,960
 I don't think that's a hobo's pair of pants.

678
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,840
 I think there's a dead body on the other side of that dumpster."

679
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,240
 And he's 13 years old, and he's like,

680
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
 "Cool, cool, there might be a dead body in this town.

681
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,160
 There's no one around.

682
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,680
 The place seems super sus,

683
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,480
 and I might find a murder victim."

684
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,360
 And he starts to walk over past the dumpster

685
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,800
 to see, because he's curious, right?

686
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
 He wants to see if it's a dead body.

687
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,160
 He turns and he looks, and it's not a dead body.

688
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,840
 It's not a bum.

689
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,560
 It's a life-size vinquilitrist dummy.

690
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,760
 And when he says life-size, he goes,

691
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,440
 "It's an adult-sized vinquilitrist dummy."

692
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
 He goes, "I come around the corner,

693
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,640
 and it's dressed in clothes."

694
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,680
 He's wearing these gray slacks.

695
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,280
 He's wearing a shirt, apparently.

696
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,040
 I don't think it had rippling abs.

697
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,240
 And it has a wooden head.

698
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,600
 When he goes, he posted a picture of a dummy.

699
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,440
 He goes, "This is exactly what it looked like.

700
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,240
 It had the wooden eyes and the wooden jaw,

701
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,560
 and you could see where the jaw mechanism

702
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,920
 would allow it to go up and down."

703
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,280
 And it's just laying there.

704
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,720
 It's head against the side of the dumpster.

705
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,400
 Like someone was throwing this away,

706
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,840
 which would make sense, right?

707
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,000
 Because these dolls are so creepy.

708
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,760
 People buy it when they go, "Yeah, never mind.

709
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,840
 I don't want to get haunted by this in the middle of the night."

710
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,440
 Throw it away.

711
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,400
 So this life-sized, adult-sized male vinquilitrist dummy

712
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,000
 is leaning up against this dumpster,

713
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,600
 kind of slouched on the ground.

714
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,160
 And he goes, "I looked at its head."

715
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,360
 And he goes, "Very sunny.

716
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,760
 The sun was penetrating through the alleyway.

717
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,880
 It wasn't some spooky alleyway in Portugal late at night."

718
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,600
 He goes, "I can clearly see that its face was wood."

719
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,800
 It's a vinquilitrist dummy, obviously, right?

720
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,680
 Has a wooden neck, wooden head, wooden eyes, wooden hair.

721
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,600
 And that is when Aaron kind of looks down,

722
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,520
 looking over the dummy, and looks down at its hands.

723
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,880
 And it has human hands.

724
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,840
 He said, unmistakably, human hands.

725
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,680
 He goes, "You could see the hair on it,

726
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,560
 the way the skin was underneath the sunlight,

727
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,520
 the fingernails, all indicators that these were not wooden hands.

728
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,240
 This was real-life human hands."

729
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,360
 And when he saw that, it kind of took him aback.

730
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
 And he looked back up.

731
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,160
 He looked at the dummy straight in its face,

732
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,280
 and then the dummy looked back.

733
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,600
 He said, "I watched those dead wooden eyes turn

734
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,320
 and stare directly at me."

735
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,520
 He ran out of the alleyway right when his dad was coming out of the store,

736
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,800
 and his dad was kind of starting to look like,

737
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,000
 "Is everything okay?"

738
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,280
 And Aaron goes, "Yeah, sure.

739
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,160
 Let's just get out of here."

740
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,080
 And dad's like, "Okay, whatever.

741
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,200
 I got my tie.

742
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,920
 Whatever you're doing.

743
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,440
 Did you murder someone back there?

744
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,000
 No, no, no, no."

745
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,560
 They went on their way, and he goes, "Listen,

746
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,280
 here's the thing.

747
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,080
 So he posted, this story happened when he was 13.

748
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,880
 We'll assume he's at least in his 20s by now."

749
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
 He goes, "Listen, I get it.

750
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,760
 That's impossible.

751
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,440
 Lifesize bin quilatrous dummy, sure those exist.

752
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,440
 The Jeff Dunham probably has one in his closet of you right now.

753
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,800
 He's making dummies of people.

754
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,160
 That's my new conspiracy theory.

755
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,400
 He traps people's souls in those dolls.

756
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,360
 He goes, "Listen, could have been a mask.

757
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,480
 Right?

758
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,400
 Could have been a guy in a mask.

759
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,560
 But it didn't look like a mask."

760
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,400
 He goes, "There were no seams to it.

761
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,360
 There was nothing to it that would make me think it was a mask."

762
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,840
 And he goes, "And it was wood.

763
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,440
 The whole thing was wood all the way down to the neck

764
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,640
 that was visible to him.

765
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
 And I watched those eyes roll towards me.

766
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,640
 The hands were unmistakably human.

767
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,200
 The head was unmistakably that of a bin quilatrous dummy."

768
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,560
 Now you could argue that, you know, I'm sure that there really are six foot tall

769
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,160
 of bin quilatrous dummies.

770
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,280
 I'm sure people have those.

771
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,000
 But they tend to have wooden hands as well.

772
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,680
 He goes, "It had human hands and have been quilatrous dummies' head.

773
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
 And the eyes moved and looked at me.

774
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,440
 They weren't human eyes.

775
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,280
 These wooden orbs with painted pupils on them went, 'Yep.'

776
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,480
 So if you picked the number one, this is your fate.

777
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,880
 Not only are you turning into something against your will,

778
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,680
 but you're completely inanimate.

779
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,160
 You're really a monstrosity at that point.

780
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,360
 I mean, to be fair, the big person was awful as well.

781
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,400
 But you were mobile.

782
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,480
 This person is laying against a dumpster.

783
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,520
 Probably placed there, right?

784
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,080
 This story of man slowly turning into a bin quilatrous dummy.

785
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,040
 I mean, I almost boggles my mind about how scary that would

786
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,080
 be. One, you're losing all motor function.

787
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,200
 And did someone take him here and drop him off at the dumpster,

788
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,640
 knowing that by the time the garbage men will get there,

789
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,840
 he'll be all wooden.

790
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,840
 And someone will be like, "I'll just throw him in the dumpster."

791
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,520
 No eating him this time.

792
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,640
 Throw him in the dumpster and then you spend the rest of your life.

793
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,280
 You know, you're all going to live multiple lives until all this wood

794
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,320
 is slowly rotted away at some dump somewhere.

795
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,160
 They take your wooden body and throw it in the dumpster,

796
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,680
 and then you're putting some landfill.

797
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,560
 And every day more and more trash is being piled on top of you,

798
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,840
 and your wooden eyes are just staring at garbage

799
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,200
 until you can't even see that anymore,

800
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,280
 until you're just in this blackness.

801
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,800
 Because there's tons of trash above you, and you can feel it.

802
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,000
 It may not be painful, but you can feel the sensation of the vermin

803
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,480
 eating your body, chewing away at your wooden legs,

804
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,040
 little termites crawling into your eyeballs, slowly dissolving them.

805
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:18,000
 And the weather and time both team up to whittle your body away into nothingness.

806
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,120
 And you better pray that when there's just a toothpick of your body left,

807
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,080
 that your soul has been released from this torment, right?

808
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,920
 That's terrifying.

809
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,280
 That's so creepy to me.

810
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,440
 So if you picked number one, that's you.

811
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,840
 You were turned into a vinquilitrous dummy against your will,

812
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,240
 assuming you don't have some terrible fetish.

813
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,720
 You're like, oh, you're rewinding that part over and over again.

814
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,520
 You're like, yes.

815
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,760
 Finally, someone talked about my dissolving fetish.

816
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,080
 You're turned into this puppet, and you just slowly rotted away

817
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,920
 over the course of 70 years as the garbage is piling up on top of you.

818
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,520
 Because there's nothing you can do, right?

819
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,040
 Just like, at least the tree.

820
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,680
 I always use the tree example because it terrifies me.

821
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,880
 But I mean, at least you could probably make friends with other trees and stuff like that.

822
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,600
 Maybe you shake your branches and scare some local campers.

823
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,960
 Maybe you love looking at squirrels.

824
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
 Maybe you love being in the outdoors.

825
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,680
 Nobody loves trash other than Templeton the Rat, and he was a fictional character.

826
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,440
 You're just laying in trash.

827
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,320
 And that, honestly, I would argue might be your best case scenario as a marionette puppet,

828
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,720
 because there's another option where someone sees you there and takes you home,

829
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
 and actually starts using you as a marionette puppet.

830
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,640
 You're sitting in some kids' closet, and they're like,

831
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,560
 "Mom, mom, I'm going to play that marionette game that you and dad really, really hate,

832
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,200
 because it's creepy."

833
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,520
 And they're like, "Why'd you bring that thing home, Jerry?"

834
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,200
 And the little boy sticks his hand up in your back and starts moving your mouth.

835
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,600
 And you're like, "I'm your best friend."

836
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,200
 And he's putting all these words in your mouth.

837
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,640
 You're like, "I don't sound like that.

838
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,160
 I don't sound like a big old weirdo."

839
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,480
 He's making you watch Paw Patrol all day long.

840
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
 You're like, "I'd rather be in trash."

841
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,280
 Nick Jr.

842
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,200
 You're watching all this stuff.

843
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,480
 Like, you're picking your poison on that one, but you have no recourse.

844
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,160
 And the fact that the transformation seems to be happening fairly slowly, right?

845
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,160
 Like, parts of them are still human, makes me think that this is a torment.

846
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,440
 It'd be one thing to wake up tomorrow, and all of a sudden, I'm a cockroach.

847
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,680
 It'd be another thing for me to slowly turn into a cockroach over the course of about four months,

848
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:21,920
 right?

849
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,080
 You're trying to go to work and trying to be normal,

850
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,120
 but you're constantly like throwing up on food and eating and stuff like that.

851
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,920
 The movie, "The Fly."

852
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,760
 That was another movie that terrified me.

853
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,360
 Like, even the original Vincent Price thing, having a human head and being on a flight.

854
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,000
 And I think that's why zombies scare me so much,

855
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,800
 because it's turning into something beyond your control.

856
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,280
 So yeah, if you pick number one, you get to choose.

857
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,360
 It's either a tire lifetime of watching Nick Jr.

858
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,520
 and constantly being handed down from generation to generation through this family.

859
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,200
 Sure, the place is air conditioned,

860
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,720
 but you're constantly having kids stick their arms up your back and making you say stuff,

861
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,160
 and you don't sound like that.

862
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,520
 Your voice does not sound like that.

863
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,880
 They're always doing the worst voices.

864
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,960
 Or rotting in trash.

865
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,400
 I think those are the only two possible options.

866
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,120
 I guess you could probably get a part in an RL Stein movie.

867
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,760
 You can be a stunt double, but other than that, you're pretty much boned.

868
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,440
 But we got one more to cover.

869
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,320
 This is for all you number fours out there.

870
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,480
 Pittlepoo, let's toss you the keys of the carbonicopter.

871
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,320
 We're leaving behind this small town.

872
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,920
 We're traveling to a local playground.

873
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,640
 It's funny.

874
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,520
 All the stuff we talk about on the show, ghosts and aliens and UFOs,

875
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,800
 we've talked about it once or twice on this podcast.

876
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,680
 I believe that this type of phenomenon can happen.

877
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,560
 Right?

878
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,240
 I'm not just a mainstream paranormal believer.

879
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,520
 I do believe in magic.

880
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,040
 I do believe in transmogrification.

881
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,120
 That might make me sound like an idiot.

882
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,920
 You're saying you really think a person could become a vinquilitrous dummy?

883
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,160
 Yes!

884
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,960
 Yes, I do think it's possible.

885
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,000
 Do I think it's likely?

886
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,840
 No, do I think it's super rare?

887
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,160
 Yes!

888
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,480
 I think the chances of it ever happening to any of us is super rare.

889
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,360
 But if you pick any of these four numbers that happen to you,

890
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,040
 I think that's why it disturbs me so much, especially this last story.

891
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,040
 Obviously, I've saved the most, for me, disturbing for last.

892
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,720
 We're in Florida.

893
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,120
 We're headed out to this preschool playground.

894
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,160
 Yay!

895
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,480
 Kids are running around having fun, picking up sticks and throwing them at bugs.

896
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,120
 And just doing kid stuff, right?

897
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,320
 Learning about the world by throwing stuff at bugs.

898
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,520
 That's the way all children learn.

899
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,040
 And this guy who posted this, he didn't post his name.

900
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,480
 We're going to go ahead and call him Charlie.

901
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,840
 He was playing with his friends.

902
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,200
 They're running around this playground.

903
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,280
 And as Charlie and his friends are playing,

904
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,640
 their attention is suddenly drawn towards the play structure.

905
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,560
 There is this jungle gym that is in the middle of the playground.

906
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,840
 And Charlie and his friends look over and they notice that there's a

907
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,400
 crowd gathered around the jungle gym.

908
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,560
 And it wasn't that there was just a bunch of kids.

909
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,800
 A couple of the staff was there as well.

910
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,680
 There was a couple of adults also gathered around the bottom of the jungle gym.

911
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,480
 The way he described the jungle gym, it was two stories.

912
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,920
 Not actually 20 feet up, but you had these support beams and a wall.

913
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,560
 And you have this kind of shaded area underneath the jungle gym

914
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,880
 that had benches, wooden benches, the whole thing is made of wood.

915
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,920
 And he goes and then when he gets to the top,

916
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,400
 when he climbed to the top of the jungle gym, there's a slide.

917
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,080
 But all of these adults and all these kids are gathered around the bottom of the play structure.

918
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:46,240
 And Charlie and his friends walk over there and they see what everyone is looking at.

919
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,760
 Attached to the play structure, like if you tied it to one of the support beams,

920
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,120
 is a domino mask.

921
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,560
 You know what that is?

922
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,880
 That's like the mask that Robin wears.

923
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,720
 It's like, or Zorro.

924
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,200
 It's a black mask that sits on the face.

925
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,880
 It's usually attached with cloth.

926
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,280
 Nowadays it's attached with like an elastic strap, a little cheap little Halloween one.

927
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,840
 But it's a domino mask and it has the eye holes cut out so you can see out of it.

928
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,680
 And just attaches to your head and he goes at the play structure.

929
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,040
 We see this domino mask, but this mask has eyes.

930
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,440
 Not fake eyes.

931
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:34,640
 Where the eye holes were, there was two human eyeballs staring out.

932
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:45,280
 And he goes, it's not like, the way he described it was the eyeballs are actually protruding from the mask.

933
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,360
 These masks, like the Zorro mask, is always worn very tight to the face.

934
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,920
 But these eyeballs were actually kind of poking out of the mask.

935
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,840
 And they were moving back and forth.

936
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,480
 There's no other thing on this play structure that makes it look like there's a living entity anywhere.

937
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,360
 Except for this domino mask with these eyeballs that are quickly darting back and forth.

938
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,840
 And everyone's just staring at these and the eyes are staring back.

939
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,040
 He can actually see the eyes look down at the kids and look up at the adults.

940
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,840
 Then look at another kid, then look at another kid, then look back up.

941
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,640
 And he goes, the eyeballs were protruding from the mask and they were bloodshot.

942
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,560
 And the feeling he got from these eyes that they were in a state of panic.

943
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:39,120
 The way they moved, the way they physically looked, the bloodshot nature of them.

944
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:44,000
 It felt like these eyes were overcome by desperation.

945
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,280
 And he said, we all stood there for a couple minutes.

946
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,040
 You can't make sense of this, right?

947
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,960
 It's not fake, not robot eyes, not plastic eyes, not wooden eyes.

948
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,360
 There's no one disguised as a play structure.

949
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,080
 It's a domino mask attached to this play structure and the eyeballs are moving back

950
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,680
 and forth rapidly as they're slightly protruding from this mask.

951
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,760
 How do you even rationalize that?

952
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,160
 He says, we all kind of stood there for a couple minutes and then the adults ushered us away back into class.

953
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,320
 He said he posted that story before, right?

954
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,120
 He, I read the second time he posted it.

955
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,560
 He said, I posted this before and I got some feedback and people said,

956
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,560
 if that, they didn't believe the story obviously because it just doesn't make sense.

957
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,000
 And they go, if that story was true then, you know, it would have been in the newspaper.

958
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,280
 And he goes, yeah, I guess so.

959
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,400
 But I know what I saw.

960
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,680
 He goes, you could probably think it was a dream or I was imagining,

961
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,160
 but it was such a lucid memory.

962
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,280
 I remember that.

963
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,040
 The skeptical answer saying it would have to be in the newspaper.

964
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,640
 No, there's a lot of stuff that should be in the newspaper that isn't in the newspaper.

965
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,440
 You could go chasing clearly living eyes would be in the newspaper.

966
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:00,480
 But the thing is, is that who's going, what adult there is going to risk their reputation

967
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,680
 by calling the police because they saw a mask with human eyeballs looking at them.

968
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,960
 You're not touching the thing, right?

969
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,200
 You're going to leave it there.

970
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,480
 You're going to call the cops.

971
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,440
 I mean, you go, yes, Jason, you would obviously call the cops if you saw something this metaphysical.

972
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,640
 But then the cops show up, you go back out there, it's gone.

973
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,560
 You wouldn't stand out there by yourself, right?

974
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,920
 You would be like, Hey, I want to call the cops.

975
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,280
 I'm going to call the cops from here.

976
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,080
 And you're like, wait, everybody is there leaving you alone with this mask.

977
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,840
 I think the only thing you could do, and I think this is something that most people do,

978
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,200
 is they just walk away.

979
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,960
 We see that situation happen all the time.

980
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,720
 So what was this mystery mask?

981
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,120
 Well, if you picked number four, you're about to find out.

982
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,120
 Your eyeballs.

983
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,360
 I don't know what else to say.

984
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,200
 Your set of eyeballs.

985
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,440
 I'm actually recording this ending.

986
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,640
 The audio quality probably sounds totally different.

987
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,120
 I'm recording this ending like four days.

988
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,840
 I'm having a batch of bunch of episodes because I have a trip coming up.

989
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,440
 I'm getting a bunch of episodes done.

990
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,480
 And I've been thinking for the past four days how to end the episode.

991
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,680
 You're just a set of eyes.

992
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,720
 You can't make any money being eyeballs, right?

993
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,680
 You're just a mask.

994
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,000
 It's terrifying though, right?

995
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,040
 You think that's what's coming.

996
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,240
 You're like, "Oh, let me guess. Jason's going to spend four days and he'll come up with..."

997
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,360
 It's spooky.

998
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,400
 I mean, think about it this way.

999
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,200
 Think about it this way.

1000
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,080
 I look at it.

1001
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,160
 You can't make any money doing it.

1002
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:34,880
 And if you were a mouth, at least you could get the enjoyment of eating things, right?

1003
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,840
 That's so scary, this little mouth.

1004
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,960
 Imagine you were...

1005
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,800
 I was thinking if it was crawling around, you'd be tasting the dirt the whole time,

1006
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,880
 just to get to a yummy cheeseburger.

1007
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,760
 Let's give you this.

1008
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,520
 At least you're like a floating mouth.

1009
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,480
 You're like the mouth.

1010
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,800
 At the height of a human.

1011
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,760
 So it's like you're floating around about five feet.

1012
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,800
 You're going, "Nomp, nomp, nomp."

1013
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,800
 That'd be pretty dope because you could taste stuff.

1014
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,280
 You're like waiting for all the fast food workers to leave.

1015
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,000
 You're all, "Hehehe, you're sneaking in, swimming in the milkshake machine."

1016
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,680
 That'd be dope.

1017
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,800
 I would be tough just to work clear, universe.

1018
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,520
 If you want to turn me into just a mouth, I can make that work.

1019
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,280
 But eyeballs?

1020
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,240
 That'd be the worst, man.

1021
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,720
 Like even if you were a floating pair of eyes, you would just be able to see stuff all the time.

1022
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,280
 And it wouldn't even be like, "Well, I'm just floating eyeballs."

1023
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,040
 I'm going to like float into some sexy woman's house.

1024
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,960
 Basically now you're just a super villain.

1025
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,320
 But then what?

1026
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,200
 You see like a sexy lady you have no other parts to.

1027
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,120
 You're like, "Oh, I'm just a pair of eyeballs."

1028
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,360
 They're going, "Oooh, God, they keep bouncing around.

1029
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,720
 Oooh, God, oooh, God."

1030
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,600
 Maybe you could go and look at a bunch of money and they could go, "Kaching!"

1031
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,680
 And they turn into little dollar signs.

1032
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,120
 But other than that, you're just a pair...

1033
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,480
 And this is not floating around.

1034
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,920
 This guy doesn't even have the ability that I made up to float around.

1035
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,920
 He's attached to a play structure.

1036
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,720
 You know what's interesting?

1037
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
 I was over the past four days,

1038
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,400
 because I was trying to figure out how to finish this.

1039
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,440
 I go, "I don't know if they actually said it was tied to the play structure.

1040
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,640
 It was just out of play structure.

1041
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,160
 I don't think it was going down the slide.

1042
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:02,800
 It's all weeee."

1043
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,200
 It might have been laying on a bench.

1044
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,800
 It might have been wrapped around a pole.

1045
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,240
 It really doesn't matter what it's attached to or if it's not.

1046
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,000
 It's a domino mask with eyeballs poking out of it and they're panicked.

1047
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,680
 Again, if the eyeballs looked like they were a little stoned

1048
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,520
 or they were enjoying a nice sunny day, I wouldn't be so scared.

1049
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,200
 But they're panicked.

1050
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,520
 Like, whatever happened to this dude to turn him into a mask, it's not good.

1051
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,600
 So if you picked that number, I don't remember what number it was.

1052
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,840
 It's so long ago I recorded the rest of that episode.

1053
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,320
 If you picked that number, this is you.

1054
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,880
 You're just a dude walking down the street one day and you're like,

1055
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,400
 "Oh man, this is totally awesome."

1056
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,360
 But then you go, "You know what?

1057
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,360
 It's like all the beautiful sights of the world.

1058
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,680
 Like, if I want to see kitten, I like look down.

1059
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,160
 And if I want to see a kite, I look up.

1060
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,840
 And if I want to see an ice cream, I look over there where the ice cream stand is.

1061
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,920
 I wish I could see everything."

1062
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,880
 The wishmaster, the wishmaster standing behind you and he goes,

1063
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,720
 "As you wish it."

1064
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,120
 And then all of a sudden you're just these eyeballs

1065
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,480
 and you take in every wonder of the known universe at once.

1066
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,960
 You see dying stars and black holes being born.

1067
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,800
 You see alien civilizations on the edge of the galaxy crumbling.

1068
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,760
 While new ones start across the universe, you're experiencing everything.

1069
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,640
 You literally see everything in one moment.

1070
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,240
 And now you're super bored.

1071
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,640
 Now you're just a pair of eyeballs at a preschool.

1072
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,880
 You're like, "Oh man, I have infinite wisdom,

1073
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,480
 but I have no mouth to share it with or no brain to process it."

1074
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,480
 I've been everywhere across all knowable reality.

1075
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,800
 I'm doing it at a preschool now you're a big ol' perp.

1076
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,200
 After you saw all the wonders of the universe, you're like,

1077
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,440
 "Ah, let's go see what those preschoolers are up to."

1078
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,400
 You wear it out so many ways now you're just chilling.

1079
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,400
 Now you're just chilling at a preschool and a bunch of kids walk up

1080
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,040
 and they get a couple of adults and they're all just staring at you.

1081
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,880
 And now you're just staring back.

1082
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,480
 You know all.

1083
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,680
 You've seen all.

1084
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,240
 But you can't do anything with that information.

1085
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,080
 You can't do anything with that knowledge.

1086
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,560
 You're just a pair of eyeballs staring out from a mask forever.

1087
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,760
 Forever.

1088
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,960
 Forever.

1089
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,200
 Was that ending good enough to take four days to come up with?

1090
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,800
 And I didn't even come up with that when I sat down to record.

1091
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,040
 I was like, "Oh, I hope something comes out that's semi-intelligible

1092
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,640
 and kind of entertaining."

1093
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,520
