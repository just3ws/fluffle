00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 A dive bar in the Pacific Northwest may hold more than just the best fish and chips you'll ever eat.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we take a look at the story of a man who wanted to be a superhero, but instead took the route of becoming a supervillain.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 When the governments of the world colluded to steal his technology, he decided the only way to fight back was to make people lose at family feud.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carviner. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hope you guys are having a lot of fun this holiday season.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Alex. Everyone give a round of applause to Alex.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 He's coming in on his brand new Segue Scooter. Are those still even being manufactured? Are they new?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 He's doing wheelies and stuff. Weeeeeee! Alex, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that. Just hope spread the word about the show. That also really, really helps out a lot.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Alex, as much as I'm tempted for everyone to climb on top of your back and you just segue us out to our first story, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 You can drive us on out to Bellingham, Washington. We've been here recently. We covered the steam stack.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So I know you know how to get there, Alex. Driving down the road here. This story was actually recommended to me by Brady Schmidt.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 He really loved the steam stack story. He's like, "Oh yeah, brought back childhood memories of Bellingham, Washington."

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 He's the smelling of burned bodies like I was the one who put the body in there. If you guys are gonna listen to that episode, I'll put it in the show notes.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 It's a pretty cool mystery, but Brady sent me this story about the same town up there. So Alex drives us up to the Waterfront Tavern.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 It's a little dive bar that surprisingly got 4 out of 5 stars. Long time listeners of the show know I love reading bad reviews.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 So when Brady sent me over this story about this bar, I was like, "Oh dude, I bet you the reviews are super disgusting."

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And I'm disappointed to tell all you guys it actually has really good service and food. Apparently it's the best fish and chips in town.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 People go, "Aw man, you're like, "Chase, this has just become a food review podcast." I wish.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 But fish and chips, if you ever find yourself there, go check out the fish and chips.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 But as we walk into this tavern, we see a little booth. We sit down, we grab the menus. We're not just here for the fish and chips that I've now mentioned 15 times.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 The reason why the Waterfront Tavern is known other than their delicious fish and chips is this. The door swings open.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I imagine it's like an old saloon door. I'm sure it's a modern door, but...

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And a shadowy figure walks in. We all kind of look over at him. He takes a seat.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Bartender goes, "Hey, what's up, Ted?" And the guy just kind of nods and we're like, "Oh, okay."

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 The door opens again. Another guy walks in and the bartender's like, "Hey, I haven't seen you around in a long time. I didn't write your name down in my notes, but I know what you're known for. Why don't I get you a drink and you can strangle it?"

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 What? What does that even mean? How do you strangle a drink?

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Door opens again. Another guy walks in and the bartender goes, "Hmmm. John... Yeah, John, I remember you.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 John Muhammad. Come over here and sit down and have a drink." He sits down next to the guy, strangling his drink.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 After a couple of minutes, we start to recognize these guys. Ted, isn't that just any Ted? It's Ted Bundy, serial killer.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And then the guy who was strangling his drink that I wrote down in my notes, but you wouldn't have known the name anyways. I didn't know it.

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He was one of the hillside stranglers. And then John Muhammad, if you are a boomer, like myself, a proud boomer, you should all know the name, John Muhammad.

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 He was one of the Beltway Snipers. That was an amazing true crime story. I'd love to cover it. I feel like it's pretty well known.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 I like to cover more obscure stuff. But the Beltway Sniper story, I remember watching on the news and it was like this mass shooting.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 It was a spree killing, actually, is what it is where you kill a lot of people over a short period of time. It's different than a serial killing or a mass shooting.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And nobody knew who was doing it. It was all over the Washington, D.C. area, the Beltway, and it went to other parts in Eastern states.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I honestly probably should do a little bit of a segment on it real quick.

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 The Beltway Sniper, again, I'm going off-memory. It happened in the early 2000s.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I know one of the conspiracies was that he was shooting a bunch of people at random. He shot a 12-year-old boy in the stomach at an elementary school.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It was truly random. But one of the targets that seemed to be kind of out of the way was a CIA analyst who was like grocery shopping.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And there was always the conspiracy theory out there that she was the real target. That everything else was just a cover to take her out.

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I remember, because you know, you steady true crime for so long, and you follow all this stuff, that they kind of built a profile of the killers.

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 They didn't know if there was one or two or multiple. Turns out there was two of them. But I remember in the news when they caught the killers, there were two African-American dudes.

46
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Actually, one was like 16 years old. And talk about a plot twist. Everyone was like, "What?" Everyone figured it was a white dude.

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 That was always the profile for this type of crime was a white dude. So huge plot twist. I remember, I don't know if I was eating popcorn when I heard that news, but if I was, I dropped it and choked on it at the same time.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Amazing plot twist. The weirdest thing, though, the weirdest detail to come out of the Beltway Sniper case.

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 It was him and his boy that there was always a rumor that they had some sort of relationship. I think he was 16 and John Muhammad was an adult.

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 There's always a rumor about that. But the day before they got arrested, this goes into that whole MK Ultra thing, which I think is...

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 We've talked about MK Ultra before. It did exist. I don't know if it goes to the level of the sex kittens that all the conspiracy theorists believe about now.

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 You're like, "Jason, don't just stop. Don't just say sex kittens." You have to explain that.

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Basically, that girls are bred. Like, Britney Spears and Katy Perry are sent to this program to turn into sluts.

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I don't think the government's like, "What should we do with this million dollars today? Let's turn Britney Spears into a slut."

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I don't believe in that. But you had this guy, he for what was it? A couple weeks?

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Again, this is all off memory. I didn't really prep this, but him and his partner were shooting people.

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 They had a car, it was like a dot center or something like that with a hole cut in the trunk and they would lay in the trunk and then just take shots.

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 After the... It was officer Moose. Chief Moose was the main cop who was after him.

59
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And he said, "Don't worry guys, your kids are safe." Like, I know this is totally random and then like two days later he shot a 12 year old in the stomach just to prove.

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Because the cop said that. It's a fascinating case. It's horrible. The kids survived.

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 But the day before they got arrested, I did write this down. I didn't know how much I'd go into detail with this, but I did write down this quote.

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 "Police Chief Charles Moose made this comment the day before they got arrested in an interview.

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 "You have indicated that you want us to do and say certain things. You have asked us to say, quote, 'We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose.

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 "We understand that hearing us say this is important to you."

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And Chief Moose told the media, "Don't... We want you to repeat this as often as you can and don't change a word of it."

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 They were like, "Well, normally we do that with quotes. We just rearrange words." He's like, "I know, but don't do that with this one.

67
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 "Repeat it as often as you can. Don't change a word of it."

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Four hours later, it wasn't even the next day. I'm looking over at my notes here. Four hours later, they were arrested.

69
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And there's always been that theory that that was some sort of code that shut off their programming.

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Like, that code was a signal for this to all end.

71
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 "We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose." You have asked us to say, "We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose."

72
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Four hours later, after weeks, long manhunt for these guys. And I think 12 people were killed.

73
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Again, I only took notes for the quote because I always thought that was fascinating. Weird story.

74
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 But let's go back to this bar because John Muhammad is sitting in this bar right now.

75
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 This bar is on Holly Street in Bellingham in Washington, and it has... Let me go back to the narrative.

76
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 It has a reputation for two things. Delicious fish and chips. And murderers, serial killers, hung out there over the years.

77
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Now, it wasn't just one boom year for serial killers. It wasn't like 1967. They had a party there. They had a convention. No.

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Over the decades, I mean, we're talking all the way from Ted Bundy to John Muhammad have been going here to drink.

79
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Now, mostly information, I want to say this too. I'm getting from an article written by Charlie Liduff.

80
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 He wrote it for The New York Times. So great article. Great work, Charlie. I'm giving you a thumbs up.

81
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 This bar is known to either attract serial killers or because of its location.

82
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 They say it's really the last stop before you head off into the wilderness of Canada or headed towards the wilderness of Alaska.

83
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 So it attracts a lot of freaks. Right? Because the only people who live in the woods are freaks.

84
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But yeah, they said Ted Bundy drank here, one of the hillside stringlers drank there.

85
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 There's a couple other names that I didn't recognize and then the Beltway Sniper.

86
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And it was funny because the bartender goes, "Yeah, you know, you get a lot of unsavory types in here, but I hated the Beltway Sniper.

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 He was terrible." I guess they said he was cheering on 9/11 and the guy's like, "I had half a mind to take him outside and beat his head in."

88
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 But then I'd go to jail. It's a short--that's the story. But I like it because it goes--and thank you for the recommendation, Brady.

89
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I like it because I've talked about this thing before. Not this particular bar, but this theory before.

90
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 That you can have holy places and peaceful places that attract holy and peaceful people.

91
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 You don't have a lot of serial killers hanging around, you know, the base of Mount Shasta trying to get in a little murria.

92
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 You have places that attract good people. Or when you're there, you feel the goodness envelop you.

93
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 You feel like, "Wow, this is a holy spot." It could be a grove of trees. It could be an ornately constructed cathedral.

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 But you can feel the spirit in you. And you feel at peace. And I've always said there should be an inverse of that.

95
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 If we have stars, the opposite of it's a black hole. I don't know. Don't science that. Don't science that.

96
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Don't go over to the scientist and say, "Is the opposite of a star a black hole?" They're like, "It's not how it works."

97
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But the opposite of a good place is a bad place. The opposite of a place that feels you with--and I'm not even talking about holy in the religious sense.

98
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I'm talking about you go to that glen that's outside your city and you walk around and you feel recharged.

99
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 So I'm not even talking about it being any particular religion. I'm talking about you feeling refreshed and good after you leave.

100
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 If you have those places, you have to have the inverse to it.

101
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Now, we as good people aren't attracted to those places. So we may just pass by them.

102
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 The convenience store on the side of the road, the clearing in the middle of the woods. We'll see those things.

103
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And we may stop by to pick up some chips at the convenience store, not the grove of trees.

104
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 But maybe we'll feel a little unsettled. It's sending us a weird message if we go there at all.

105
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 But to people who are driving down the road who are already intent on being evil, who already have that side in them, birthed and unleashed,

106
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 they're attracted to that convenience store. They're attracted to that bar.

107
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Obviously, the New York Times wasn't putting a metaphysical spin on this, but I think if you were a serial killer, viewer, or a murderer,

108
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 you were driving through the neighborhood, you're going to see all these restaurants, you're going to see Denny's, you're going to see McDonald's,

109
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 you're going to see an Arby's, and then you're going to see Waterfront Tavern.

110
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And that place speaks to the evil inside of you. I'm not saying the owners there are evil.

111
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 I don't even think they can do serial killing or just regular killing. And I don't even think it's their fault.

112
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It could have been something that happened on that land way before the Waterfront Tavern was even built.

113
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 That just acts like a beacon towards the worst of humanity.

114
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 So the next time you're driving through Bellingham, Washington, if you want to sit in a seat formally occupied by a lunatic,

115
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 take a seat at the Waterfront Tavern or Arby's or Arby's too, if Waterfront Tavern's, they both attract the most desperate of all humans.

116
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Take a seat at the Waterfront Tavern. You may find yourself enjoying great set of fish and chips, or you may feel right at home.

117
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 You feel recharged, refreshed. And if you do, well then, you're probably, if you go there and enjoy the food,

118
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 you're probably a bad person. You're probably an evil person. You just don't know yet.

119
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And as you're driving away, you look up in the rear-view mirror and your eyes are yellow.

120
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And it freeze frames. And then credits roll. And you're still trying to drive. There's much credits in your way.

121
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 You're like, "Ah, Alex, go ahead and call in that carpenter copter. We're going to get away from this menacing man

122
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 who can't drive when there's a bunch of letters and words in front of his face.

123
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Call in that carpenter copter. We are headed out to a small house in America."

124
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Alex is looking around. He's like, "There's like 300 million of these."

125
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I'm like, "I know, I know. There's a lot of small houses in America."

126
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Where we're going is to a particular man's house.

127
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He's like, "That doesn't help me. Alex, that doesn't help me at all."

128
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 I'm like, "Shh, just fly, Alex. Just fly."

129
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 This was sent to me by Fabio Nurbon. Send me a ton of stuff. Really, really good guy.

130
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 He's sending me a lot of great stories. I really appreciate that.

131
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 This one he sent to me, he found this one on Craigslist. He actually said, you know, "Listen to your show all the time."

132
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 You talk about Craigslist every once in a while. He's from another country. He goes, "I'm not going to dock some."

133
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 But Fabio, I always get it mispronounced, so probably mispronounced again.

134
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Fabio said, "You talk about Craigslist from time to time. I went to check it out. I wanted to see what Craigslist was all about."

135
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And he stumbled across a supervillain.

136
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Lightning is striking all around the Carbenter Cofter.

137
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Alex is starting to get a little sweaty, a little bit of sweat on his forehead, and I turn to him and I go, "No."

138
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 This means we're on the right path.

139
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Scott Patton is one of those really weird, complicated characters that's hard to draw a through line

140
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 to form some sort of narrative. So I'm going to try my best. That is my job, after all, is to figure out a way to tell these stories.

141
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 But Scott Patton, I guess the best way to sum it up is this. Scott Patton is a supervillain.

142
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 But like all supervillains, he had a noble beginning. He wanted to do something good.

143
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 He invented this machine that would be able to clean up radioactivity.

144
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 So we see a young Scott Patton node working on this device in his garage, and he has these special science goggles on and a lab coat.

145
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 "Eat, eat, eat!" He's looking at it, and he's like, "This is perfect! Some day, if there's any sort of nuclear disaster, all the world has to do is turn on my device.

146
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Everything will be saved, and I, Scott Patton, will be remembered as a hero."

147
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 "Eat, eat, eat!" He's putting his little finishing touches on it.

148
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 But then Fukushima happened.

149
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 The cookie monster showed up. Now that's supposed to be an earthquake.

150
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Fukushima, the Japanese nuclear reactor, started to leak into the ocean.

151
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And Scott Patton node realizes this is the perfect time, guys. This world may die unless my invention is used.

152
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 So let me go to the garage. What? Huh? He's not a very good actor. He opens the garage door and his device is gone.

153
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 All of his blueprints are gone. Everything about this device is gone.

154
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 You see, the governments of the world knew what Scott Patton node were up to.

155
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 So they broke into his house, stole everything, and left him with nothing.

156
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Now that narrative I just told you is more concise than like 50 of his videos.

157
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 The gist is, the government sold his device.

158
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 So he now no longer has the ability to save the world.

159
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Somebody does, but he's saying that they're not using it. Like, they took it from him so he couldn't save the world,

160
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 but they're not using it either, and Fukushima is slowly seeping into the ocean.

161
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 We're all gonna die soon. Soon being the year 2015, but somehow we're still here.

162
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 So what would you do if the government stole the invention you've been working on all this time?

163
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Most people would probably get really depressed.

164
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So a lot of people would make a stink on the media.

165
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Scott developed superpowers. So that's something you can put on your to-do list.

166
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Next time someone wrongs you just go, "err, err, err!"

167
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Do you remember this stuff back a couple years ago?

168
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 The Middle East got electrified. Do you remember that?

169
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 You remember about that in the news? Everyone in Syria, everyone in Saudi Arabia, that was...

170
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 If you do remember that, if you do remember that event that never happened,

171
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 you go to the doctor or that was Scott. Scott electrified the Middle East.

172
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Also, back in 2014, he sent out a message. He told everybody to put your beds on the second floor.

173
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 You remember that? I remember that. I actually do remember that.

174
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I was reading in the New York Times one day, headline, "Man says beds on the second floor."

175
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 That was it. There's no article just the headline. It was like, "What?"

176
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 He told us. He warned us back in 2014 to put our beds on the second floor.

177
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And guess what? Guess what? That tsunami hit Turkey.

178
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 That super famous tsunami that wiped out the country, but it didn't.

179
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 There was a tsunami, but no one died. It was just like a gentle wave.

180
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 The earthquake killed a bunch of people, but if your bed was on the second story of your house,

181
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 it's probably not a good place to be in an earthquake on the second story.

182
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 So he's developed these superpowers. You ask how? Why?

183
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 He has made an alliance. This is actually pretty smart. I hadn't thought of this.

184
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Who's a human's biggest enemies?

185
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Not the radiation that's seeping into the ocean due to Fukushima. It's the Draconians.

186
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 You see, the Reptilians actually came to Earth millions and millions of years ago,

187
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 and star-seated our planet. "Hey, we didn't evolve from monkeys, man. What are you talking about?"

188
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 "That didn't create us out of clay." No, the Draconians came down and made us out of ants.

189
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Took a little ants, right? And turned them into us.

190
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Which makes a lot of sense, because I was always wondering where my extra arms came from.

191
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 I hide them in my live streams, but I have several arms, and I do have an addiction to sugar,

192
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 so that makes so much sense. They are actually eating us. They've always been eating us,

193
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 but now they're helping out Scott take his revenge.

194
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So he has lightning powers, which is pretty cool. If I had any set of powers, they would be lightning powers.

195
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 So Scott, I've got him in. I'm a little jealous of that.

196
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 But I'm just a little jealous.

197
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 President Obama is more than jealous. President Obama is threatened by Scott Pattonode.

198
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Not only did President Obama send three different assassination teams against a man who could wield electricity,

199
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 a man who was the highest form of ant on the planet, and of course, they couldn't kill him.

200
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So, there are a couple of hit teams against Scott Pattonode. They totally lost.

201
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Scott Pattonode retaliates by punching politicians.

202
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Punching them. Remember that in the news? Actually, this is crazy, because you do remember this in the news.

203
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Scott Pattonode was punching people in the face, but he was doing it psychically.

204
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 So you know there's that big Adrenochrome conspiracy theory about all the celebrities having black eyes?

205
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Because either, depending on the theory, that's where they inject the Adrenochrome,

206
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 or it's a side effect of getting the Adrenochrome? No! You're wrong! You're wrong!

207
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Scott Pattonode is sitting in his house, and he imagines Dolly Parton walking on the street, and he's like...

208
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 He's making race car noises, and then Dolly Parton's like, "Ow, my eye!"

209
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And she moves her hand away in his big black eye. That's Scott Pattonode! He's punching these people in the eye.

210
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 So that's pretty dope. That's a dope superpower, right? Even if I didn't have the electricity thing.

211
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 If I could just psychically punch people in the eye, that'd be awesome.

212
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 But Obama's not gonna stand for that. Obama's not gonna stand for all of his Illuminati buddies getting punched in the eye.

213
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 So Obama killed all of Scott Pattonode's favorite celebrities.

214
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Scott Pattonode's at a graveyard, and he's looking at all these gravestones. Water... rain... what's supposed to be?

215
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Coming down from the sky. No lightning, though. Scott Pattonode is not in good mood. He's not making lightning appear.

216
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 He's looking at all these gravestones. Paul Walker. Great actor. Great actor.

217
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Leonard Nimoy. Obama killed Leonard Nimoy. Oh, Obama! Tom Clancy.

218
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Hmm. Heard of him. Heard of him. I know he makes video games. He's a big video game developer.

219
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Roger Moore. One of the best James Bond's out there. No... Prince? Did you know that Obama killed Prince?

220
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 I don't know if the theory is that Obama had Prince killed, but I want to imagine that Obama did it himself.

221
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He's like the final hitman in Scarface, and he's wearing the sunglasses, and he's got on the cool suit,

222
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 and he has the Sadov shotgun, and Prince is in there making music. Oh yeah, this sounds so much better if it took my pants off.

223
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 He's dancing all naked, and then behind him Obama has the Sadov shotgun. That'd be dope, but I don't know.

224
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 So, Prince... good. I'm not a huge Prince fan, but I respect his contributions to music. I think he's a musical genius.

225
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I just don't like that music. I'm a Michael Jackson fan myself. Paul Walker is amazing.

226
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 All these guys, Tom Clancy, world famous novelist, and then the last gravestone, one of his favorite celebrities.

227
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 This is nobody's favorite celebrity. This is not a single, if you ever asked any person, name seven of your favorite celebrities.

228
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Name 50 of your famous celebrities. Nobody names this one. Joan Rivers. I don't even think my grandma would have named Joan Rivers.

229
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Nobody says that. What's funny though is that there is a conspiracy theory that outside of Scott Pattonode, there is a conspiracy theory that Obama killed Joan Rivers.

230
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I don't want to say that's a real conspiracy theory, because it makes it sound like it's real, but that one's been going around for years,

231
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 because like two nights before Joan Rivers died, I think she had a botched plastic surgery operation, she said that Michelle Obama was a dude,

232
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 and so Obama was like Obama's eating dinner, he's like what?!

233
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Switzerland's like that's it. Go take her out. That's an old conspiracy theory.

234
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 One, that Joan Rivers was killed because she made that joke to like TMZ.

235
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Two, that's a long running conspiracy theory that Michelle Obama is really a dude.

236
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Like I was just looking at that conspiracy theory last night. I'm like has this not gone away yet?

237
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 He hasn't been president for five years now and this is still a conspiracy theory.

238
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So the birther thing has gone away quicker than Michelle Obama being a man conspiracy theory.

239
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 So that conspiracy theory I've seen other places. Both the Joan Rivers was killed and that Michelle Obama is a dude,

240
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 and the kids were adopted and all sorts of nonsense, but so that does exist outside of Scott Pattonode.

241
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 But anyway, so these are the people that Obama took out to really piss off Scott Pattonode.

242
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Scott makes claims he's an avatar of Jesus. His dad is Zeus.

243
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 So dad explains the lightning powers. I don't know what his dad's relationship is with the Draconians.

244
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 I don't know if, I know anything about it. Is he saying that Zeus actually came down to Earth 40-some odd years ago

245
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 and impregnated his mom? Or is that he's like from a lineage of Zeus?

246
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Or is Zeus literally like hey dad can borrow some money? And Zeus is like you're a demigod, you don't need money.

247
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Here's a cloud you can float around on. Scott's like oh yeah.

248
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Another power that Scott Pattonode has, probably the most devious one, because it truly targets the innocent,

249
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 not Obama's inchman. He can watch television. Everyone can do that. That's not his superpower.

250
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 But he'll watch game shows and he'll think you're wrong. Get it wrong. You don't know the answer.

251
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And as the dude is trying to figure out five things you do with buttermilk other than drink it on an episode of Family Feud

252
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 and they're trying to hit the buzzer, he, Scott Pattonode's like mm, mm, mm, mm, no.

253
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I hope you don't know the answer. There's only one thing you use buttermilk for.

254
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 But the people are puzzled. Scott Pattonode can actually make you lose at game shows. Family Feud.

255
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Wheel of Fortune. Those are the two he lists. But I'm sure it goes on and on.

256
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Ten thousand dollar pyramid. Tic Tac Toe people. Hollywood Squares. All of them. All the hits. All the great ones.

257
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Innocent people just trying to earn money. This is their only job. This is the only skill that they have is being on Wheel of Fortune.

258
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And you're taking the money out of their hands. How they're supposed to feed their kids.

259
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 With the showcase? They don't ever have bread. It's always just trips to like Brazil or something like that.

260
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 I need to put food on the table, Scott. Please don't let me get the whammy, Scott. I beg of you. No whammies.

261
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 But that's a lot of his craziness trying to compress that in to just a few minutes because he has 220 videos on this.

262
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 I want to step back for a second and take a look at a more personal side of Scott Pattonode.

263
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Because this is where I think it gets interesting. People make crazy claims online all the time, but I think this is where it gets really, really interesting.

264
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 We might go a little long on this one. Let me read you this comment that he left on one of his many blogs, many write-ups.

265
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 I was all over Facebook and Twitter and stuff like that. Again, Fabio, thanks for sending this over. Let me read you this. We are going to go a little long here.

266
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 I remember a few years back when I had a rat in the attic running around or a mouse or something and it was the winter time.

267
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 And I was getting mad at it running around the attic, so I began to wish death on it.

268
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And sure enough, one day it was running around the attic and I heard it and it landed on a nail and got stuck and died.

269
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 So therefore, I got the death I wished on it. Just like 20 years ago.

270
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 So he can kill rats with his mind. That thought ends. That was basically one long sentence and then we move right into this next example.

271
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Just like 20 years ago, the Kirby vacuum cleaner managers were yelling at me for not being able to sell a vacuum.

272
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 So I sat there and was... He just killed a rat, right?

273
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And now some guys are like, "Damn it, Scott! Can't you just sell at least one vacuum? How hard is it to sell vacuums door to door to people who don't need vacuums and people don't want to be disturbed in the middle of the afternoon? How hard is that?"

274
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Just like 20 years ago, the Kirby vacuum cleaner managers were yelling at me for not being able to sell a vacuum.

275
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 So I sat there and was wishing death on them and sure enough, later on that afternoon they ran a yellow light and had an oncoming old lady in the oncoming lane turning that turned when they didn't stop for the yellow light.

276
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And we ripped through her car and then hit a concrete telephone pole and well, the airbags blew when they hit the car. Sorry, I'm trying to keep the grammar right here.

277
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 But there is none. And we ripped through the car and then hit a concrete telephone pole and well, the airbags blew when they hit the car, but they didn't blow again when they hit the concrete telephone pole.

278
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I never saw those managers get out of the truck at all when the ambulance came. The two people next to me went in ambulances. I was really the only person in the accident that walked away.

279
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 We were standing on the street corner, we were looking at this car accident and you look over at me and I was like, "Dude, I don't..."

280
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 First off, airbags don't keep deploying. They're not bumper cars. It's not like every time you hit something, the airbags keep boop boop boop.

281
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 So the airbags will only deploy once. The idea that the people that he worked for had gotten a car accident and then apparently vanished,

282
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 they never left the... To this day, they've never left that vehicle. They're in a 5th dimensional Toyota Subaru. He never saw them again.

283
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 I'm assuming he didn't go back to work. But he's sitting in this car. The people who are driving the car, he wishes that they die. It's not a smart maneuver.

284
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Then he mentions there's two other people in the backseat with him. So he's basically turned the entire car into an unguided missile.

285
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 He knows what's gonna happen. He says, "But I never saw the people who were in the front seat never saw them again. They ceased to exist."

286
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 I try to find the birth certificates next to Obama's. None of them existed.

287
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Actually, now that we do have to go along in this episode, because I missed the whole thing, he's trying to kill everyone on the planet.

288
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 It's not only enough that he's going after Obama for killing Joan Rivers. He actually wants to kill all human life on the planet.

289
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 I don't know how I spaced on that. He wants to kill all of us. You can't be an ally to Scott. He's trying to warn us that he's going to murder us.

290
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 So the fact that he would turn the vehicle into this and not care about anyone in it, even the two people who weren't yelling at him, he doesn't care.

291
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 He wants everyone to die because this invention was stolen. He's not just punching. You might be like, "Oh yeah, dude, I hate the rich and the powerful. I wish I could psychically punch him in the eye."

292
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 But then he turns on you and his eyes are glowing red and he's electrocutes you. He wants to eliminate all humans on the planet.

293
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 That's his goal. So he went from being an inventor to wanting revenge so bad that he's willing to destroy the human race.

294
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 He envisions a future where there's nothing but him, the Draconians, and a Joan Rivers clone next to him to tell him jokes.

295
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I don't even know what Joan Rivers did, but anyway, we shall do that for the rest of time.

296
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 But let's step back here because I do want to talk a little bit about him personally. We have these grandiose visions, but then we find out he's a Kirby vacuum salesman.

297
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 He makes a lot of odd decisions in his YouTube videos. Some videos he's talking to the camera. Some videos it's slideshows, which is a fair format,

298
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 but each slide is like 10 different photos from a photo from his Facebook, a photo from his MySpace, if he has one.

299
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 But you know what I mean? Just for an example, a photo from this, that, and the other thing, there are these big mosaics photos he's taken of UFOs and chemtrails and things like that.

300
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 It's very, very bizarre. He goes out of his way to lie about his location, which is fine. Again, you're on the internet, you're lying about your location.

301
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 But then in one, I just happened to be watching this one YouTube video. He showed a screenshot of what appeared to be his cell phone that had his contact list on it.

302
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 So I'm immediately curious. I found the company whose number is listed. I found his address. I found his address in a matter of like 20 minutes, and I'm thinking,

303
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 he's put, and I'm not going to reveal it obviously, but he's put out 220 videos. He's trying to say he lives in the Southwest because he was afraid that ISIS was in Mexico, so he was trying to tell,

304
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 even some of the parts don't make sense, but he said that he lived in this specific Southwest state, and then he said he was going to go to Mexico, and then Obama moved ISIS to Mexico.

305
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And he said he tricked everyone, but then I found out he doesn't live anywhere in that region at all. He lives much, I'm not going to reveal his address, but I thought that was weird.

306
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 I thought that was really weird, and then I was able to actually match up photos of that area to photos he was taking.

307
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 So it's interesting to see someone who goes out of their way to create fake profiles showing they live in one location, and then goof up so, so battling so consistently that you can read street signs when he's taking photos going,

308
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 I took this photo outside of my house of a UFO, and it's a clear shot of a street sign that's only in that neighborhood.

309
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Very, very weird thing. You're like, Jason, that's the weird thing? The guy says that he's going to destroy all humanity and worry about the demands.

310
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 It is weird, because it's a bit of a sidestep. We cover people who have wacky beliefs all the time on this show, but when we start to look into the real life of them, it becomes more fascinating, I think, and actually becomes more real.

311
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 He's also trying to give away a boat trailer. He has a video entitled, tell me if this isn't the deal of a century.

312
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 This is a video. Again, so if you happen to be one of Obama's agents, but you needed a new boat trailer, you just say, hey, I want your boat trailer, and you could walk up to this dude's house.

313
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Here's this YouTube video. Free Burnt Bent Trailer Frame. Right there, it's a deal.

314
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Free Burnt Bent Trailer Frame back to original condition. So I don't know, I'll go there. I'm like, what? You promised me Burnt. This is original condition.

315
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Free Burnt Bent Trailer Frame back to original condition, along with...

316
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 The deal of a century, guys. Not only do you get a Burnt Bent Boat Trailer, you also get one fourth of a boat. You get one fourth of a boat hole.

317
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 It's free, though. If you've ever wanted 25% of a boat, this is the YouTube video you want to watch.

318
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 He actually has a couple boats in his backyard. I was like, dude, you keep showing me these boats.

319
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 At a certain point, I was like, I just need to know how much I can find out about this guy. I can look at these boats, and then I'm looking at the satellite footage of a bunch of boats in a backyard.

320
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 I'm trying to do you a favor by saying this. I'm not trying to, like, dox you. I'm saying, if you want to hide your identity, don't show your backyard constantly.

321
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Don't take photos in your neighborhood at all. If you want to keep your location secret, you're doing it wrong.

322
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 So Scott, if you're listening to this, you know, don't be putting your stuff out there.

323
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 It's funny because I kind of feel bad for Scott. I think the real reason why I get a little bit of tug of the heart strings on Scott,

324
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 I actually, I feel like I've gone really easy on him compared to how I've covered a lot of other people, because in the end, he's just giving people black eyes and electrifying the Middle East and telling people to move their bets.

325
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 But let's wrap it up like this. This is where I was kind of like, awww.

326
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Not only did his invention get stolen, he also says that he wrote a comic book, which, oh man, I'd love to get my hands on that.

327
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 I'd love to steal it. I'd love to read it. But he said a woman stole his comic book. He wrote this comic book out and he stole it.

328
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 He has some copies though. He really should sell it. He has some copies and they did have drawings from his comic book.

329
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 It looks more like a story, like a children's storybook. A lot of like full page illustrations, at least the ones that I saw.

330
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 They're drawn in a very Chris Chan-esque way. You can tell it's an adult drawing in a very childlike style.

331
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 But the comic book actually predicted a lot of stuff. He wrote it a long time ago, and this was before he knew his journey.

332
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 It said that he predicted that he was the son of Zeus. He didn't know he was the son of Zeus until he created this comic book.

333
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 He predicted that. It also predicted that he would own a motorcycle someday.

334
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And now, all of us who have ever owned a motor vehicle, right? It was because of the comic book we wrote.

335
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 It's like, oh man, I never drew a comic book. That's why I walk everywhere. That's why I don't have a car.

336
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 The comic book predicted he would own a motorcycle someday. And you don't just get a motorcycle. You just can't buy one of those things.

337
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 It has to be gifted to you from the gods. And you're Dad Zeus, so you're definitely going to get one.

338
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 But as I'm looking through a couple pages of this comic book, he posted it.

339
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 It might have been in a YouTube video I was watching. Everything started to blur together at this point.

340
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 In the comic book, that's the story of him. One of the pages that shows a little Scott Patnode.

341
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 It shows Scott as a little boy, or his self-insert. It's a little boy, a little Scott-shaped boy, laying in bed at night.

342
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 He's holding a little teddy bear, a little moon coming in through the window.

343
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 And he's dreaming of being a motocross star. No, not just a motocross star.

344
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 He's dreaming of being like an evil Keneval. He has a little outfit on. I think he had a little cape.

345
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Little boy has a smile on his face dreaming of motorcycle adventures.

346
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 I saw that panel and I thought, poor Scott. Poor Scott. He probably doesn't need my pity. He probably doesn't want it.

347
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And it's not necessarily pity. But in that panel, I saw the alternate Scott.

348
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 He had dreams. He had dreams. Maybe they're unrealistic dreams. I don't know how hard it is to become evil Keneval.

349
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 I don't know if it's an easy industry to get into, or if it's very hard considering there's not, you know, circus shows going on all the time anymore.

350
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 I don't know. But in that one panel, I saw a story of a boy who wanted an exciting life.

351
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 But somewhere between that little boy and Scott of today, something changed.

352
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 And I'm not talking about his invention got stolen. I don't even know if the invention existed.

353
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 But maybe he was about to go for his first evil Keneval ride.

354
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 He just needed to drop this invention off the pan office. Obama broke into his house and took it.

355
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 I think obviously that something else Scott is obviously struggling with something.

356
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And I think this is where we see that split in the timeline.

357
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 We've covered a lot of people on this show, and they're actually really well put together people who have bizarre beliefs, really bizarre theories.

358
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 The guy who believes he has the hat that can cure autism. The vampire lord Kevin. Even Hans.

359
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 I don't think Hans has any sort of mental issues. I think he just has a bizarre way of looking at the world.

360
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 I think when we look at people like Scott, I'm not going to diagnose him over the podcast, but he's definitely struggling with something.

361
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 And I think the fact that he goes through such lengths to hide his location and at the same time reveals it at every possible chance shows that.

362
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 And I think the fact that he wants to wish violence on the world over and over and over again shows that. Hans doesn't want to blow up a continent.

363
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 But I feel like at some point Scott had these dreams of an exciting and bold life and then something changed.

364
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 Whether that was a mental thing, whether that was a situational thing, someone broke his heart, someone turned their back on him.

365
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Who knows?

366
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 But Scott, if you are listening to this and really to everyone who's listening to this, we've had some good fun this episode.

367
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 I'm not making fun of you as a person. You can have those childlike dreams again. I guarantee it.

368
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Life is long and it can be hard, but you can't stop working towards what you truly want.

369
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 If you want to be a motocross rider, jumping through flaming hoops, do it. You may suck at it. You may only do it a single time, but do it.

370
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Because even if you do that and fail, even if you take that one childlike dream of yours that you look back on ago, I was dumb for believing that.

371
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Even if you try it just once, even if you fail, that act of trying has more impact on your soul than a billion lightning bolts flying through the universe.

372
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Scott and all of you, don't let hate and revenge cloud your true dreams.

 Travelers, insurance smart takes.

 A storm puts a hole in my roof. I could stay with my physical trainer buddy, Keith. He calls himself Coach.

380
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Luckily, loss of use coverage can help pay for me to stay at a hotel while my home is repaired.

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 No 5 a.m. trampoline kettlebell swings for me. Coach.
