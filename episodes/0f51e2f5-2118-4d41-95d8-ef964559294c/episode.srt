1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
 Before your peaceful morning turns into this, set aside a little me time and ease into your

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,440
 day with Honey Bunches of Oats cereal.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,680
 Those sweet flakes and crunchy granola keep your happy tank fueled up, so when it's time

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,560
 to get moving, you're ready!

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,000
 With the boost you need to be your best self, it's amazing what a little me time can do!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,080
 So make Honey Bunches of Oats cereal part of your morning routine, and make a bunch happen!

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,240
 Pick up a box of Honey Bunches of Oats in the cereal aisle today!

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,720
 Theories about what UFOs are and where they come from seem to multiply, as a federal deadline

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,840
 to release classified documents grows closer.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,360
 A man believes that he was abducted by blue bird aliens, but only him!

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,880
 If you were abducted by them, he'll see you in court.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,920
 Then we travel to Chile to take a look at the story of two friends hanging out in their

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,880
 car late one night.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,040
 They think they're just going to have a fun conversation.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,040
 Instead they come face to face with an interdimensional hobo.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:18,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,120
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Riding Into Dead

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,080
 Rabbit Command right now on the back of a giant tarantula.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
 It's Space Vomit!

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,680
 I'm going to have to apologize, it's this pile of vomit floating in zero gravity, but

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
 I wanted to add the tarantula in there.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,920
 Tarantula's walking in.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
 Space Vomit!

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,720
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,480
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you aren't regurgitated food in the middle

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,800
 of the darkest void, that's fine too, just help spread the word about the show.

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
 It really helps out a lot.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,600
 Someone scoop Space Vomit into that bucket, I'm going to toss the keys into the bucket,

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,320
 pour the bucket in the Jason Jalopy, we are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, we are

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,760
 headed out to the Pentagon.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,680
 Space Vomit is somehow driving this vehicle.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,880
 I did a story on this a while back, that the US government had 120 days to reveal what

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,680
 they knew about UFOs.

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,160
 Or an unidentified aerial phenomenon is what the government usually refers to this stuff

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,040
 as, UFO is a pop culture term.

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,840
 Because UFO makes you think like space aliens.

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,520
 And so that deadline is coming up, I believe in June next month.

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,160
 And the problem is, is because those two terms get conflated a lot, when Barack Obama is

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,640
 on the James Corden show and he goes, "Yeah, there is stuff that our pilots have seen that

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,440
 we can't make heads or tails of, unidentified aerial phenomenon," that went around the world

44
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,200
 super fast saying Barack Obama confirmed the existence of UFOs.

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,400
 And when you think UFOs, you think little green men.

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
 He didn't do that.

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
 He didn't do that at all.

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,200
 He said that there is stuff out there that we just can't identify.

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
 It's the same, at the end of the day it's the same thing.

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,200
 But one makes you think X-Files and one makes you think anything from a weather balloon to

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,240
 an advanced drone to alien craft.

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,760
 It could be any of those things.

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,960
 You have, in your mind, you automatically think aliens because it's been connected so long.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,840
 Now what's going to happen in June?

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
 Nothing, right?

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,840
 They're not going to actually reveal any information that's going to lead to the existence of aliens.

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,320
 They're not going to do that.

58
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,200
 Even if there's a guy at the FBI who has a big book of his favorite aliens and they

59
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,240
 autographed it and he looks at the calendar and he's like, "Oh, I got to reveal your guys'

60
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
 identities."

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,800
 They're not going to reveal this stuff.

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,440
 It's going to be some smoke and mirrors thing or they'll be like, "What deadline?

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,040
 What deadline is it that they hold a gun to everyone's head at the same time in the world?"

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
 But there's a scarier version of this.

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,480
 And I actually was having dinner last night with some friends.

66
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,800
 One of them was an ex-air force fighter pilot and now he works in the private sector.

67
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,360
 Now he flies jets for supervillains.

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,760
 He takes out Invincible and the team team.

69
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,600
 So now he does design and stuff like that and I asked him about this stuff.

70
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 Generally Air Force pilots nowadays, or pilots in general, love to talk about this stuff.

71
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,040
 Back in the day, you'd get laughed out.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,440
 You'd get laughed out if you mentioned it.

73
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,960
 But nowadays it's just a different thing.

74
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,640
 And he goes, "We don't know what they are.

75
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
 We don't know what they are."

76
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,280
 Which is pretty much the answer to your here.

77
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,160
 But here is the thing.

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,680
 They will never reveal aliens exist in June.

79
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,180
 That's not going to happen.

80
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,560
 What if they come forward in June and they go, "Unidentified aerial phenomenon.

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,280
 Call them UFOs, call them what you want."

82
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,360
 Since 1949, we've been seeing these things over the skies of America, over the skies

83
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
 of the world.

84
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,640
 We don't know what they were.

85
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,160
 We have some suspicions.

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,240
 90% of them were false.

87
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,360
 90% of them were fake.

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,920
 And the other 10% we can now clearly say that they have Chinese technology.

89
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,080
 The Chinese government has technology and they've had it since 1949 that outstrips anything

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,440
 that any other power is.

91
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,680
 How would that make you feel?

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,280
 I'm assuming you're not a Chinese resident.

93
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,320
 If you're a Chinese resident, that would make you feel great.

94
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,040
 How would that make you feel no matter what country you live in if 10% of all these UFO

95
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,000
 stories was Chinese technology, arrival country's technology?

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,400
 That answer is more logical than a space race.

97
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
 I believe in aliens.

98
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,720
 And I've talked about this several times on my show, but a space race from 10 million

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,000
 light years away or even just 10 million miles away coming back and forth to Earth.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,080
 How would you feel about that?

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,160
 If in June they go, "Okay, we'll admit it.

102
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,040
 China has more advanced technology than we have."

103
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,160
 And we've covered it up because we thought it would make you panic.

104
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,040
 Don't panic.

105
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,360
 So when we look for these answers, remember, I think this is really interesting.

106
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,200
 There's a chance that we're going to find an answer that not only isn't the romantic

107
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,440
 answer that we wanted, but kind of sucks, right?

108
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,960
 It's one thing to think that the great aliens have more advanced technology than we do because

109
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
 we really don't know their motives.

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,600
 So we really don't want to, we know like they want to like have no nukes and be all hippy

111
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
 and stuff like that.

112
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,040
 Sure, they cut a couple of buttholes out of cows and a few humans, but other than that,

113
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,720
 we don't really know what they want.

114
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,320
 I'm not in the anti-butthole cutting for one.

115
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
 I'm against that.

116
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,280
 But versus, we know what the Chinese government wants.

117
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,520
 You'd be like, "Well, I guess they have this advanced capability."

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,520
 So it's an interesting thing to look at.

119
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,880
 And I also wanted to share this too.

120
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,720
 I got this from the Patreon Discord.

121
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
 Mr. C posted this.

122
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
 It's fairly short.

123
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,800
 I'll put it in the show notes, but it just goes to show like how many interesting theories

124
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,600
 we can have about UFOs that are outside of the normal abduction experience that we're

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
 used to.

126
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,500
 Because we cover mostly abduction experiences on this show versus UFO sightings.

127
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,440
 And I think we lose sight that UFO sightings are far, far, far more numerous than the stories

128
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,640
 we cover where people are getting peamed aboard and getting their buttholes cut out.

129
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,200
 Like I love those stories because they are anomalies.

130
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,360
 I cover them all the time because they are anomalies.

131
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,480
 But most of the time it's just someone going, "Martha, look!"

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,720
 And there's like a little doo-doo-doo-doo in the sky.

133
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,920
 And then maybe occasionally some dude's getting abducted and there's a talking bear and things

134
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
 like that.

135
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
 And that is amazing.

136
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,960
 That is if the Chinese are not responsible for the talking bear stories.

137
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,040
 But all of that other technology, like a good chunk of that, could actually be Earthbound.

138
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,200
 But I thought this was really cool.

139
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,760
 Mr. C put this on the Patreon Discord and I thought it was cool.

140
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,320
 And it's basically another idea of what UFOs or UAPs could be.

141
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,680
 And this was posted originally by Lerker1125.

142
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,360
 And it's, what if UFOs?

143
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
 And this would make so much sense.

144
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,880
 I've heard this theory even put forward by scientists, not on anonymous Reddit boards

145
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,400
 that were aware of this game from anything that's Reddit.

146
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,920
 It would be the easiest thing for an alien planet to explore.

147
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,280
 The cosmos would be what we're doing right now.

148
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,320
 We're sending unmanned vehicles out.

149
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,600
 So we have Voyager that's left the solar system.

150
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
 We have little rovers doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo walking around on Mars.

151
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,040
 They're not even cool enough to walk around.

152
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
 They roll around.

153
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,240
 And so one of them's a helicopter now.

154
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
 They're slowly evolving.

155
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
 And one of the point is that it would make far more sense for an alien species to instead

156
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
 of putting a bunch of aliens on a ship and flying it across the void.

157
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,200
 Because modern science says you just can't do that.

158
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,000
 To make drones.

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,800
 To fly out across the cosmos.

160
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,720
 And this theory is basically like all of these vehicles that we see, there is no pilot.

161
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,200
 There is no alien on board.

162
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
 And it's just a drone.

163
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,440
 And you're like, well that's fine too, right?

164
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,640
 Because you can wave to the drone and be like, we're here.

165
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,880
 And the message is being sent back to an alien planet.

166
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,200
 But the alien planet that sent those drones out, they could have been long dead.

167
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,360
 What we're seeing in the sky could be ghosts of an old civilization.

168
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,520
 Their program not to make contact with us.

169
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,560
 They're just here to observe and report.

170
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
 They zip around.

171
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
 We can never catch them.

172
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
 They're gone.

173
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
 They go underwater.

174
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
 They disappear.

175
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,960
 And that's it.

176
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,520
 And we think, oh maybe we will have contact with these things someday.

177
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,000
 But the masters who built those things have been dead tens of thousands of years.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,560
 And we're basically a cargo cult.

179
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,280
 Like the tribes on the islands that when they would see airplanes passing overhead, they're

180
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,400
 like, tell us your secrets.

181
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,320
 We have whole swaps of humanity looking up at these things going, how are you going to

182
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
 save us?

183
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,800
 And it's just empty vessels reporting back to dead planets.

184
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,160
 So that doesn't cheer you up.

185
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,360
 I mean, I just think it's an intro.

186
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,880
 We have so many theories about these things.

187
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,120
 My personal theory.

188
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,640
 Put our conspiracy caps on and then I'm taking mine back off because I believe aliens are

189
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,280
 local.

190
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,000
 I believe they've either been, I don't believe in ancient aliens, oddly enough, but I believe

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 that aliens have either been on this planet for 100,000, 200,000, a million years.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,120
 There's not enough of them to overthrow us.

193
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,280
 And they live underground.

194
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,080
 Not Halloworth, but they live in the cave systems.

195
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
 They live underwater.

196
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,280
 All these UFOs we see are local UFOs.

197
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,600
 They didn't start off here.

198
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,080
 But they're here now.

199
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,360
 Whether it was crashed, maybe they were on some sort of mission a long time ago and then

200
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,680
 their planet blew up.

201
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,000
 They're like, "Ting it!"

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,280
 I think it's that or I think they're interdimensional.

203
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,800
 Or they're from localized in the solar system.

204
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,320
 I could say there's aliens on Mars and someone would laugh.

205
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
 They're like, "What?

206
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 That's unscientific.

207
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,680
 Lights faster than lights we travel."

208
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,840
 Now that's, it'd be far more logical for these things to be from inside the solar system

209
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,120
 or inside the planet.

210
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,360
 Because think about this.

211
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,200
 All the footage we've had of UFOs in our air.

212
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,760
 All of the photos you can dispute a ton of them, but you have eyewitness accounts versus

213
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,200
 we've never, other, like every so often there'll be a glitch and you'll be like, "Oh,

214
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
 look at that black cube floating by the sun."

215
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,760
 There's no photos of mother ships in orbit around Earth.

216
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,480
 There's none.

217
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,520
 We've never caught images of a ship coming past Pluto headed towards Earth.

218
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,720
 We have tons of photos and video footage of aliens on Earth.

219
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
 So I think they're localized.

220
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,720
 I think they either are originally from the solar system or they use the solar system

221
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
 at...

222
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,400
 I don't think I've ever really gone into detail with my views on UFOs.

223
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
 I don't believe...

224
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,280
 They may have come from far, far off in the distance.

225
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,960
 Millions of years ago, but I don't think...

226
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,720
 I don't think the UFO you see now, they ZOO take back off and then there's like an alien

227
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,600
 bowing before an alien king.

228
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,960
 Lord Mlock Block!

229
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,640
 I've recently come from the planet known as Earth.

230
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
 I don't...

231
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,920
 It's so scientific it doesn't make sense.

232
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
 But maybe there...

233
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,520
 Maybe King Mlock Block is in Mars.

234
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
 And he's chilling there.

235
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
 It's his vacation home.

236
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
 He's spent the last 10,000 years there.

237
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 Lord Mlock Block!

238
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,240
 I've just come from the planet I know what planet you're from.

239
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,680
 It's right next door.

240
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,560
 Or aliens are interdimensional.

241
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,600
 I've never said that I don't think aliens exist.

242
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,280
 I just don't believe they're coming from so far away.

243
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
 So that's my theory.

244
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,240
 I think I've talked about that on the show, bits and pieces here and there.

245
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
 I don't think I've ever laid it out.

246
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,040
 So they're either interdimensional.

247
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,920
 They've been here for millions of years or they've been here for millions of years,

248
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,320
 but they're not based on Earth.

249
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,800
 They're from the moon or they're from Mars.

250
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,480
 They are from somewhere else, but they've made bases there.

251
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,840
 That's my theory.

252
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,440
 And I'm complaining because Barack Obama didn't back me up.

253
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
 And then we have...

254
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,240
 Remember Trump talked about aliens too and he's like, "I don't believe in them."

255
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,720
 Trump specifically said, "I don't believe in aliens."

256
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,040
 He goes, "But our boys were...

257
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,720
 They're seeing some weird stuff in the sky.

258
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,040
 Seeing some weird stuff in the sky."

259
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,120
 Barack Obama said that he...

260
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,600
 When he first joined the presidency, when he first joined that club, he asked, "Do we

261
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
 have aliens?"

262
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,760
 And he was told a couple days later...

263
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,880
 It took him a couple days to figure that out.

264
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,680
 They go, "No, there's no aliens."

265
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,840
 And then he talked about UAP.

266
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,320
 So they both say the two things are different, which I think is a way we have to think about

267
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,560
 it, because it is very, very likely that this technology that is physics-defying and

268
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,840
 has all this capability to shut off our nuclear bombs and zip across the sky.

269
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,720
 We can never catch it.

270
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,800
 It might belong to another government on Earth.

271
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:28,000
 And that would be more troubling than it coming from an alien planet, because we don't know

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,160
 what aliens are up to, but we know how sinister humans can be when they have a technological

273
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,280
 advantage.

274
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
 Space vomit.

275
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:42,280
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the handles, form little gross hands to hold onto the hang

276
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
 hair glider.

277
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,480
 We're going to jump in his bucket of vomit, and he's going to...

278
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,320
 Fly us out from the Pentagon all the way to a courthouse in Colorado.

279
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,640
 And I gotta do the sound effect again for the transition.

280
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,040
 I got most of this information from an article in The Daily Beast by Will Sommer, and it's

281
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
 just...

282
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,320
 You know what?

283
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,960
 We've talked about this before.

284
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,920
 We've talked about this guy in particular before.

285
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,040
 There's a man known as Corey Good.

286
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,920
 We talked about him on Episode 47.

287
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,400
 He was in the very first season of Dead Rav Radio.

288
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,560
 He was the one who said that reptilians were snatching kids off streets in the United States,

289
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,800
 shipping them to Antarctica as slaves.

290
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,200
 And I also believe he was part of our Mars story as well.

291
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,240
 Because kids are being kidnapped there and I don't know why the reptilians would be like

292
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
 "No, only Antarctica.

293
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,960
 Why are there a bunch of lizard people in the coldest part of the planet?"

294
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,680
 Anyways, Corey Good, we've talked about him at least once on the show, I believe more

295
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
 than once.

296
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
 Fascinating character, and this...

297
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,400
 You guys are smart.

298
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,320
 No dummy listens to this show, right?

299
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,360
 No one who is dummy listens to this show.

300
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
 You guys are smart.

301
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,040
 We may get hoodwinked from time to time, sure.

302
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,840
 But we're not dumb.

303
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:12,440
 And this story highlights the difference between us and people who subscribe to other podcasts

304
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,360
 and other streaming services that I will unname right now, but I will name later.

305
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
 But it's a different...

306
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,360
 It's a different group of people I'm calling dummies.

307
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,920
 Not the people I'm about to name.

308
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,840
 So for legal reasons, just to be polite.

309
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,680
 So Corey Good is on the streaming service called Gaia.

310
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,640
 And we've talked about them before too.

311
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,560
 I described it as Oprah level metaphysics.

312
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,960
 It's really just like wine moms talking about spirituality.

313
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,000
 It started off as interesting, I looked into this.

314
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,560
 It started off as an exercise brand and the guy was like "Hmm, I'm making millions of

315
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,520
 dollars off of these bicycles."

316
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,400
 What I really want to do is have people sit down for hours on end and watch conspiracy

317
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
 content.

318
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,240
 So he started Gaia and it has a more of a...

319
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,960
 I shouldn't call it conspiracy content.

320
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,360
 It has more of a spirituality bent.

321
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,800
 But over time, I have this theory, over time, all content bends towards the conspiracy.

322
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
 It just happens.

323
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,360
 You can have a news network that starts off just the facts.

324
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,520
 And then over time, it'll start reporting more and more information that backs up the

325
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:22,480
 people who run the news agency's beliefs, which tends to become conspiracy theory.

326
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,200
 And you see it with true crime podcasts have a problem with it as well, even if they're

327
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,880
 just doing true crime stuff.

328
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,920
 Eventually they start to get this warped sense of justice or...

329
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,160
 It's really weird.

330
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
 It's really weird.

331
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,680
 You stay long enough in any lane, eventually it'll begin to warp towards conspiracy.

332
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,440
 Not us, we're already fully in the conspiracy theory lane.

333
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,160
 Started off as this spirituality movement.

334
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,440
 Then it starts getting into ancient aliens and more conspiracy content.

335
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,000
 So Cory Good does this thing where he says that when he was six years old, he was abducted

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,280
 by the blue avians.

337
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,080
 Ka-ka!

338
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,160
 And it's exactly what you think it is.

339
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
 It...

340
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
 I'm not thinking anything.

341
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,400
 When I hear those two words, we're together.

342
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
 I'm thinking maybe like a little blue macaw on Cory Good's shoulder.

343
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,440
 They're six foot tall bird aliens.

344
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
 They're blue.

345
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
 Also, they're blue.

346
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,680
 It's not like they're sad all the time.

347
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,840
 They're not huge fans of Eiffel 65.

348
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,600
 They're six foot tall blue birds.

349
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,100
 Fascinating imagery.

350
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,280
 I'm a huge fan of insectoids because they don't get enough love in UFOology.

351
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
 And now we have the avians.

352
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,680
 The blue avian.

353
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,760
 He was abducted and he was taught all these psychic skills and stuff like that.

354
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
 And then he was abducted.

355
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,920
 Like they're like, "See you later!"

356
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,960
 And as the birds are taking him back home, someone else abducts him.

357
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,840
 He's abducted by the secret space program and he's part of this thing called 20 and

358
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,120
 Back where you do 20 years guaranteed in the secret space program and then you're sent

359
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
 back home.

360
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,240
 And then no one's allowed to abduct you from here on out.

361
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
 Secret space program.

362
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,920
 I've covered that before.

363
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,720
 It's exactly what it says.

364
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,880
 The governments of the world have a space program that you don't know about.

365
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
 There you go.

366
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,520
 And it hovers around the moon and they have basals on Mars and stuff like that.

367
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,000
 So secret space program.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Blue avians.

369
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 20 and Back.

370
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,680
 So he has this show on Gaia called Cosmic Disclosure.

371
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,840
 And he has a co-host and they sit and they talk about like, "Oh dude, you won't believe

372
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
 what happened last weekend.

373
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
 What happened to you, Corey?"

374
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,080
 Well I was walking on the street and I got abducted by a bunch of blue birds.

375
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,920
 And then he would tell this other story and it kind of just goes on and on and on.

376
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,000
 Well he left the show in 2018.

377
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,040
 His co-host left earlier.

378
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,720
 But in 2018, Corey goes like, "You know what?

379
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,200
 I don't want to do this anymore."

380
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,840
 And Corey's always back wounds all over him.

381
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
 He's covered in bandages.

382
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,000
 He's like, "If I get abducted by these birds one more time, I'm going to lose it."

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,800
 He quits the show.

384
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
 This is a big rated show for Gaia, right?

385
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,880
 Because it sounds ultra ridiculous.

386
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,000
 Who doesn't want to sit around and listen to an adult man to see he got kidnapped by

387
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,480
 birds last week?

388
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,320
 And there's a new episode every single week.

389
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,680
 Who doesn't want to watch that?

390
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,840
 So you can watch the insanity of a man wash over him.

391
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,560
 He's just throwing crackers everywhere.

392
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,040
 He's like, "Take these birds!

393
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
 Take the crackers and not me!"

394
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,960
 He doesn't want to watch that.

395
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,920
 There's no CGI recreation.

396
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,160
 I've never seen it but I'm just assuming it's him sitting in a chair being like, "You

397
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
 won't believe what happened."

398
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,960
 It would be way better if then it got to an animated version.

399
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,600
 There's him cowering in a corner.

400
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,120
 These giant birds are walking towards him.

401
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,560
 He quit the show.

402
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,840
 So Gaia goes, "Well, let's just keep the show going.

403
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,160
 Cosmic Disclosure.

404
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,440
 Now the new host is, I want to call him Jason Todd but he got killed by the Joker with a

405
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,600
 crowbar.

406
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
 What's his name?

407
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,720
 It is Jason Rice."

408
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,480
 And so they get Jason Rice to come on the show and he goes, "Welcome to Cosmic Disclosure.

409
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,000
 I'm the new host, Jason Rice.

410
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,560
 And wouldn't you know it?

411
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,680
 Wouldn't you know it, trusting audience of Gaia?"

412
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,800
 This is 100% true.

413
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,880
 This is so ridiculous.

414
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,320
 Jason Rice takes over the show called Cosmic Disclosure and he goes, "Guys, you won't

415
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,680
 believe what just happened.

416
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:09,400
 But I was also abducted by Blue Avians and it happened when I was a kid and I was abducted

417
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
 by the Secret Space Program.

418
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
 Can you believe it?

419
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:19,280
 Two people who both host the show were abducted by the same themes of the show.

420
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,200
 We were abducted by the same characters of the show.

421
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,320
 And I also signed a contract called 20 and back.

422
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,600
 So I was abducted when I was six.

423
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,080
 I was on all these adventures with these birds.

424
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:35,840
 And here I am to tell you week after week about bird people."

425
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,200
 So Corey Good is suing Gaia.

426
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,880
 This is so fascinating to me and it should be an absolute wake up call to anyone who

427
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,080
 believes any of this nonsense.

428
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
 Right?

429
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,240
 I was just talking about aliens hanging out on Mars and King Block Block.

430
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,200
 This is obviously not a true story.

431
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,280
 I mean the lawsuit and everything I just told you is true but I'm talking about the Blue

432
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,360
 Avians because Blue Avians, he trademarked that.

433
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,800
 Corey Good owns the trademark to Blue Avians, 20 and back, which is dumb.

434
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 Don't trademark this stupid stuff.

435
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
 Corey saved your money.

436
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,200
 And he trademarked Secret Space Program.

437
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,320
 I cannot trademark.

438
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,880
 I, Jason Carpenter, cannot trademark United States Air Force because it's a real thing

439
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,120
 that a government owns.

440
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,320
 And I definitely, I'm pretty, I could trademark insectoid for like a t-shirt.

441
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,360
 If I wanted to have like an insectoid t-shirt brand.

442
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,600
 But I couldn't then prevent anyone else from using the word insectoid.

443
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,680
 It's a scientific term.

444
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,360
 A bunch of bugs, a bunch of bug doctors would show up.

445
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
 Is that a thing?

446
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,560
 They'd become a thing and they'd show up and they'd beat me up with mandibles.

447
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,000
 He trademarked, before this happened, he'd trademarked, it was back in 2014 because

448
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,840
 he just left the show in 2018.

449
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,320
 He trademarked the term Blue Avians the way an author would trademark something.

450
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,080
 And he's in court right now trying to convince the judge to not let them talk about Blue

451
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
 Avians.

452
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,360
 He owned the supposedly real alien race that kidnapped him when he was six years old.

453
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,720
 They don't have their name trademarked.

454
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,680
 And you're like, Jason, why would a bird trademark their own name?

455
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,480
 That's a good point and an absurd statement.

456
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,920
 But why would he?

457
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
 Why would he?

458
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:35,120
 If it was, if it was, I would have never thought, if I ran into a gnome named Bork, I would

459
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,120
 have never, and we went on this magical adventure and I planned on telling you the story, I

460
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,200
 would have never thought in a million years why better trademark Bork's name because

461
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
 he's real.

462
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,000
 I've never trademarked any, I've trademarked stuff before, but I've never trademarked

463
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,840
 like my cat's name or my best friend's name.

464
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
 Now I'm actually having really good ideas.

465
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,400
 I should start trademarking those names and charging my best friend to hang out with me.

466
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,280
 He trademarked the name Blue Avian and he's saying, Gaia, you can't use this stuff.

467
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
 I made it up.

468
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,880
 I mean, I experienced it first and I trademarked it and you can't talk about this stuff.

469
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,600
 Now Gaia goes, but it's real, Corey, right?

470
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,920
 Blue Avians are real and you can't trademark real stuff.

471
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,560
 And right now there's a trademark attorney coming out on YouTube.

472
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
 You know what I mean?

473
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,640
 You can trademark Blue Avian as a brand of drink.

474
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,720
 But if there's this real adventure, you can't trademark the adventure because it's real.

475
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,880
 So he's suing Gaia and he goes, you guys can't use this as his trademark stuff.

476
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,760
 He can't come forward and say, you guys can't use this.

477
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,080
 I made it up.

478
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
 This is my story.

479
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
 I made it up.

480
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,000
 Gaia is like, you can't stop us because this man was also abducted when he was six years

481
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,080
 old by the Blue Avians.

482
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,800
 So Corey Good can either come forward and say, you're right.

483
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,440
 I made it all up and it was really fun and he is nudging the audience and he goes, but

484
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,520
 you guys had a good time listening to the story, right?

485
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,040
 He could do that and goes, but Gaia can't report on this anymore because I made it up.

486
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,600
 Or he could try to argue in court.

487
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,880
 If you're on her, I was abducted when I was six years old by a species of bluebirds.

488
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,280
 He wasn't.

489
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,080
 And that guy would be like, no, I remember seeing you in the elevator.

490
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,960
 Or he can do this.

491
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:26,660
 He says that this is absolutely mind bogglingly bad legal decision.

492
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,680
 This is his argument, not that the Blue Avian thing is fake.

493
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:38,840
 Corey Good is arguing that Gaia is run by Satan worshipers.

494
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
 That's not illegal defense.

495
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,240
 That was illegal defense.

496
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,320
 You could shut down a ton of people.

497
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,120
 He says they're run by Satan worshipers.

498
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,720
 That's his argument in court.

499
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,080
 And his co-host that I mentioned earlier was David Wilcock, who's another big name in

500
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,920
 UFOology.

501
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:04,000
 The reason why he left cosmic disclosure was because he believed back in 2016 that Gaia

502
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,200
 was run by Satan worshipers, by Luciferians.

503
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,720
 That's the term they're using specifically.

504
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:16,520
 And Gaia asked cosmic disclosure to do a promo for another show called like Ancient Civilizations

505
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,920
 of David Wilcock.

506
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,280
 Apparently, this, I'm getting all this information.

507
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,760
 If anyone's coming to sue me, I'm getting all this information from that Daily Beast

508
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
 article.

509
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,240
 This summer can be my co-defendant in court.

510
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,600
 David Wilcock supposedly said, "I'm not doing a promo read for Ancient Civilization.

511
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,040
 That show is run by Luciferians."

512
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,720
 And everyone hates Luciferians, and if I do a promo read for that, they're gonna come

513
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
 after me.

514
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,520
 Not the Luciferians, the people who ate Luciferians are gonna come after David Wilcock.

515
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,720
 So he left the show.

516
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,440
 Because they wanted him to do like a tie-in for some other show on the network he's on.

517
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,400
 He was very, very clear on that back in 2016.

518
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,280
 So I hate to break this to you, Corey.

519
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,600
 If Luciferians are running Gaia, you knew it back in 2016, when your co-host left for

520
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,800
 that reason.

521
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,560
 So if you continue to work with Luciferians for two more years, that's on you, dude.

522
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
 Right?

523
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
 That's on you.

524
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,240
 That's not gonna work in a court of law.

525
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,320
 I just made this board judge being like, "Ugh, what's next?"

526
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,640
 And I walk in with this little dwarf, or co-defendants as well.

527
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,240
 Gaia is countersuing Corey Good.

528
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,560
 Gaia is countersuing Corey Good for defamation, right?

529
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,240
 Because he's calling him a bunch of sane worshipers.

530
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,760
 He's calling him the sane worshipers.

531
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,000
 They're suing him for defamation.

532
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,720
 Oh, and Corey Good also had this weird anecdote.

533
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,480
 He goes, "One of the reasons why he quit is one of the senior officials of Gaia, one

534
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,280
 of the senior officials of the spirituality network, quasi-conspiracy network.

535
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,320
 One day Corey Good is sitting there, eating some chicken.

536
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,520
 He's like, "I hate the blue avian so much.

537
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,080
 I eat their kind on earth."

538
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,520
 He is sitting in the break room where he's walking around the Gaia offices, and one of

539
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,800
 the main leaders, one of the senior executives of Gaia has walked through the office as well.

540
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,800
 He goes, "Corey Good!"

541
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,360
 The thing is, let me pause this story for a second.

542
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,840
 The swarm about to take place on earth, and it is as ridiculous as any of his space-based

543
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
 stories.

544
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,720
 This is part of his legal reasons of why he quit the show.

545
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,160
 Corey Good's hanging out at the offices of Gaia one day, and a senior executive walks

546
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,840
 into whatever room he's in and goes, "Corey Good!" and pulls out a gun.

547
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,520
 Because when you think of the executives of Gaia, right, of this meditation network,

548
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,800
 you imagine they're all armed in the offices, right?

549
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,120
 You imagine they're always walking around with AKs.

550
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,320
 He pulls out a gun and points it at Corey.

551
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,680
 He says, "You have one week to record 26 episodes of content.

552
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
 You got it?

553
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,360
 You got it Corey Good!

554
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
 You want to be Corey Bad!"

555
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,800
 Corey's like, "That doesn't make sense."

556
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,560
 The guy goes, "I have the gun.

557
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,200
 I make the puns."

558
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,560
 That one actually does sound pretty good.

559
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,280
 You gonna make 26 episodes in one week, and Corey's like, "I'll do it!

560
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
 I'll do it!

561
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,080
 Man, just back off!"

562
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,720
 He's praying he gets them talking right now.

563
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,680
 He's like, "Please, bluebirds, take me away!"

564
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,240
 The executive storms off.

565
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,560
 He's looking for the intern to get his coffee, putting guns to people's heads.

566
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,360
 So Corey Good says that's one of the reasons why he quit.

567
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,280
 A guy in the office, a senior executive pulled a gun on him and said, "Make 26 episodes in

568
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
 a week."

569
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,960
 And he's like, "How am I supposed to make up that much stuff in a week, man?

570
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,280
 I got a narrative to build.

571
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,080
 It's not like any of this is based on any sort of real stuff."

572
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,160
 Dude, if someone put a gun in my head, well, first off, that would be a bad one.

573
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,800
 It would be bad for that dude, because I'm a ninja.

574
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,680
 But let's say that that day I'm just kind of sleepy.

575
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,520
 I just ate a bunch of turkey, and the guy puts it in my head, and I'm like, "Oh, what

576
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
 do you want?"

577
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
 Instead, make 26 episodes in a week.

578
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,680
 I'd be like, "Okay, I pretty much do that anyways.

579
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,080
 I can do that."

580
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,880
 So Corey Good, you gotta push them up by your bootstraps.

581
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,240
 Someone puts a gun to your head.

582
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,240
 Just do what they say.

583
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,080
 You can do 26 episodes in a week.

584
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,840
 So that is this lawsuit going on.

585
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,400
 Really fascinating stuff.

586
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,080
 So to fans of Corey Good, this should be a wake-up call, right?

587
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,680
 I guess I can't say he's 100% making it up.

588
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,840
 There could be a portion of it being true.

589
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,160
 But the fact that he is arguing that he's the only guy who was abducted to join as part

590
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,520
 of the space program, just one six-year-old boy, obviously they're abducting other people

591
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,960
 or other people are just joining.

592
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,400
 And he's saying he was the only one who was part of this avian soul group, this blue avian

593
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,320
 soul group or whatever.

594
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,840
 It should make you consider whether or not he's telling the truth.

595
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,360
 It really, really, really should make you--there's not a single listener of this podcast who

596
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,240
 listens to that show.

597
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,840
 But if on the off chance you are and this is all news to you, it should really make you

598
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,680
 reconsider him.

599
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,200
 It should really make you go, "Mmm, it is kind of weird that he's claiming all of this

600
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,280
 stuff but it only happened to him.

601
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,720
 It can't happen to anyone else.

602
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,280
 No one else can take over the show."

603
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,560
 And at the same time, it should make you give a side eye to Gaia because Gaia obviously

604
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:19,120
 either knows that this is all fabricated and they go, "This is a top rated show so let's

605
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,080
 get someone else into fabricated."

606
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,040
 Or they got hoodwinked again that some other guy saw that this guy was leaving and goes,

607
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
 "Guys, you won't believe it.

608
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
 It's just the other day.

609
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,040
 I also got abducted by blue avians and guys like, "That's perfect.

610
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,120
 We have the perfect job for you."

611
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
 And it shows up.

612
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,040
 So either everyone is goofing on everyone else.

613
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,240
 That's a legal term by the way.

614
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
 Goofing.

615
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,400
 Your honor, he's goofing on me.

616
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,840
 That's a legal term.

617
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
 So it's either that.

618
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,960
 Either goofing on goofs or people are getting fooled, which is not any better, right?

619
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,640
 You don't want the people you get your spirituality and yoga advice to be easily gullible.

620
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,960
 Otherwise you're going to do the yoga wrong and your soul is going to get tormented.

621
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,160
 And then you have to extrapolate it out obviously.

622
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,720
 Is that this Corey Good is not an isolated event.

623
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,880
 There's not just one person spinning these stories.

624
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,040
 He's the only person that I know of though that was savvy enough to trademark it.

625
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,240
 And again, that makes it look suspicious.

626
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,040
 No one went and fought in Vietnam and had these crazy stories, like these crazy adventures

627
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,440
 in Vietnam and then came back and trademarked the village that they were in or trademarked

628
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,400
 the country of Vietnam.

629
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,000
 It just doesn't happen.

630
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,520
 So is Corey Good just ahead of the curve and he's able to trademark this stuff and he's

631
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,320
 savvy about it or is this leaning towards the fact that it's fabricated?

632
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,560
 It will be interesting to see where this court trial goes.

633
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,960
 I'll try to keep you updated.

634
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,000
 I just wish for the first time in my life I wish I lived in Colorado.

635
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,080
 I would quit my job and just hang out at the courthouse all day long.

636
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,880
 Just to watch the judge slowly descend into insanity.

637
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,040
 And then after the trial he's like bye because that's what the judges do right after the

638
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,540
 trial they wave.

639
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,640
 See you guys later and then he walks into the judges quarters and that's where I'm living

640
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,120
 because I lost my place because I quit my job.

641
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,920
 I'm hiding under his desk and the judge walks in and I can just see his feet and he's like

642
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,560
 "Oh finally it's time to get out of this."

643
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,920
 And he drops his black robe to the ground and I'm like "Where's this going?"

644
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,520
 And I'm just seeing his feet and then he takes his shoes off and I'm expecting to see like

645
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
 bird feet.

646
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,080
 That kind of makes sense right?

647
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,480
 Now it's just human feet and I'm like disappointed.

648
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,280
 I'm looking at these 10 human toes and I'm like "Oh man."

649
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,720
 But then the 10 toes begin to wiggle and they're like shaking and stuff like that.

650
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,400
 And he's like "Oh my muscle spasms."

651
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,520
 And I'm like "Dang it I thought like bird talons are gonna pop out."

652
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,680
 And then he starts like straight, he starts doing yoga because he's watching all that

653
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,160
 Gaia video during the trial and he's doing yoga and I'm like "What, how long is this

654
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,360
 gonna take?"

655
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,520
 And then I hear the sound of like, skin tearing like flesh rip.

656
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,880
 I know what that sounds like!

657
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,040
 I don't even have to see it.

658
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,940
 I'm like that's obviously a man's skin being ripped from his bones.

659
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:07,340
 I hear this *pfft* and I am like curious now, like is he turning into a bird?

660
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,260
 That's the whole gimmick here that I think he's a bird!

661
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,880
 But I'm under the desk, and he's really just opening a bag of flaming hot Cheetos.

662
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
 And I'm like dang it.

663
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,040
 And he's like yhosh yhosh yhosh, eating them.

664
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,960
 And then I remember something.

665
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,160
 Flaming hot Cheetos are disgusting.

666
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:29,360
 And I realize that no human in the right mind would ever, ever buy a bag of flaming hot Cheetos

667
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,480
 to eat by themselves and then buy it as a prank to pull on one of their friends who can't

668
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,840
 read who's illiterate and doesn't know what the bag looks like.

669
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,480
 And I go, a human tongue would have obviously been burnt by now.

670
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,000
 And then I notice that he doesn't sound like a human eating flaming hot Cheetos.

671
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,280
 It sounds like a beak going *chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck*.

672
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,920
 And then that's enough evidence for me.

673
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,320
 I start sneaking out and I turn around and they're sitting at the judge's booth or bench

674
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,680
 or whatever it is.

675
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,320
 The desk I was hiding under, I forgot what it's called.

676
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,440
 There's a big blue avian bird and his beak is all covered in Cheeto dust.

677
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,160
 Yes, we are in the episode.

678
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,020
 I'm not going to be able to get to the two-dimensional hobo, this one.

679
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,400
 But there's a really big one.

680
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,440
 Jason, tell us that story.

681
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,080
 Could talk about this stupid bird, this dumb bird thing that's gone on for five minutes.

682
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,760
 You could have told me something about a two-dimensional hobo.

683
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,720
 What are you doing, dude?

684
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,680
 Anyways, there's this bird flaming hot Cheetos.

685
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,080
 And his hands are now giant feathers.

686
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
 It's a full-on bird.

687
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,320
 And he goes, "I would love to abduct you, young man.

688
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:51,420
 I would love to abduct you and take you to space and raise you as my own.

689
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,380
 Like you were an egg born from my wife's vagina.

690
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,540
 I wish I could do that.

691
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,420
 But unfortunately I can't because that has been trademarked."

692
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,420
 And he drops the Cheetos and he turns around and he faces the window looking outside.

693
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,660
 Everyone in town now sees that their judge is a giant blue bird.

694
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,100
 The whole city is aghast.

695
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,800
 He's like, "No, because now that Corey Good has made it illegal for us to even abduct

696
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,300
 the children, can you believe that?

697
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,400
 We're no longer allowed to abduct people.

698
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,840
 Because if we abduct people, now we will be dragged in front of trademark court."

699
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,560
 You see, Corey Good thinks that he's just shutting down Gaia Television.

700
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,920
 But in fact, he's shutting down communication between two species.

701
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,580
 Blue avians, we truly do exist.

702
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,680
 But we can never, ever show up on Earth.

703
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,820
 We can never help you into the cosmic brotherhood.

704
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:52,700
 Because one man, one man filed one lawsuit and one, he has shut down cosmic communication

705
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,220
 for all time.

706
00:35:54,220 --> 00:36:02,380
 He looks us in the eye and he goes, "Because of human greed, Earth will have no friends

707
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
 in the galaxy."

708
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:13,800
 Goodbye, space brothers, or I should say, space orphans.

709
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,600
 Cacock!

710
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
 Cacock!

711
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,760
 Flies out the window.

712
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
 Space vomit.

713
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,920
 Call in that carpenter copter.

714
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,520
 We're not going to be able to see the two dimensional hobo this episode, but I just want to make

715
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,320
 sure you ride in that carpenter copter.

716
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
 Bring it on down.

717
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,120
 We're going to take it back to Dead Rabbit Command.

718
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,320
 It's a solemn journey.

719
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
 We're all sad.

720
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,660
 Corey Good, before you finish this lawsuit, think about that.

721
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:46,680
 You want to be an advocate of cosmic disclosure, but this may cause us to fall into an eternity

722
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,440
 of cosmic silence.

723
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,140
 And I'll talk about two dimensional hobos on tomorrow's episode.

724
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,060
