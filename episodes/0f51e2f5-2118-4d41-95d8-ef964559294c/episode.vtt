00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 Before your peaceful morning turns into this, set aside a little me time and ease into your

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.440
 day with Honey Bunches of Oats cereal.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.680
 Those sweet flakes and crunchy granola keep your happy tank fueled up, so when it's time

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.560
 to get moving, you're ready!

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.000
 With the boost you need to be your best self, it's amazing what a little me time can do!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.080
 So make Honey Bunches of Oats cereal part of your morning routine, and make a bunch happen!

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.240
 Pick up a box of Honey Bunches of Oats in the cereal aisle today!

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.720
 Theories about what UFOs are and where they come from seem to multiply, as a federal deadline

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.840
 to release classified documents grows closer.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.360
 A man believes that he was abducted by blue bird aliens, but only him!

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.880
 If you were abducted by them, he'll see you in court.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.920
 Then we travel to Chile to take a look at the story of two friends hanging out in their

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.880
 car late one night.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.040
 They think they're just going to have a fun conversation.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.040
 Instead they come face to face with an interdimensional hobo.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:18.160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.120
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Riding Into Dead

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.080
 Rabbit Command right now on the back of a giant tarantula.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.080
 It's Space Vomit!

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.680
 I'm going to have to apologize, it's this pile of vomit floating in zero gravity, but

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.680
 I wanted to add the tarantula in there.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.920
 Tarantula's walking in.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 Space Vomit!

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.720
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.480
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you aren't regurgitated food in the middle

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.800
 of the darkest void, that's fine too, just help spread the word about the show.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 It really helps out a lot.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.600
 Someone scoop Space Vomit into that bucket, I'm going to toss the keys into the bucket,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.320
 pour the bucket in the Jason Jalopy, we are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, we are

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.760
 headed out to the Pentagon.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.680
 Space Vomit is somehow driving this vehicle.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.880
 I did a story on this a while back, that the US government had 120 days to reveal what

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.680
 they knew about UFOs.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.160
 Or an unidentified aerial phenomenon is what the government usually refers to this stuff

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.040
 as, UFO is a pop culture term.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.840
 Because UFO makes you think like space aliens.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.520
 And so that deadline is coming up, I believe in June next month.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.160
 And the problem is, is because those two terms get conflated a lot, when Barack Obama is

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.640
 on the James Corden show and he goes, "Yeah, there is stuff that our pilots have seen that

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.440
 we can't make heads or tails of, unidentified aerial phenomenon," that went around the world

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.200
 super fast saying Barack Obama confirmed the existence of UFOs.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.400
 And when you think UFOs, you think little green men.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400
 He didn't do that.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.200
 He didn't do that at all.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.200
 He said that there is stuff out there that we just can't identify.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 It's the same, at the end of the day it's the same thing.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 But one makes you think X-Files and one makes you think anything from a weather balloon to

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.240
 an advanced drone to alien craft.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.760
 It could be any of those things.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.960
 You have, in your mind, you automatically think aliens because it's been connected so long.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.840
 Now what's going to happen in June?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.840
 Nothing, right?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.840
 They're not going to actually reveal any information that's going to lead to the existence of aliens.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.320
 They're not going to do that.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.200
 Even if there's a guy at the FBI who has a big book of his favorite aliens and they

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.240
 autographed it and he looks at the calendar and he's like, "Oh, I got to reveal your guys'

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.240
 identities."

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.800
 They're not going to reveal this stuff.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.440
 It's going to be some smoke and mirrors thing or they'll be like, "What deadline?

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.040
 What deadline is it that they hold a gun to everyone's head at the same time in the world?"

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.200
 But there's a scarier version of this.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.480
 And I actually was having dinner last night with some friends.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.800
 One of them was an ex-air force fighter pilot and now he works in the private sector.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.360
 Now he flies jets for supervillains.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.760
 He takes out Invincible and the team team.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.600
 So now he does design and stuff like that and I asked him about this stuff.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 Generally Air Force pilots nowadays, or pilots in general, love to talk about this stuff.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.040
 Back in the day, you'd get laughed out.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.440
 You'd get laughed out if you mentioned it.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.960
 But nowadays it's just a different thing.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.640
 And he goes, "We don't know what they are.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640
 We don't know what they are."

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.280
 Which is pretty much the answer to your here.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.160
 But here is the thing.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.680
 They will never reveal aliens exist in June.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.180
 That's not going to happen.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.560
 What if they come forward in June and they go, "Unidentified aerial phenomenon.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.280
 Call them UFOs, call them what you want."

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.360
 Since 1949, we've been seeing these things over the skies of America, over the skies

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.360
 of the world.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.640
 We don't know what they were.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.160
 We have some suspicions.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.240
 90% of them were false.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.360
 90% of them were fake.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.920
 And the other 10% we can now clearly say that they have Chinese technology.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.080
 The Chinese government has technology and they've had it since 1949 that outstrips anything

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.440
 that any other power is.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.680
 How would that make you feel?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.280
 I'm assuming you're not a Chinese resident.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.320
 If you're a Chinese resident, that would make you feel great.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.040
 How would that make you feel no matter what country you live in if 10% of all these UFO

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.000
 stories was Chinese technology, arrival country's technology?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.400
 That answer is more logical than a space race.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.400
 I believe in aliens.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.720
 And I've talked about this several times on my show, but a space race from 10 million

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.000
 light years away or even just 10 million miles away coming back and forth to Earth.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.080
 How would you feel about that?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.160
 If in June they go, "Okay, we'll admit it.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.040
 China has more advanced technology than we have."

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.160
 And we've covered it up because we thought it would make you panic.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.040
 Don't panic.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.360
 So when we look for these answers, remember, I think this is really interesting.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.200
 There's a chance that we're going to find an answer that not only isn't the romantic

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.440
 answer that we wanted, but kind of sucks, right?

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.960
 It's one thing to think that the great aliens have more advanced technology than we do because

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.720
 we really don't know their motives.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.600
 So we really don't want to, we know like they want to like have no nukes and be all hippy

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.600
 and stuff like that.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.040
 Sure, they cut a couple of buttholes out of cows and a few humans, but other than that,

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.720
 we don't really know what they want.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.320
 I'm not in the anti-butthole cutting for one.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320
 I'm against that.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.280
 But versus, we know what the Chinese government wants.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.520
 You'd be like, "Well, I guess they have this advanced capability."

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.520
 So it's an interesting thing to look at.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.880
 And I also wanted to share this too.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.720
 I got this from the Patreon Discord.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.560
 Mr. C posted this.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.560
 It's fairly short.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.800
 I'll put it in the show notes, but it just goes to show like how many interesting theories

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:47.600
 we can have about UFOs that are outside of the normal abduction experience that we're

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600
 used to.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.500
 Because we cover mostly abduction experiences on this show versus UFO sightings.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.440
 And I think we lose sight that UFO sightings are far, far, far more numerous than the stories

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.640
 we cover where people are getting peamed aboard and getting their buttholes cut out.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.200
 Like I love those stories because they are anomalies.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.360
 I cover them all the time because they are anomalies.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.480
 But most of the time it's just someone going, "Martha, look!"

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.720
 And there's like a little doo-doo-doo-doo in the sky.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.920
 And then maybe occasionally some dude's getting abducted and there's a talking bear and things

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.920
 like that.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920
 And that is amazing.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.960
 That is if the Chinese are not responsible for the talking bear stories.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.040
 But all of that other technology, like a good chunk of that, could actually be Earthbound.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.200
 But I thought this was really cool.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.760
 Mr. C put this on the Patreon Discord and I thought it was cool.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.320
 And it's basically another idea of what UFOs or UAPs could be.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.680
 And this was posted originally by Lerker1125.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.360
 And it's, what if UFOs?

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.800
 And this would make so much sense.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.880
 I've heard this theory even put forward by scientists, not on anonymous Reddit boards

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.400
 that were aware of this game from anything that's Reddit.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.920
 It would be the easiest thing for an alien planet to explore.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.280
 The cosmos would be what we're doing right now.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.320
 We're sending unmanned vehicles out.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.600
 So we have Voyager that's left the solar system.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.600
 We have little rovers doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo walking around on Mars.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.040
 They're not even cool enough to walk around.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040
 They roll around.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.240
 And so one of them's a helicopter now.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.240
 They're slowly evolving.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.560
 And one of the point is that it would make far more sense for an alien species to instead

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.560
 of putting a bunch of aliens on a ship and flying it across the void.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.200
 Because modern science says you just can't do that.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.000
 To make drones.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.800
 To fly out across the cosmos.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.720
 And this theory is basically like all of these vehicles that we see, there is no pilot.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.200
 There is no alien on board.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200
 And it's just a drone.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.440
 And you're like, well that's fine too, right?

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.640
 Because you can wave to the drone and be like, we're here.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.880
 And the message is being sent back to an alien planet.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.200
 But the alien planet that sent those drones out, they could have been long dead.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.360
 What we're seeing in the sky could be ghosts of an old civilization.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.520
 Their program not to make contact with us.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.560
 They're just here to observe and report.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.560
 They zip around.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560
 We can never catch them.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.560
 They're gone.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.560
 They go underwater.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560
 They disappear.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.960
 And that's it.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.520
 And we think, oh maybe we will have contact with these things someday.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.000
 But the masters who built those things have been dead tens of thousands of years.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.560
 And we're basically a cargo cult.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.280
 Like the tribes on the islands that when they would see airplanes passing overhead, they're

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.400
 like, tell us your secrets.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.320
 We have whole swaps of humanity looking up at these things going, how are you going to

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320
 save us?

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:47.800
 And it's just empty vessels reporting back to dead planets.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.160
 So that doesn't cheer you up.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.360
 I mean, I just think it's an intro.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.880
 We have so many theories about these things.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.120
 My personal theory.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.640
 Put our conspiracy caps on and then I'm taking mine back off because I believe aliens are

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.280
 local.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.000
 I believe they've either been, I don't believe in ancient aliens, oddly enough, but I believe

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 that aliens have either been on this planet for 100,000, 200,000, a million years.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.120
 There's not enough of them to overthrow us.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.280
 And they live underground.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.080
 Not Halloworth, but they live in the cave systems.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.080
 They live underwater.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.280
 All these UFOs we see are local UFOs.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.600
 They didn't start off here.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.080
 But they're here now.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.360
 Whether it was crashed, maybe they were on some sort of mission a long time ago and then

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.680
 their planet blew up.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.000
 They're like, "Ting it!"

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.280
 I think it's that or I think they're interdimensional.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.800
 Or they're from localized in the solar system.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.320
 I could say there's aliens on Mars and someone would laugh.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.320
 They're like, "What?

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320
 That's unscientific.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.680
 Lights faster than lights we travel."

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.840
 Now that's, it'd be far more logical for these things to be from inside the solar system

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.120
 or inside the planet.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.360
 Because think about this.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.200
 All the footage we've had of UFOs in our air.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.760
 All of the photos you can dispute a ton of them, but you have eyewitness accounts versus

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.200
 we've never, other, like every so often there'll be a glitch and you'll be like, "Oh,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.240
 look at that black cube floating by the sun."

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.760
 There's no photos of mother ships in orbit around Earth.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.480
 There's none.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:19.520
 We've never caught images of a ship coming past Pluto headed towards Earth.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.720
 We have tons of photos and video footage of aliens on Earth.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.840
 So I think they're localized.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.720
 I think they either are originally from the solar system or they use the solar system

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720
 at...

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.400
 I don't think I've ever really gone into detail with my views on UFOs.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.400
 I don't believe...

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.280
 They may have come from far, far off in the distance.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.960
 Millions of years ago, but I don't think...

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.720
 I don't think the UFO you see now, they ZOO take back off and then there's like an alien

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.600
 bowing before an alien king.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.960
 Lord Mlock Block!

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.640
 I've recently come from the planet known as Earth.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640
 I don't...

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.920
 It's so scientific it doesn't make sense.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.920
 But maybe there...

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.520
 Maybe King Mlock Block is in Mars.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.520
 And he's chilling there.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.520
 It's his vacation home.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.520
 He's spent the last 10,000 years there.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.520
 Lord Mlock Block!

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.240
 I've just come from the planet I know what planet you're from.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.680
 It's right next door.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.560
 Or aliens are interdimensional.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.600
 I've never said that I don't think aliens exist.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.280
 I just don't believe they're coming from so far away.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.280
 So that's my theory.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.240
 I think I've talked about that on the show, bits and pieces here and there.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240
 I don't think I've ever laid it out.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.040
 So they're either interdimensional.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.920
 They've been here for millions of years or they've been here for millions of years,

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.320
 but they're not based on Earth.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.800
 They're from the moon or they're from Mars.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.480
 They are from somewhere else, but they've made bases there.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.840
 That's my theory.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.440
 And I'm complaining because Barack Obama didn't back me up.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440
 And then we have...

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.240
 Remember Trump talked about aliens too and he's like, "I don't believe in them."

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.720
 Trump specifically said, "I don't believe in aliens."

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.040
 He goes, "But our boys were...

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.720
 They're seeing some weird stuff in the sky.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.040
 Seeing some weird stuff in the sky."

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.120
 Barack Obama said that he...

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.600
 When he first joined the presidency, when he first joined that club, he asked, "Do we

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.600
 have aliens?"

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.760
 And he was told a couple days later...

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.880
 It took him a couple days to figure that out.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.680
 They go, "No, there's no aliens."

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.840
 And then he talked about UAP.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.320
 So they both say the two things are different, which I think is a way we have to think about

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.560
 it, because it is very, very likely that this technology that is physics-defying and

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.840
 has all this capability to shut off our nuclear bombs and zip across the sky.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.720
 We can never catch it.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.800
 It might belong to another government on Earth.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:28.000
 And that would be more troubling than it coming from an alien planet, because we don't know

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.160
 what aliens are up to, but we know how sinister humans can be when they have a technological

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.280
 advantage.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.280
 Space vomit.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:42.280
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the handles, form little gross hands to hold onto the hang

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280
 hair glider.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.480
 We're going to jump in his bucket of vomit, and he's going to...

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:55.320
 Fly us out from the Pentagon all the way to a courthouse in Colorado.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:01.640
 And I gotta do the sound effect again for the transition.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:07.040
 I got most of this information from an article in The Daily Beast by Will Sommer, and it's

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040
 just...

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.320
 You know what?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.960
 We've talked about this before.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.920
 We've talked about this guy in particular before.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.040
 There's a man known as Corey Good.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.920
 We talked about him on Episode 47.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.400
 He was in the very first season of Dead Rav Radio.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.560
 He was the one who said that reptilians were snatching kids off streets in the United States,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.800
 shipping them to Antarctica as slaves.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.200
 And I also believe he was part of our Mars story as well.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.240
 Because kids are being kidnapped there and I don't know why the reptilians would be like

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.240
 "No, only Antarctica.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.960
 Why are there a bunch of lizard people in the coldest part of the planet?"

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.680
 Anyways, Corey Good, we've talked about him at least once on the show, I believe more

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.680
 than once.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.240
 Fascinating character, and this...

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.400
 You guys are smart.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.320
 No dummy listens to this show, right?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.360
 No one who is dummy listens to this show.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360
 You guys are smart.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.040
 We may get hoodwinked from time to time, sure.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.840
 But we're not dumb.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:12.440
 And this story highlights the difference between us and people who subscribe to other podcasts

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.360
 and other streaming services that I will unname right now, but I will name later.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.360
 But it's a different...

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.360
 It's a different group of people I'm calling dummies.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.920
 Not the people I'm about to name.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.840
 So for legal reasons, just to be polite.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.680
 So Corey Good is on the streaming service called Gaia.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.640
 And we've talked about them before too.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.560
 I described it as Oprah level metaphysics.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.960
 It's really just like wine moms talking about spirituality.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.000
 It started off as interesting, I looked into this.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.560
 It started off as an exercise brand and the guy was like "Hmm, I'm making millions of

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.520
 dollars off of these bicycles."

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.400
 What I really want to do is have people sit down for hours on end and watch conspiracy

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400
 content.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.240
 So he started Gaia and it has a more of a...

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.960
 I shouldn't call it conspiracy content.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.360
 It has more of a spirituality bent.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:07.800
 But over time, I have this theory, over time, all content bends towards the conspiracy.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.200
 It just happens.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.360
 You can have a news network that starts off just the facts.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.520
 And then over time, it'll start reporting more and more information that backs up the

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:22.480
 people who run the news agency's beliefs, which tends to become conspiracy theory.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.200
 And you see it with true crime podcasts have a problem with it as well, even if they're

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.880
 just doing true crime stuff.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.920
 Eventually they start to get this warped sense of justice or...

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.160
 It's really weird.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.160
 It's really weird.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.680
 You stay long enough in any lane, eventually it'll begin to warp towards conspiracy.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.440
 Not us, we're already fully in the conspiracy theory lane.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.160
 Started off as this spirituality movement.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.440
 Then it starts getting into ancient aliens and more conspiracy content.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:54.000
 So Cory Good does this thing where he says that when he was six years old, he was abducted

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.280
 by the blue avians.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.080
 Ka-ka!

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.160
 And it's exactly what you think it is.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.160
 It...

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160
 I'm not thinking anything.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.400
 When I hear those two words, we're together.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.000
 I'm thinking maybe like a little blue macaw on Cory Good's shoulder.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.440
 They're six foot tall bird aliens.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440
 They're blue.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.440
 Also, they're blue.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.680
 It's not like they're sad all the time.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.840
 They're not huge fans of Eiffel 65.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.600
 They're six foot tall blue birds.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.100
 Fascinating imagery.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:27.280
 I'm a huge fan of insectoids because they don't get enough love in UFOology.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.280
 And now we have the avians.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.680
 The blue avian.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.760
 He was abducted and he was taught all these psychic skills and stuff like that.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.760
 And then he was abducted.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.920
 Like they're like, "See you later!"

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.960
 And as the birds are taking him back home, someone else abducts him.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.840
 He's abducted by the secret space program and he's part of this thing called 20 and

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.120
 Back where you do 20 years guaranteed in the secret space program and then you're sent

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.120
 back home.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.240
 And then no one's allowed to abduct you from here on out.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240
 Secret space program.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.920
 I've covered that before.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.720
 It's exactly what it says.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.880
 The governments of the world have a space program that you don't know about.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.880
 There you go.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.520
 And it hovers around the moon and they have basals on Mars and stuff like that.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.000
 So secret space program.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Blue avians.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 20 and Back.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.680
 So he has this show on Gaia called Cosmic Disclosure.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.840
 And he has a co-host and they sit and they talk about like, "Oh dude, you won't believe

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.840
 what happened last weekend.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.840
 What happened to you, Corey?"

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.080
 Well I was walking on the street and I got abducted by a bunch of blue birds.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.920
 And then he would tell this other story and it kind of just goes on and on and on.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.000
 Well he left the show in 2018.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.040
 His co-host left earlier.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.720
 But in 2018, Corey goes like, "You know what?

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.200
 I don't want to do this anymore."

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.840
 And Corey's always back wounds all over him.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.840
 He's covered in bandages.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.000
 He's like, "If I get abducted by these birds one more time, I'm going to lose it."

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.800
 He quits the show.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.800
 This is a big rated show for Gaia, right?

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.880
 Because it sounds ultra ridiculous.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.000
 Who doesn't want to sit around and listen to an adult man to see he got kidnapped by

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.480
 birds last week?

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.320
 And there's a new episode every single week.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.680
 Who doesn't want to watch that?

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.840
 So you can watch the insanity of a man wash over him.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.560
 He's just throwing crackers everywhere.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.040
 He's like, "Take these birds!

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.040
 Take the crackers and not me!"

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.960
 He doesn't want to watch that.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.920
 There's no CGI recreation.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.160
 I've never seen it but I'm just assuming it's him sitting in a chair being like, "You

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.160
 won't believe what happened."

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.960
 It would be way better if then it got to an animated version.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.600
 There's him cowering in a corner.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.120
 These giant birds are walking towards him.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.560
 He quit the show.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.840
 So Gaia goes, "Well, let's just keep the show going.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.160
 Cosmic Disclosure.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.440
 Now the new host is, I want to call him Jason Todd but he got killed by the Joker with a

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.600
 crowbar.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600
 What's his name?

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.720
 It is Jason Rice."

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.480
 And so they get Jason Rice to come on the show and he goes, "Welcome to Cosmic Disclosure.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.000
 I'm the new host, Jason Rice.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.560
 And wouldn't you know it?

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.680
 Wouldn't you know it, trusting audience of Gaia?"

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.800
 This is 100% true.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.880
 This is so ridiculous.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.320
 Jason Rice takes over the show called Cosmic Disclosure and he goes, "Guys, you won't

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.680
 believe what just happened.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:09.400
 But I was also abducted by Blue Avians and it happened when I was a kid and I was abducted

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.200
 by the Secret Space Program.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.200
 Can you believe it?

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:19.280
 Two people who both host the show were abducted by the same themes of the show.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.200
 We were abducted by the same characters of the show.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.320
 And I also signed a contract called 20 and back.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.600
 So I was abducted when I was six.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.080
 I was on all these adventures with these birds.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:35.840
 And here I am to tell you week after week about bird people."

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.200
 So Corey Good is suing Gaia.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.880
 This is so fascinating to me and it should be an absolute wake up call to anyone who

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.080
 believes any of this nonsense.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080
 Right?

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:56.240
 I was just talking about aliens hanging out on Mars and King Block Block.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.200
 This is obviously not a true story.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.280
 I mean the lawsuit and everything I just told you is true but I'm talking about the Blue

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.360
 Avians because Blue Avians, he trademarked that.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.800
 Corey Good owns the trademark to Blue Avians, 20 and back, which is dumb.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.800
 Don't trademark this stupid stuff.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800
 Corey saved your money.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.200
 And he trademarked Secret Space Program.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.320
 I cannot trademark.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:27.880
 I, Jason Carpenter, cannot trademark United States Air Force because it's a real thing

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.120
 that a government owns.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.320
 And I definitely, I'm pretty, I could trademark insectoid for like a t-shirt.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.360
 If I wanted to have like an insectoid t-shirt brand.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.600
 But I couldn't then prevent anyone else from using the word insectoid.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.680
 It's a scientific term.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.360
 A bunch of bugs, a bunch of bug doctors would show up.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.360
 Is that a thing?

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.560
 They'd become a thing and they'd show up and they'd beat me up with mandibles.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.000
 He trademarked, before this happened, he'd trademarked, it was back in 2014 because

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.840
 he just left the show in 2018.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:03.320
 He trademarked the term Blue Avians the way an author would trademark something.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.080
 And he's in court right now trying to convince the judge to not let them talk about Blue

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.080
 Avians.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:14.360
 He owned the supposedly real alien race that kidnapped him when he was six years old.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.720
 They don't have their name trademarked.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.680
 And you're like, Jason, why would a bird trademark their own name?

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.480
 That's a good point and an absurd statement.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.920
 But why would he?

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.920
 Why would he?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:35.120
 If it was, if it was, I would have never thought, if I ran into a gnome named Bork, I would

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.120
 have never, and we went on this magical adventure and I planned on telling you the story, I

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.200
 would have never thought in a million years why better trademark Bork's name because

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.200
 he's real.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.000
 I've never trademarked any, I've trademarked stuff before, but I've never trademarked

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.840
 like my cat's name or my best friend's name.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.600
 Now I'm actually having really good ideas.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.400
 I should start trademarking those names and charging my best friend to hang out with me.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:04.280
 He trademarked the name Blue Avian and he's saying, Gaia, you can't use this stuff.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.280
 I made it up.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.880
 I mean, I experienced it first and I trademarked it and you can't talk about this stuff.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.600
 Now Gaia goes, but it's real, Corey, right?

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.920
 Blue Avians are real and you can't trademark real stuff.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.560
 And right now there's a trademark attorney coming out on YouTube.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560
 You know what I mean?

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.640
 You can trademark Blue Avian as a brand of drink.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.720
 But if there's this real adventure, you can't trademark the adventure because it's real.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.880
 So he's suing Gaia and he goes, you guys can't use this as his trademark stuff.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.760
 He can't come forward and say, you guys can't use this.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.080
 I made it up.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.080
 This is my story.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.080
 I made it up.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.000
 Gaia is like, you can't stop us because this man was also abducted when he was six years

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.080
 old by the Blue Avians.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.800
 So Corey Good can either come forward and say, you're right.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.440
 I made it all up and it was really fun and he is nudging the audience and he goes, but

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.520
 you guys had a good time listening to the story, right?

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.040
 He could do that and goes, but Gaia can't report on this anymore because I made it up.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.600
 Or he could try to argue in court.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.880
 If you're on her, I was abducted when I was six years old by a species of bluebirds.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.280
 He wasn't.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:16.080
 And that guy would be like, no, I remember seeing you in the elevator.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.960
 Or he can do this.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:26.660
 He says that this is absolutely mind bogglingly bad legal decision.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.680
 This is his argument, not that the Blue Avian thing is fake.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:38.840
 Corey Good is arguing that Gaia is run by Satan worshipers.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.840
 That's not illegal defense.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.240
 That was illegal defense.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.320
 You could shut down a ton of people.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.120
 He says they're run by Satan worshipers.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.720
 That's his argument in court.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.080
 And his co-host that I mentioned earlier was David Wilcock, who's another big name in

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.920
 UFOology.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:04.000
 The reason why he left cosmic disclosure was because he believed back in 2016 that Gaia

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.200
 was run by Satan worshipers, by Luciferians.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.720
 That's the term they're using specifically.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:16.520
 And Gaia asked cosmic disclosure to do a promo for another show called like Ancient Civilizations

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.920
 of David Wilcock.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.280
 Apparently, this, I'm getting all this information.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.760
 If anyone's coming to sue me, I'm getting all this information from that Daily Beast

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.760
 article.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.240
 This summer can be my co-defendant in court.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:33.600
 David Wilcock supposedly said, "I'm not doing a promo read for Ancient Civilization.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.040
 That show is run by Luciferians."

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.720
 And everyone hates Luciferians, and if I do a promo read for that, they're gonna come

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.720
 after me.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.520
 Not the Luciferians, the people who ate Luciferians are gonna come after David Wilcock.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.720
 So he left the show.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:53.440
 Because they wanted him to do like a tie-in for some other show on the network he's on.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.400
 He was very, very clear on that back in 2016.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.280
 So I hate to break this to you, Corey.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:05.600
 If Luciferians are running Gaia, you knew it back in 2016, when your co-host left for

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.800
 that reason.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:12.560
 So if you continue to work with Luciferians for two more years, that's on you, dude.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560
 Right?

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.560
 That's on you.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.240
 That's not gonna work in a court of law.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.320
 I just made this board judge being like, "Ugh, what's next?"

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.640
 And I walk in with this little dwarf, or co-defendants as well.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.240
 Gaia is countersuing Corey Good.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.560
 Gaia is countersuing Corey Good for defamation, right?

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.240
 Because he's calling him a bunch of sane worshipers.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.760
 He's calling him the sane worshipers.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.000
 They're suing him for defamation.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.720
 Oh, and Corey Good also had this weird anecdote.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.480
 He goes, "One of the reasons why he quit is one of the senior officials of Gaia, one

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:48.280
 of the senior officials of the spirituality network, quasi-conspiracy network.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.320
 One day Corey Good is sitting there, eating some chicken.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.520
 He's like, "I hate the blue avian so much.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.080
 I eat their kind on earth."

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.520
 He is sitting in the break room where he's walking around the Gaia offices, and one of

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.800
 the main leaders, one of the senior executives of Gaia has walked through the office as well.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.800
 He goes, "Corey Good!"

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.360
 The thing is, let me pause this story for a second.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:18.840
 The swarm about to take place on earth, and it is as ridiculous as any of his space-based

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.840
 stories.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.720
 This is part of his legal reasons of why he quit the show.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:28.160
 Corey Good's hanging out at the offices of Gaia one day, and a senior executive walks

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:34.840
 into whatever room he's in and goes, "Corey Good!" and pulls out a gun.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.520
 Because when you think of the executives of Gaia, right, of this meditation network,

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.800
 you imagine they're all armed in the offices, right?

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.120
 You imagine they're always walking around with AKs.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.320
 He pulls out a gun and points it at Corey.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.680
 He says, "You have one week to record 26 episodes of content.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680
 You got it?

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.360
 You got it Corey Good!

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.360
 You want to be Corey Bad!"

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.800
 Corey's like, "That doesn't make sense."

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.560
 The guy goes, "I have the gun.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.200
 I make the puns."

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.560
 That one actually does sound pretty good.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.280
 You gonna make 26 episodes in one week, and Corey's like, "I'll do it!

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.280
 I'll do it!

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.080
 Man, just back off!"

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.720
 He's praying he gets them talking right now.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.680
 He's like, "Please, bluebirds, take me away!"

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.240
 The executive storms off.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.560
 He's looking for the intern to get his coffee, putting guns to people's heads.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.360
 So Corey Good says that's one of the reasons why he quit.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.280
 A guy in the office, a senior executive pulled a gun on him and said, "Make 26 episodes in

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.280
 a week."

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.960
 And he's like, "How am I supposed to make up that much stuff in a week, man?

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.280
 I got a narrative to build.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.080
 It's not like any of this is based on any sort of real stuff."

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.160
 Dude, if someone put a gun in my head, well, first off, that would be a bad one.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.800
 It would be bad for that dude, because I'm a ninja.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.680
 But let's say that that day I'm just kind of sleepy.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.520
 I just ate a bunch of turkey, and the guy puts it in my head, and I'm like, "Oh, what

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.520
 do you want?"

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.520
 Instead, make 26 episodes in a week.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.680
 I'd be like, "Okay, I pretty much do that anyways.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.080
 I can do that."

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.880
 So Corey Good, you gotta push them up by your bootstraps.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.240
 Someone puts a gun to your head.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.240
 Just do what they say.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.080
 You can do 26 episodes in a week.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.840
 So that is this lawsuit going on.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.400
 Really fascinating stuff.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.080
 So to fans of Corey Good, this should be a wake-up call, right?

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.680
 I guess I can't say he's 100% making it up.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.840
 There could be a portion of it being true.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:23.160
 But the fact that he is arguing that he's the only guy who was abducted to join as part

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.520
 of the space program, just one six-year-old boy, obviously they're abducting other people

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.960
 or other people are just joining.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.400
 And he's saying he was the only one who was part of this avian soul group, this blue avian

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.320
 soul group or whatever.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.840
 It should make you consider whether or not he's telling the truth.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:48.360
 It really, really, really should make you--there's not a single listener of this podcast who

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.240
 listens to that show.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.840
 But if on the off chance you are and this is all news to you, it should really make you

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.680
 reconsider him.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.200
 It should really make you go, "Mmm, it is kind of weird that he's claiming all of this

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.280
 stuff but it only happened to him.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.720
 It can't happen to anyone else.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.280
 No one else can take over the show."

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:12.560
 And at the same time, it should make you give a side eye to Gaia because Gaia obviously

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:19.120
 either knows that this is all fabricated and they go, "This is a top rated show so let's

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.080
 get someone else into fabricated."

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.040
 Or they got hoodwinked again that some other guy saw that this guy was leaving and goes,

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040
 "Guys, you won't believe it.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.040
 It's just the other day.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.040
 I also got abducted by blue avians and guys like, "That's perfect.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.120
 We have the perfect job for you."

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.120
 And it shows up.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:39.040
 So either everyone is goofing on everyone else.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.240
 That's a legal term by the way.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.240
 Goofing.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.400
 Your honor, he's goofing on me.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.840
 That's a legal term.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840
 So it's either that.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.960
 Either goofing on goofs or people are getting fooled, which is not any better, right?

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.640
 You don't want the people you get your spirituality and yoga advice to be easily gullible.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.960
 Otherwise you're going to do the yoga wrong and your soul is going to get tormented.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.160
 And then you have to extrapolate it out obviously.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.720
 Is that this Corey Good is not an isolated event.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.880
 There's not just one person spinning these stories.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:17.040
 He's the only person that I know of though that was savvy enough to trademark it.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.240
 And again, that makes it look suspicious.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.040
 No one went and fought in Vietnam and had these crazy stories, like these crazy adventures

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:27.440
 in Vietnam and then came back and trademarked the village that they were in or trademarked

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.400
 the country of Vietnam.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.000
 It just doesn't happen.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.520
 So is Corey Good just ahead of the curve and he's able to trademark this stuff and he's

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.320
 savvy about it or is this leaning towards the fact that it's fabricated?

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.560
 It will be interesting to see where this court trial goes.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.960
 I'll try to keep you updated.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:49.000
 I just wish for the first time in my life I wish I lived in Colorado.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.080
 I would quit my job and just hang out at the courthouse all day long.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.880
 Just to watch the judge slowly descend into insanity.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.040
 And then after the trial he's like bye because that's what the judges do right after the

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.540
 trial they wave.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.640
 See you guys later and then he walks into the judges quarters and that's where I'm living

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.120
 because I lost my place because I quit my job.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.920
 I'm hiding under his desk and the judge walks in and I can just see his feet and he's like

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.560
 "Oh finally it's time to get out of this."

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.920
 And he drops his black robe to the ground and I'm like "Where's this going?"

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.520
 And I'm just seeing his feet and then he takes his shoes off and I'm expecting to see like

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520
 bird feet.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.080
 That kind of makes sense right?

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.480
 Now it's just human feet and I'm like disappointed.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.280
 I'm looking at these 10 human toes and I'm like "Oh man."

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:35.720
 But then the 10 toes begin to wiggle and they're like shaking and stuff like that.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.400
 And he's like "Oh my muscle spasms."

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.520
 And I'm like "Dang it I thought like bird talons are gonna pop out."

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.680
 And then he starts like straight, he starts doing yoga because he's watching all that

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.160
 Gaia video during the trial and he's doing yoga and I'm like "What, how long is this

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.360
 gonna take?"

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.520
 And then I hear the sound of like, skin tearing like flesh rip.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.880
 I know what that sounds like!

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.040
 I don't even have to see it.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.940
 I'm like that's obviously a man's skin being ripped from his bones.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:07.340
 I hear this *pfft* and I am like curious now, like is he turning into a bird?

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.260
 That's the whole gimmick here that I think he's a bird!

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.880
 But I'm under the desk, and he's really just opening a bag of flaming hot Cheetos.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.880
 And I'm like dang it.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.040
 And he's like yhosh yhosh yhosh, eating them.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.960
 And then I remember something.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.160
 Flaming hot Cheetos are disgusting.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.360
 And I realize that no human in the right mind would ever, ever buy a bag of flaming hot Cheetos

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.480
 to eat by themselves and then buy it as a prank to pull on one of their friends who can't

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.840
 read who's illiterate and doesn't know what the bag looks like.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.480
 And I go, a human tongue would have obviously been burnt by now.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.000
 And then I notice that he doesn't sound like a human eating flaming hot Cheetos.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.280
 It sounds like a beak going *chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck*.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.920
 And then that's enough evidence for me.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:01.320
 I start sneaking out and I turn around and they're sitting at the judge's booth or bench

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.680
 or whatever it is.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:06.320
 The desk I was hiding under, I forgot what it's called.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.440
 There's a big blue avian bird and his beak is all covered in Cheeto dust.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.160
 Yes, we are in the episode.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.020
 I'm not going to be able to get to the two-dimensional hobo, this one.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.400
 But there's a really big one.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.440
 Jason, tell us that story.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:26.080
 Could talk about this stupid bird, this dumb bird thing that's gone on for five minutes.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.760
 You could have told me something about a two-dimensional hobo.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.720
 What are you doing, dude?

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.680
 Anyways, there's this bird flaming hot Cheetos.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.080
 And his hands are now giant feathers.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.080
 It's a full-on bird.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.320
 And he goes, "I would love to abduct you, young man.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:51.420
 I would love to abduct you and take you to space and raise you as my own.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.380
 Like you were an egg born from my wife's vagina.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.540
 I wish I could do that.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.420
 But unfortunately I can't because that has been trademarked."

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.420
 And he drops the Cheetos and he turns around and he faces the window looking outside.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.660
 Everyone in town now sees that their judge is a giant blue bird.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.100
 The whole city is aghast.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:15.800
 He's like, "No, because now that Corey Good has made it illegal for us to even abduct

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.300
 the children, can you believe that?

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.400
 We're no longer allowed to abduct people.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.840
 Because if we abduct people, now we will be dragged in front of trademark court."

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.560
 You see, Corey Good thinks that he's just shutting down Gaia Television.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.920
 But in fact, he's shutting down communication between two species.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.580
 Blue avians, we truly do exist.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.680
 But we can never, ever show up on Earth.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.820
 We can never help you into the cosmic brotherhood.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:52.700
 Because one man, one man filed one lawsuit and one, he has shut down cosmic communication

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.220
 for all time.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:36:02.380
 He looks us in the eye and he goes, "Because of human greed, Earth will have no friends

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.380
 in the galaxy."

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:13.800
 Goodbye, space brothers, or I should say, space orphans.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.600
 Cacock!

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.600
 Cacock!

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.760
 Flies out the window.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.760
 Space vomit.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.920
 Call in that carpenter copter.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.520
 We're not going to be able to see the two dimensional hobo this episode, but I just want to make

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.320
 sure you ride in that carpenter copter.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.320
 Bring it on down.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.120
 We're going to take it back to Dead Rabbit Command.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.320
 It's a solemn journey.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.320
 We're all sad.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.660
 Corey Good, before you finish this lawsuit, think about that.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:46.680
 You want to be an advocate of cosmic disclosure, but this may cause us to fall into an eternity

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.440
 of cosmic silence.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.140
 And I'll talk about two dimensional hobos on tomorrow's episode.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.060
