WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.760
 A bizarre sighting in the middle of the woods.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.400
 A conspiracy that involves America's favorite pastime.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.880
 And then we take another trip to the conspiracy theory iceberg

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.040
 to look at the bizarre theory that demonic activity

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.320
 is closely connected to the blue light

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.760
 coming out of your cell phone today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.340
 (upbeat music)

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.200
 Hey, everyone.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.000
 Back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.880
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.960
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.280
 We got three stories.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.360
 First off, I wanna give a shout out

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.280
 to our newest Patreon, Swain on Discord.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.800
 Swain on Discord.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.000
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.120
 Really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.880
 I wanna say this about Swain real quick.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.360
 There's gonna be a link in the show notes.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.560
 Today I'm putting it above even my Patreon link.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.760
 I want everyone to check this out.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.720
 A long time ago, Swain took my Thomas Dick episode.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.480
 And made a proof of concept little animation

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.320
 of that episode.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.880
 It's maybe like 40 seconds, a minute long.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.920
 Ah, dude, I think it's so funny.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.380
 Actually watching this video, watching this cartoon,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.760
 made me realize how my style of presenting it,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.080
 it was really kind of a wake up call.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.040
 It was kind of weird to see myself doing the show.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.200
 'Cause this was pretty early on.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.320
 I think this was in the first 100 episodes.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.520
 It was really, really cool.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.560
 I'd been meaning to share it with you.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.320
 And then I forgot who sent it to me, honestly.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.000
 And then I've lost the link.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.720
 But when he hit me up on the Patreon,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.760
 I was able to track it down.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.600
 So there it is.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.560
 I recommend all you guys checking out his channel,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.440
 checking out that video.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.280
 It's super funny.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.480
 It's a little animated version of that episode.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.320
 Awesome.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.160
 Thank you so much, Swain.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.080
 Thank you so much for doing that.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.280
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.840
 Just help get the word out about the show.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.720
 That really, really helps out a lot, guys.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.680
 Swain, we're gonna toss you the keys

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.600
 to the Jason Jalopy.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.520
 First off, we're headed out to the middle of the forest.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.680
 (humming)

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 We're getting married, apparently.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.640
 What's that song from?

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.960
 Some old timey thing.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.800
 Doesn't matter.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.960
 Music box music.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.760
 We get to the middle of the forest.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.600
 Now this is totally unsourced.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.040
 This was a post from the export

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.480
 that was screen-shotted and then presented on Reddit.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.440
 So that's the providence of this story.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.680
 Or providence, providence.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.520
 It doesn't matter.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.340
 Providence.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.440
 This is the providence of this story.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.280
 We don't have a source.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.240
 We don't have a location.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.360
 We don't have anything like that.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.320
 But I still find this story interesting.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.160
 We're gonna take a look.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.760
 Okay, so slow down the car, Swain.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.480
 We're pulling up into the forest.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.320
 Get out.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.560
 We got on our hunting caps.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.480
 We got our rifles.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.320
 We're walking around.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.960
 And we're gonna join a man hunting with his grandfather.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.480
 What happened was there was a kid.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.160
 He was 19th birthday.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.360
 He was out hunting with his grandpa.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.240
 A little father, not father-son,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.080
 by the name of the activity.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.520
 Grandfather-son, by the name of the act.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.000
 No, they're not.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.400
 Whatever, two dudes are hanging out in the woods, right?

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.440
 And they see a deer walking, walking around.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.720
 And this is what they came here for.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.160
 This isn't that Rihanna song.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.640
 This is what they actually came here for.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.400
 They're gonna kill this deer.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.440
 And the deer stops and looks at a rock.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.120
 And they get their guns ready.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.760
 Do both of them shoot at the same time?

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.560
 I've never been hunting.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.880
 Do you take turns hunting?

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.720
 Like, do I have it?

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.600
 And I'm like, okay, I'm gonna shoot it in the neck this time.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.000
 And you're like, no, you numbschool.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.840
 I'm gonna do it.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.320
 You guys are wrestling over the gun.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.280
 If there's two people with guns, do they take turns?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.640
 Do they both shoot at the same time?

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.400
 Whichever bullet hits it first wins?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.200
 Anyways, they're sitting there with their guns.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.320
 This is, I'm a city boy.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.880
 They're sitting there with their guns.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.960
 And they see this deer.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.400
 And the deer is like just standing there

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.840
 looking at this rock.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.240
 And then slams its head into the rock.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.800
 And the grandpa and the son, the son's not there.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.720
 The grandpa, the son realizes a disturbance.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.200
 The grandfather and the grandson look at each other.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.560
 And they look back at the deer.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.520
 And the rock is covered in blood.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.000
 And the deer looks at the rock.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.160
 (gasps)

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
 Smashes its head into the rock again.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.000
 (imitates gunshot)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.600
 Smashes its head into the rock again.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.160
 One of the antlers break off.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.000
 It's like 3D.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.840
 It's coming right at the grandpa and the grandson.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.480
 Well, they dodge.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.320
 (imitates gunshot)

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.720
 Crash, crash, crash.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.680
 Smashin' its head into the rock.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.000
 Harder and harder and harder.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.320
 The deer rears its head back up.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.960
 And brains are shooting out of the deer.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.440
 Swains thrown up in the corner.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.240
 (imitates gunshot)

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.080
 Sorry, Swain.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.320
 He's holding his hair back.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.960
 Smash, smash.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.800
 The deer keeps smashing its head into the rock.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.960
 Brains are just leaking out.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.960
 And then the deer stands up on two legs, looks around,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.040
 starts walking towards the river on two legs.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.880
 And then just doot, doot, doot.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.840
 Raging river, doot, doot, doot.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.120
 Walking deeper into the water, doot, doot.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.960
 Grounds.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.760
 The grandpa and the grandson,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.120
 the birthday party's canceled, right?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.560
 Grandfather actually moved out of the area.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.240
 He went to go live with his grandmother in Florida.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.200
 Not his grandmother.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.800
 She went to be like Betsy Ross.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.480
 He goes to live with his wife in Florida.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.040
 I don't know whether they separated before.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.520
 He's like, honey, please take me back.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.200
 I've seen the air of my ways.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.000
 Plus, I've seen pure Cthulhu level horror.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.480
 Please, I want another chance.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.040
 He moves in with his ex-wife, his grandma.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.880
 Not his grandma.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.720
 What is up with you?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.000
 The point is that grandfather moves away

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.560
 and the grandson never went back to the forest.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.400
 So that story was posted.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.320
 It's creepy, right?

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.800
 It's pretty disgusting.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.040
 Some people have had, first off,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.200
 let's assume the story's true.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.560
 Could totally be fake, could be creepy, boss.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.720
 But let's assume for the sake of argument, that's true.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.760
 Some people on Reddit goes,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.360
 it could be chronic wasting disease.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.560
 It could have had like Khrushchevill's Jokub disease.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.840
 It's the Mad Cow disease,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.480
 but it's the deer version, Mad Deer disease.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.640
 It could have been that they had like a,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.840
 like some sort of obviously mental deficiency

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.720
 and smashed their brains.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.160
 It could be that they were having some sort of disease

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.440
 that was eating away at their brain.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.120
 And the itch was so bad

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.960
 that they were smashing their head into the rock.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.580
 Doesn't explain why they walked up on two feet.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.140
 I guess deer sometimes can walk on two feet,

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.760
 not for a super long distance,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.320
 but they have been known to do that.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.920
 There's video footage of them walking like that.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.880
 But yeah, a bizarre story.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.560
 I mean, obviously I'm covering it

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.960
 not just because it's bizarre,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.640
 but because it's almost like,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.440
 it is like a Cthulhu level thing,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.800
 like an animal killing itself very calmly.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.880
 Like it was smashing its head,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.040
 but it wasn't crying out in pain.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.660
 And then once it had already knocked out a good chunk

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.560
 of its brains, it stood up and walked away into the river.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.000
 Now that obviously sounds fake.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.200
 Another person on Reddit was saying,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.880
 they worked at a farm.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.400
 Oh, by the way, if you love animals, rewind it.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.240
 Don't listen to this first story.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.280
 But sorry, I should have said that earlier.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.520
 This one guy said he was working on a farm in Australia

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.840
 and there was massive wildfire.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.240
 And he remembers seeing kangaroos

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.800
 that had been caught on fire running towards their fence line.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.880
 They had a metal fence line around their property.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.960
 And he says the kangaroos were burning.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.240
 They were on fire.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.200
 They're killing themselves.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.160
 They began smashing their heads into the metal fence line

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.260
 to kill the pain was so unbearable.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.840
 Which is interesting because I didn't know animals

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.120
 were that smart.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.960
 Like, I didn't think an animal was smart enough

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.980
 to kill itself.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.740
 Like, yeah, sure, lemmings, you know, that's not true.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.600
 You know, lemmings don't really run off cliffs.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.040
 That's a weird thing.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.320
 Walt Disney's, that was from a documentary

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.240
 that Walt Disney made.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.760
 And they're like, I don't know if they just needed

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.640
 a climatic ending or something like that.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.120
 I guess lemmings kind of do that.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.840
 But they, the producers of that documentary pushed them off.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.320
 They were like, it wasn't like off screen.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.880
 There was a intern like throwing them off the cliff.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.080
 But they edited the footage

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.280
 and made basically like herded them off the cliff.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.800
 I think it is a real thing, but not to the scale

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.360
 that it really is.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.560
 And then that movie was a meme, made it a thing.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.960
 But anyways, like, how does a kangaroo,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.800
 so you're on fire, this is super grim,

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.660
 but let's say I'm a kangaroo and I'm smoldering.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.040
 Not like I'm super sexy, I'm literally smoky.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.960
 And I see a pillow, a metal stake, and a tree.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.800
 And I have to smash my head into one of those three things.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.600
 I didn't think animals were smart enough to go,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.440
 pillow out, just take a nap.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.080
 The metal stake will go through my brain

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.840
 and that tree will take a long time for me to smash my head.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.760
 'Cause they don't know what metal is.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.640
 I didn't know that animals knew the difference

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.360
 between like minerals and stuff.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.120
 Like, I didn't know, like if you put a kangaroo

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.200
 and you had like, let's say you had a cliff.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.520
 You were like, Jason, please, please,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.600
 just stop talking about it.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.920
 You had a cliff and there was like a bunch of water

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.600
 at the bottom of one cliff and then a bunch of water

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.400
 and some jagged rocks on another cliff.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.440
 Swain's like, give me my money back.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.320
 Why am I here for this episode?

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.400
 He's erasing the cartoon, he deletes it from me too.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.520
 You have a cliff, you have a water.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.560
 You have a cliff, you have water with jagged rocks

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.080
 and then you have a cliff with like a pavement underneath it.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.440
 Wouldn't the kangaroo go to the first cliff and go,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.000
 that's just water, I'll probably swim.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.240
 But it will put the fire out.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.760
 And then he jumps to the other one

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.880
 but he still wants to kill himself

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.440
 because he owes the mob a bunch of money

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.240
 and he can't pay him back and he's on fire.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.760
 So he goes to the other cliff and he sees the jagged rocks

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.580
 and he goes, hmm, that will kill me but maybe not.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.200
 Maybe I'll fall in between the jagged rocks

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.400
 and dive very slowly and then he goes to the other cliff

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.280
 and sees the pavement and goes, that is pavement.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.600
 In my kangaroo brain, it knows

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.640
 that that will kill me instantly

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.600
 because the reason I know that if I jump off a cliff

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.800
 and if I land on pavement, I will die

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.240
 is because people have told me that.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.320
 I don't genetically know, I never genetically knew that.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.640
 You didn't know that.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.920
 We don't know that if you fall off a distance, you die

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.840
 unless somebody tells you or you see it happen.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.240
 If I, kangaroos aren't walking around with watermelons

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.560
 and they don't butterfingers in, they're like, oops.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.600
 And they watch the watermelon splat on the ground

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.640
 and the kangaroo goes, that will happen to me.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.540
 If I fall, that's not how animals think, right?

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.800
 So how did the animals know?

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.840
 How did, why wasn't the deer smashing his head on a tree?

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.720
 How did he know a rock was going to do the job?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.880
 Like, how did they figure that out?

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.080
 So anyways, the kangaroos, they sell on metal spikes

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.440
 which to me makes me think that they know minerals and stuff

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.000
 'cause then they'd be like, that's like soft soap rock.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.320
 What's that rock that's like pumice, the kangaroo's on fire.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.160
 You see he's a bunch of pumice.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.000
 You guys get it.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.240
 I'm not gonna keep naming.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.800
 I'm not gonna keep coming with hypothetical situations.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.120
 How does the kangaroo know that the metal would do it?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.000
 Like, did they jump past another fence

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.400
 then it was just like wood and the kangaroos are like,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.960
 sure I'm burning to death, but that won't do the job.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.840
 I know another 50 feet there's a metal fence line.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.080
 So there you go.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.400
 I did not intend for that to be another evolutionary rant

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.880
 but it turned out to be one.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.880
 Swain, let's go ahead and leave behind Australia.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.120
 That's where we ended up in that story.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.680
 Let's hop in the carpenter copter.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.340
 We're headed back to America.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.640
 This is a really short one.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.560
 I've had this on deck for a while.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.400
 That was very interesting

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.120
 'cause I talk a lot about real conspiracies,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.560
 conspiracies that are provable that matter.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.040
 And this conspiracy you can argue

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.000
 whether or not it matters.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.240
 I think it matters to a large group of people though.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.460
 And I gotta give a shout out to Chris Thompson

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.240
 for Dead Spin, the website Dead Spin.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.960
 He wrote this article a while back in July of 2019

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.040
 and all of my research comes from this article.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.400
 To give you a little background of the story,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.960
 you have Major League Baseball, MLB.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.440
 Recently, back in 2019, had purchased Rawlings

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.160
 and they're the ones who make the baseballs

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.580
 that are used in professional level baseball games.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.360
 So originally they are two separate companies

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.760
 but now Major League Baseball bought out Rawlings.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.120
 And then we have this quote

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.480
 from Houston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.920
 He was speaking to ESPN and he had this quote

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.040
 and he's gonna be referencing a man named Rob Manfred.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.800
 He's the Major League Baseball Commissioner.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.240
 So that's a little bit of background to this.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.200
 I think this is an interesting conspiracy.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.920
 And so what Verlander's beef is,

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.760
 is he believes that Major League Baseball

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.320
 is messing with the baseballs themselves

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.600
 because now they own the company

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.360
 that manufactures the baseball.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.360
 He believes that Major League Baseball

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.360
 is actually gooseing up the balls.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.800
 They're making it so they can just hit homer

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.000
 after homer after homer.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.880
 Look at this quote, I found this interesting.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.000
 It's an effing joke, Verlander says.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.360
 It's an effing joke.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.800
 Major League Baseball's turning this game into a joke.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.000
 They own Rawlings and you've got Manfred up here saying

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.360
 it might be the way they center the pill.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.760
 Some baseball term, I don't know what that means,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.800
 but you might.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.880
 Back to the quote, they own the effing company.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.200
 If any other 40 billion company

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.160
 bought out a 400 million company

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.800
 and the product changed dramatically,

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.800
 it's not a guess as to what happened.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.700
 We all know what happened.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.520
 Manfred the first time he came in, what do you say?

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.600
 He said they want more offense.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.400
 All of a sudden he comes in, the balls are juiced.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.760
 It's not a coincidence, we are not idiots.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.500
 Then they're asking, do you think that this is intentional?

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.120
 Do you think that these balls are making it easier

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.000
 to hit home runs?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.220
 He goes into this quote, yes, 100%.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.400
 They've been using juiced balls in the home run derby forever.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.560
 They know how to do it, it's not coincidence.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.860
 I find it really hard to believe

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.200
 that Major League Baseball owns Rawlings

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.440
 and just coincidentally, the balls become juiced.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.280
 Manfred had a response to this and he simply said,

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.640
 "The balls have not been changed in quote,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.080
 "any meaningful way."

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.120
 So the balls have been changed.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.420
 I think that's an interesting conspiracy theory.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.380
 It's one that affects millions of people, baseball fans.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.260
 It definitely also affects money.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.300
 So it's an interesting conspiracy theory.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.500
 It's one that is probably true, right?

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.580
 It's one that involves a corporation

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.140
 manipulating the outcome behind the scenes.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.180
 It really has all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.980
 You have a truth sayer who's putting his career on the line.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.780
 I'm sure that his coaches got several phone calls

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.620
 after this interview.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.040
 I'm sure he got pulled in his coaches office

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.880
 and all this stuff.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.200
 It's all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.040
 I find this type of stuff very fascinating.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.920
 It's a reminder that there are conspiracy theories

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.280
 happening all around us.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.200
 They're like miracles.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.120
 They happen all around and we don't know how they work,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.560
 but they happen.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.160
 Very, very fascinating story.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.200
 I don't really cover many sports on this show,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.520
 but I thought that was an interesting one.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.320
 So Swain, let's hop in that carbonar copter

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.880
 one last time this episode.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.640
 We're headed out to Britain to start this adventure.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.600
 (imitates flying)

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.680
 We're flying out of Houston, Texas.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.140
 Supposedly, we'll cover this in a later episode,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.020
 but supposedly there's supposed to be a massive hurricane

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.380
 hitting Houston, Texas on August 10th, I think it was.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.220
 We'll be covering that.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.300
 It's possible that a time traveler is using TikTok

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.860
 to warn people of the future.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.660
 However, he's also selling t-shirts.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.740
 So I'm a little skeptical of his time travel claims,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.020
 but Beatrice Leyva sent me that story.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.420
 We'll be talking about that later in the week.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.780
 That's a little teaser for that.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.060
 (imitates flying)

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.820
 We're leaving behind.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.940
 Beatrice is like, "No, no, the hurricane's coming.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:18.980
 Save me, save me.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.880
 What, we can't hear you over the carbonar copter.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.880
 We can totally hear her.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.180
 We're just leaving her behind.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.760
 Wait, no, I'm a loyal listener."

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.600
 We're flying away.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.600
 So she's a loyal listener, but we're still leaving her

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.440
 to the hurricane that won't happen.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.600
 But we're flying out.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.480
 We're flying out to Britain.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.800
 So this is from the Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.160
 It's just a simple phrase on the Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.360
 And again, thank you, some weirdo from Twitter, aka Jack,

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.400
 for making this Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.520
 Spreadsheet has really made a lot of this stuff helpful

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.700
 to look at.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.580
 We're flying to Britain because there's a Conspiracy Theory

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.500
 iceberg phrase, "LED attracts demons."

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.300
 And that means light emitting diodes.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.260
 So we're talking about all sorts of LED lights,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.580
 which includes flat screen television sets,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.460
 which will include your cell phone,

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.820
 includes computer monitors,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.740
 which includes devices all over us.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.940
 These things invite demonic activity.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.420
 So before we get into this, we're gonna go to Britain.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.420
 We're gonna travel back to the year 1907.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.240
 And LED light has a interesting provenance

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.240
 of different things.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.400
 I see I learned, I learned, I learned from my mistakes.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.600
 When it was basically invented and then forgotten

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.880
 and invented and forgotten.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.720
 But it was originally first invented in the year 1907.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.840
 That's the first time that you're able

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.640
 to create a solid state light,

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.320
 which is different than gas light or filament lights.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.080
 Now back in 1907, this is like people are still walking

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.040
 around in old-time Victorian clothing.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.260
 The tripods haven't even shown up yet.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.540
 So we're talking about like old-timey stuff,

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.260
 but they were still working on a solid state light.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.260
 And now it's everywhere.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.960
 But you know, like it was invented and lost,

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.800
 invented and lost.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.180
 1907, guess who invented it?

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.020
 Marconi Labs.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.500
 Now I don't know if that's the same Marconi related

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.220
 to Marconi systems that we covered on Friday,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.140
 that a bunch of people were brutally suicided.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.160
 A little weird coincidence, right?

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.280
 I don't know how many Marconi Labs are out there,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.440
 but maybe it's different.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.080
 Maybe it's the same people.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.040
 It wouldn't make sense though,

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.400
 because Marconi was pushing limits of science

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.480
 even in the 80s.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.000
 But LED lights are all around us.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.020
 It's very, very efficient.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.340
 They don't use a lot of energy.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.440
 They don't put out a lot of heat.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.560
 The problem is that they're very, very damaging to our eyes.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.520
 But it allows us to have flat screens.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.440
 It allows us to have super bright cell phones

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.280
 and all that stuff.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.120
 It can make your poison.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.540
 It could cause permanent eye damage.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.380
 We don't know yet.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.640
 But let's take a look at this phrase here.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.140
 LED attracts demons.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.840
 LED attracts demonic activity.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.260
 It's kind of a spooky phrase,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.580
 because I know that I personally stay up late

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.400
 in bed with my cell phone, reading nonsense.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.860
 And the light is comforting, right?

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.860
 You're in a dark room.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.340
 You have that light.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.220
 You feel safe.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:12.220
 But what if the light is actually attracting the darkness?

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.100
 What if right now while you're lying in bed,

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.460
 listening to this podcast and your phones off in the corner,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.680
 giving you a little bit of blue light?

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.400
 What if that's not a safety net?

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.200
 What if it's actually a beacon for dark forces?

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.960
 I think it's interesting on one level

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.840
 because light is always,

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.800
 light is the opposite of darkness.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.560
 The book of Genesis starts off

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.080
 where there is nothing but darkness.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.700
 And then God says, "Let there be light."

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.820
 And that's like the creation.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.980
 There was nothingness,

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.300
 and then light is the first thing created.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.660
 That's if you believe in the story of Genesis.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.500
 But even if you don't,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.620
 I think you still get the symbolism.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.660
 Even if you look at the book of Genesis as a myth,

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.180
 you still understand the symbolism.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.660
 It's light coming into darkness.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.380
 It's something coming into nothing.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.600
 I think when we think of light,

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.600
 we also think of the heat, of the warmth.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.260
 And even a light bulb, an old light bulb,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.340
 an old filament light bulb was hot to the touch.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.160
 So you couldn't have light without other forms of energy,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.760
 i.e. heat.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.120
 But what if you're able to have light

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.720
 but you're able to not have the heat?

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.240
 Which is what an LED does.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.920
 Or it has such an insignificant amount of heat.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.280
 What if it's not the light

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.800
 that actually keeps the darkness away,

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.960
 but the heat that does,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.760
 it's not the light of day

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.040
 that keeps demonic forces at bay.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.800
 It's the heat of the life-giving sun.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.160
 It's the oil lamp.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.120
 It's the candle.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.320
 It's the flame.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.580
 Even if it's just the flame being put out by a filament,

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.860
 we were confused.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.100
 It wasn't the light itself,

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.740
 but the heat behind the light.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.180
 Now that we've been able to create a world of light

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.820
 with no heat,

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.060
 we've basically taken that natural defense away.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.660
 So we are in the darkness,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.900
 even though there's light.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.220
 We're still surrounded by darkness.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.980
 So when you're already in a dark room

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.940
 and you pull out your cell phone late at night,

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.220
 that blue screen pops up.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.760
 Something knows that you are not protected.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.760
 It knows where you're at.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.680
 And it knows that the heat,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.120
 the life-giving energy is gone.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.440
 Replaced with a false light.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.000
 Lucifer is described as,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.600
 Lucifer literally means light bringer.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.760
 But is it a false light?

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.680
 That was always the thing.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.740
 Lucifer brings false light.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.160
 Very, very esoteric.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.280
 I mean, obviously this is what we do

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.800
 with the conspiracy theory icebergs.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.580
 We take these phrases,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.200
 we examine whether or not there's any truth to the phrase.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.460
 We put on our conspiracy caps full board.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.180
 We discuss this.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.020
 So that's one saying of it could have a literal meaning

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.380
 like that,

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.980
 that having LED lights attract demons

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.100
 because it is a false light.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.440
 We think we're safe, but we're not.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.280
 We're the opposite of safe.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.420
 We're sending out a beacon.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.380
 I mean, that's always the thing.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.420
 When you cry for help,

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.860
 you could be attracting a savior

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.380
 or you could be attracting a predator

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.240
 knowing that you're unsafe.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.680
 You're scared.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.140
 So let's flip this around for a second.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.800
 Maybe the blue screen isn't attracting them

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.540
 to us in the external world.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:14.360
 Maybe the demons have already infested cyberspace.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.220
 They're already existing in this virtual world.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.720
 And when we pull out our phone late at night,

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.800
 turn it on and begin surfing the internet,

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.380
 as your kids call it.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.440
 They find their way from the virtual world

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.400
 into our world.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.980
 That's interesting theory.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.820
 Let's take a look at this.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.900
 You'll see this if you look this up.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.100
 So I have to address this.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.940
 There's a man.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.220
 He's the Reverend Jim P's.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.260
 I have to give him his due.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.900
 He's a man of the cloth.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.260
 A Reverend Jim P's borough.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.900
 He wrote a book called "Devil and the Machine."

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.340
 He's a minister down in Georgia

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.060
 and he was interviewed in this newspaper.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.100
 You'll see his name pop up

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.860
 on a ton of very reputable paranormal websites.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.660
 He wrote a book called "Ghost and the Machine"

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.860
 about how demons can possess computers.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.100
 He doesn't exist.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.260
 He was originally mentioned in the weekly world news.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.180
 The book doesn't exist.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.020
 He doesn't exist.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.420
 So if you start researching this

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.580
 and he pops up immediately,

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.500
 just move on to the next article

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.380
 'cause that doesn't exist.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.460
 What does exist?

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.300
 So I had to address that

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.540
 'cause he's the most popular.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.540
 What does exist though is there is a man named Rizwan Horshi.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.820
 And he wrote two books.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.820
 They're both called "See and Control Demons and Pains"

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.340
 from my eyes, "A Sense and Theories."

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.260
 And then he had book one and book two.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.380
 He had an interesting,

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.100
 I haven't ordered the books.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.420
 I was just reading the excerpts

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.900
 and they have the Google x-ray thing.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:27.980
 But I think I got the gist of it.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.980
 He has this theory that demons do possess computers.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.820
 He actually believes that there is a separate type of demon

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.940
 that is what's known as an electronic demon.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.580
 And he says they're basically completely digital,

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.620
 but not digital in the sense that they're ones and zeros.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.580
 Like they don't exist, they exist in an electronic form.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.780
 Their bodies are electric.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.300
 Their brains are electric.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:58.300
 They are a completely different strata of demons.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.580
 And these demons use the electrical impulses

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.420
 of our brains to hack us.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.940
 Now this obviously sounds completely bizarre, right?

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.940
 But let's again put on our conspiracy caps

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.340
 that also protect our brains from being hacked.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.220
 The idea of a spiritual possession is a demon

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.260
 taking over your body.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.920
 Your soul is trapped in your own body.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.540
 So you can kind of observe what's going on,

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.740
 but the demon has control over your body.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.220
 If you had to explain hacking to a caveman,

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.140
 that is pretty much what you would say, right?

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.660
 That your computer is being controlled by somebody else.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.920
 Now obviously it gets more complicated than that.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.580
 You could say, well, your computer is not controlled.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.540
 It's this particular subset program that's running,

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.900
 and it's overwriting this program

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.260
 that should be doing it and so on and so forth.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.100
 It has back there.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.640
 You can go into the real technical side of it,

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.560
 but you will just say,

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.700
 the hacker has control of your computer.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.860
 You talk to a computer specialist,

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.700
 they'll be like, well,

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.140
 they have control of this particular thing

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.100
 in this path, and stuff like that.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.780
 So the idea of a demon not necessarily having

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.980
 a soul possession, but simply hacking into your brain,

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.540
 your brain is nothing but electrical impulses

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.220
 and gray matter.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.820
 And so the idea that something could interfere

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.020
 with the electrical impulses would make sense.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.580
 And how do most people get hacked?

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.020
 Not all, but most people get hacked

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.860
 by messing up themselves,

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.140
 by inviting something into their computer.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.820
 Opening an email, clicking on a link,

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.480
 winning, quote unquote, winning a sweepstakes

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.980
 and following the prompts.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.420
 That's how a lot of computers get hacked.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.180
 It's rare that you just turn on your computer.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.940
 If it possible, I'm sure it's possible,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.620
 but it would have to be a specialized attack

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.020
 where you turn on your computer,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.960
 you do nothing and it gets hacked.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.900
 And so what do we always hear about people getting possessed?

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.440
 They invite the spirits in.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.660
 They're using the Ouija board.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.140
 They're going to these haunted locations.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.500
 They're putting themselves at risk of being possessed,

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.500
 i.e. hacked.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:00.500
 So it's less paranormal and more like a new program

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.900
 overriding the brain.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.900
 And because these demons exist in an electronic form

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.940
 or an electrical form,

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.940
 they can move through the internet.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.700
 So it's not like you're pulling your cell phone

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.500
 up late at night and there's a demon

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.600
 out in a graveyard somewhere and flying through the sky

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.000
 and it's sitting outside your window.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.040
 It's the other side.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.360
 It's in the system already.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.640
 And you're going through the internet

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.400
 and you're seeing a link and you're clicking on it

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.000
 and something in the system sees you.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.360
 That blue light to us is a display,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.440
 but it's really a one-way mirror.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.080
 On the other side of that screen,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.240
 of that big screen television set of your laptop,

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.640
 of your phone, there's something watching you,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.460
 influencing you, hacking you.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.080
 I find this theory very, very fascinating.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.340
 Very fascinating.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.020
 I believe that there's another phrase

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.420
 on the conspiracy theory iceberg

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.660
 that I've tried looking into.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.780
 I haven't really found much on it.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.020
 It's enchanted websites.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.980
 I believe, and I mentioned this before on the show,

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.620
 I believe that websites can be haunted.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.860
 I 100% believe that if a place,

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.140
 if a location can be haunted,

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.560
 what is a website but a digital place?

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.140
 We even use terms like digital storefront.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.780
 Why couldn't there be haunted websites?

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.000
 Haunted porn websites that make you seek out

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.480
 more extreme pornography until the next thing you know,

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.660
 the feds are kicking in your door.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.820
 You just went too far.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.920
 You couldn't get that feeling again.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.820
 It was addicted.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.700
 A haunted gambling website.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.600
 You end up blowing your family's fortunes.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.860
 There was a guy recently who met a cam girl in Russia.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:45.860
 He embezzled $250,000 from his father.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.660
 And when his family finally had an intervention for him,

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.540
 he killed his brother, his mother, and his father.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.540
 He's in prison now for the rest of his life for a cam girl.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.180
 I'm not saying the cam girl is a demon,

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.660
 but I'm saying that you can't tell me

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.780
 there's not demonic influences on the internet.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.340
 You find a gore website,

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.860
 and then you're trying to find even gore-er things,

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.540
 and then you wanna try it out for yourself.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.220
 Now millions of people could go and watch gore videos

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.180
 all day long, but you went to that site

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.060
 that had another force behind it.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:25.100
 You went to that site and something reached out

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.540
 and interfered with the electrical waves of your brain.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.920
 You didn't even notice it,

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.780
 but you knew you needed to go back to that site.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.620
 Maybe you were at work the next day and you felt,

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.580
 I need to go see if they've updated that.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.620
 I wanna see what that's new going on.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.900
 I wanna see this and you keep going to it

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.060
 over and over and over again.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.880
 You're building those neural pathways.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.180
 You're opening the door to this thing.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:53.420
 Riz Juan also says that based on his theory,

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.900
 we should never build robots

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.540
 with the capability of killing humans,

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.980
 because guess what?

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.800
 These electronic demons can possess the body of a robot.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.940
 So it may not be that we have to worry about the AI,

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.380
 over Lord, or maybe a demon will masquerade as an AI.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.660
 Humanity will think they've created this amazing,

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.860
 advanced intelligence system,

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.440
 but it's really an age-old demonic force.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.780
 The darkness itself that was pushed away

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.540
 when the light came into existence.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:28.060
 Sitting in a computer, leading humanity.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:32.580
 And what does LED stand for, light emitting diode?

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.260
 What is it's spell?

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.840
 LED causing a person to move in a direction.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.500
 Now I've made fun of other people

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.940
 who've made such connections in the past

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.100
 and feel free to make fun of me,

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.140
 but I do find that to be an interesting coincidence.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.480
 Is it possible that these devices we have in our pockets

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.460
 that we use for entertainment,

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.740
 that you're probably listening to this podcast on

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.820
 this very moment, is actually a beacon

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.260
 that brings us, every time we use it,

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.860
 one step closer to the darkness.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.380
 We think it connects us as a civilization.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.380
 And it does, but it may be connecting the civilization

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:14.500
 to something much darker, much older,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.380
 and much more evil than we could ever comprehend.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.820
