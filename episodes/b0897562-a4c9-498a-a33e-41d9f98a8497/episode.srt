1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,760
 A bizarre sighting in the middle of the woods.

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,400
 A conspiracy that involves America's favorite pastime.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,880
 And then we take another trip to the conspiracy theory iceberg

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,040
 to look at the bizarre theory that demonic activity

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,320
 is closely connected to the blue light

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,760
 coming out of your cell phone today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,340
 (upbeat music)

21
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,200
 Hey, everyone.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,000
 Back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,880
 I'm having a great day.

25
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,960
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,280
 We got three stories.

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,360
 First off, I wanna give a shout out

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,280
 to our newest Patreon, Swain on Discord.

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,800
 Swain on Discord.

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,000
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,120
 Really, really helps out a lot.

33
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,880
 I wanna say this about Swain real quick.

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,360
 There's gonna be a link in the show notes.

35
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,560
 Today I'm putting it above even my Patreon link.

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,760
 I want everyone to check this out.

37
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,720
 A long time ago, Swain took my Thomas Dick episode.

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,480
 And made a proof of concept little animation

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,320
 of that episode.

40
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,880
 It's maybe like 40 seconds, a minute long.

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,920
 Ah, dude, I think it's so funny.

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,380
 Actually watching this video, watching this cartoon,

43
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,760
 made me realize how my style of presenting it,

44
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,080
 it was really kind of a wake up call.

45
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,040
 It was kind of weird to see myself doing the show.

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,200
 'Cause this was pretty early on.

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,320
 I think this was in the first 100 episodes.

48
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,520
 It was really, really cool.

49
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,560
 I'd been meaning to share it with you.

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,320
 And then I forgot who sent it to me, honestly.

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
 And then I've lost the link.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,720
 But when he hit me up on the Patreon,

53
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,760
 I was able to track it down.

54
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
 So there it is.

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,560
 I recommend all you guys checking out his channel,

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,440
 checking out that video.

57
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,280
 It's super funny.

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,480
 It's a little animated version of that episode.

59
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
 Awesome.

60
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,160
 Thank you so much, Swain.

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,080
 Thank you so much for doing that.

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,280
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,840
 Just help get the word out about the show.

64
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,720
 That really, really helps out a lot, guys.

65
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,680
 Swain, we're gonna toss you the keys

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
 to the Jason Jalopy.

67
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,520
 First off, we're headed out to the middle of the forest.

68
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,680
 (humming)

69
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,680
 We're getting married, apparently.

70
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,640
 What's that song from?

71
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,960
 Some old timey thing.

72
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,800
 Doesn't matter.

73
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,960
 Music box music.

74
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,760
 We get to the middle of the forest.

75
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,600
 Now this is totally unsourced.

76
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,040
 This was a post from the export

77
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,480
 that was screen-shotted and then presented on Reddit.

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,440
 So that's the providence of this story.

79
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,680
 Or providence, providence.

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,520
 It doesn't matter.

81
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,340
 Providence.

82
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,440
 This is the providence of this story.

83
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,280
 We don't have a source.

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,240
 We don't have a location.

85
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,360
 We don't have anything like that.

86
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,320
 But I still find this story interesting.

87
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,160
 We're gonna take a look.

88
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,760
 Okay, so slow down the car, Swain.

89
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,480
 We're pulling up into the forest.

90
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
 Get out.

91
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
 We got on our hunting caps.

92
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,480
 We got our rifles.

93
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,320
 We're walking around.

94
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,960
 And we're gonna join a man hunting with his grandfather.

95
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,480
 What happened was there was a kid.

96
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,160
 He was 19th birthday.

97
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,360
 He was out hunting with his grandpa.

98
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,240
 A little father, not father-son,

99
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
 by the name of the activity.

100
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,520
 Grandfather-son, by the name of the act.

101
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,000
 No, they're not.

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
 Whatever, two dudes are hanging out in the woods, right?

103
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
 And they see a deer walking, walking around.

104
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,720
 And this is what they came here for.

105
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,160
 This isn't that Rihanna song.

106
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,640
 This is what they actually came here for.

107
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,400
 They're gonna kill this deer.

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,440
 And the deer stops and looks at a rock.

109
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,120
 And they get their guns ready.

110
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,760
 Do both of them shoot at the same time?

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,560
 I've never been hunting.

112
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,880
 Do you take turns hunting?

113
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,720
 Like, do I have it?

114
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,600
 And I'm like, okay, I'm gonna shoot it in the neck this time.

115
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
 And you're like, no, you numbschool.

116
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
 I'm gonna do it.

117
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,320
 You guys are wrestling over the gun.

118
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,280
 If there's two people with guns, do they take turns?

119
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
 Do they both shoot at the same time?

120
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,400
 Whichever bullet hits it first wins?

121
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
 Anyways, they're sitting there with their guns.

122
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,320
 This is, I'm a city boy.

123
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,880
 They're sitting there with their guns.

124
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,960
 And they see this deer.

125
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,400
 And the deer is like just standing there

126
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
 looking at this rock.

127
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,240
 And then slams its head into the rock.

128
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,800
 And the grandpa and the son, the son's not there.

129
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,720
 The grandpa, the son realizes a disturbance.

130
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,200
 The grandfather and the grandson look at each other.

131
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,560
 And they look back at the deer.

132
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,520
 And the rock is covered in blood.

133
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,000
 And the deer looks at the rock.

134
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,160
 (gasps)

135
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
 Smashes its head into the rock again.

136
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,000
 (imitates gunshot)

137
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
 Smashes its head into the rock again.

138
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,160
 One of the antlers break off.

139
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
 It's like 3D.

140
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,840
 It's coming right at the grandpa and the grandson.

141
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,480
 Well, they dodge.

142
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,320
 (imitates gunshot)

143
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,720
 Crash, crash, crash.

144
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,680
 Smashin' its head into the rock.

145
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,000
 Harder and harder and harder.

146
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,320
 The deer rears its head back up.

147
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,960
 And brains are shooting out of the deer.

148
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,440
 Swains thrown up in the corner.

149
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,240
 (imitates gunshot)

150
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,080
 Sorry, Swain.

151
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,320
 He's holding his hair back.

152
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,960
 Smash, smash.

153
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
 The deer keeps smashing its head into the rock.

154
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
 Brains are just leaking out.

155
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,960
 And then the deer stands up on two legs, looks around,

156
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,040
 starts walking towards the river on two legs.

157
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,880
 And then just doot, doot, doot.

158
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,840
 Raging river, doot, doot, doot.

159
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,120
 Walking deeper into the water, doot, doot.

160
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
 Grounds.

161
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,760
 The grandpa and the grandson,

162
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,120
 the birthday party's canceled, right?

163
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,560
 Grandfather actually moved out of the area.

164
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,240
 He went to go live with his grandmother in Florida.

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,200
 Not his grandmother.

166
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,800
 She went to be like Betsy Ross.

167
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,480
 He goes to live with his wife in Florida.

168
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,040
 I don't know whether they separated before.

169
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,520
 He's like, honey, please take me back.

170
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,200
 I've seen the air of my ways.

171
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,000
 Plus, I've seen pure Cthulhu level horror.

172
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,480
 Please, I want another chance.

173
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,040
 He moves in with his ex-wife, his grandma.

174
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,880
 Not his grandma.

175
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
 What is up with you?

176
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,000
 The point is that grandfather moves away

177
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,560
 and the grandson never went back to the forest.

178
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,400
 So that story was posted.

179
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,320
 It's creepy, right?

180
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,800
 It's pretty disgusting.

181
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
 Some people have had, first off,

182
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,200
 let's assume the story's true.

183
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,560
 Could totally be fake, could be creepy, boss.

184
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,720
 But let's assume for the sake of argument, that's true.

185
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,760
 Some people on Reddit goes,

186
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,360
 it could be chronic wasting disease.

187
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,560
 It could have had like Khrushchevill's Jokub disease.

188
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,840
 It's the Mad Cow disease,

189
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,480
 but it's the deer version, Mad Deer disease.

190
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,640
 It could have been that they had like a,

191
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,840
 like some sort of obviously mental deficiency

192
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,720
 and smashed their brains.

193
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,160
 It could be that they were having some sort of disease

194
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,440
 that was eating away at their brain.

195
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,120
 And the itch was so bad

196
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,960
 that they were smashing their head into the rock.

197
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,580
 Doesn't explain why they walked up on two feet.

198
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,140
 I guess deer sometimes can walk on two feet,

199
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,760
 not for a super long distance,

200
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,320
 but they have been known to do that.

201
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,920
 There's video footage of them walking like that.

202
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,880
 But yeah, a bizarre story.

203
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,560
 I mean, obviously I'm covering it

204
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,960
 not just because it's bizarre,

205
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,640
 but because it's almost like,

206
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
 it is like a Cthulhu level thing,

207
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,800
 like an animal killing itself very calmly.

208
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,880
 Like it was smashing its head,

209
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,040
 but it wasn't crying out in pain.

210
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,660
 And then once it had already knocked out a good chunk

211
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,560
 of its brains, it stood up and walked away into the river.

212
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
 Now that obviously sounds fake.

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
 Another person on Reddit was saying,

214
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,880
 they worked at a farm.

215
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,400
 Oh, by the way, if you love animals, rewind it.

216
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,240
 Don't listen to this first story.

217
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,280
 But sorry, I should have said that earlier.

218
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
 This one guy said he was working on a farm in Australia

219
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
 and there was massive wildfire.

220
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,240
 And he remembers seeing kangaroos

221
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,800
 that had been caught on fire running towards their fence line.

222
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,880
 They had a metal fence line around their property.

223
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,960
 And he says the kangaroos were burning.

224
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,240
 They were on fire.

225
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,200
 They're killing themselves.

226
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,160
 They began smashing their heads into the metal fence line

227
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,260
 to kill the pain was so unbearable.

228
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,840
 Which is interesting because I didn't know animals

229
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,120
 were that smart.

230
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,960
 Like, I didn't think an animal was smart enough

231
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,980
 to kill itself.

232
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,740
 Like, yeah, sure, lemmings, you know, that's not true.

233
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,600
 You know, lemmings don't really run off cliffs.

234
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,040
 That's a weird thing.

235
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,320
 Walt Disney's, that was from a documentary

236
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,240
 that Walt Disney made.

237
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,760
 And they're like, I don't know if they just needed

238
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,640
 a climatic ending or something like that.

239
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,120
 I guess lemmings kind of do that.

240
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,840
 But they, the producers of that documentary pushed them off.

241
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,320
 They were like, it wasn't like off screen.

242
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,880
 There was a intern like throwing them off the cliff.

243
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,080
 But they edited the footage

244
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
 and made basically like herded them off the cliff.

245
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,800
 I think it is a real thing, but not to the scale

246
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,360
 that it really is.

247
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,560
 And then that movie was a meme, made it a thing.

248
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,960
 But anyways, like, how does a kangaroo,

249
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,800
 so you're on fire, this is super grim,

250
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,660
 but let's say I'm a kangaroo and I'm smoldering.

251
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,040
 Not like I'm super sexy, I'm literally smoky.

252
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,960
 And I see a pillow, a metal stake, and a tree.

253
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,800
 And I have to smash my head into one of those three things.

254
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,600
 I didn't think animals were smart enough to go,

255
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,440
 pillow out, just take a nap.

256
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,080
 The metal stake will go through my brain

257
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,840
 and that tree will take a long time for me to smash my head.

258
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,760
 'Cause they don't know what metal is.

259
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,640
 I didn't know that animals knew the difference

260
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,360
 between like minerals and stuff.

261
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,120
 Like, I didn't know, like if you put a kangaroo

262
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,200
 and you had like, let's say you had a cliff.

263
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,520
 You were like, Jason, please, please,

264
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,600
 just stop talking about it.

265
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,920
 You had a cliff and there was like a bunch of water

266
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,600
 at the bottom of one cliff and then a bunch of water

267
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,400
 and some jagged rocks on another cliff.

268
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,440
 Swain's like, give me my money back.

269
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,320
 Why am I here for this episode?

270
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,400
 He's erasing the cartoon, he deletes it from me too.

271
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,520
 You have a cliff, you have a water.

272
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,560
 You have a cliff, you have water with jagged rocks

273
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,080
 and then you have a cliff with like a pavement underneath it.

274
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
 Wouldn't the kangaroo go to the first cliff and go,

275
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,000
 that's just water, I'll probably swim.

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,240
 But it will put the fire out.

277
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,760
 And then he jumps to the other one

278
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,880
 but he still wants to kill himself

279
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,440
 because he owes the mob a bunch of money

280
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,240
 and he can't pay him back and he's on fire.

281
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,760
 So he goes to the other cliff and he sees the jagged rocks

282
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,580
 and he goes, hmm, that will kill me but maybe not.

283
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,200
 Maybe I'll fall in between the jagged rocks

284
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,400
 and dive very slowly and then he goes to the other cliff

285
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,280
 and sees the pavement and goes, that is pavement.

286
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,600
 In my kangaroo brain, it knows

287
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
 that that will kill me instantly

288
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,600
 because the reason I know that if I jump off a cliff

289
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,800
 and if I land on pavement, I will die

290
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,240
 is because people have told me that.

291
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,320
 I don't genetically know, I never genetically knew that.

292
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,640
 You didn't know that.

293
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,920
 We don't know that if you fall off a distance, you die

294
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,840
 unless somebody tells you or you see it happen.

295
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,240
 If I, kangaroos aren't walking around with watermelons

296
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,560
 and they don't butterfingers in, they're like, oops.

297
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,600
 And they watch the watermelon splat on the ground

298
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,640
 and the kangaroo goes, that will happen to me.

299
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,540
 If I fall, that's not how animals think, right?

300
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,800
 So how did the animals know?

301
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,840
 How did, why wasn't the deer smashing his head on a tree?

302
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,720
 How did he know a rock was going to do the job?

303
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
 Like, how did they figure that out?

304
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,080
 So anyways, the kangaroos, they sell on metal spikes

305
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,440
 which to me makes me think that they know minerals and stuff

306
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,000
 'cause then they'd be like, that's like soft soap rock.

307
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,320
 What's that rock that's like pumice, the kangaroo's on fire.

308
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,160
 You see he's a bunch of pumice.

309
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,000
 You guys get it.

310
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,240
 I'm not gonna keep naming.

311
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,800
 I'm not gonna keep coming with hypothetical situations.

312
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,120
 How does the kangaroo know that the metal would do it?

313
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,000
 Like, did they jump past another fence

314
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,400
 then it was just like wood and the kangaroos are like,

315
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,960
 sure I'm burning to death, but that won't do the job.

316
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,840
 I know another 50 feet there's a metal fence line.

317
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,080
 So there you go.

318
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,400
 I did not intend for that to be another evolutionary rant

319
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,880
 but it turned out to be one.

320
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,880
 Swain, let's go ahead and leave behind Australia.

321
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,120
 That's where we ended up in that story.

322
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,680
 Let's hop in the carpenter copter.

323
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,340
 We're headed back to America.

324
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,640
 This is a really short one.

325
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,560
 I've had this on deck for a while.

326
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,400
 That was very interesting

327
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,120
 'cause I talk a lot about real conspiracies,

328
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
 conspiracies that are provable that matter.

329
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,040
 And this conspiracy you can argue

330
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,000
 whether or not it matters.

331
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,240
 I think it matters to a large group of people though.

332
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,460
 And I gotta give a shout out to Chris Thompson

333
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,240
 for Dead Spin, the website Dead Spin.

334
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,960
 He wrote this article a while back in July of 2019

335
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,040
 and all of my research comes from this article.

336
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,400
 To give you a little background of the story,

337
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,960
 you have Major League Baseball, MLB.

338
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,440
 Recently, back in 2019, had purchased Rawlings

339
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,160
 and they're the ones who make the baseballs

340
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,580
 that are used in professional level baseball games.

341
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,360
 So originally they are two separate companies

342
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,760
 but now Major League Baseball bought out Rawlings.

343
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,120
 And then we have this quote

344
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,480
 from Houston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.

345
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,920
 He was speaking to ESPN and he had this quote

346
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,040
 and he's gonna be referencing a man named Rob Manfred.

347
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
 He's the Major League Baseball Commissioner.

348
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
 So that's a little bit of background to this.

349
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,200
 I think this is an interesting conspiracy.

350
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,920
 And so what Verlander's beef is,

351
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,760
 is he believes that Major League Baseball

352
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,320
 is messing with the baseballs themselves

353
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,600
 because now they own the company

354
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,360
 that manufactures the baseball.

355
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
 He believes that Major League Baseball

356
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,360
 is actually gooseing up the balls.

357
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,800
 They're making it so they can just hit homer

358
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
 after homer after homer.

359
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,880
 Look at this quote, I found this interesting.

360
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,000
 It's an effing joke, Verlander says.

361
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,360
 It's an effing joke.

362
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,800
 Major League Baseball's turning this game into a joke.

363
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,000
 They own Rawlings and you've got Manfred up here saying

364
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,360
 it might be the way they center the pill.

365
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,760
 Some baseball term, I don't know what that means,

366
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,800
 but you might.

367
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,880
 Back to the quote, they own the effing company.

368
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,200
 If any other 40 billion company

369
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,160
 bought out a 400 million company

370
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,800
 and the product changed dramatically,

371
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 it's not a guess as to what happened.

372
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,700
 We all know what happened.

373
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,520
 Manfred the first time he came in, what do you say?

374
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,600
 He said they want more offense.

375
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,400
 All of a sudden he comes in, the balls are juiced.

376
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,760
 It's not a coincidence, we are not idiots.

377
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,500
 Then they're asking, do you think that this is intentional?

378
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,120
 Do you think that these balls are making it easier

379
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,000
 to hit home runs?

380
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,220
 He goes into this quote, yes, 100%.

381
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,400
 They've been using juiced balls in the home run derby forever.

382
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,560
 They know how to do it, it's not coincidence.

383
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,860
 I find it really hard to believe

384
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,200
 that Major League Baseball owns Rawlings

385
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,440
 and just coincidentally, the balls become juiced.

386
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,280
 Manfred had a response to this and he simply said,

387
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,640
 "The balls have not been changed in quote,

388
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,080
 "any meaningful way."

389
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,120
 So the balls have been changed.

390
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,420
 I think that's an interesting conspiracy theory.

391
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,380
 It's one that affects millions of people, baseball fans.

392
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,260
 It definitely also affects money.

393
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,300
 So it's an interesting conspiracy theory.

394
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,500
 It's one that is probably true, right?

395
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,580
 It's one that involves a corporation

396
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,140
 manipulating the outcome behind the scenes.

397
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,180
 It really has all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory.

398
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,980
 You have a truth sayer who's putting his career on the line.

399
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,780
 I'm sure that his coaches got several phone calls

400
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,620
 after this interview.

401
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,040
 I'm sure he got pulled in his coaches office

402
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,880
 and all this stuff.

403
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,200
 It's all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory.

404
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,040
 I find this type of stuff very fascinating.

405
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,920
 It's a reminder that there are conspiracy theories

406
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,280
 happening all around us.

407
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,200
 They're like miracles.

408
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,120
 They happen all around and we don't know how they work,

409
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,560
 but they happen.

410
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,160
 Very, very fascinating story.

411
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,200
 I don't really cover many sports on this show,

412
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,520
 but I thought that was an interesting one.

413
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,320
 So Swain, let's hop in that carbonar copter

414
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,880
 one last time this episode.

415
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,640
 We're headed out to Britain to start this adventure.

416
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,600
 (imitates flying)

417
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,680
 We're flying out of Houston, Texas.

418
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,140
 Supposedly, we'll cover this in a later episode,

419
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,020
 but supposedly there's supposed to be a massive hurricane

420
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,380
 hitting Houston, Texas on August 10th, I think it was.

421
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,220
 We'll be covering that.

422
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,300
 It's possible that a time traveler is using TikTok

423
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,860
 to warn people of the future.

424
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,660
 However, he's also selling t-shirts.

425
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,740
 So I'm a little skeptical of his time travel claims,

426
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,020
 but Beatrice Leyva sent me that story.

427
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,420
 We'll be talking about that later in the week.

428
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,780
 That's a little teaser for that.

429
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,060
 (imitates flying)

430
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,820
 We're leaving behind.

431
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,940
 Beatrice is like, "No, no, the hurricane's coming.

432
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,980
 Save me, save me.

433
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,880
 What, we can't hear you over the carbonar copter.

434
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
 We can totally hear her.

435
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,180
 We're just leaving her behind.

436
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,760
 Wait, no, I'm a loyal listener."

437
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,600
 We're flying away.

438
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,600
 So she's a loyal listener, but we're still leaving her

439
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
 to the hurricane that won't happen.

440
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,600
 But we're flying out.

441
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,480
 We're flying out to Britain.

442
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,800
 So this is from the Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

443
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,160
 It's just a simple phrase on the Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

444
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,360
 And again, thank you, some weirdo from Twitter, aka Jack,

445
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,400
 for making this Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

446
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,520
 Spreadsheet has really made a lot of this stuff helpful

447
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,700
 to look at.

448
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,580
 We're flying to Britain because there's a Conspiracy Theory

449
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,500
 iceberg phrase, "LED attracts demons."

450
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,300
 And that means light emitting diodes.

451
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,260
 So we're talking about all sorts of LED lights,

452
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,580
 which includes flat screen television sets,

453
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,460
 which will include your cell phone,

454
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,820
 includes computer monitors,

455
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,740
 which includes devices all over us.

456
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,940
 These things invite demonic activity.

457
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,420
 So before we get into this, we're gonna go to Britain.

458
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,420
 We're gonna travel back to the year 1907.

459
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,240
 And LED light has a interesting provenance

460
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
 of different things.

461
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,400
 I see I learned, I learned, I learned from my mistakes.

462
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,600
 When it was basically invented and then forgotten

463
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,880
 and invented and forgotten.

464
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,720
 But it was originally first invented in the year 1907.

465
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,840
 That's the first time that you're able

466
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,640
 to create a solid state light,

467
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,320
 which is different than gas light or filament lights.

468
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,080
 Now back in 1907, this is like people are still walking

469
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,040
 around in old-time Victorian clothing.

470
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,260
 The tripods haven't even shown up yet.

471
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,540
 So we're talking about like old-timey stuff,

472
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,260
 but they were still working on a solid state light.

473
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,260
 And now it's everywhere.

474
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,960
 But you know, like it was invented and lost,

475
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,800
 invented and lost.

476
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,180
 1907, guess who invented it?

477
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,020
 Marconi Labs.

478
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,500
 Now I don't know if that's the same Marconi related

479
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,220
 to Marconi systems that we covered on Friday,

480
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,140
 that a bunch of people were brutally suicided.

481
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,160
 A little weird coincidence, right?

482
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,280
 I don't know how many Marconi Labs are out there,

483
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,440
 but maybe it's different.

484
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,080
 Maybe it's the same people.

485
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,040
 It wouldn't make sense though,

486
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,400
 because Marconi was pushing limits of science

487
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,480
 even in the 80s.

488
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,000
 But LED lights are all around us.

489
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,020
 It's very, very efficient.

490
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,340
 They don't use a lot of energy.

491
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,440
 They don't put out a lot of heat.

492
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,560
 The problem is that they're very, very damaging to our eyes.

493
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,520
 But it allows us to have flat screens.

494
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,440
 It allows us to have super bright cell phones

495
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,280
 and all that stuff.

496
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,120
 It can make your poison.

497
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,540
 It could cause permanent eye damage.

498
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,380
 We don't know yet.

499
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,640
 But let's take a look at this phrase here.

500
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,140
 LED attracts demons.

501
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,840
 LED attracts demonic activity.

502
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,260
 It's kind of a spooky phrase,

503
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,580
 because I know that I personally stay up late

504
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,400
 in bed with my cell phone, reading nonsense.

505
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,860
 And the light is comforting, right?

506
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,860
 You're in a dark room.

507
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,340
 You have that light.

508
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,220
 You feel safe.

509
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,220
 But what if the light is actually attracting the darkness?

510
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,100
 What if right now while you're lying in bed,

511
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,460
 listening to this podcast and your phones off in the corner,

512
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,680
 giving you a little bit of blue light?

513
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,400
 What if that's not a safety net?

514
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,200
 What if it's actually a beacon for dark forces?

515
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,960
 I think it's interesting on one level

516
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,840
 because light is always,

517
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,800
 light is the opposite of darkness.

518
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,560
 The book of Genesis starts off

519
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,080
 where there is nothing but darkness.

520
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,700
 And then God says, "Let there be light."

521
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,820
 And that's like the creation.

522
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,980
 There was nothingness,

523
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,300
 and then light is the first thing created.

524
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,660
 That's if you believe in the story of Genesis.

525
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,500
 But even if you don't,

526
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,620
 I think you still get the symbolism.

527
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,660
 Even if you look at the book of Genesis as a myth,

528
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,180
 you still understand the symbolism.

529
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,660
 It's light coming into darkness.

530
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,380
 It's something coming into nothing.

531
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,600
 I think when we think of light,

532
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,600
 we also think of the heat, of the warmth.

533
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,260
 And even a light bulb, an old light bulb,

534
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,340
 an old filament light bulb was hot to the touch.

535
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,160
 So you couldn't have light without other forms of energy,

536
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,760
 i.e. heat.

537
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,120
 But what if you're able to have light

538
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,720
 but you're able to not have the heat?

539
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,240
 Which is what an LED does.

540
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,920
 Or it has such an insignificant amount of heat.

541
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,280
 What if it's not the light

542
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,800
 that actually keeps the darkness away,

543
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,960
 but the heat that does,

544
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,760
 it's not the light of day

545
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,040
 that keeps demonic forces at bay.

546
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,800
 It's the heat of the life-giving sun.

547
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,160
 It's the oil lamp.

548
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,120
 It's the candle.

549
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,320
 It's the flame.

550
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,580
 Even if it's just the flame being put out by a filament,

551
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,860
 we were confused.

552
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,100
 It wasn't the light itself,

553
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,740
 but the heat behind the light.

554
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,180
 Now that we've been able to create a world of light

555
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,820
 with no heat,

556
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,060
 we've basically taken that natural defense away.

557
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,660
 So we are in the darkness,

558
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,900
 even though there's light.

559
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,220
 We're still surrounded by darkness.

560
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,980
 So when you're already in a dark room

561
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,940
 and you pull out your cell phone late at night,

562
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,220
 that blue screen pops up.

563
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,760
 Something knows that you are not protected.

564
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,760
 It knows where you're at.

565
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,680
 And it knows that the heat,

566
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,120
 the life-giving energy is gone.

567
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,440
 Replaced with a false light.

568
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,000
 Lucifer is described as,

569
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
 Lucifer literally means light bringer.

570
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,760
 But is it a false light?

571
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,680
 That was always the thing.

572
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,740
 Lucifer brings false light.

573
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,160
 Very, very esoteric.

574
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,280
 I mean, obviously this is what we do

575
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,800
 with the conspiracy theory icebergs.

576
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,580
 We take these phrases,

577
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,200
 we examine whether or not there's any truth to the phrase.

578
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,460
 We put on our conspiracy caps full board.

579
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,180
 We discuss this.

580
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,020
 So that's one saying of it could have a literal meaning

581
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,380
 like that,

582
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,980
 that having LED lights attract demons

583
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,100
 because it is a false light.

584
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,440
 We think we're safe, but we're not.

585
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,280
 We're the opposite of safe.

586
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,420
 We're sending out a beacon.

587
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,380
 I mean, that's always the thing.

588
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,420
 When you cry for help,

589
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,860
 you could be attracting a savior

590
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,380
 or you could be attracting a predator

591
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,240
 knowing that you're unsafe.

592
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,680
 You're scared.

593
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,140
 So let's flip this around for a second.

594
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,800
 Maybe the blue screen isn't attracting them

595
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,540
 to us in the external world.

596
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,360
 Maybe the demons have already infested cyberspace.

597
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,220
 They're already existing in this virtual world.

598
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,720
 And when we pull out our phone late at night,

599
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,800
 turn it on and begin surfing the internet,

600
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,380
 as your kids call it.

601
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,440
 They find their way from the virtual world

602
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,400
 into our world.

603
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,980
 That's interesting theory.

604
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,820
 Let's take a look at this.

605
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,900
 You'll see this if you look this up.

606
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,100
 So I have to address this.

607
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,940
 There's a man.

608
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,220
 He's the Reverend Jim P's.

609
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,260
 I have to give him his due.

610
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,900
 He's a man of the cloth.

611
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,260
 A Reverend Jim P's borough.

612
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,900
 He wrote a book called "Devil and the Machine."

613
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,340
 He's a minister down in Georgia

614
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,060
 and he was interviewed in this newspaper.

615
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,100
 You'll see his name pop up

616
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,860
 on a ton of very reputable paranormal websites.

617
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,660
 He wrote a book called "Ghost and the Machine"

618
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,860
 about how demons can possess computers.

619
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,100
 He doesn't exist.

620
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,260
 He was originally mentioned in the weekly world news.

621
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,180
 The book doesn't exist.

622
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,020
 He doesn't exist.

623
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,420
 So if you start researching this

624
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,580
 and he pops up immediately,

625
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,500
 just move on to the next article

626
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,380
 'cause that doesn't exist.

627
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,460
 What does exist?

628
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,300
 So I had to address that

629
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,540
 'cause he's the most popular.

630
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,540
 What does exist though is there is a man named Rizwan Horshi.

631
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,820
 And he wrote two books.

632
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,820
 They're both called "See and Control Demons and Pains"

633
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,340
 from my eyes, "A Sense and Theories."

634
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,260
 And then he had book one and book two.

635
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,380
 He had an interesting,

636
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,100
 I haven't ordered the books.

637
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,420
 I was just reading the excerpts

638
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,900
 and they have the Google x-ray thing.

639
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,980
 But I think I got the gist of it.

640
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,980
 He has this theory that demons do possess computers.

641
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,820
 He actually believes that there is a separate type of demon

642
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,940
 that is what's known as an electronic demon.

643
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,580
 And he says they're basically completely digital,

644
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,620
 but not digital in the sense that they're ones and zeros.

645
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,580
 Like they don't exist, they exist in an electronic form.

646
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,780
 Their bodies are electric.

647
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,300
 Their brains are electric.

648
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,300
 They are a completely different strata of demons.

649
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,580
 And these demons use the electrical impulses

650
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,420
 of our brains to hack us.

651
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,940
 Now this obviously sounds completely bizarre, right?

652
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,940
 But let's again put on our conspiracy caps

653
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,340
 that also protect our brains from being hacked.

654
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,220
 The idea of a spiritual possession is a demon

655
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,260
 taking over your body.

656
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,920
 Your soul is trapped in your own body.

657
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,540
 So you can kind of observe what's going on,

658
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,740
 but the demon has control over your body.

659
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,220
 If you had to explain hacking to a caveman,

660
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,140
 that is pretty much what you would say, right?

661
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,660
 That your computer is being controlled by somebody else.

662
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,920
 Now obviously it gets more complicated than that.

663
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,580
 You could say, well, your computer is not controlled.

664
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,540
 It's this particular subset program that's running,

665
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,900
 and it's overwriting this program

666
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,260
 that should be doing it and so on and so forth.

667
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,100
 It has back there.

668
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,640
 You can go into the real technical side of it,

669
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,560
 but you will just say,

670
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,700
 the hacker has control of your computer.

671
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,860
 You talk to a computer specialist,

672
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,700
 they'll be like, well,

673
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,140
 they have control of this particular thing

674
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,100
 in this path, and stuff like that.

675
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,780
 So the idea of a demon not necessarily having

676
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,980
 a soul possession, but simply hacking into your brain,

677
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,540
 your brain is nothing but electrical impulses

678
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,220
 and gray matter.

679
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,820
 And so the idea that something could interfere

680
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,020
 with the electrical impulses would make sense.

681
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,580
 And how do most people get hacked?

682
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,020
 Not all, but most people get hacked

683
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,860
 by messing up themselves,

684
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,140
 by inviting something into their computer.

685
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,820
 Opening an email, clicking on a link,

686
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,480
 winning, quote unquote, winning a sweepstakes

687
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,980
 and following the prompts.

688
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,420
 That's how a lot of computers get hacked.

689
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,180
 It's rare that you just turn on your computer.

690
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,940
 If it possible, I'm sure it's possible,

691
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,620
 but it would have to be a specialized attack

692
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,020
 where you turn on your computer,

693
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,960
 you do nothing and it gets hacked.

694
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,900
 And so what do we always hear about people getting possessed?

695
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,440
 They invite the spirits in.

696
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,660
 They're using the Ouija board.

697
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,140
 They're going to these haunted locations.

698
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,500
 They're putting themselves at risk of being possessed,

699
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 i.e. hacked.

700
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 So it's less paranormal and more like a new program

701
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,900
 overriding the brain.

702
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,900
 And because these demons exist in an electronic form

703
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,940
 or an electrical form,

704
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,940
 they can move through the internet.

705
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,700
 So it's not like you're pulling your cell phone

706
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,500
 up late at night and there's a demon

707
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,600
 out in a graveyard somewhere and flying through the sky

708
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,000
 and it's sitting outside your window.

709
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,040
 It's the other side.

710
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,360
 It's in the system already.

711
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,640
 And you're going through the internet

712
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,400
 and you're seeing a link and you're clicking on it

713
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,000
 and something in the system sees you.

714
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,360
 That blue light to us is a display,

715
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,440
 but it's really a one-way mirror.

716
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,080
 On the other side of that screen,

717
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,240
 of that big screen television set of your laptop,

718
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,640
 of your phone, there's something watching you,

719
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,460
 influencing you, hacking you.

720
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,080
 I find this theory very, very fascinating.

721
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,340
 Very fascinating.

722
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,020
 I believe that there's another phrase

723
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,420
 on the conspiracy theory iceberg

724
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,660
 that I've tried looking into.

725
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,780
 I haven't really found much on it.

726
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,020
 It's enchanted websites.

727
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,980
 I believe, and I mentioned this before on the show,

728
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,620
 I believe that websites can be haunted.

729
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,860
 I 100% believe that if a place,

730
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,140
 if a location can be haunted,

731
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,560
 what is a website but a digital place?

732
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,140
 We even use terms like digital storefront.

733
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,780
 Why couldn't there be haunted websites?

734
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,000
 Haunted porn websites that make you seek out

735
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,480
 more extreme pornography until the next thing you know,

736
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,660
 the feds are kicking in your door.

737
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,820
 You just went too far.

738
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,920
 You couldn't get that feeling again.

739
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,820
 It was addicted.

740
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,700
 A haunted gambling website.

741
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,600
 You end up blowing your family's fortunes.

742
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,860
 There was a guy recently who met a cam girl in Russia.

743
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,860
 He embezzled $250,000 from his father.

744
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,660
 And when his family finally had an intervention for him,

745
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,540
 he killed his brother, his mother, and his father.

746
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,540
 He's in prison now for the rest of his life for a cam girl.

747
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,180
 I'm not saying the cam girl is a demon,

748
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,660
 but I'm saying that you can't tell me

749
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,780
 there's not demonic influences on the internet.

750
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,340
 You find a gore website,

751
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,860
 and then you're trying to find even gore-er things,

752
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,540
 and then you wanna try it out for yourself.

753
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,220
 Now millions of people could go and watch gore videos

754
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,180
 all day long, but you went to that site

755
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,060
 that had another force behind it.

756
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:25,100
 You went to that site and something reached out

757
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,540
 and interfered with the electrical waves of your brain.

758
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,920
 You didn't even notice it,

759
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,780
 but you knew you needed to go back to that site.

760
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,620
 Maybe you were at work the next day and you felt,

761
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,580
 I need to go see if they've updated that.

762
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,620
 I wanna see what that's new going on.

763
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,900
 I wanna see this and you keep going to it

764
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,060
 over and over and over again.

765
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,880
 You're building those neural pathways.

766
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,180
 You're opening the door to this thing.

767
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,420
 Riz Juan also says that based on his theory,

768
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,900
 we should never build robots

769
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,540
 with the capability of killing humans,

770
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,980
 because guess what?

771
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,800
 These electronic demons can possess the body of a robot.

772
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,940
 So it may not be that we have to worry about the AI,

773
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,380
 over Lord, or maybe a demon will masquerade as an AI.

774
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,660
 Humanity will think they've created this amazing,

775
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,860
 advanced intelligence system,

776
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,440
 but it's really an age-old demonic force.

777
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,780
 The darkness itself that was pushed away

778
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,540
 when the light came into existence.

779
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:28,060
 Sitting in a computer, leading humanity.

780
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,580
 And what does LED stand for, light emitting diode?

781
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,260
 What is it's spell?

782
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,840
 LED causing a person to move in a direction.

783
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,500
 Now I've made fun of other people

784
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,940
 who've made such connections in the past

785
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,100
 and feel free to make fun of me,

786
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,140
 but I do find that to be an interesting coincidence.

787
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,480
 Is it possible that these devices we have in our pockets

788
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,460
 that we use for entertainment,

789
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,740
 that you're probably listening to this podcast on

790
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,820
 this very moment, is actually a beacon

791
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,260
 that brings us, every time we use it,

792
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,860
 one step closer to the darkness.

793
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,380
 We think it connects us as a civilization.

794
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,380
 And it does, but it may be connecting the civilization

795
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,500
 to something much darker, much older,

796
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,380
 and much more evil than we could ever comprehend.

797
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,820
 (upbeat music)

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,340
