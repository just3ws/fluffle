WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.480
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.480
 When a man has a coughing fit,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.480
 no one expects a tumor to pop out of his mouth.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.480
 We travel back to the Civil War to take a look at a time

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 when soldiers may have been blessed by an angel.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.480
 And then we take a look at a bizarre story involving a shepherd,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.480
 his family, and a murder hiding in the woods.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.480
 Is the murderer Bigfoot?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 Or something far more sinister today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.480
 [music]

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.480
 Hey, everybody.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.480
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.480
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.480
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.480
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.480
 so we're going to get started right now.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.480
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.480
 Amalia.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 Amalia, thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 Really, really is awesome.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 You are going to be our pilot, our captain this episode,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480
 and I'm sending you out a sticker.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.480
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine, too.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.480
 Just hope you get the word out about the show.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.480
 That really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.480
 We also have a merch store, and join us on the Minecraft server.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.480
 That's always fun playing.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.480
 I'm going to be taking a pretty long vacation soon.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 I'm actually recording my episodes in advance right now.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.480
 So I'm actually going to have three weeks

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.480
 where the episodes are going to still be playing.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 I'm going to have new episodes coming out,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.480
 but I'm recording them all in advance.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.480
 So when I'm on actual vacation for three weeks,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.480
 it'll be the longest vacation I've taken since I started this show.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 It'll be fun, and you guys will have episodes.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 I think we'll have one week of repeats,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 but everything else should be fine.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.480
 So, Amalia, let's go ahead and hop inside that Dead Rabbit rowboat.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.480
 We are going to start off by rowing all the way from Oregon to China.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 Probably could have picked a better vehicle,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480
 but we'll get there eventually.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.480
 We're headed back to the year 2019.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480
 It's March 2019.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.480
 We're in Hunshan County.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.480
 That's in the Hu Bai province in China.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.480
 We get out, our arms are super muscular.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.480
 From rowing all the way from America to China.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.480
 We're walking around, we're super buff.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.480
 But we're not here to push people over.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.480
 We're here, we put on our lab coats, to be doctors.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480
 We're just super muscular doctors.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.480
 And when we get to China, we're going to walk around China a bit.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 We're going to this dude's house.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480
 Now, we don't have his name.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.480
 This is a medical case.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.480
 They don't really reveal people's personal information.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.480
 When it comes to these types of cases, we'll just call him Michael.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.480
 Michael is a 63-year-old man.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.480
 We're going to walk in to his house.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.480
 We're super rude.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.480
 We don't even knock.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 He's like, "Ugh!"

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.480
 He's shocked, but then we put on our invisibility cloaks,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.480
 and he just thinks he was having an illusion.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.480
 He has actually worse problems than a bunch of strangers appearing in his house.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.480
 Michael is sitting in his house and starts trying to clear his throat.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.480
 Something's wrong.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.480
 He can't figure it out, but he's not going to go to the doctor, right?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.480
 He's just going to work.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 He's just going to work it through, right?

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.480
 And then one day, he's dealing with this throat issue,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.480
 but one day he gets super drunk,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480
 way more than a normal human drunk, right?

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.480
 But he's just dealing with it.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.480
 He has this lump in his throat.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.480
 He just figures that maybe he is always nervous.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.480
 So he also, on top of that, seems to have a serious drinking problem,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.480
 because one day he gets, according to my notes, super drunk.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.480
 I don't know what the difference is between being drunk, very drunk, and super drunk,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.480
 but for some reason I wrote down super drunk,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.480
 so let's imagine it is Kryptonian levels of alcoholism.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.480
 He ends up going to throw up, because he's not a Kryptonian.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.480
 He drank as much as Superman, but he's not Superman.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.480
 He goes to throw up, and he feels a horrible pain in his throat.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.480
 Oh! Oh!

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.480
 And then he feels it.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.480
 He feels it at the top of his throat.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.480
 He feels it at the top of his throat.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.480
 He feels a chunk of meat.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.480
 Sorry, Amalia.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.480
 Seriously? She's in the corner.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.480
 Why did I have to be on this episode?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.480
 We're holding her hair back.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.480
 Sorry, Amalia.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.480
 He feels a chunk of meat in his throat.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.480
 He tries to cough it up, and it's stuck.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.480
 It's stuck in his throat.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.480
 Just telling the stories.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.480
 I feel like something's stuck in my throat.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.480
 He's trying to cough it up.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.480
 He can't.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.480
 He reaches into his mouth.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.480
 He feels it.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.480
 He says it's about five inches long.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.480
 He starts to tug on it.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.480
 There's something in his mouth that shouldn't be there.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.480
 Something gross and slimy.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480
 And he's like, "That's weird.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.480
 I didn't eat a Taco Bell yesterday.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480
 I remember getting drunk,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.480
 but I don't remember eating a chalupa."

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.480
 And he's pulling it.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.480
 He's pulling it, and it pops out.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.480
 It pops out of his mouth.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.480
 He said it looked like a longed, forked tongue.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.480
 And it's actually now hanging out of his mouth.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.480
 So what do you do?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.480
 You're coming down from a sane drinking binge.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.480
 You're thankful that you need Taco Bell,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.480
 so you're like, "Oh, yeah, that's fine."

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.480
 But, and you have like a piece of meat

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480
 sticking out of your mouth.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.480
 He can't yank it.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480
 He's trying to pull it.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.480
 It won't pop out.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.480
 So he does the next alternative, right?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480
 He does the next best thing.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.480
 He pushes it back into his throat.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.480
 He begins drinking a bunch of water.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.480
 He's like poking at it.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.480
 I imagine he gets like a plunger.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.480
 Eventually it goes back into his throat.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.480
 I'm sorry for my remaining listeners.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.480
 I'm sorry.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.480
 And then, then he goes to the doctor, right?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.480
 Because it's one thing to have like a lump in your throat

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.480
 in a couple of days, whatever.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.480
 But when it comes out and you can actually look at it

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.480
 and you can feel it, how slim it is,

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.480
 he goes to the doctor.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.480
 Doctor looks in there.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.480
 Doctor, I'm assuming doesn't believe him at first.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.480
 He's like, "And then, Doc, after my incredible drinking binge,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.480
 something came out of my body."

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.480
 The doctor's like, "Let's run a couple tests on your liver

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 before you take a look at this quote-unquote forked tongue

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.480
 in your mouth after they basically flesh his liver."

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.480
 It was a tumor.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.480
 He had a benign tumor that had been growing in his throat

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.480
 and it was getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.480
 And then one day he coughed it up and panicked

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.480
 and he pushed it back in and they did take it out.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.480
 He doesn't have it anymore.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.480
 They took out the tumor.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.480
 As far as we can tell, Michael is totally fine.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.480
 He may still have a drinking problem, hopefully not.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.480
 Hopefully he's like, "I'm swearing off liquor."

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.480
 But, but interesting little note here.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.480
 It was a benign tumor.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.480
 He said it was like a long forked tongue.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.480
 What if...

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.480
 Alien hybrid, right?

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.480
 He's a half reptilian.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480
 That's why he could drink.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.480
 Maybe he really is from Krypton.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.480
 That's why he could drink so much.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.480
 So Michael, hopefully you're not the first wave

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.480
 of an alien invasion.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.480
 Hopefully you were just a man with a benign tumor

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480
 in your throat.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480
 And hopefully you are now...

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.480
 Maybe you're just having a drink after work

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.480
 instead of getting quote super drunk.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.480
 But disgusting story, disgusting story.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.480
 And I just want to share that with you.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.480
 That one had actually been in my notes for a long time.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.480
 It's one of those stories that I was like,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.480
 "Well, I could tell it, but a lot of people

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.480
 will probably get disgusted by it."

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.480
 It was one of those stories.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.480
 Amalia, are you ready to take off?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480
 She's nodding her head.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.480
 She'll be anywhere but this story.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.480
 Let's go ahead and hop in the carbonar copter

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.480
 and you see me with a little thing in my pocket.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.480
 Amalia is like, "Is that the tumor, dude?

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.480
 Are you bringing that guy's tumor with me?"

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.480
 I was like, "What?

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.480
 I keep mementos from all my stories.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.480
 I'm holding the tumor.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.480
 I'm all swallowing it."

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.480
 Mmm.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.480
 Tastes like benign.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.480
 Let's go ahead and leave behind China.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.480
 We're in the carbonar copter now.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.480
 We are flying out to old, timey America.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.480
 We're going back to the time of the Civil War.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.480
 You know, it's funny when I first started doing this podcast,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.480
 if you had told me I would do a lot of Civil War stories

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.480
 and a lot of Bigfoot stories, I'd been like, "Nah."

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.480
 But it turns out that's the case, right?

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.480
 So as we're flying out over the Civil War,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.480
 we're flying specifically over to Shiloh, Tennessee.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.480
 Let's put on our Union outfits.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.480
 Let's put on our blue outfits.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.480
 Put our little hats on, because we're going to join the Union

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.480
 in this fight against the Confederacy.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480
 [imitates flying]

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.480
 The helicopter's flying.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.480
 It morphs now.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.480
 It's like greyscale, and it looks like an old, timey helicopter.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.480
 It looks like a heliotrope or whatever you used to call them.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.480
 It looks like one of the Da Vinci's machines.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.480
 We're flying over the battlefield in old, timey fashion.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.480
 It's April 6th, 1862.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.480
 We're in Shiloh, Tennessee.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.480
 We're flying over this--it's not a battlefield yet.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.480
 The Union troops are just kind of hanging out in the area.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.480
 And unbeknownst to them,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.480
 we see 40,000 Confederate troops headed towards them.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.480
 How does 40,000 of anything sneak up on you?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.480
 But the Union, apparently, they're all napping at the same time.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.480
 40,000 people come over the hill.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.480
 There's a massive battle.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.480
 It's the Battle of Shiloh.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.480
 It goes from April 6th to April 7th.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.480
 Union and the Confederacy.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.480
 [imitates flying]

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480
 We're shooting at each other.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480
 Cannonball's going everywhere.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.480
 Within these two days of battle,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.480
 16,000 wounded.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.480
 And they're just like laying there.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.480
 "Oh, I got shot in the stomach!

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.480
 Buh! Buh!"

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.480
 "I'm going to pull out that little tumor.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.480
 I'm going to stick it in the wound. You'll be okay."

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.480
 Now, for the other 15,999 people,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.480
 I need more tumors. Stat!

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.480
 The doctor's like, "What? He's just holding two saws?"

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.480
 He's like, "No, I'm just going to cut these people up."

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.480
 Okay, but if I can get more tumors,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.480
 I can patch up all these bullet holes.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.480
 There's a dude with a cannonball in his stomach.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.480
 I'm like, "We're going to need a bigger tumor for that one."

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.480
 But anyways, this is very interesting.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.480
 So you got people laying in the mud.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.480
 They're all shot up and stuff like that.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.480
 It's 16,000s a lot.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.480
 So it's not like, you know, it's going to take a while.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.480
 I think even modern medicine,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.480
 it would take a while to treat 16,000 wounded.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.480
 Now, some of them just were like,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 "Oh, I got a splinter in my hand when the gun did that."

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480
 Some of them were grievously wounded.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.480
 Some of them were like blowing up and had like missing limbs.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.480
 People were just like, "Ugh, I drank too much sassaparilla

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.480
 and it's making me gassy and I'm just going to lay down in this mud for a while."

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.480
 So you had a whole gamut of injuries.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.480
 But what happened was they were treating people that first night, right?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.480
 There's a battle that starts on April 6th and then the sun sets

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.480
 and you have people who were shot were just kind of laying in the mud,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.480
 laying all over the battlefield.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.480
 And it takes time to get to these people,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.480
 but some of the people were laying in the mud and they're bleeding.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.480
 They're trying to hold their blood.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.480
 They're trying to hold their body parts in.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.480
 The ground is glowing around them.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.480
 They're like, "What in tarnation is this?"

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.480
 And then they notice that their wounds are glowing too.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.480
 [Wings wailing]

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.480
 And you'd have the doctors, medics come out and find the people,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.480
 bring them back to where they can treat them.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.480
 The doctors were also seeing these people with glowing wounds.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.480
 And they started to notice something.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.480
 There's 16,000 people dead.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.480
 They were glowing wounds.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.480
 They survived for when they were more likely to survive.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.480
 If they did survive, they healed faster.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.480
 And there was no gangrene, which really is what got you back then.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.480
 The little metal fragment going through your body.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.480
 That will kill you.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.480
 But if it doesn't kill you instantly, a lot of times it was the gangrene.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.480
 It was the infection.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.480
 These people who were glowing didn't get gangrene.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.480
 They survived. They tended to survive better and they healed really quickly.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.480
 Not everyone was glowing in the battlefield.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.480
 That would suck if you're laying there and you're not glowing.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.480
 Everyone else around you is glowing and you're like, "Oh, I feel left out."

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.480
 They're all making fun of you. They're all dead.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.480
 "Dead guy." You're like, "Oh, you're right. I am dead."

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.480
 Now, this was like an old Civil War story.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.480
 They called it "Angel's Glow."

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.480
 And no one really knew what to make of it.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.480
 It was written down in the contemporary accounts of the time.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.480
 "Battle of Shiloh." A couple of soldiers were glowing.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.480
 They didn't really know how to classify it.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.480
 Was it like a fairy tale? Was it a folk legend? Who knows?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.480
 In 2001, two teens in the area decided to do this experiment.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.480
 Billy Martin and John Curtis decided to look into this old, tiny case.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.480
 What was this? Was this real? Was it a miracle? What was it?

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.480
 What they did was they took a bunch of samples of the soil around the battlefield of Shiloh.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.480
 What happened? Part of... These are the... It turns out to be a real thing,

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.480
 but it needed to have certain things going on.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.480
 One, it was really cold. It was April 6th and April 7th.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.480
 It was really cold that time of year.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.480
 So a lot of them got hypothermia, which just slowed down disease overall.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.480
 But in the soil of Shiloh, there is actually a bioluminescent bacteria

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.480
 that's attached to flatworms, which are all over that area.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:06.480
 When the bacteria got into the wound, it basically stabilized it.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.480
 It allowed no gangrene to go there.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.480
 So you needed not only the really, really cold weather,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.480
 but you also needed this bacteria present.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.480
 And there was just the flatworms all over the dirt,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.480
 and they probably got tired of the war going on.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.480
 They're like, "Well, it's flat. I mean, the cannonball is going to roll over it

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.480
 and going to make it more flat."

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480
 They probably didn't carry their way.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.480
 They're like that, and they're not super sentient.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.480
 But the idea is you needed the super cold temperature

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.480
 and the bioluminescent bacteria that's attached to the flatworms

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.480
 with both of those elements together,

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.480
 depending on where you were at in that battlefield,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.480
 depending on whether or not you got enough of that glowing bacteria

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.480
 in your wounds to save your life.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.480
 It would be a thing like if you were laying there

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.480
 and you saw your buddies glowing,

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.480
 you may want to scoop up some mud and rub it all over your wound.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.480
 I wouldn't necessarily recommend that in all cases.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.480
 But it turns out that there actually is a scientific reasoning

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.480
 for why these soldiers weren't dying of normally fatal wounds.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.480
 They just happened to get shot in the right spot.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.480
 Not like shot in your liver as opposed to your heart,

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.480
 but they fell in the soil where there was a lot of these worms,

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.480
 where other people may have been shot in the shoulder and were sitting up,

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.480
 and they weren't laying in the mud and it wasn't getting

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.480
 the right amount of bacteria in there, the good bacteria,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.480
 and then they would die of gangrene on their shoulder.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.480
 Very, very bizarre story, a mystical legend

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.480
 that actually has a scientific explanation.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.480
 So thank you Billy Martin and John Curtis for letting us know

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.480
 the secret to the angels glow.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.480
 I wonder if, like modern medics, they should have a little pack of mud.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480
 Someone's like, "Medic! Medic!"

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.480
 And there's some guy running across the battlefield

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.480
 and he starts throwing mud on GIs and they're like, "Oh, yes, yes!"

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.480
 And then their skin looks so nice and they have that glow.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.480
 And they're ready to go.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.480
 I wonder if they've been able to package.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.480
 I patent that, I patent that idea, dude.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.480
 DARPA, don't take that.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.480
 I patent, Pax of Mud from Shiloh.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.480
 Don't, don't do that.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.480
 I mean, do it, but give me credit.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.480
 I want a penny for every ounce of mud.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.480
 But Amalia, let's wave goodbye to those two young kids,

 Billy and whatever the other dude's name was.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.480
 I put my notes away.

 Bye dudes.

 John, he's wiping away his tears, I forgot his name.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480
 Bye Billy, bye John.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480
 We're saying goodbye to them.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.480
 I've left behind my lucky tumor, but I don't think we're going to need it.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.480
 We're actually headed out to Kyrgyzstan.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.480
 The year is 1990.

 [Mimicking helicopter sounds]

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480
 Helicopter, we're back.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.480
 We're no longer an old-timey helicopter.

 We're the sleek, battle-hardened, carpenter-copter that you all know and love.

 We're flying out to Kyrgyzstan.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:51.480
 Now, this story is from a, originally it was published in a newspaper called Literature Kyrgyzstan.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.480
 Every source I found of this story online, I originally saw this and think about it docs.com,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.480
 but then I look for other references.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.480
 They all repeat the story verbatim, which generally makes it suspicious.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.480
 But, let's take a look at this story.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.480
 Let's pretend this story is 100% accurate.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.480
 I think it's an interesting one.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.480
 Molly, let's bring that carpenter copter nice and low.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.480
 Flying over the beautiful hilly landscape of Kyrgyzstan.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.480
 Once we land, we're going to meet a shepherd.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.480
 He comes out, "Hey, people, I'm coming from..."

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.480
 Apparently, I sound like Santa Claus for some reason.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.480
 We're like, "Hey, I'm sitting on his lap."

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.480
 You're like, "Jason, get up. It's not really Santa Claus."

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.480
 "My name is Omusha. I am a shepherd."

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.480
 She can tell from this flock of very loud sheep behind me.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.480
 Here is my beautiful wife, and my young son is in the house.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.480
 He's playing Nintendo 64.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.480
 But, let's not why you're here.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:57.480
 I know why you're here. You're here to talk about the monster on the rock.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.480
 And so, here's the story that's been going around

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.480
 through this newspaper article, "Kyrgyzstan, Literature Kyrgyzstan."

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.480
 Out in the middle of Kyrgyzstan, you had Omushu, his son, and his wife.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.480
 And they're eking by. It's not the most lucrative business,

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.480
 but, you know, a shepherd's going to do what a shepherd does.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.480
 He's going to shepherd.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.480
 And he has a bunch of sheep, takes them out in the pasture, lets them eat,

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.480
 then brings them in at night, puts them in the fence, goes home,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.480
 kicks his feet up, and dreams. Counts sheep.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.480
 Counts sheep literally falls asleep on the job all the time.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.480
 But one day, he's sitting there. He's out in the pasture.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.480
 And he hears his wife, "Oh, oh, oh, oh!"

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.480
 And he's like, "That's weird. Normally, she only makes that sound when I'm with her."

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.480
 He turns around and he sees her panicking, pointing up at a rock,

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.480
 a massive rock that overlooks the pasture.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.480
 And he follows her finger up to the rock,

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:53.480
 and he sees on top of the rock a massive hairy creature staring down at them.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.480
 Once he got the attention of Omushu, it jumps off the rock and runs into the forest.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:03.480
 And the wife goes, "Listen, I don't ask for much from this marriage, okay?

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.480
 I knew what I was getting into when I married a shepherd, but please, that is too far."

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.480
 Like, I didn't think when I took the vows that there would be a monster involved somewhere.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.480
 Can we leave?

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.480
 And Omushu goes, "No, look at this. It's so beautiful.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.480
 Look at all these sheep are grazing peacefully.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.480
 I mean, sure, yes, you do have the occasional eight foot tall monster on the rock,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.480
 but I will go hunt it.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.480
 You know, I'm good at two things. Sheeping and shooting."

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.480
 So he walks into his house, he gets his rifle.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480
 So it's always at the ready.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.480
 Now, he does go out into the woods a couple of times.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.480
 He's trying to track this thing down.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.480
 He's walking around, he's looking for it.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.480
 He's looking for any giant other rocks he could be hiding on.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.480
 He can't find any evidence of it, but the classic evidence of a bigfoot,

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.480
 he finds footprints.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.480
 He finds footprints.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.480
 Hmm.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.480
 So the creature was out here, he thinks to himself.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.480
 But then he just goes home because he can't find the like what's he supposed to do

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.480
 just hang out at the footprint all day long.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480
 He's sleeping in it.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.480
 He's curled up sleeping in it.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.480
 A couple of days later, he's out of the pasture again.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.480
 Kind of forgotten about it.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.480
 I mean, I guess if you're in the middle of Kyrgyzstan and you're a shepherd,

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.480
 you got more important things to worry about.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.480
 You can't all, I think honestly, like being a bigfoot hunter,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.480
 like having the time to go out and hunt bigfoot means you don't really have much else going on.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.480
 I don't know of many people who like work at a factory 40 hours a week.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.480
 They're like, "But the weekends belong to the bigfoot."

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.480
 Like if you're actually going out and hunting bigfoot,

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.480
 that's probably your main job.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480
 So you've got other things to do.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.480
 You have to do some sheep stuff.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.480
 But one day he's out in the pasture, his wife starts freaking out again,

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.480
 and he's like, "Oh, what?"

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.480
 He kind of knows what it is, so he doesn't even waste time to turn to her.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.480
 He looks over the rock and there's the creature.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.480
 But see, he had been prepared this time.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.480
 He really didn't seem to mind the creature at all,

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.480
 but he's probably more upset at his wife screaming all the time.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.480
 He pulls his rifle out, which he had at the ready, and he takes a shot.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.480
 [gunshot]

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.480
 Creature jumps off the rocks, runs into the forest.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.480
 She's like, "Can we please leave?"

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.480
 He's like, "Oh, come on. Tell you what. I know what's going to happen. I hit it.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.480
 Tomorrow morning I'm going to wake up. I'm going to go check out that rock."

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.480
 Because it was kind of dusk at this point.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.480
 And there's probably going to be a body 30 yards in the forest, because I got it good.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.480
 I'm not going to worry about it. You don't worry about it, whatever.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.480
 The next day, sure enough, he went out there and the rock did have a blood trail leading away from it.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.480
 So he knew that he'd shot it.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.480
 He begins walking, following the blood trail.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.480
 Eventually it dries up, but he figures it's not coming back.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.480
 Whatever it was, it's not coming back.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.480
 A couple days later, he's walking through his pasture.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.480
 Sheep are just walking around.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.480
 And he sees a lump in the field.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.480
 Hmm. It's weird I don't remember leaving any lumps out here.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.480
 He checks his mouth. No, it didn't spit up any tumors. Hmm.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.480
 Let's go see what this lump is.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.480
 As he's walking closer to it, he realizes it's not just a lump.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.480
 It's the body of his son.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:10.480
 There's an interesting detail to this, because when he goes up to the body of his son, the son's dead.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:16.480
 But the line that's used repeatedly is there is no violence showing on the body.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.480
 He wasn't bashed up, he wasn't beat up, he wasn't torn in half.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.480
 Sorry, that's a little gruesome, but I mean, we're talking about a bigfoot creature here.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.480
 No, none of those things, that's not what killed him.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:34.480
 I'll get to the cause of death in a bit, but for dramatic reasons, we're just going to have the father bring the child back to the house, the grieving mother.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.480
 And if an omushu swears at that point, he's going to kill this creature.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:45.480
 However long it takes, grabs his gun, grabs some supplies, goes into the forest, and is trying to track this thing down.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:52.480
 Now a couple nights pass, he's spending nights in the forest, he can't find it.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.480
 After about three or four nights, he goes, "I gotta go back, get some more supplies from home."

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:06.480
 So he comes back home, he sees a sheep in the pen, walks into his house, there his wife lays.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.480
 No violence done to her body, she's dead nonetheless.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:19.480
 Omushu gets ahold of a friend of his, another shepherd, named Shepak.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.480
 He goes, "Shepak, this thing killed my son, killed my wife, I gotta kill this thing.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.480
 I gotta do whatever it takes, I need you to watch my sheep while I'm gone, I will be back."

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.480
 I will be back.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.480
 Shepak's like, "Sure dude, no problem."

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.480
 Omushu grabs his gun, grabs his gear, goes off into the forest.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:45.480
 Shepak does honor this debt, stays in the house, watches over the sheep.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:52.480
 And one morning Shepak wakes up, get ready to do his thing, go tend those sheep.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.480
 The sheep are agitated, making a lot of noise.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.480
 "Baaah, baaah." The sheep go, "Baaah."

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.480
 You won't believe that was me, that was not a sound effect machine.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.480
 "Baaah."

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.480
 Anyways, Shepak goes, "Whoa, those sheep sound incredibly realistic."

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.480
 He sees they're agitated, they're in their pin, he opens the gate, he walks in.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:24.480
 And there, in the middle of all the sheep, lies the body of Omushu.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:31.480
 No violence done upon his body, but he is very clearly dead.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:37.480
 And that's where the story ends, and the story is set up to be that this creature, this Bigfoot creature,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.480
 is killing this family one by one.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.480
 There's a very interesting detail I left out of this.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.480
 First off, before I get to that detail, I think we should be--

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.480
 It's very, very, very rare we come across a story of a Bigfoot killing somebody.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:57.480
 We've done stories where people have found bodies in areas where there have been Bigfoot activity.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.480
 But it's very rare when we find a story where Bigfoot actually is assaulting people.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.480
 We have this story with a guy who went into the other dimension

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.480
 and there was a Bigfoot-type creature waiting there for him, and it said, "DATCHER!"

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.480
 That was an old episode, that one was really good.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.480
 I don't remember what episode that was, it might have been interdimensional Bigfoot, but--

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:24.480
 We have that one. We have the one about all the Bigfoot sightings in the Southwest, American Southwest,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:30.480
 where you had the Speedway monster was out there, and you had bodies being found,

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.480
 because at this point, the Spaniards and the Indigenous people had stayed out of a certain region,

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.480
 and as more Europeans were showing up there, getting horribly mangled down there.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.480
 But you had Bigfoot sightings and then these bodies.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:49.480
 As far as I can remember, and you guys know this show more than I do, honestly,

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:55.480
 I can't recall a time that we've actually had a Bigfoot kill somebody, or even really assault somebody.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.480
 We've had Bigfoot sightings and then people die, and I could be wrong, we may have covered that,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.480
 but even if I have covered it, it's extremely rare.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:08.480
 And here we would have a case over a period of time of a Bigfoot creature showing up repeatedly

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.480
 and taking out a family one by one.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.480
 So that in and of itself is rare.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.480
 But this is what makes this story super interesting.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.480
 Here's the detail I left out.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.480
 The way that they died.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.480
 The father, the son, because the father, the mother, and the son were all found dead.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.480
 No violence done upon their bodies, the phrase used.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:35.480
 Two puncture marks in their neck, blood dripping out of the puncture marks.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.480
 That's not a Bigfoot kill.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.480
 That's not a Bigfoot kill.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.480
 What are Bigfoot's known for?

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.480
 Their size, their strength.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:48.480
 People say when they hear these things, it sounds like trees rending into pitch black.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.480
 Night.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.480
 It's massive creatures.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.480
 They've been known to throw rocks.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:59.480
 Puncture marks in the neck.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.480
 Obviously that makes you think of a vampire.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:08.480
 If you got attacked by a Bigfoot, I don't think there's much left of you.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.480
 I think a Bigfoot attack would be similar to a gorilla attack.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.480
 You're lucky if you keep your genitals in your face.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.480
 That's the first thing they would go for.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.480
 Just as an ape-like species.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.480
 Now Bigfoot is me Bigfoot.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.480
 Me not want to grab genitals.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.480
 But in a fight response, as a human when we fight, we go to disable generally.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.480
 We're punching for the face.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480
 We're punching for the head.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.480
 And if it's really bad, you're punching for the neck.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.480
 But I mean, if you're in a real, real bad fight, you're going to grab the genitals.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.480
 You're going to go and put out an eye.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.480
 Like if it's death, if you lose this fight, you're going to die.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.480
 You're going to try to do some real damage to them.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.480
 Grab the balls and twist.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.480
 Apes, that is their default thing.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.480
 Apes aren't going to stand up and box you, right?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.480
 They're just going to start ripping you apart.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480
 Ripping humans apart.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.480
 They rip off your face.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.480
 They pull off your genitals.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.480
 You think a Bigfoot would at least have some of those instincts as well.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.480
 If there's one attack you, you can literally just pull limbs off.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.480
 But whatever case you do, definitely don't think of it being a stealth attack.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.480
 An attack with no damage to the body.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.480
 Those stories that I told where they found the people in the American Southwest,

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 they were horribly mutilated.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.480
 Horribly mutilated bodies that they were finding in the brush.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.480
 Nothing like, it looked like Lestat took him in the night.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.480
 Looks like his last moments were about terror and ecstasy.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.480
 No, their fangs were broken.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.480
 They were being killed supposedly by Bigfoot.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.480
 So these don't really seem like Bigfoot attacks.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.480
 So I have a hypothesis, and I think this might be going out there,

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.480
 but we've covered a lot of weird Bigfoot stuff.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.480
 Let's put this into another perspective.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.480
 Bigfoot was not the adversary in this story.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.480
 Despite the fact that he was being hunted.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.480
 Despite the fact that he was shot.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:55.480
 "Ugh, me only want to save family, but will it wound through liver and make that difficult?"

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.480
 "Ugh!"

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.480
 Wandering through the woods.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.480
 What if it was there to protect that family from a vampire?

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:09.480
 He didn't escalate it when he shot Bigfoot.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.480
 He didn't escalate it so that Bigfoot came back to kill his family.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:19.480
 The fact that he shot Bigfoot made it impossible for him to save Omusha's son.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.480
 Far-fetched, absolutely, right?

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.480
 Absolutely far-fetched.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.480
 But it actually, if the story is true, right?

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.480
 It could totally be made up.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.480
 If the story is true, it most likely is made up.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:38.480
 But if the story is true, these definitely aren't the hallmarks of a Bigfoot kill.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:44.480
 Or an ape kill, or the kill of someone who's eight feet tall and 800 pounds.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.480
 It's the attack pattern of a vampire.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.480
 If you get killed in your sleep, you don't go, "Michael Myers must have done it."

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.480
 Like, you have certain rules with this stuff.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.480
 What if there was a vampire watching over that hurt?

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.480
 And actually, a vampire wouldn't make sense as well, because it could feed off the sheep.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.480
 That's why it would be in a pasture area to begin with.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.480
 Remember, none of these people were seen to be killed.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.480
 The bodies were discovered the next day, as if the attacks took place at night.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.480
 Bigfoot's not there killing these people.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.480
 Bigfoot's trying to save this group of shepherds from this vampire.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.480
 And it failed, because it was being hunted.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.480
 It was being pursued.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:26.480
 Interesting story, interesting piece of the lore, because it would actually add another wrinkle to the story of Bigfoot.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.480
 The reason why Bigfoot is always out there, always hidden, isn't trying to hide from us.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.480
 But it's trying to sneak up on the things that are actually trying to take us out.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.480
 It would add a whole other layer to the idea of high strangeness.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.480
 That's where we usually see Bigfoot in UFO and ghosts and stuff like that.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.480
 Generally, in a similar area, where you see one, you tend to see the other.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:52.480
 It's possible that Bigfoot is there to protect us from those other crazy things.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.480
 He's not a furry foe.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.480
 He's not an elusive enemy.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.480
 He's a protector.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:04.480
 But we treat him as something that we can either hunt, chase, capture, or kill.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.480
 When we should just be in like, "You do you, because I know you got my back."

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.480
 Do we have an ally in the war against darkness?

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.480
 And is that ally our eight-foot friend?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.480
 The Sasquatch.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.480
 It would make sense why he's seeing all over the world.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.480
 It would make sense why he's so powerful.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.480
 There's no way a vampire could bite through a Bigfoot's neck.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.480
 I can't believe I said that sentence out loud.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.480
 But you know what I mean? It would be built for combat.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:37.480
 Plus, it would have the skills of disappearing on command, of being incredibly elusive.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.480
 It does fly Bigfoot's head inside and flying UFOs as well.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.480
 The world of the weird, a lot of times we try to contain it by going, "This is a ghost sighting.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.480
 This is UFO sighting. This is a Bigfoot sighting."

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.480
 It may all be connected.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.480
 And there may be battle lines drawn.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.480
 Bigfoot may be on our side.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:59.480
 At the end of the day, it may come down between humanity and Bigfoot,

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.480
 versus the forces of evil.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.480
 The demons and the darkness and the plagues of humanity.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.480
 We'll be standing there side by side with our furry friend.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.480
 But if we keep hunting him, if we keep pursuing him,

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.480
 he may not be there when we need him the most.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.480
 He may not be there as those fangs dig into our neck.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:37.480
 The Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.480
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.480
 I'm glad you listen to it today. Have a great one, guys.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:32:00.480
