1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,480
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,480
 When a man has a coughing fit,

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,480
 no one expects a tumor to pop out of his mouth.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,480
 We travel back to the Civil War to take a look at a time

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,480
 when soldiers may have been blessed by an angel.

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,480
 And then we take a look at a bizarre story involving a shepherd,

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,480
 his family, and a murder hiding in the woods.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,480
 Is the murderer Bigfoot?

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,480
 Or something far more sinister today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,480
 [music]

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 Hey, everybody.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,480
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
 I'm having a great day.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today,

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
 so we're going to get started right now.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,480
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter,

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
 Amalia.

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,480
 Amalia, thank you so much for supporting the show.

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
 Really, really is awesome.

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,480
 You are going to be our pilot, our captain this episode,

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
 and I'm sending you out a sticker.

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine, too.

37
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
 Just hope you get the word out about the show.

38
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,480
 That really, really helps out a lot.

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,480
 We also have a merch store, and join us on the Minecraft server.

40
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
 That's always fun playing.

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,480
 I'm going to be taking a pretty long vacation soon.

42
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,480
 I'm actually recording my episodes in advance right now.

43
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,480
 So I'm actually going to have three weeks

44
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
 where the episodes are going to still be playing.

45
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
 I'm going to have new episodes coming out,

46
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
 but I'm recording them all in advance.

47
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,480
 So when I'm on actual vacation for three weeks,

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,480
 it'll be the longest vacation I've taken since I started this show.

49
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,480
 It'll be fun, and you guys will have episodes.

50
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,480
 I think we'll have one week of repeats,

51
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
 but everything else should be fine.

52
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,480
 So, Amalia, let's go ahead and hop inside that Dead Rabbit rowboat.

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,480
 We are going to start off by rowing all the way from Oregon to China.

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,480
 Probably could have picked a better vehicle,

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
 but we'll get there eventually.

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
 We're headed back to the year 2019.

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
 It's March 2019.

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
 We're in Hunshan County.

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 That's in the Hu Bai province in China.

60
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
 We get out, our arms are super muscular.

61
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,480
 From rowing all the way from America to China.

62
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
 We're walking around, we're super buff.

63
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,480
 But we're not here to push people over.

64
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,480
 We're here, we put on our lab coats, to be doctors.

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
 We're just super muscular doctors.

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
 And when we get to China, we're going to walk around China a bit.

67
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
 We're going to this dude's house.

68
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
 Now, we don't have his name.

69
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
 This is a medical case.

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
 They don't really reveal people's personal information.

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,480
 When it comes to these types of cases, we'll just call him Michael.

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
 Michael is a 63-year-old man.

73
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
 We're going to walk in to his house.

74
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 We're super rude.

75
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
 We don't even knock.

76
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
 He's like, "Ugh!"

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
 He's shocked, but then we put on our invisibility cloaks,

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
 and he just thinks he was having an illusion.

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,480
 He has actually worse problems than a bunch of strangers appearing in his house.

80
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,480
 Michael is sitting in his house and starts trying to clear his throat.

81
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
 Something's wrong.

82
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,480
 He can't figure it out, but he's not going to go to the doctor, right?

83
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,480
 He's just going to work.

84
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,480
 He's just going to work it through, right?

85
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
 And then one day, he's dealing with this throat issue,

86
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,480
 but one day he gets super drunk,

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,480
 way more than a normal human drunk, right?

88
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
 But he's just dealing with it.

89
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
 He has this lump in his throat.

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,480
 He just figures that maybe he is always nervous.

91
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,480
 So he also, on top of that, seems to have a serious drinking problem,

92
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,480
 because one day he gets, according to my notes, super drunk.

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 I don't know what the difference is between being drunk, very drunk, and super drunk,

94
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
 but for some reason I wrote down super drunk,

95
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,480
 so let's imagine it is Kryptonian levels of alcoholism.

96
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,480
 He ends up going to throw up, because he's not a Kryptonian.

97
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,480
 He drank as much as Superman, but he's not Superman.

98
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,480
 He goes to throw up, and he feels a horrible pain in his throat.

99
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,480
 Oh! Oh!

100
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
 And then he feels it.

101
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,480
 He feels it at the top of his throat.

102
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
 He feels it at the top of his throat.

103
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
 He feels a chunk of meat.

104
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
 Sorry, Amalia.

105
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
 Seriously? She's in the corner.

106
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
 Why did I have to be on this episode?

107
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
 We're holding her hair back.

108
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
 Sorry, Amalia.

109
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
 He feels a chunk of meat in his throat.

110
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 He tries to cough it up, and it's stuck.

111
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 It's stuck in his throat.

112
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
 Just telling the stories.

113
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
 I feel like something's stuck in my throat.

114
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
 He's trying to cough it up.

115
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
 He can't.

116
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
 He reaches into his mouth.

117
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
 He feels it.

118
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
 He says it's about five inches long.

119
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
 He starts to tug on it.

120
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
 There's something in his mouth that shouldn't be there.

121
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,480
 Something gross and slimy.

122
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
 And he's like, "That's weird.

123
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
 I didn't eat a Taco Bell yesterday.

124
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
 I remember getting drunk,

125
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
 but I don't remember eating a chalupa."

126
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
 And he's pulling it.

127
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
 He's pulling it, and it pops out.

128
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,480
 It pops out of his mouth.

129
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,480
 He said it looked like a longed, forked tongue.

130
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 And it's actually now hanging out of his mouth.

131
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
 So what do you do?

132
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,480
 You're coming down from a sane drinking binge.

133
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 You're thankful that you need Taco Bell,

134
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
 so you're like, "Oh, yeah, that's fine."

135
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,480
 But, and you have like a piece of meat

136
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
 sticking out of your mouth.

137
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
 He can't yank it.

138
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 He's trying to pull it.

139
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
 It won't pop out.

140
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
 So he does the next alternative, right?

141
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
 He does the next best thing.

142
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
 He pushes it back into his throat.

143
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
 He begins drinking a bunch of water.

144
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
 He's like poking at it.

145
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
 I imagine he gets like a plunger.

146
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,480
 Eventually it goes back into his throat.

147
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
 I'm sorry for my remaining listeners.

148
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,480
 I'm sorry.

149
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,480
 And then, then he goes to the doctor, right?

150
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
 Because it's one thing to have like a lump in your throat

151
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
 in a couple of days, whatever.

152
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
 But when it comes out and you can actually look at it

153
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
 and you can feel it, how slim it is,

154
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
 he goes to the doctor.

155
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
 Doctor looks in there.

156
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
 Doctor, I'm assuming doesn't believe him at first.

157
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,480
 He's like, "And then, Doc, after my incredible drinking binge,

158
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
 something came out of my body."

159
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
 The doctor's like, "Let's run a couple tests on your liver

160
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480
 before you take a look at this quote-unquote forked tongue

161
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,480
 in your mouth after they basically flesh his liver."

162
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
 It was a tumor.

163
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,480
 He had a benign tumor that had been growing in his throat

164
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
 and it was getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

165
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
 And then one day he coughed it up and panicked

166
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,480
 and he pushed it back in and they did take it out.

167
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
 He doesn't have it anymore.

168
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
 They took out the tumor.

169
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
 As far as we can tell, Michael is totally fine.

170
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,480
 He may still have a drinking problem, hopefully not.

171
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
 Hopefully he's like, "I'm swearing off liquor."

172
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,480
 But, but interesting little note here.

173
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
 It was a benign tumor.

174
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
 He said it was like a long forked tongue.

175
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
 What if...

176
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,480
 Alien hybrid, right?

177
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
 He's a half reptilian.

178
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
 That's why he could drink.

179
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
 Maybe he really is from Krypton.

180
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
 That's why he could drink so much.

181
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,480
 So Michael, hopefully you're not the first wave

182
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
 of an alien invasion.

183
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,480
 Hopefully you were just a man with a benign tumor

184
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
 in your throat.

185
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
 And hopefully you are now...

186
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
 Maybe you're just having a drink after work

187
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
 instead of getting quote super drunk.

188
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,480
 But disgusting story, disgusting story.

189
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
 And I just want to share that with you.

190
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
 That one had actually been in my notes for a long time.

191
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,480
 It's one of those stories that I was like,

192
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,480
 "Well, I could tell it, but a lot of people

193
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
 will probably get disgusted by it."

194
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
 It was one of those stories.

195
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
 Amalia, are you ready to take off?

196
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
 She's nodding her head.

197
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,480
 She'll be anywhere but this story.

198
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 Let's go ahead and hop in the carbonar copter

199
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
 and you see me with a little thing in my pocket.

200
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,480
 Amalia is like, "Is that the tumor, dude?

201
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
 Are you bringing that guy's tumor with me?"

202
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 I was like, "What?

203
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
 I keep mementos from all my stories.

204
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
 I'm holding the tumor.

205
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
 I'm all swallowing it."

206
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
 Mmm.

207
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
 Tastes like benign.

208
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
 Let's go ahead and leave behind China.

209
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
 We're in the carbonar copter now.

210
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
 We are flying out to old, timey America.

211
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,480
 We're going back to the time of the Civil War.

212
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,480
 You know, it's funny when I first started doing this podcast,

213
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
 if you had told me I would do a lot of Civil War stories

214
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 and a lot of Bigfoot stories, I'd been like, "Nah."

215
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
 But it turns out that's the case, right?

216
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
 So as we're flying out over the Civil War,

217
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,480
 we're flying specifically over to Shiloh, Tennessee.

218
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
 Let's put on our Union outfits.

219
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
 Let's put on our blue outfits.

220
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
 Put our little hats on, because we're going to join the Union

221
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
 in this fight against the Confederacy.

222
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
 [imitates flying]

223
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
 The helicopter's flying.

224
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
 It morphs now.

225
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
 It's like greyscale, and it looks like an old, timey helicopter.

226
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
 It looks like a heliotrope or whatever you used to call them.

227
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,480
 It looks like one of the Da Vinci's machines.

228
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,480
 We're flying over the battlefield in old, timey fashion.

229
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,480
 It's April 6th, 1862.

230
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
 We're in Shiloh, Tennessee.

231
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
 We're flying over this--it's not a battlefield yet.

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,480
 The Union troops are just kind of hanging out in the area.

233
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,480
 And unbeknownst to them,

234
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 we see 40,000 Confederate troops headed towards them.

235
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,480
 How does 40,000 of anything sneak up on you?

236
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,480
 But the Union, apparently, they're all napping at the same time.

237
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
 40,000 people come over the hill.

238
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
 There's a massive battle.

239
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
 It's the Battle of Shiloh.

240
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
 It goes from April 6th to April 7th.

241
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
 Union and the Confederacy.

242
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
 [imitates flying]

243
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
 We're shooting at each other.

244
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
 Cannonball's going everywhere.

245
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
 Within these two days of battle,

246
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,480
 16,000 wounded.

247
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
 And they're just like laying there.

248
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
 "Oh, I got shot in the stomach!

249
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
 Buh! Buh!"

250
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
 "I'm going to pull out that little tumor.

251
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
 I'm going to stick it in the wound. You'll be okay."

252
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,480
 Now, for the other 15,999 people,

253
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
 I need more tumors. Stat!

254
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,480
 The doctor's like, "What? He's just holding two saws?"

255
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
 He's like, "No, I'm just going to cut these people up."

256
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
 Okay, but if I can get more tumors,

257
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
 I can patch up all these bullet holes.

258
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
 There's a dude with a cannonball in his stomach.

259
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,480
 I'm like, "We're going to need a bigger tumor for that one."

260
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,480
 But anyways, this is very interesting.

261
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
 So you got people laying in the mud.

262
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
 They're all shot up and stuff like that.

263
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
 It's 16,000s a lot.

264
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
 So it's not like, you know, it's going to take a while.

265
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
 I think even modern medicine,

266
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
 it would take a while to treat 16,000 wounded.

267
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
 Now, some of them just were like,

268
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,480
 "Oh, I got a splinter in my hand when the gun did that."

269
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
 Some of them were grievously wounded.

270
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,480
 Some of them were like blowing up and had like missing limbs.

271
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,480
 People were just like, "Ugh, I drank too much sassaparilla

272
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,480
 and it's making me gassy and I'm just going to lay down in this mud for a while."

273
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
 So you had a whole gamut of injuries.

274
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,480
 But what happened was they were treating people that first night, right?

275
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,480
 There's a battle that starts on April 6th and then the sun sets

276
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 and you have people who were shot were just kind of laying in the mud,

277
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
 laying all over the battlefield.

278
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
 And it takes time to get to these people,

279
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
 but some of the people were laying in the mud and they're bleeding.

280
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
 They're trying to hold their blood.

281
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
 They're trying to hold their body parts in.

282
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,480
 The ground is glowing around them.

283
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,480
 They're like, "What in tarnation is this?"

284
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,480
 And then they notice that their wounds are glowing too.

285
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,480
 [Wings wailing]

286
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,480
 And you'd have the doctors, medics come out and find the people,

287
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
 bring them back to where they can treat them.

288
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,480
 The doctors were also seeing these people with glowing wounds.

289
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
 And they started to notice something.

290
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
 There's 16,000 people dead.

291
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
 They were glowing wounds.

292
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,480
 They survived for when they were more likely to survive.

293
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 If they did survive, they healed faster.

294
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,480
 And there was no gangrene, which really is what got you back then.

295
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,480
 The little metal fragment going through your body.

296
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
 That will kill you.

297
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,480
 But if it doesn't kill you instantly, a lot of times it was the gangrene.

298
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
 It was the infection.

299
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,480
 These people who were glowing didn't get gangrene.

300
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,480
 They survived. They tended to survive better and they healed really quickly.

301
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,480
 Not everyone was glowing in the battlefield.

302
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,480
 That would suck if you're laying there and you're not glowing.

303
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,480
 Everyone else around you is glowing and you're like, "Oh, I feel left out."

304
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,480
 They're all making fun of you. They're all dead.

305
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
 "Dead guy." You're like, "Oh, you're right. I am dead."

306
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
 Now, this was like an old Civil War story.

307
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
 They called it "Angel's Glow."

308
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
 And no one really knew what to make of it.

309
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,480
 It was written down in the contemporary accounts of the time.

310
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,480
 "Battle of Shiloh." A couple of soldiers were glowing.

311
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
 They didn't really know how to classify it.

312
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,480
 Was it like a fairy tale? Was it a folk legend? Who knows?

313
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,480
 In 2001, two teens in the area decided to do this experiment.

314
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,480
 Billy Martin and John Curtis decided to look into this old, tiny case.

315
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
 What was this? Was this real? Was it a miracle? What was it?

316
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,480
 What they did was they took a bunch of samples of the soil around the battlefield of Shiloh.

317
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,480
 What happened? Part of... These are the... It turns out to be a real thing,

318
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,480
 but it needed to have certain things going on.

319
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,480
 One, it was really cold. It was April 6th and April 7th.

320
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
 It was really cold that time of year.

321
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,480
 So a lot of them got hypothermia, which just slowed down disease overall.

322
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,480
 But in the soil of Shiloh, there is actually a bioluminescent bacteria

323
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,480
 that's attached to flatworms, which are all over that area.

324
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,480
 When the bacteria got into the wound, it basically stabilized it.

325
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,480
 It allowed no gangrene to go there.

326
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,480
 So you needed not only the really, really cold weather,

327
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,480
 but you also needed this bacteria present.

328
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,480
 And there was just the flatworms all over the dirt,

329
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
 and they probably got tired of the war going on.

330
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,480
 They're like, "Well, it's flat. I mean, the cannonball is going to roll over it

331
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
 and going to make it more flat."

332
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
 They probably didn't carry their way.

333
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
 They're like that, and they're not super sentient.

334
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,480
 But the idea is you needed the super cold temperature

335
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,480
 and the bioluminescent bacteria that's attached to the flatworms

336
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
 with both of those elements together,

337
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,480
 depending on where you were at in that battlefield,

338
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 depending on whether or not you got enough of that glowing bacteria

339
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,480
 in your wounds to save your life.

340
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
 It would be a thing like if you were laying there

341
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
 and you saw your buddies glowing,

342
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,480
 you may want to scoop up some mud and rub it all over your wound.

343
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,480
 I wouldn't necessarily recommend that in all cases.

344
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
 But it turns out that there actually is a scientific reasoning

345
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,480
 for why these soldiers weren't dying of normally fatal wounds.

346
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,480
 They just happened to get shot in the right spot.

347
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
 Not like shot in your liver as opposed to your heart,

348
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,480
 but they fell in the soil where there was a lot of these worms,

349
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,480
 where other people may have been shot in the shoulder and were sitting up,

350
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,480
 and they weren't laying in the mud and it wasn't getting

351
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,480
 the right amount of bacteria in there, the good bacteria,

352
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,480
 and then they would die of gangrene on their shoulder.

353
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,480
 Very, very bizarre story, a mystical legend

354
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
 that actually has a scientific explanation.

355
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,480
 So thank you Billy Martin and John Curtis for letting us know

356
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
 the secret to the angels glow.

357
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,480
 I wonder if, like modern medics, they should have a little pack of mud.

358
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
 Someone's like, "Medic! Medic!"

359
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
 And there's some guy running across the battlefield

360
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,480
 and he starts throwing mud on GIs and they're like, "Oh, yes, yes!"

361
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,480
 And then their skin looks so nice and they have that glow.

362
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
 And they're ready to go.

363
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
 I wonder if they've been able to package.

364
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
 I patent that, I patent that idea, dude.

365
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
 DARPA, don't take that.

366
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
 I patent, Pax of Mud from Shiloh.

367
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
 Don't, don't do that.

368
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
 I mean, do it, but give me credit.

369
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
 I want a penny for every ounce of mud.

370
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
 But Amalia, let's wave goodbye to those two young kids,

371
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
 Billy and whatever the other dude's name was.

372
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
 I put my notes away.

373
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
 Bye dudes.

374
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,480
 John, he's wiping away his tears, I forgot his name.

375
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
 Bye Billy, bye John.

376
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
 We're saying goodbye to them.

377
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,480
 I've left behind my lucky tumor, but I don't think we're going to need it.

378
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,480
 We're actually headed out to Kyrgyzstan.

379
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
 The year is 1990.

380
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
 [Mimicking helicopter sounds]

381
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
 Helicopter, we're back.

382
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 We're no longer an old-timey helicopter.

383
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,480
 We're the sleek, battle-hardened, carpenter-copter that you all know and love.

384
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
 We're flying out to Kyrgyzstan.

385
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,480
 Now, this story is from a, originally it was published in a newspaper called Literature Kyrgyzstan.

386
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,480
 Every source I found of this story online, I originally saw this and think about it docs.com,

387
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 but then I look for other references.

388
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,480
 They all repeat the story verbatim, which generally makes it suspicious.

389
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
 But, let's take a look at this story.

390
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,480
 Let's pretend this story is 100% accurate.

391
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
 I think it's an interesting one.

392
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,480
 Molly, let's bring that carpenter copter nice and low.

393
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,480
 Flying over the beautiful hilly landscape of Kyrgyzstan.

394
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,480
 Once we land, we're going to meet a shepherd.

395
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,480
 He comes out, "Hey, people, I'm coming from..."

396
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
 Apparently, I sound like Santa Claus for some reason.

397
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
 We're like, "Hey, I'm sitting on his lap."

398
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,480
 You're like, "Jason, get up. It's not really Santa Claus."

399
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
 "My name is Omusha. I am a shepherd."

400
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,480
 She can tell from this flock of very loud sheep behind me.

401
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 Here is my beautiful wife, and my young son is in the house.

402
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
 He's playing Nintendo 64.

403
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,480
 But, let's not why you're here.

404
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,480
 I know why you're here. You're here to talk about the monster on the rock.

405
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
 And so, here's the story that's been going around

406
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,480
 through this newspaper article, "Kyrgyzstan, Literature Kyrgyzstan."

407
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,480
 Out in the middle of Kyrgyzstan, you had Omushu, his son, and his wife.

408
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
 And they're eking by. It's not the most lucrative business,

409
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
 but, you know, a shepherd's going to do what a shepherd does.

410
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
 He's going to shepherd.

411
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,480
 And he has a bunch of sheep, takes them out in the pasture, lets them eat,

412
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,480
 then brings them in at night, puts them in the fence, goes home,

413
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,480
 kicks his feet up, and dreams. Counts sheep.

414
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,480
 Counts sheep literally falls asleep on the job all the time.

415
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
 But one day, he's sitting there. He's out in the pasture.

416
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,480
 And he hears his wife, "Oh, oh, oh, oh!"

417
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,480
 And he's like, "That's weird. Normally, she only makes that sound when I'm with her."

418
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,480
 He turns around and he sees her panicking, pointing up at a rock,

419
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
 a massive rock that overlooks the pasture.

420
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
 And he follows her finger up to the rock,

421
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,480
 and he sees on top of the rock a massive hairy creature staring down at them.

422
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,480
 Once he got the attention of Omushu, it jumps off the rock and runs into the forest.

423
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,480
 And the wife goes, "Listen, I don't ask for much from this marriage, okay?

424
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,480
 I knew what I was getting into when I married a shepherd, but please, that is too far."

425
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,480
 Like, I didn't think when I took the vows that there would be a monster involved somewhere.

426
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
 Can we leave?

427
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,480
 And Omushu goes, "No, look at this. It's so beautiful.

428
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
 Look at all these sheep are grazing peacefully.

429
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,480
 I mean, sure, yes, you do have the occasional eight foot tall monster on the rock,

430
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,480
 but I will go hunt it.

431
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,480
 You know, I'm good at two things. Sheeping and shooting."

432
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,480
 So he walks into his house, he gets his rifle.

433
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
 So it's always at the ready.

434
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
 Now, he does go out into the woods a couple of times.

435
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
 He's trying to track this thing down.

436
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
 He's walking around, he's looking for it.

437
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,480
 He's looking for any giant other rocks he could be hiding on.

438
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,480
 He can't find any evidence of it, but the classic evidence of a bigfoot,

439
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
 he finds footprints.

440
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
 He finds footprints.

441
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 Hmm.

442
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,480
 So the creature was out here, he thinks to himself.

443
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,480
 But then he just goes home because he can't find the like what's he supposed to do

444
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
 just hang out at the footprint all day long.

445
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
 He's sleeping in it.

446
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
 He's curled up sleeping in it.

447
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
 A couple of days later, he's out of the pasture again.

448
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,480
 Kind of forgotten about it.

449
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,480
 I mean, I guess if you're in the middle of Kyrgyzstan and you're a shepherd,

450
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 you got more important things to worry about.

451
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,480
 You can't all, I think honestly, like being a bigfoot hunter,

452
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,480
 like having the time to go out and hunt bigfoot means you don't really have much else going on.

453
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,480
 I don't know of many people who like work at a factory 40 hours a week.

454
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
 They're like, "But the weekends belong to the bigfoot."

455
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,480
 Like if you're actually going out and hunting bigfoot,

456
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
 that's probably your main job.

457
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
 So you've got other things to do.

458
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
 You have to do some sheep stuff.

459
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,480
 But one day he's out in the pasture, his wife starts freaking out again,

460
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
 and he's like, "Oh, what?"

461
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,480
 He kind of knows what it is, so he doesn't even waste time to turn to her.

462
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
 He looks over the rock and there's the creature.

463
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,480
 But see, he had been prepared this time.

464
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
 He really didn't seem to mind the creature at all,

465
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,480
 but he's probably more upset at his wife screaming all the time.

466
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,480
 He pulls his rifle out, which he had at the ready, and he takes a shot.

467
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,480
 [gunshot]

468
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,480
 Creature jumps off the rocks, runs into the forest.

469
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
 She's like, "Can we please leave?"

470
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,480
 He's like, "Oh, come on. Tell you what. I know what's going to happen. I hit it.

471
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,480
 Tomorrow morning I'm going to wake up. I'm going to go check out that rock."

472
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
 Because it was kind of dusk at this point.

473
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,480
 And there's probably going to be a body 30 yards in the forest, because I got it good.

474
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
 I'm not going to worry about it. You don't worry about it, whatever.

475
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,480
 The next day, sure enough, he went out there and the rock did have a blood trail leading away from it.

476
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
 So he knew that he'd shot it.

477
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
 He begins walking, following the blood trail.

478
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,480
 Eventually it dries up, but he figures it's not coming back.

479
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,480
 Whatever it was, it's not coming back.

480
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
 A couple days later, he's walking through his pasture.

481
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
 Sheep are just walking around.

482
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,480
 And he sees a lump in the field.

483
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,480
 Hmm. It's weird I don't remember leaving any lumps out here.

484
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,480
 He checks his mouth. No, it didn't spit up any tumors. Hmm.

485
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
 Let's go see what this lump is.

486
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,480
 As he's walking closer to it, he realizes it's not just a lump.

487
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,480
 It's the body of his son.

488
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,480
 There's an interesting detail to this, because when he goes up to the body of his son, the son's dead.

489
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,480
 But the line that's used repeatedly is there is no violence showing on the body.

490
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,480
 He wasn't bashed up, he wasn't beat up, he wasn't torn in half.

491
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,480
 Sorry, that's a little gruesome, but I mean, we're talking about a bigfoot creature here.

492
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,480
 No, none of those things, that's not what killed him.

493
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:34,480
 I'll get to the cause of death in a bit, but for dramatic reasons, we're just going to have the father bring the child back to the house, the grieving mother.

494
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,480
 And if an omushu swears at that point, he's going to kill this creature.

495
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,480
 However long it takes, grabs his gun, grabs some supplies, goes into the forest, and is trying to track this thing down.

496
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,480
 Now a couple nights pass, he's spending nights in the forest, he can't find it.

497
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,480
 After about three or four nights, he goes, "I gotta go back, get some more supplies from home."

498
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:06,480
 So he comes back home, he sees a sheep in the pen, walks into his house, there his wife lays.

499
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,480
 No violence done to her body, she's dead nonetheless.

500
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,480
 Omushu gets ahold of a friend of his, another shepherd, named Shepak.

501
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,480
 He goes, "Shepak, this thing killed my son, killed my wife, I gotta kill this thing.

502
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,480
 I gotta do whatever it takes, I need you to watch my sheep while I'm gone, I will be back."

503
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
 I will be back.

504
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,480
 Shepak's like, "Sure dude, no problem."

505
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
 Omushu grabs his gun, grabs his gear, goes off into the forest.

506
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,480
 Shepak does honor this debt, stays in the house, watches over the sheep.

507
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:52,480
 And one morning Shepak wakes up, get ready to do his thing, go tend those sheep.

508
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,480
 The sheep are agitated, making a lot of noise.

509
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,480
 "Baaah, baaah." The sheep go, "Baaah."

510
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,480
 You won't believe that was me, that was not a sound effect machine.

511
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
 "Baaah."

512
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 Anyways, Shepak goes, "Whoa, those sheep sound incredibly realistic."

513
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,480
 He sees they're agitated, they're in their pin, he opens the gate, he walks in.

514
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:24,480
 And there, in the middle of all the sheep, lies the body of Omushu.

515
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,480
 No violence done upon his body, but he is very clearly dead.

516
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,480
 And that's where the story ends, and the story is set up to be that this creature, this Bigfoot creature,

517
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,480
 is killing this family one by one.

518
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,480
 There's a very interesting detail I left out of this.

519
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,480
 First off, before I get to that detail, I think we should be--

520
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,480
 It's very, very, very rare we come across a story of a Bigfoot killing somebody.

521
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,480
 We've done stories where people have found bodies in areas where there have been Bigfoot activity.

522
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,480
 But it's very rare when we find a story where Bigfoot actually is assaulting people.

523
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,480
 We have this story with a guy who went into the other dimension

524
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,480
 and there was a Bigfoot-type creature waiting there for him, and it said, "DATCHER!"

525
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
 That was an old episode, that one was really good.

526
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,480
 I don't remember what episode that was, it might have been interdimensional Bigfoot, but--

527
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:24,480
 We have that one. We have the one about all the Bigfoot sightings in the Southwest, American Southwest,

528
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,480
 where you had the Speedway monster was out there, and you had bodies being found,

529
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,480
 because at this point, the Spaniards and the Indigenous people had stayed out of a certain region,

530
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,480
 and as more Europeans were showing up there, getting horribly mangled down there.

531
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,480
 But you had Bigfoot sightings and then these bodies.

532
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,480
 As far as I can remember, and you guys know this show more than I do, honestly,

533
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,480
 I can't recall a time that we've actually had a Bigfoot kill somebody, or even really assault somebody.

534
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,480
 We've had Bigfoot sightings and then people die, and I could be wrong, we may have covered that,

535
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,480
 but even if I have covered it, it's extremely rare.

536
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,480
 And here we would have a case over a period of time of a Bigfoot creature showing up repeatedly

537
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
 and taking out a family one by one.

538
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
 So that in and of itself is rare.

539
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,480
 But this is what makes this story super interesting.

540
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,480
 Here's the detail I left out.

541
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,480
 The way that they died.

542
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,480
 The father, the son, because the father, the mother, and the son were all found dead.

543
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,480
 No violence done upon their bodies, the phrase used.

544
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,480
 Two puncture marks in their neck, blood dripping out of the puncture marks.

545
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
 That's not a Bigfoot kill.

546
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
 That's not a Bigfoot kill.

547
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
 What are Bigfoot's known for?

548
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
 Their size, their strength.

549
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,480
 People say when they hear these things, it sounds like trees rending into pitch black.

550
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
 Night.

551
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
 It's massive creatures.

552
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
 They've been known to throw rocks.

553
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,480
 Puncture marks in the neck.

554
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,480
 Obviously that makes you think of a vampire.

555
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,480
 If you got attacked by a Bigfoot, I don't think there's much left of you.

556
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,480
 I think a Bigfoot attack would be similar to a gorilla attack.

557
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,480
 You're lucky if you keep your genitals in your face.

558
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
 That's the first thing they would go for.

559
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
 Just as an ape-like species.

560
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
 Now Bigfoot is me Bigfoot.

561
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
 Me not want to grab genitals.

562
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,480
 But in a fight response, as a human when we fight, we go to disable generally.

563
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
 We're punching for the face.

564
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
 We're punching for the head.

565
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,480
 And if it's really bad, you're punching for the neck.

566
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,480
 But I mean, if you're in a real, real bad fight, you're going to grab the genitals.

567
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
 You're going to go and put out an eye.

568
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,480
 Like if it's death, if you lose this fight, you're going to die.

569
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
 You're going to try to do some real damage to them.

570
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
 Grab the balls and twist.

571
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
 Apes, that is their default thing.

572
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
 Apes aren't going to stand up and box you, right?

573
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
 They're just going to start ripping you apart.

574
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
 Ripping humans apart.

575
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
 They rip off your face.

576
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
 They pull off your genitals.

577
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,480
 You think a Bigfoot would at least have some of those instincts as well.

578
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,480
 If there's one attack you, you can literally just pull limbs off.

579
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,480
 But whatever case you do, definitely don't think of it being a stealth attack.

580
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
 An attack with no damage to the body.

581
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
 Those stories that I told where they found the people in the American Southwest,

582
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
 they were horribly mutilated.

583
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,480
 Horribly mutilated bodies that they were finding in the brush.

584
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,480
 Nothing like, it looked like Lestat took him in the night.

585
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,480
 Looks like his last moments were about terror and ecstasy.

586
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
 No, their fangs were broken.

587
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,480
 They were being killed supposedly by Bigfoot.

588
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
 So these don't really seem like Bigfoot attacks.

589
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,480
 So I have a hypothesis, and I think this might be going out there,

590
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,480
 but we've covered a lot of weird Bigfoot stuff.

591
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
 Let's put this into another perspective.

592
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,480
 Bigfoot was not the adversary in this story.

593
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
 Despite the fact that he was being hunted.

594
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
 Despite the fact that he was shot.

595
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,480
 "Ugh, me only want to save family, but will it wound through liver and make that difficult?"

596
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
 "Ugh!"

597
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
 Wandering through the woods.

598
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,480
 What if it was there to protect that family from a vampire?

599
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 He didn't escalate it when he shot Bigfoot.

600
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,480
 He didn't escalate it so that Bigfoot came back to kill his family.

601
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,480
 The fact that he shot Bigfoot made it impossible for him to save Omusha's son.

602
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,480
 Far-fetched, absolutely, right?

603
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
 Absolutely far-fetched.

604
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,480
 But it actually, if the story is true, right?

605
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
 It could totally be made up.

606
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,480
 If the story is true, it most likely is made up.

607
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:38,480
 But if the story is true, these definitely aren't the hallmarks of a Bigfoot kill.

608
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,480
 Or an ape kill, or the kill of someone who's eight feet tall and 800 pounds.

609
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,480
 It's the attack pattern of a vampire.

610
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,480
 If you get killed in your sleep, you don't go, "Michael Myers must have done it."

611
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,480
 Like, you have certain rules with this stuff.

612
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,480
 What if there was a vampire watching over that hurt?

613
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,480
 And actually, a vampire wouldn't make sense as well, because it could feed off the sheep.

614
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
 That's why it would be in a pasture area to begin with.

615
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
 Remember, none of these people were seen to be killed.

616
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,480
 The bodies were discovered the next day, as if the attacks took place at night.

617
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,480
 Bigfoot's not there killing these people.

618
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,480
 Bigfoot's trying to save this group of shepherds from this vampire.

619
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
 And it failed, because it was being hunted.

620
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
 It was being pursued.

621
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,480
 Interesting story, interesting piece of the lore, because it would actually add another wrinkle to the story of Bigfoot.

622
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,480
 The reason why Bigfoot is always out there, always hidden, isn't trying to hide from us.

623
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,480
 But it's trying to sneak up on the things that are actually trying to take us out.

624
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,480
 It would add a whole other layer to the idea of high strangeness.

625
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,480
 That's where we usually see Bigfoot in UFO and ghosts and stuff like that.

626
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,480
 Generally, in a similar area, where you see one, you tend to see the other.

627
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,480
 It's possible that Bigfoot is there to protect us from those other crazy things.

628
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
 He's not a furry foe.

629
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
 He's not an elusive enemy.

630
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
 He's a protector.

631
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,480
 But we treat him as something that we can either hunt, chase, capture, or kill.

632
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,480
 When we should just be in like, "You do you, because I know you got my back."

633
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,480
 Do we have an ally in the war against darkness?

634
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,480
 And is that ally our eight-foot friend?

635
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
 The Sasquatch.

636
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
 It would make sense why he's seeing all over the world.

637
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,480
 It would make sense why he's so powerful.

638
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,480
 There's no way a vampire could bite through a Bigfoot's neck.

639
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
 I can't believe I said that sentence out loud.

640
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,480
 But you know what I mean? It would be built for combat.

641
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,480
 Plus, it would have the skills of disappearing on command, of being incredibly elusive.

642
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,480
 It does fly Bigfoot's head inside and flying UFOs as well.

643
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,480
 The world of the weird, a lot of times we try to contain it by going, "This is a ghost sighting.

644
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
 This is UFO sighting. This is a Bigfoot sighting."

645
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
 It may all be connected.

646
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
 And there may be battle lines drawn.

647
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,480
 Bigfoot may be on our side.

648
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,480
 At the end of the day, it may come down between humanity and Bigfoot,

649
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
 versus the forces of evil.

650
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,480
 The demons and the darkness and the plagues of humanity.

651
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,480
 We'll be standing there side by side with our furry friend.

652
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,480
 But if we keep hunting him, if we keep pursuing him,

653
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,480
 he may not be there when we need him the most.

654
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,480
 He may not be there as those fangs dig into our neck.

655
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:37,480
 The Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

656
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

657
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,480
 I'm glad you listen to it today. Have a great one, guys.

658
