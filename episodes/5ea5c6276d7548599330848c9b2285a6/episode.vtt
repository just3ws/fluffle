00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.560
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.160
 - A voyeur is checking out a woman on a beach,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.800
 and then the unthinkable happens.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.160
 And then we take a look at the story of Gary Wilcox,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.160
 a 27-year-old farmer tending his plot of land in 1964,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 Newark Valley.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.480
 What started off as a normal work day,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.600
 turned into an interesting case of interplanetary trade

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.120
 today on Dead Reborating.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.880
 - I don't wanna sleep down.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880
 Actually, I'm a walk-in-down.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.200
 - Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.280
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.200
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.960
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.880
 We're gonna go ahead and get started with this.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.440
 Jump right into it.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.400
 Both feet down the whole of story.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.240
 I don't know where I'm going with that.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.640
 Anyways, anyways.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.120
 The year is 1995.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.320
 It's August 26th.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.960
 It is a hot day in Newburg Beach, Kentucky.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.600
 A perfect day to go sunbathing.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.600
 And on this day, there is a man watching a woman

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.640
 with a telescope.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.960
 So he's quite a ways away.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.440
 His motives may seem a little weird.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.160
 Well, okay, let's call Spade a Spade.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.120
 It's definitely not something you should be doing.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.120
 There's a dude with a telescope

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.160
 watching this woman sunbathing.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.200
 Doesn't know the woman, never met her before in her life.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.320
 Just sees an attractive woman

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.840
 catching some rays on the sand from the sun.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.640
 Okay, you're so set in the mood.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.920
 Seagulls flying around, crabs.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.080
 Those are the little, you're not typing.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.800
 Those are the little, what are those like claws?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.640
 A little claws.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.480
 And Heather Teague is sunbathing.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.760
 Just another young woman looking for a tan.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.600
 Oh, you get it.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.240
 It's been set up, okay.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.880
 A man sitting there in his house on his patio

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.080
 with his telescope watching this hot young woman

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.840
 catch rays, okay.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.720
 I don't know why, the scene is set up.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.520
 The scene is set up.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.880
 The sun was setting, no, I'm just joking.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.280
 Okay, but he's watching her with a telescope

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.480
 and then he sees come out of the bushes.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.880
 So the beach, I guess I should have built the scene up

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.720
 some more.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.120
 There's the beach, right?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.160
 And then on one side of the beach is the water.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.520
 How beaches normally work.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.880
 And on the other side of the beach is like a forested area.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.040
 And this dude, this unnamed dude,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.120
 his name is not reported in any of these stories.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.080
 And this is a true story.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.800
 This involves the cops very, very quickly.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.680
 This guy's watching this woman through his telescope

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.080
 and he sees the kind of the brushes start to rustle.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.720
 And he notices a man walk out of the forest behind her.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.440
 Now that wouldn't be anything too suspicious

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.000
 because it's a public beach.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.120
 You don't get suspicious every time someone walks

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.960
 into a public beach.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.520
 You're like, oh no, a couple of cops.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.720
 People every time a car parks, you're like, oh no.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.160
 You see someone come out of the forest

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.480
 coming onto the beach.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.840
 Not super suspicious.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.400
 This guy though, was had no shirt on.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.880
 Again, that's not a red flag.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.600
 It's not a red flag for a beach.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.520
 He's wearing jeans, but he was also wearing

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.760
 a mosquito net over his face and a wig.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.440
 And the guy in the telescopes watching this

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.320
 and now he's really suspicious.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.800
 'Cause he's like, what in the world?

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.840
 And he watches, now he has his telescope on this guy.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.280
 He just walks down the beach very calmly,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.840
 walks up behind Heather, pulls a gun out,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.080
 grabs her by the hair, drags her off into the woods.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.440
 Now this isn't, I actually had a story idea

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.920
 similar to this real life event.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.920
 Because what happened, my story idea was this.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.040
 A guy was breaking into women's houses

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.000
 to videotape them while they were sleeping

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.480
 'cause he's a voyeur.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.400
 And he breaks into one woman's house.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.240
 And that's all he does.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.560
 He just videotapes them while they're sleeping.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.120
 And he breaks into one woman's house.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.480
 And while he's videotaping her while she's sleeping,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.920
 he sees this demonic figure crawl up

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.320
 on the other side of the bed and he runs away.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.720
 And the next day, the woman is found murdered.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.480
 Now he has a dilemma because he's a criminal.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.800
 He's committing a criminal act.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.080
 But then he saw something and plus,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.440
 since he had broken to her apartment,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.560
 he's kind of a suspect.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.000
 They're looking for his fingerprints.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.120
 Like they have his fingerprints and stuff like that.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.000
 But he's trying to convince this other girl

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.640
 that he also did this to, 'cause he doesn't stop doing it.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.400
 He still keeps breaking into women's rooms,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.960
 trying to convince her that she's also in trouble

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960
 'cause he also saw the demon.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.200
 So in her room.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.240
 So it's one of those things where he had a problem

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.960
 and his problem led him to discovering a worse problem.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.200
 And then it just kind of goes on from there.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.200
 So the dilemma is if you're a criminal,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.560
 if you're committing a criminal act

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.240
 and in the commission of a criminal act,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.120
 do you see a worse criminal act?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.360
 How do you go about reporting that?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.840
 This guy, he could probably say,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.840
 "Hey, I was just looking at the beach with my telescope.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.760
 I wasn't peeping.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.200
 I wasn't doing anything inappropriate.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.640
 Both hands are on the telescope."

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.400
 And the officer is probably like, "What, everybody?

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.760
 Like we just want to know what this suspect looked like."

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.900
 Because she went missing, completely missing.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.720
 And what was interesting,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.000
 again, this took place back in 1995.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.680
 This crime gets spotted

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.040
 'cause you have a peeping tom with a telescope

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.120
 and the police start searching the area.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.880
 They end up finding out that another guy

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.940
 was videotaping crop vandalism.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.760
 He was having problems with crop vandalism,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.840
 which I think might actually be a code word

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.960
 for crop circles.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.040
 He's getting straight up signs aliens walking around.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.880
 But he was videotaping the area for crop vandalism.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.360
 Actually, he was probably just videotaping sunbathers,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.880
 but that was his excuse.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.340
 But he caught footage of a car parked next to Heather's car.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.160
 And the cop said, "Listen, that's a long shot,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.480
 but we'll start looking into that."

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.480
 They started looking for that car

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.320
 that was parked next to Heather's car

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.640
 that day on the beach.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.320
 They end up pulling this man over

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.960
 who had a matching car.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.440
 It was a routine traffic stop.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.560
 His name was Marvin Dill.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.560
 Marvin Dill.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.200
 And when they start searching his car,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.040
 routine traffic stop,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.320
 but they were, they did have,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.600
 were keeping a lookout for this red on white Ford Bronco.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.640
 They find two guns, two knives, duct tape,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.360
 rubber gloves, rope,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.400
 and they found some hair that looked like Heather's.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.440
 So they go, "Okay, this might be our guy.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.760
 "They actually end up letting him go

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.560
 "because they don't have enough to hold him."

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.960
 And then when they go back to his house,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.440
 he tells his wife, he sees the cops walking to the driveway

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.840
 and he tells his wife, "Hey, why don't you leave me alone

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.280
 "for a while and I got some business to take care of."

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.400
 And he shot himself.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.920
 And that was it.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.760
 That's it.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.440
 No one's ever found Heather's body.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.760
 No one has ever found who did it.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.460
 It was, you know, most likely Marvin Dill, but.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.920
 Weird story, but I think the most interesting part of it is

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.760
 how when you are in the commission of a crime,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.600
 how can you, I shouldn't be so harsh

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.640
 on the guy with the telescope.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.000
 He might not have been as perverted

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.240
 as I'm making him out to be.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.920
 He may have been an upstanding citizen

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.680
 who just wanted to see what the soil of a beach

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.120
 looked like with the telescope.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.460
 But the point of the matter is at a certain point,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.600
 he had to make a phone call and say,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.040
 "Hey, officer, I was watching the beach.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.280
 "I had my telescope on backwards.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.160
 "I was trying to look at boats, but I don't know how to use it.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.720
 "It was my first day and I saw this horrible adduction."

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.040
 And it's also interesting to think because you would think

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.680
 if something bad was happening to you,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.560
 if someone could like, if you were being assaulted

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.120
 or something you would hope that someone was watching,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.440
 someone could intervene.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.560
 And nowadays that's pretty much the case.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.200
 You're surrounded by video cameras pretty much everywhere.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.800
 But even when someone's watching the action live,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.680
 you may still disappear off the face of the earth.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.800
 Someone's looking at a crime committed against you

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.760
 and you get dragged off into the woods

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.560
 and never seen again.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.640
 It's just weird because you think that

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.080
 as long as someone can see me,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.880
 as long as someone can see me, maybe I can get help,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.080
 but you can still disappear off the face of the planet

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.480
 while someone is watching you through a telescope.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.160
 Disappearing in the middle of the woods,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.920
 that's one thing, disappearing on a lonely trail is one thing.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.220
 But disappearing in full view of somebody

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.140
 is quite, quite chilling.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.900
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.940
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.820
 Now our next story is an interesting one.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.020
 It's one that is actually dismissed

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.700
 for the most part in UFOology.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.060
 So one of those stories that has some of the similarities

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.900
 of what you hear from a UFO story,

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.900
 but it's not very widely talked about,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.060
 it's kind of considered a hoax.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.340
 And I'll tell you why.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.980
 I'll tell you why it's considered a hoax.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.420
 I have some mixed feelings about it,

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.580
 but I don't think it's the out and out hoax

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.220
 that mainstream UFOology says it is.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.420
 Maybe I'm just being a contrarian.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.820
 Let's go ahead and dig into the story of Gary Wilcox.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.080
 The year is 1964.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.180
 We're leaving Kentucky, we're leaving the beach,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.860
 we're leaving the sunny sunny beaches

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.420
 for the sunny sunny farms of New York City.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.300
 There are farms in New York, well, the farms,

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.220
 sorry, not New York City, New York State.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.980
 We're in Newark Valley, that's the place we're at.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.820
 It's 1964, it's April 24th,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.660
 it's 10 a.m. in the morning

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.780
 and Gary Wilcox is driving his tractor

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.100
 (imitates engine revving)

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.540
 around his farm.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.900
 He actually has it attached to a manure spreader,

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.260
 so it's just like (imitates engine revving)

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.740
 just shoot manure out everywhere, not everywhere.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.380
 It shoots it out in organized columns

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.900
 to help the crops grow.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.900
 It's not like going on the neighbors.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.400
 Dennis the Menace didn't invent it,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.740
 but he has this manure spreader hooked to his tractor,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.100
 he's driving around his property, spread a manure.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.380
 And he sees off in the distance a shiny metallic object.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.660
 It's quite big, 20 feet long, four feet high,

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.020
 15 feet wide, it looked like a, just a big object.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.700
 And it firstly thinks, is that a fuel tank?

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.620
 Like, or did a plane land in my field?

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.060
 Like, he couldn't really make out what it was.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.660
 So he drives over his manure spreading tractor

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.900
 over to this object.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.380
 (imitates engine revving)

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.140
 Pulls up, doesn't skid,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.860
 there's nothing to skid on, it's dirt.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.780
 He hops out and he notices that it's not a fuel tank,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.220
 it's not a airplane, it's something he's never seen before.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.380
 He said that it looked like a metallic egg,

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.060
 a shiny aluminum colored metallic egg,

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.260
 with no rivets, no seams in it, just one thing.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.220
 Now that's a very common in UFOology.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.100
 It's funny that because Earth technology

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.740
 is even our most advanced stuff,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.340
 like you can see seams in it,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.300
 there are, here's where the pieces of metal

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.140
 have to fit together, it always,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.820
 people always note when they discover this alien technology

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.160
 that it seems like it's just one piece of metal.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.860
 Which I personally don't find that,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.340
 I don't find that impressive.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.980
 Like maybe it's because I'm not like a metal worker man,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.940
 but the fact that something's made out of one thing of metal,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.100
 I would, that wouldn't be what shocked me.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.660
 What would shock me, I wouldn't really look into that detail,

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.460
 it was hovering, it was hovering off the ground.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.580
 That would be my first giveaway that it was a UFO,

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.360
 not that I couldn't see any rivets.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.460
 I will say this though, Gary,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.220
 27 year old Gary Wilcox did something

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.180
 that I have not seen in any of my UFO stories

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.180
 that I've been doing for this show,

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.900
 or really any that I've read ever.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.340
 He sees a ship, it's hovering slightly off the ground,

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.460
 he notices there's no rivets, there's no seams,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.460
 it's this perfectly molded piece of metal.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.500
 It's most likely from either another planet

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.720
 or the dimension, something like that.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.860
 It is not of this world,

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.900
 and Gary Wilcox walks up to it and kicks it.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.300
 Which is something that I think a farmer would do,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.260
 but I think, I've never read that before.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.060
 I've never read someone seeing a UFO

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.940
 and walking up and giving it a good kick.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.540
 Like it was a tractor tire,

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.580
 like he was trying to figure out

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.900
 what the air pressure was in it.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.500
 He kicks the ship, and that causes two aliens

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.580
 to come out of it.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.020
 So now you're like, oh, this is dope.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.580
 Like imagine if you were walking through the city

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.780
 and you saw a nice car and you're like, that's weird.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.940
 Never seen this make a model of a car, it has no seams.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.540
 And you just kick the side of the car

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.440
 and a bunch of metallic gangbangers crawl out of it.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.940
 That's where I thought this story was going, but no.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.780
 Something weirder happens than that.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.540
 So these two aliens hop out

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.660
 and they're described as four feet tall.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.220
 So that's kind of the size of a gray alien.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.020
 But he said they were covered in head to toe metal.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:43.980
 They weren't robots.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.100
 He never classified them as robots.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.340
 But he said from foot to head, they were wearing a space suit.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.780
 I couldn't see their faces.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.340
 They just looked like these people

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.900
 who were wrapped in aluminum foil, soft aluminum foil.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.260
 Very shiny metal people, but not metal.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.380
 Like there he assumes that there were aliens

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.780
 inside these suits.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.100
 They hop out of the UFO

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.340
 and they're carrying a tray of material.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.100
 Space material, you ask?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.620
 No, actually.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.100
 On this tray, I wouldn't recognize these things

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.020
 when maybe the last four, but the first one,

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.540
 the aliens jump out of the UFO.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.860
 They're holding a tray that has alfalfa on it.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.900
 I wouldn't know that if I was eating it.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.500
 It also had roots, soil, leaves and brush.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.220
 So it was a collection of earthly materials on this tray.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.740
 And he says we just stood there staring at each other

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.180
 for a couple of minutes.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.260
 And he was terrified.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.780
 He was absolutely terrified of what was going on.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.340
 Now these aliens are watching him

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.420
 and he's watching these aliens

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.140
 and he's looking down at the tray they're holding.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.500
 And most likely they got this stuff from his farm.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.100
 They're basically stealing stuff from his property.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.380
 He's terrified to death.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.580
 He said the first thing the aliens say to him

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.940
 on this warm April 24th,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.540
 is it warm in April in New York?

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.740
 On this regular April 24th day, 10 a.m.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.180
 Right now it's probably like 10, 10.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.540
 But anyways, the aliens look at him and they go,

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.900
 don't be alarmed.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.580
 We have spoken to people before.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.540
 And I'd be thinking,

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.700
 I don't care how many people you've spoken to.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.860
 I don't care if you do in Tony Robbins seminars.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.020
 I'm terrified.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.100
 You're right in front of me.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.220
 You guys are four feet tall.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.140
 You jumped out of a spaceship and I can't see your faces.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.100
 I don't care how many people you've talked to.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:17.980
 But for whatever reason,

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.540
 this actually calms Gary Wilcox down.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.820
 And he says, he goes, this is the weird thing.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.900
 This was an actual quote, I'll read his quote.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.140
 Their voices did not sound like a voice I could describe.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.340
 I could understand what was said,

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.860
 but cannot tell whether they were speaking English or not.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.100
 So that's kind of interesting thing.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.180
 It could be some sort of language,

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.860
 assuming any of this is real,

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.700
 but with modern translators that we use,

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.380
 you'll hear the person speak in their native language

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.820
 and then you'll hear them speak in English.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.780
 I think, I think those have been invented, right?

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.660
 Those exist, right?

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.300
 It could be also some sort of telepathy

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.100
 or something like that, which is really common with,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.180
 it's an other common theme with UFO stories.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.620
 We have the ship with no seams.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.940
 We have the possible telepathy.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.820
 They can easily communicate with us.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.580
 But then we start to get to a couple things

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.180
 that really deviate from normal,

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.380
 quote unquote, normal UFO stories.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.860
 But there's one particular fact that makes people go,

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.180
 this story is 100% a hoax or 99% a hoax.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.660
 And that's why it's not really talked about in UFOology.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.900
 He starts, the aliens start a conversation with him

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.580
 and they ask him, so what are you doing here?

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.620
 And he's like, I'm a farmer, this is my farm.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.500
 And they go, what's that thing there?

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.420
 And he goes, this, this right here,

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.760
 that's my John Deere tractor.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.660
 And they're like, oh, interesting.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.620
 What's that thing on the back?

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.460
 He's like, oh, that spreads out manure.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.920
 And the two aliens look at each other, they go,

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.180
 what is this manure you speak of?

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.780
 And he's like, oh, I mean,

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.700
 do you want the Cliff Notes version?

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.100
 You want me to really tell you what it is.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.340
 It's a big old pile of poop,

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.660
 much pile of poop mixed in with some nutrients.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.060
 And then I put it in this fancy-dancy machine

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.180
 and it just shoots it out everywhere.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.820
 Dennis the Menistyle and the aliens are like,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.100
 oh, that explains the smell.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.020
 And they discussed his job for quite a while.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.860
 They talked for a total of two hours,

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.460
 according to Gary Wilcox.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.860
 He talked to these aliens for about two hours.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.060
 Didn't get any farm work done talking to these two aliens.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.500
 And one interesting fact is that the,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.540
 usually it's the person saying, where do you come from?

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.020
 Are you here to declare war?

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.500
 Are you here to help our environment?

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.340
 Stuff like that.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.540
 The aliens were asking the human questions.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.300
 So that's one thing that you don't normally get

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.140
 in these stories.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.060
 The aliens are actually more curious about him verbally

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.380
 than he's asking them questions.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.580
 They do offer some information though.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.740
 They say, the reason why we're asking you

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.980
 all these questions about farming,

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.460
 the reason why we have this tray of stolen alfalfa,

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.100
 soil, root, stuff like that,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.980
 is because on our planet, we live on a rocky planet

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.780
 where organic substances don't really exist.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.980
 We can't grow anything on our planet.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.800
 So we're fascinated by the fact that Earth has these,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.260
 just minerals lying about,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.220
 these organic materials lying about.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.700
 So we're gonna take these back,

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.620
 run a bunch of experiments on them.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.900
 He's like, that's fascinating.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.620
 They also gave an interesting,

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.780
 this is a really, really interesting comment.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.380
 And it explains a lot about UFOs.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.980
 And again, it's a shame that the story

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.620
 isn't more widely accepted.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.580
 The aliens say, you know, we have a real problem

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.620
 with your guys' environment.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.420
 Our ships cannot operate where there's pollution,

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.740
 where there's a lot of automobiles,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.120
 where there's a lot of exhaust in the air.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.480
 Our ships can't fly.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.480
 That's why we fly in rural areas.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.520
 That's why we're mostly sighted out in farmlands.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.200
 Now, that's so interesting

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.000
 because it answers two questions.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.640
 It answers two big questions about modern UFO stories.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.280
 One, why do UFOs always sighted by country bumpkins

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.640
 in the middle of nowhere?

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.160
 Because their ships can only fly out there.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.480
 If you fly over LA city,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.840
 like the Battle of Los Angeles,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.240
 that was a hoax, it wasn't a hoax,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.520
 it was just a mass hysteria event.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.020
 It would explain why they're mostly seen in farmland areas

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.300
 is because that's where their ships are able to fly

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.660
 without any interference.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.620
 Two, and I've been harping on this forever.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.860
 It explains the idea of aliens coming down

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.580
 and telling us we gotta change the environment

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.420
 and stuff like that.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.460
 If we keep doing stuff to an environment,

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.000
 it's gonna doom us.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.340
 And we've gotten this huge wave of hippie aliens

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.620
 showing up for the past 30 years,

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.660
 talking about the ozone layer and nonsense like that.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.260
 This could be why.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.660
 It's nothing to do with the fact like,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.200
 oh no, humanity, if you keep putting carbon

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.360
 in the atmosphere, you'll die off.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.600
 It's not that, it's that their ships won't work.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.480
 If we keep polluting the planet,

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.200
 they can't keep coming down here to get our resources.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.440
 Or eventually, if they ever do decide to do

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.240
 like a full scale colonization invasion,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.560
 if their ships can't fly,

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.760
 there's gonna be a very short term invasion.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.120
 So it answers those two questions,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.720
 why they're always seen in middle of nowhere,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.820
 why aliens would care anything for our environment at all.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.140
 'Cause if you can build a spaceship to fly around,

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.940
 you could easily build artificial environments,

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.580
 Dyson spheres, whatever.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.420
 If you can build a spaceship,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.380
 you can build a desalination plant.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.020
 If you can build a spaceship

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.120
 that can bend the rules of the universe,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.940
 you could easily go, oh, here's this two by two box

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.100
 that you press it, it cleans your atmosphere.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.700
 But if their ships can't even get here

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.140
 because the pollution gets so bad,

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.900
 that makes more sense.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.180
 So it answers those two questions,

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.760
 but eventually he goes, hey, can I hit your ride

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.760
 with you guys?

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.880
 Which is, again, this kid is quite bold,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.920
 walks up, kicks a UFO,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.080
 and then asks for a ride on said UFO.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.320
 And the aliens, I mean, they've been talking for two hours,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.160
 they got to know each other, probably exchanged phone numbers,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.920
 maybe a little flirting was going on there.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.240
 But the aliens said, you know what, dude, that'd be cool.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.360
 But where we come from, the atmosphere's really, really thin,

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.520
 so you wouldn't be able to breathe.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.040
 Basically like, sure, you could come,

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.300
 hang out on our spaceship,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.380
 but once we land, you will die.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.700
 So they said they couldn't do that.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.500
 And they went on and on, and then he finally said at the end,

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.100
 he goes, hey, you know what,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.900
 you guys are really interested in manure, right?

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.900
 And they're like, oh, that's a nice way

00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.940
 to wrap up this conversation.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.980
 Yes, we are interested in your earth manure.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.660
 He goes, I can go get you a bag.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.220
 I can get you a bag of manure.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.100
 Give it to you, you take it back to your spaceship.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.100
 And the aliens go, (sighs)

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:11.940
 we don't have time.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.780
 Like, if you, by the time you get back to your farmhouse

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.500
 and get back here, 'cause it was like a 300 acre farm,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.920
 he goes, we gotta go, dude.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.260
 Which seems weird that they talked for two hours.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.400
 And then when he said he just needed to go get some manure,

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.440
 all of a sudden they had to leave.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.960
 Which, to be fair, if I was hanging out at someone's house

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.000
 and I was having a good time, we were talking,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.840
 and then he goes, hey, man,

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.200
 you wanna take some manure home with you?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.320
 I would be like, it's time to go.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.080
 But anyway, so the aliens get in their ship and it goes,

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.280
 oh, oh, actually, they get back off the ship.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.640
 They gotta deliver one more message.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.320
 They jump off the ship and they say,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.920
 hey, we're gonna tell you something.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.200
 We're gonna tell you something.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.080
 John Glenn, you know astronaut John Glenn and Gary,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.820
 he's like, yeah, yeah, totally, totally no.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.280
 They're like, okay, that was weird.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.660
 You know John Glenn?

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.140
 There's also an astronaut name, Virgil Grissom.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.520
 He's a U.S. astronaut and Gary Wilcox,

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.780
 yeah, I kinda know him.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.220
 And then they said two Russian astronauts.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.220
 They don't say the names in the reports, but,

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.980
 so John Glenn, Virgil Grissom and two Russian astronauts,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.020
 the aliens say they're going to die within a year

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.180
 due to exposure from, quote, the elements of space.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.400
 And then they get back on their spaceship

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.160
 and Gary Wilcox is like, oh, that was creepy.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.200
 And the ship goes, (whooshing)

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.760
 it just disappears, flies off so fast, you can't see it.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.520
 Now, Gary has just wasted two hours,

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.200
 I guess it's not a waste to have interstellar communication,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.480
 but Gary has spent two hours of his day

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.840
 in the middle of the field talking to either aliens

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.840
 or figments of his imagination.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.280
 But he says, you know what?

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.300
 I'm gonna get them that bag of fertilizer.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.920
 So he goes back to his farmhouse.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.620
 He actually continues to do his duties.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.500
 He ends up loading a 75 pound bag of manure,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.560
 drives it back to the spot where the spaceship landed,

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.620
 and throws it down and goes home.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.260
 And he says the next day that bag of manure was gone.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.540
 Dun, dun, dun.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.500
 Now, the reason why we know about this

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.580
 is because he did call the police afterwards.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.500
 He said, wait, which is, it's funny

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.820
 because who would you call?

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.160
 Like, it definitely, you would think,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.000
 well, that was kind of cool,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.240
 hung out with some dope aliens,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.340
 you know, talking about alfalfa and manure for a while.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.840
 She told me a couple astronauts were gonna die.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.980
 That might be a national security problem.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.960
 But you also figure, at the end of the day,

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.180
 it would be the same thing if any foreign government

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.280
 just happened to land in your yard,

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.140
 talk to you for a while.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.620
 Eventually you would probably wanna alert the authorities.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.780
 He alerted the authorities,

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.860
 then it got, then the UFO community got wind of it.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.720
 And apparently he was offered a bunch of money

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.460
 for exclusive rights to his story and he turned it down.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.480
 So people have said he probably wasn't

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.960
 a financial motive in this.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.560
 But the reason why, let me talk about the prophecy

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.440
 here real quick, 'cause that's not why UFOologists

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.040
 disregard this story.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.180
 So let's look at that prophecy.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.760
 This story took place in 1964.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.980
 The aliens said within a year,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.200
 John Glenn, Virgil Grissom,

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.940
 and two Russian astronauts were going to die

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.920
 due to exposure from space.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.080
 Within three years, John Glenn didn't die then.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.640
 John Glenn was still around.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.820
 But within three years, Virgil died in a Apollo.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.780
 I think it was the, it was some Apollo mission

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.420
 where the capsule burnt up.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.380
 Him and two other American astronauts

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.660
 were cooked to a crisp in this reentry capsule.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.720
 Or maybe it was on launch.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.080
 But anyways, they died.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.580
 And then there was a Russian astronaut

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.960
 named Vladimir, of course.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.340
 He died in 1967.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.240
 He died on the exact date, April 24th, 1967,

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.300
 three years to the day.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.420
 Now, so their prophecy was not true.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.260
 Which if we want to be skeptical

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.580
 and say none of it was true, then of course.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.500
 That was just statistical.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.620
 That people in a high risk business

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.900
 were going to die doing that.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.580
 So you could just write that off.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.180
 I would say if you believe this story,

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.060
 the reason why the prophecy could be wrong,

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.300
 and I don't really know if it's a prophecy

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.140
 as much as a warning,

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:58.160
 but it could be wrong because our space suit technology

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.420
 at this stage in development

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.700
 was better than that alien's race.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.300
 So when they first started shooting people off

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.020
 to their moons, they were dying of exposure to space.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.740
 But we had a better system, so we weren't dying

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.260
 because of all those elements up there.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.780
 If we're assuming the story is true,

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.180
 that is a way to work around the prophecy.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.420
 So if it's a hoax,

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.060
 you should never include prophecies in your hoaxes ever.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.540
 Unless it's a thousand years from now.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.540
 If you're ever planning on pulling a hoax,

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.420
 if you're ever planning on having a vision

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.900
 or something like that, never set a date.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.740
 Never set a date.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.620
 It'll always backfire.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.380
 Even if you think it's 100%.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.740
 But that's not the false warning,

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.660
 the warning that turned out not to be true,

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.980
 is not the reason why UFOologists don't believe this,

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.620
 because people still believe in no dramas,

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.900
 even though his dates constantly change.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.260
 There's a particular fact that I left out of this story.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.420
 So let's say you were listening to the story this whole time

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.860
 and you thought, this is fascinating.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.020
 And I do think it's fascinating,

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.620
 even with this particular fact.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.180
 But I'm telling you this story,

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.220
 I left out a key detail.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.060
 And it's the reason why UFOologists

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.900
 don't believe a story.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.460
 And it is the dumbest reason to not believe this story.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.540
 The aliens said that they come from a planet

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.960
 where organic matter doesn't grow.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.100
 They come from a planet with a thin atmosphere.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.420
 They come from a rocky planet.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.660
 And they told Gary Wilcox the name of that planet.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.660
 That planet's name is Mars.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:28.020
 Because the story takes place on the planet closest to us.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.740
 It has pretty much been dismissed by modern UFOologists.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.560
 Because they say, well, there are no aliens on Mars.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.380
 If he had said they came from the global globs system,

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.820
 if he had said they had come from nine planets

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.700
 beyond the eighth veil,

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.540
 this story would be more entrenched in the lore.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.100
 The first documented case of voluntarily trading

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.720
 with an alien species.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.860
 Well, they didn't give us anything,

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.940
 but we gave them earthly materials.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.340
 This would have been one of those stories that went around.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.180
 But because he named it as Mars,

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.300
 and people go, well, there are no aliens on Mars,

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.340
 it's impossible.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.820
 It gets brushed to the side.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.100
 And I find that fascinating because one,

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.940
 if you believe in things like faster than light travel

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.600
 and the government's covering up,

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.140
 why wouldn't you believe the government

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.840
 is covering up life on Mars?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.100
 If you look at Mars and say that's a dead planet,

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.220
 you could say, well, maybe there's aliens

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.060
 in the middle of it.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.540
 Maybe there's aliens in the cave system.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.040
 Because if you're gonna believe in something as,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.020
 this is just, I mean, let's just say,

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.840
 if you're gonna believe in something

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.060
 as ludicrous as aliens to begin with,

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.380
 why stop there?

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.820
 It's so bizarre to me.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.060
 I believe in aliens.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.020
 I don't think they come from other star systems.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.980
 I would find it far more likely

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.300
 that there were aliens inside a cave system in Mars

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.500
 or some other place in our solar system.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.420
 I would find that infinitesimally more,

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.480
 is that a word, infinitesimal?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.780
 I would find that far, far more likely

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.500
 than them coming from Alpha Centauri

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.680
 or the Draco Star Cluster or whatever.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.800
 That is just ridiculous.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.720
 Absolutely ridiculous.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.280
 If you're gonna expend the fuel

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.080
 to get from all the way from there to come here,

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.600
 you're not picking Alpha Alpha.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.640
 You're not picking up cows, okay?

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.480
 I don't think they come from that far away.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.320
 I've said this before.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.240
 I think they're already here.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.240
 I think they're coming from another dimension

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.520
 or they're with our local star system,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.480
 i.e. our solar system.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.760
 That just makes more sense.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:27.000
 But because the idea of aliens from Mars is such a joke

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.180
 that people just disregard it out of hand.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.900
 And his story has really been considered a hoax

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.540
 for decades because of that one word, Mars.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.520
 If aliens were gonna come from anywhere in outer space,

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.160
 they would come from someplace relatively close to us.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.500
 If they're breaking the laws of physics,

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.140
 then they're fairies and they're angels and they're whatever.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.820
 I mean, you just have to look at it realistically like that.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.460
 And to me, that actually makes it more exciting

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.160
 to think that aliens are already here.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.460
 Like they traveled here four million years ago

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.620
 and they're right underneath us

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.860
 or they're just shifting from one dimension to another

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.040
 and they can pop up anywhere.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.540
 I find that's far more intriguing

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.240
 than a space empire across the galaxy

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.320
 'cause who cares about that?

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.920
 To think that there are next door neighbors

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.880
 and they're picking our vegetables and taking them home.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.440
 I find far, far more interesting.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.620
 But modern ufology disagrees with me.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.080
 They really have, it's the same thing with bigfoot people.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.460
 They have this rigid ideology that anything,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.980
 they don't like to be contested.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.580
 It has to fit that ideology.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.700
 If he had said any other planet,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.660
 this story would be regarded in a different way.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.900
 You have to wonder how many other stories out there

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.180
 are likely stories that are intriguing,

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.400
 have these interesting little tidbits of alien life

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.440
 and the motives of why aliens do the things they do.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.560
 'Cause it's really a story,

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.120
 really explains a lot about why aliens do the things they do.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.640
 And they just get buried

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.640
 because they don't fit the dogma of the UFO community.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.760
 Researchers going over reams and reams of data

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.240
 and they come across these stories that just don't fit.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.060
 It's like a religious text.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.480
 This is what the UFO lore is.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.720
 And anything that doesn't contribute to the overall arc

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.760
 that the people, the powers that be in the UFO community

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.280
 want it to be, they get pulled out.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.600
 Like the Council of Nicaea putting the Bible together.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.460
 We do the same thing with UFOology.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.400
 This story doesn't fit the overall narrative, tear it out.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.640
 This story doesn't fit the overall narrative, tear it out.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.020
 These five do put them in,

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.520
 even though they add nothing to what we know

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.380
 about why UFOs and aliens work.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.220
 They add nothing.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.220
 They only reinforce what you want us to think about that.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.300
 UFOology has long been rumored

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.940
 to not be a collection of crackpots,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.220
 ex-military officials, politicians,

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.780
 and people gazing up at the sky.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.300
 It's long been rumored to not be controlled by those people.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.220
 The Bigfoot community, a bunch of weirdos.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.500
 The Paranormal community, a bunch of weirdos.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.820
 And I'm including myself in those groups.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.360
 With the UFOologists, there's always been a rumor

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.400
 that it is not being controlled top down

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.660
 by the weirdos with a passion

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.320
 for unidentified flying objects.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.360
 That it is being dictated by the governments of the world.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.320
 Who use weirdos?

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.640
 Who use ex-military officials?

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.000
 Who use whistleblowing politicians?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.320
 They're all part of this power structure.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.400
 You don't ever hear that.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.680
 You don't ever hear that the government

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.580
 is interfering with Bigfoot investigations.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.420
 But you often hear

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.300
 that they're interfering with UFO investigations.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:54.180
 And you'll also hear some of the top names in UFOology

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:59.020
 being named by others as disinfo agents, as shills.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.640
 As people who are put into power,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.300
 either have their books pushed more

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.700
 or their personal UFO organizations pushed more

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.700
 by an overseen body by a controlling hand.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.480
 And when that happens, and I don't know if that's true,

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.320
 I don't know if that's true.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.080
 It's just long been a rumor

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.000
 that the top weirdos, the top weirdos of the UFO community

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 are disinfo agents, the gatekeepers of UFO lore.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.760
 The most likely explanation is there is no

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.520
 rumored group controlling UFO mythology

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.280
 because there are no UFOs, that it's all optical illusions.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.160
 And what people are seeing is something

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.760
 but they're not aliens from another planet

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.120
 or another dimension or anything like that.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.540
 It's another phenomenon.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.640
 That's the most skeptical, rational answer.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.080
 But to people who see UFOs and people have seen aliens

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.980
 and things like that, that answer doesn't wash.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.840
 And then we have people like Gary Wilcox.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.560
 People who tell their story and it becomes a hoax.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.320
 It becomes a joke.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.000
 It becomes disregarded because everyone knows

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.760
 there are no aliens on Mars.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.160
 If it was a hoax, it was a very costly one

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.000
 for Gary Wilcox.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.320
 His farm ended up going out of business

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.240
 because the large stretches of land

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.240
 would no longer grow vegetables.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.080
 He also had to get treated reportedly, reportedly.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.560
 He also had to get treated for radiation burns

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.880
 because of his close contact to whatever it was

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.000
 that was out in his field that day.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.240
 In the end though, he did leave the farm

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.520
 and became an accomplished mechanic.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.280
 And there's been rumors that his mechanical abilities

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.880
 were given to him by his contact with the aliens.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.960
 I don't know if that's true.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.200
 He may have always been a gifted mechanic.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.880
 But his story ends on a high note.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.400
 Yes, he did have the radiation burns

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.780
 and yes, his business had failed,

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.980
 but he did much better in his later years.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.980
 But his story didn't.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.320
 While his personal life may have had a happy ending,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:11.320
 his story has been relegated to be in another joke,

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.960
 another little hoax.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.880
 And it's time to move on and look towards

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.560
 the quote unquote, legitimate alien stories.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.740
 The stories that match the narrative

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.500
 that somebody wants us to believe.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:30.420
 The saying never was, I want to believe.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:36.040
 The saying actually is, I will tell you what to believe.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.560
 And you will believe nothing else.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.520
