 British Swim School, make us flash.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.260
 A massive manhunt ending in a violent standoff

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 in the state of Washington,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.220
 forces us all to ask the question,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.720
 what exactly is the media covering up?

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.660
 And then we end our haunted Halloween spooktobular

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.220
 with one of the craziest ghost stories yet.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.420
 Is it possible that a family was haunted

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.580
 by the Virgin Mary?

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.040
 (upbeat music)

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.260
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.140
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.340
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.380
 or I'm your ghost, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.460
 However, I never thought of that joke before.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.180
 How does that never pop to my head?

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.020
 I'm your ghost, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.980
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.580
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.500
 It's the end of our Halloween spooktobular spectacular

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.460
 October, whatever I called it.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.900
 Today is the end of that.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.900
 I hope you guys all have a nice night

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.860
 tricking and or treating.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.820
 But someone who has a nice night, no matter what month

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.500
 it is walking into Dead Rabbit Command

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.620
 is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.100
 Everyone give it up for Medusa Buzzcutt.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.620
 Woo hoo, yeah, come on in,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.140
 slithering on into Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.220
 Long time supporter of the show,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.700
 Medusa Buzzcutt's been around for a long time.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.180
 Medusa, you're gonna be our captain,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.380
 our pilot this episode.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.780
 If you guys can't support the Patreon,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.980
 I totally understand that you do.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.340
 Just help spread the word about the show.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.740
 You have no idea how much that helps out.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.300
 If you find any value in this show,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.940
 make sure the world knows about Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.540
 Medusa, let's go ahead.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.060
 I'm gonna touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.420
 catch him in your little snaky hairs.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.740
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.500
 that drive us all the way out.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.020
 To Stevens County, Washington.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.260
 (imitates gun shot)

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.340
 Couple miles north, actually think it's a couple hundred

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.620
 miles north from Dead Rabbit Command,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.540
 but we're now headed up to Stevens County

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.420
 and I gotta give a shout out to Patreon supporter

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.540
 Thomas the Dink Engine.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.380
 Thomas sent me this story, really, really appreciate it.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.220
 This is a weird one.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.140
 This is kind of a weird one.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.420
 I don't know what it means, if anything.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.660
 October 12th, 2022 is when this story takes place.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.580
 We're in Stevens County, we're nearby Loon Lake.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.180
 That's exactly what it sounds like.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.660
 It's a body of water surrounded by land.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.980
 I don't know the population of loons in the area.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.660
 Maybe it's just shaped like a loon.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.940
 Maybe it was discovered by Charles Loon, who knows.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.820
 But anyways, Loon Lake up in Washington,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.860
 nearby Stevens County.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.300
 We're gonna meet a man named Jeffrey Smith.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300
 Jeffrey Smith is 54 years old

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.500
 and he's running through the woods near Loon Lake.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.740
 He's not jogging, he's not out there for his health.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.540
 Well, he's trying not to die.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.580
 So I guess that would be considered there for your health.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.940
 He's running through the woods.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.940
 He has a pistol in one hand, he has body armor

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.140
 and he's running through the woods.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.340
 Above him, he hairs a police drone.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.500
 (buzzing)

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.500
 It's flying high above the tree lines.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.140
 Jeffrey Smith is wanted by the police

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.140
 because just a few hours earlier,

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.140
 he showed up at this dude's house and tried to kill him.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.460
 Fired a gun right at the guy and then got in his car

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.740
 and drove away and the police are after this dude.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.900
 He drives over to Loon Lake, starts running through the woods.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.540
 Now, when I say the police is after this dude,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.140
 this is a huge manhunt.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.340
 We have all these officers chasing him in the cars

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.020
 and then they stop, they don't go into the woods after him

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.620
 'cause you know, who knows where he's at.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.180
 They also call in the SWAT team.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.700
 Special weapons and tactics is here as well.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.140
 So they are fully prepared to face down

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.180
 this single dude with a pistol.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.220
 As the police are there, as the police and the SWAT

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.640
 and all these officers are there,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.900
 they begin to announce over loudspeakers,

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.100
 maybe even over the drone.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.100
 I wonder if the drone has a little speaker on it,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.700
 but they're saying, give yourself up, turn yourself in.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.340
 Please, we don't wanna hurt you.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.580
 The drone then detects,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.820
 Jeffrey Smith does fire a couple shots

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.780
 at the police officers.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.740
 They're like, ah, get down, get down.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.660
 And then the drone does detect

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.460
 Jeffrey Smith walking towards the police.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.840
 And when the drone operator says he's headed our way,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.020
 two police officers, I believe they were specifically

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.100
 SWAT officers, but two officers open fire

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.180
 and they kill Jeffrey at Loon Lake.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:29.420
 This is an interesting story, not for what happened.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.740
 Unfortunately, we do have these types of incidents happen

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.420
 all over the world.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.660
 Right?

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.260
 We have people go from zero to 60,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.420
 like they just seem to be totally fine

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.660
 and then they just open fire on some random person,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.540
 whether it's their workplace,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.660
 someone walking down the street.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.820
 We see these types of things.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.260
 Sometimes it's a setup to do suicide by cop.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.660
 They're trying to get a bunch of cops there

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.460
 so the cops can kill them and they can die

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.340
 without having to take their own life.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.140
 This isn't an unusual story, unfortunately.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.420
 You'll find several articles detailing what I just told you,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.340
 but that's not the whole story.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.100
 Thomas the Dink Engine works at,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.820
 he said he worked at a dispensary.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.180
 So I, the only dispensary I can think of

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.820
 is a medical marijuana dispensary.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.420
 Maybe there are other things.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.320
 Maybe other people pronouncing correctly.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.740
 I'm sure they do.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.980
 But he works at a dispensary and he said that,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.060
 one day he's sitting there, he's selling,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.700
 I'm just gonna assume he's selling weed,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.900
 he could be selling balls and yarn or whatever,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.420
 but he's sitting there, he's slaying that green stuff

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.420
 and a woman walks in and she was totally distraught.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.060
 He could tell that there was something wrong with her.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.780
 And she tells Thomas, this is the worst thing

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.620
 that could have ever happened.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.620
 My fiance was just shot and killed by SWAT.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.700
 Thomas like, what in the world are you talking about?

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.700
 She says, listen, my fiance went to go kill a pedophile

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:18.300
 and the police chased him and they killed him in the woods.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:26.500
 Now, none of that was mentioned in news articles.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.580
 The news articles, the news as I presented it to you,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.740
 those are articles written October 19th, October 20th,

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.500
 you know, like more recent articles.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.860
 And I, thank you, Thomas, for sending this over.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.340
 I go, this is really interesting.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.980
 None of these articles are stating why he did it.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.500
 They just said he went to this house,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.940
 he shot at a person and drove away.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.180
 And police, this massive police force chased him

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.020
 into the woods and killed him.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.180
 And I had to look for, like a lot of the articles,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.620
 they weren't even mentioning the name of the victim at all.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.540
 They weren't mentioning the name of the suspect,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.180
 but you understand like in the original,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.900
 like first couple articles that are coming out

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.700
 October 12th, October 13th,

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.660
 maybe they don't have that information.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.900
 But I'm looking around and reading these articles.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.620
 Most of the articles that I was reading

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.980
 was from a local newspaper called spokesman.com

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.380
 is like the Spokane spokesman.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.180
 I'm looking for all this stuff.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.300
 And I'm also looking at news websites as well, like KXLY.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.780
 And they're telling the story that a guy shot at somebody

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.820
 seemingly randomly, got chased into the woods

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.420
 and was executed when I found out the name,

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.340
 when I found out the suspect's name, Jeffrey Smith.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.860
 I start looking for mentions of his name, right?

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.300
 And I'm still pulling up these articles.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.340
 Jeffrey Smith shot at Loon Lake,

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.420
 shot at some random guy and police chased him down.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.140
 Finally, I was having to try all these different

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.340
 combinations of words.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.100
 If I typed in Loon Lake shooting, Loon Lake SWAT,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.180
 it was giving me these articles, that's what I just told you.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.140
 Finally, when I had his name,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.860
 and I typed in Jeffrey Smith Loon Lake,

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.860
 I found an article published October 13th.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.780
 Before these other articles were coming out,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.100
 this article published October 13th saying,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.820
 yeah, he tried to kill a pedophile.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.940
 One article.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.060
 And that is not mentioned in any of the articles

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.220
 going forward.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.980
 We're in the town of Clayton, Washington.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.460
 It's actually like an unincorporated neighborhood

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.020
 or unincorporated place, if I remember correctly.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.700
 It's 315 PM, Jeffrey shows up to the house of Daven Brock,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.940
 40 year old man, who if you look at the Washington

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.860
 sex offender database, he's a level two sex offender,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.180
 which means there's a moderate risk to the community

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.320
 that he is in.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.420
 He was arrested and served prison time

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.140
 for taking indecent liberties with multiple

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.140
 15 to 16 year old girls.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.620
 And indecent liberty sounds like the name

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.580
 of some art house movie, right, on AMC.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.660
 And indecent liberties is basically

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.860
 when someone's not able to consent,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.380
 not just including age.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.940
 I didn't even find age on the list

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.300
 'cause I looked at the statute.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.900
 It's straight up like you're in a position of power

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.780
 over them or they have some sort of mental

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.220
 or physical disability.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.500
 So that's what he got charged with.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.620
 It wasn't some movie starring Daniel Day-Lewis.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.460
 It's a really gross crime.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:45.780
 And one of those victims was Jeffrey Smith's son's girlfriend.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:52.380
 So Jeffrey Smith, after learning this,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.420
 drove to Davin Brock's house,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.380
 waited on the porch for him, was drinking.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.380
 Davin walked up and Davin said,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.460
 "We talked for a while just like friends."

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.380
 And then I started to put two and two together.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.340
 I realized that one of my victims

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.780
 was related to him in some way.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.440
 And he pulled a gun out and he shot towards me.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.660
 And then he says, "I'm going to kill you."

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.300
 He started threatening to kill me.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.180
 And then he walked to his car and got another gun.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.180
 And then threatened to kill me again and then drove away.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.700
 That story is not repeated going forward.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.100
 Even though Davin Brock is, it's not hearsay.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.980
 Davin Brock is telling that story.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.320
 Going forward, it's just some lunatic with a gun.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.520
 Now, yes, he was out to murder someone

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.900
 or threaten someone, right?

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.580
 And he was drinking, he had these firearms

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.180
 and you don't want that in your community either.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:50.260
 But that's context.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.060
 And the question is, is why is this part

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.180
 of the story being buried?

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.580
 We covered an episode, it was very recent,

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.820
 about a month ago, and this is why

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.900
 Tom has sent this story over.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.540
 About some vigilantes, some pedophile hunter group.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.660
 Confron a man and target, a pedophile.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.180
 They were pretending to be an underage girl.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.220
 This guy showed up to meet with a girl.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.900
 They started getting in with scuffle.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.780
 Someone pulled out a gun.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.860
 I think it was one of the creep catchers pulled out a gun

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.900
 and shot the pedophile in the leg.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.980
 If I remember correctly.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.020
 And you read the stories and they're like,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.660
 "Yeah, it's crazy, these three guys

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.260
 "got in a fight with another guy at Target

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.460
 "and one of them got shot.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.020
 "Man, what a world we live in."

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.240
 And they're not saying this guy's a pedophile.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.860
 Or if they are saying it, it's way, way down in the article.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.260
 Or an alleged pedophile or attempted pedophile,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.140
 whatever you wanna classify it as.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.460
 And I remember saying on that episode,

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.660
 why aren't they telling the whole story?

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.260
 And then we have this one happening as well.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.380
 'Cause if you're just reading these articles,

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.260
 I mean, I had to specifically,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.500
 it was almost like I was trying to unlock the Da Vinci code.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.820
 I had to use the right words to get into it.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.900
 I had to find the guy's name first off.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.580
 And then an even weirder footnote to this whole story

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.420
 because Jeffrey did die.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:14.720
 There's a website called obituaries.neptunessociety.com.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.860
 And when you type in Jeffrey Smithaloon Lake

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.500
 when you go to Google, one of the first things that pops up

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.740
 is this obituary for Jeffrey Smith.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.180
 And it says October 12th, 2022.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.860
 Jeffrey John Smith, age 52 of Loon Lake.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.060
 So this is the right guy.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.820
 The Loon Lake Washington passed away

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.300
 on Wednesday, October 12th.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.140
 Fond memories and expressions of sympathy, dot, dot, dot.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.580
 So you go and you click on that link

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.380
 to read more about the obituary

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.220
 and to see what people are saying.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.780
 It's been deleted from the obituary website.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:54.240
 His obituary is gone.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.260
 What is this?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.580
 What is this?

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.700
 It used to be when I was, this is my boomer thing.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.980
 When I was a kid, it would be front and center,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.540
 though news would be that a man tried to kill

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.140
 a convicted pedophile and got killed by the police.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.900
 That's the news story.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.340
 I don't know, and I'm sure there's a thousand

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.340
 conspiracy theories that we could all think of,

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.180
 but why are they neglecting to add,

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.380
 it's a very, very interesting detail.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.900
 It's context for one, it's also salacious.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.220
 That's why I'm surprised the media isn't pushing that.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.220
 But whatever is keeping this story out of the media,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.540
 like again, I had to really, really look around

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.520
 to find the one article I did.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.100
 And even looking at this Google search results,

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.420
 the first one says, "Corner identifies man shot

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.860
 by deputies near Loon Lake October 20th."

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.580
 It was when that was published.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.140
 But they don't mention that in the article

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.580
 that was published six days later.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.620
 They don't mention it at all.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.660
 It just makes it seem like some guy randomly shot somebody,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.780
 or shot at somebody, and they've even deleted his obituary.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.100
 This is so weird.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.340
 This is so weird.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.780
 I don't understand why people are running cover

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.180
 for pedophiles.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.500
 Why are these parts of the story getting deleted?

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.740
 It's so weird to the point

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.540
 that they even deleted his obituary.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.420
 Insane, insane.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.780
 And I don't have an answer for it.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.820
 Like again, I mean, you obviously could be like,

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.620
 "Well, you know, the media always protects pedophiles,

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.620
 but yeah, usually only the powerful ones, right?

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.620
 Only the movie stars and the politicians

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.460
 and stuff like that.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.980
 Someone's running cover for Brian Singer,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.860
 so he keeps getting these movie deals and stuff like that.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.700
 It's horrible.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.980
 They're director Jeepers Creepers.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.580
 You know, someone's like, "Here's make more money.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.500
 We know you're pedophile,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.420
 but make more money for us."

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.420
 We see that.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.580
 So every time that Brian Singer does an interview,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.580
 they don't ask him, "Hey, what about all those allegations

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.260
 from that documentary in Open Secret?

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.100
 Hey, is people running cover for him?"

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.900
 This is just some creepo living on the street.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.180
 Absolutely.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.260
 There is a directive coming from somewhere,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.860
 'cause now we've had two incidents of this.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.340
 I always say first time is a anomaly.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.300
 The second time is a pattern.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.220
 I actually, I don't remember what I say,

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.580
 but basically if we see something happening

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.820
 over and over again,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.100
 why is the media running cover for pedophiles?

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.540
 They did it in the story about

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.680
 where that guy got shot at a target.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.020
 They weren't giving you context.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.220
 They made it seem like it was just a mass shooting,

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.220
 a shooting at a target type of thing.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.140
 You had to dig for the pedophile stuff.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.420
 And then here, again, they know why he shot him.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.380
 It stated very early in this timeline,

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.660
 and now new articles don't talk about that.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.140
 They're not having his obituary.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.120
 Why are they doing this?

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.380
 Absolutely insane.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.300
 Absolutely nuts.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.260
 Medusa Buscut, let's go ahead and tashie the keys

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.940
 to the world famous carpenter copter.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.900
 We are leaving behind,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.260
 we're leaving behind apparently a newsroom of people

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.740
 who love protecting pedophiles.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.580
 Take us all the way out of this disgusting cesspool.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.580
 We're headed out to a sleepy suburban neighborhood.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.580
 (imitates music)

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.180
 You know, I know I'm moving on to the next topic.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.300
 I guess I should be a little skeptical.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.980
 You could say in this instance,

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.100
 that they didn't wanna reveal too much information

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.860
 about the victim because then they didn't want him

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.380
 to get harassed by his neighbors.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.900
 Well, first off, I don't care if he's getting,

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.580
 I don't care if he's getting harassed by his neighbors, right?

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.500
 This is a fairly recent crime he committed,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.420
 even if it was a long time ago still.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.780
 But I don't care if he's gonna harass by his neighbors.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.460
 Also, he's on a, I typed in his name,

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.380
 I typed in Davin's name into the Washington

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.460
 Sex Offender Database.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.600
 It's all public information anyways.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.300
 I would be more curious if I lived in the neighborhood

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.380
 and be like, why did he shoot at Davin?

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.980
 I'd be more curious to find that out.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.460
 So the idea of protecting him for some reason.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.740
 And again, why?

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.820
 Why would they want to?

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.900
 But anyways, that's enough of that story.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.220
 We're headed out to this sleepy suburban neighborhood.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.620
 Medusa, go ahead and land this Carbenter Copture.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.180
 We're gonna get on our BMX bikes

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.140
 and we're gonna just ride around this little town.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.340
 They actually don't know where this story takes place.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.740
 I keep saying it's saying a sleepy suburban neighborhood.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.820
 It could take place anywhere.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.660
 We actually do have a photo of the main character

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.340
 of this story and they're standing next to a stucco,

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.100
 one of those houses with kind of the stucco on the outside.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.060
 So those are generally suburban, you know,

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.700
 homes that they just roll off the back of a factory truck.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.000
 Little stucco house in a sleepy little neighborhood.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.220
 This story came from someone who goes by the handle online

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.220
 as the great dreamer, 1937.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.700
 The great dreamer, we're gonna go ahead and call you Mikey.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.380
 Mikey lives with a family of four.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:03.380
 You got mom and dad and then his older sister, Tina,

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.580
 and then Mikey himself.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.180
 And this family, everything's going great in this family.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.060
 Not perfect, no one has a perfect family,

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.540
 but it's going pretty good.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.380
 It's going pretty good.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.340
 They're a very nice family, good members of the community

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.460
 and good members of their local church.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.540
 Such good members of the church that they received

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:30.100
 from their church, a statue of the Virgin Mary.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.460
 That's a pretty sizable statue.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.820
 There is a photo of this and based on the ferns,

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.580
 next to it, I'm just guessing, right?

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.980
 I don't know how big their ferns are,

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.180
 but I'd say the statue's probably about

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.180
 two to three feet tall, right?

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.940
 It's pretty, it's pretty big statue, dude.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.100
 That's bigger than a lot of little babies, right?

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.900
 Totolors and stuff, they'd be like intimidated by it.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.500
 Intimidated by this statue of the Virgin Mary.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.620
 So they have this statue, they've had it in their house

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.900
 for a really long time, for a really long time.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.460
 They've actually had it longer than

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.620
 they've had their own children.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.420
 We're talking about 25 plus years.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.100
 This statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.480
 has been in their house.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.820
 But life unfortunately happens

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.820
 and the mother ends up in the hospital.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.100
 The fathers at the hospital, the kids are at home.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.220
 And one night, it had to be like maybe four in the morning.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:36.140
 Tina wakes up, her dad is walking into her bedroom

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:42.300
 and he says, "Mom passed away tonight."

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:47.380
 Tina couldn't believe it.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.460
 You know, this is your mom,

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.980
 losing your mom would have to be just incredibly difficult,

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.400
 even worse, the younger you are.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.240
 Tina hears this news and you know, it hurts her, right?

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.400
 She's never gonna see her mom again.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.920
 The next morning, when Tina,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.520
 we don't have an age for these kids as well,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.720
 but considering they're home alone,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.280
 I figure Tina is probably in her early teens

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.000
 and Mikey younger than that bit.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.940
 Tina and Mikey, the next morning they're in the house

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.740
 and dad comes home from the hospital

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.760
 and he sits down and he goes,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:33.440
 mom died last night, mom died last night in the hospital.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.980
 Dad's telling him all this stuff

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.980
 and Tina is thinking, wait a second.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.500
 So dad came at four in the morning to tell me about it.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.780
 Then he went back to the hospital,

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.980
 maybe fill out some paperwork

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.380
 and then he's coming back to tell us about it.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.300
 But what she learns,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:00.420
 her dad never came home at four in the morning.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.020
 That wasn't her father walking into that room

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.500
 to deliver the news that her mother had died.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:16.460
 After the mom passed away, they had to move.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.380
 So they left their house

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.420
 and they ended up getting an apartment.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.540
 There's a two bedroom apartment, but there was three of them.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.380
 So the way that they had it set up was that

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.660
 Tina got one room, Mikey got another room,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.500
 but the father slept on the couch out in the living room.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.740
 And when they made this move, they took the stuff

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.420
 that you could take out of a house and fit into an apartment.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.020
 But one of the things that they made sure

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.740
 they brought into this apartment with them

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.900
 was the statue of the Virgin Mary.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.960
 They had had it for so long.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.160
 And what are you gonna do with it?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.400
 Just throw it away, give it away.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.040
 No, this is an icon.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.760
 It's not a piece of trash.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.480
 We can make room for it in our house

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.560
 and it was actually situated right next to the television set.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.720
 Well, the father would sleep on the couch

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.880
 and a lot of times he would sleep on his back.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.880
 So he's facing the nice cushiony apart.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.560
 He's back as to the television set.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.360
 But he started to notice something.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.260
 Whenever he laid there on his side

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.840
 with his back to the television set,

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.800
 his back was also to the statue.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.480
 And when he would be laying there in the darkness,

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.120
 he would hear breathing behind him.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.640
 (sighs)

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.720
 (sighs)

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.720
 (sighs)

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:49.040
 He said it was so heavy

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:55.200
 and so distinct he could actually count the breaths.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.800
 It wasn't something he had to strain to hear.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.440
 It was clearly audible.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.240
 Someone or something was breathing very heavily

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.720
 whenever he had his back to the statue.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.280
 Now, not all the, not, let me say, it wasn't every time.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.120
 It's not like he's like,

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.400
 "Oh, I forgot something in the kitchen."

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.240
 And he turns around,

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.660
 he's walking to go get some more cheez-its

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.840
 and he hears the breathing.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.600
 It didn't happen every single time

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.120
 and it happened when he was going to bed

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.420
 when he had his back to the statue.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.800
 But even then it wasn't every single time

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.880
 but this was a phenomenon he did recognize.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.440
 Another pattern he started to see

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.120
 was the nightmares.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.960
 He would have this dream

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.120
 that he would wake up in a bed,

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.800
 which would probably be the dream

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.720
 of anyone living on a couch.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.440
 He'd fall asleep on a couch.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.040
 He'd wake up in a bed.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.240
 He's still in the dream world

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.920
 but in the dream he's waking up in a bed.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.760
 And he's all alone in the bed.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.760
 But he can't move.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.840
 He's laying on his side in this bed

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.200
 and he can't move.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.700
 And he begins to feel something crawl

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.100
 into the bed behind him.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.700
 This thing would continue to move through the bed

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.120
 until it was right behind him,

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.800
 until its body was pressed against his.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.940
 And he'd begin to feel these arms wrap around him.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.060
 But he compared it to,

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.280
 it was like I was being hugged by a skeleton.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:46.300
 It didn't feel like there was any meat, no skin, right?

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.940
 It was just this real skinny,

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.780
 emaciated, skeletal-like entity behind him.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.060
 And he could feel the arms wrapping around him

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.300
 feel the bony ribcage press against his back.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:03.320
 And it would always whisper something into his ear.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.320
 It would say it over and over and over again.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:12.400
 He said the voice was this very high-pitched sound.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.560
 He goes, it reminded him of,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.040
 like if you've ever watched like funny YouTube videos

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.200
 or America's Funny Some videos or whatever.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:25.040
 It sounded like a animal trying to speak human languages.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.520
 So we'd have a dog say thank you, thank you, whatever.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.620
 We've heard those you too,

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.240
 if you haven't I'll put some in the show notes.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.200
 But he says that's what it sounded like

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.360
 and it always said the same thing

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.040
 and it would say it over and over again.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.520
 It always said,

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.240
 it's me.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.340
 It's the Virgin Mary.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:51.280
 We'll just repeat that over and over again,

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.800
 whispering right in his ear.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.720
 He would wake up.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.440
 And he said he'd only have to stream

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.300
 maybe three or four times.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:05.800
 But each time it played out the same.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.480
 He would wake up in a bed, unable to move.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.600
 Something would crawl into bed with him,

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.040
 get right next to his body,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.200
 wrap its arms around him

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.280
 and begin to say the same phrase.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.760
 In this high-pitched tone,

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.720
 it's me, it's the Virgin Mary over and over and over again.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.200
 He said the only difference in the dreams

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.680
 is in each dream,

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.400
 whatever was crawling into bed behind me

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:38.800
 felt more and more alive each time.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.480
 It was no longer the skeletal arms,

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.080
 but they felt a little more human.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.120
 Each time this creature, whatever it was,

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.400
 well it's saying it's the Virgin Mary,

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.880
 but whatever it was,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.200
 it was almost manifesting into a real human form.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.920
 Now this house wasn't just played by these nightmares.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.640
 Well, he was the only one having the nightmares,

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.560
 but he also, one time he walked into the kitchen

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.480
 and a plate flew right out of the kitchen cabinet,

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.920
 right at him, almost hit him.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.600
 Tina said that she had seen once

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.400
 a shadow man type entity

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.600
 walk out of her room and enter Mikey's room.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.640
 So we do also have observable phenomenon

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.000
 outside of the dream world,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.160
 the heavy breathing, the plate flying

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.320
 and the shadow man type entity.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.000
 Mikey has not experienced any of this.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.680
 He hears all of these stories way later in life,

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.360
 but for Tina and her father,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.480
 these are very real scary encounters

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.480
 that they're dealing with in the moment.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:02.600
 Well, Tina, this is another reason

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.800
 why I think she's fairly old,

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.440
 Tina in short order,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.200
 she ends up getting married and moving out of the house.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.920
 And the father, and what must be one of the most genius,

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.680
 genius moves of all time says,

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.280
 "You know what, Tina?

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.560
 So happy you're getting married.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.320
 I'm a little suspicious of that shadow man

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:28.000
 you've chosen as a groom, but I want you to have this.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.240
 This is the best thing."

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.240
 As a wedding present, he gave his daughter

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.320
 the statue of the Virgin Mary.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.480
 Now it was a keepsake, right?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.800
 Like this was something they had

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.400
 from when mom was still alive.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.080
 It was something they had had for over two decades,

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.760
 but even Mikey said when he was writing this out,

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.160
 I think dad just wanted to get rid of it.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:57.640
 Like sure, it's a nice memento of our life together

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.040
 as a family, but also it breathes at me late at night.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.800
 I don't know how much everyone knew

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.280
 what was going on at this time.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.600
 How, I don't think the dad woke up every morning

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.640
 and he's like, "Kids, I had the dream again.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.040
 I had the dream about that crazy creature

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.840
 crawling in a bed."

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.120
 But he gives the statue to his daughter

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.880
 and nothing happens, right?

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.360
 She gets the statue, it's not hovering around late at night,

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.720
 no dishes are flying towards her face.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.000
 Well, at least for the first couple months,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.640
 then she starts to have nightmares.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:40.360
 And her nightmares are also always set up the same.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.020
 She's walking down the street of her neighborhood.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.120
 She's walking down the street of her neighborhood,

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.940
 she knows this area very well.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.720
 She's walking to church.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.600
 And if she's walking down the street

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.920
 and she's headed towards church,

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.760
 something doesn't feel right.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:08.840
 And she turns around and behind her,

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.600
 probably a couple of yards, right?

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.940
 It's not right next to her,

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.900
 but let's say five, 10 yards away,

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:21.480
 on the ground is the statue of the Virgin Mary.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:27.840
 She keeps walking.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.440
 She's continuing to try to get to the church

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.760
 and she still feels something isn't right

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.480
 and she turns around and about five to 10 yards away

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.020
 is the statue.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:49.220
 And in all these dreams, she's trying to get to the church.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.220
 And in all these dreams, she can't get to the church.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.660
 No matter how many times she's trying to walk down this road,

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.700
 she can never actually enter the church.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.500
 And in all these dreams, no matter what distance

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.220
 she has traveled, the statue of the Virgin Mary

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.700
 is always behind her.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:09.460
 Jason, that's how traveling works.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.400
 If you leave point A and you go into straight line,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.680
 everything else is behind you.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.560
 It's always the same kind of distance behind her.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.740
 It's following her.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:24.520
 And in these dreams, sometimes she kept trying

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.040
 to get to the church, she couldn't get to the church.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.000
 She would hide.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.480
 She would go into someone's house

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.580
 and hide from the statue.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:37.260
 She'd be behind a couch.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.220
 Worried what was gonna happen

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.260
 if the statue eventually caught up to her.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.460
 And then somebody else,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.180
 another human in the dream would find her

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:56.640
 in the closet, behind the couch, under the bed.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.940
 And the person would say, this isn't going to work.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.620
 She's going to find you.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.780
 (silence)

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:09.660
 She's trapped in this dream loop.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.140
 It doesn't happen every single night,

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.640
 but when it happens, it plays out the same.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.780
 She is either slowly pursued by the statue.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.420
 She never sees it moving.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.700
 It's just always behind her.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.060
 And if she does try, if she does not continue her journey,

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.420
 if she decides to hide somewhere,

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.380
 a human always finds her and tells her, this won't work.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.620
 She's going to find you.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:36.420
 One night, she gets to the church.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.540
 One night she's having this dream.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.700
 And for whatever reason, why this night was any different

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.980
 than any of the other nightmares,

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.140
 she actually is walking down the street,

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.360
 the statue's behind her.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.580
 She gets the weird feeling.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.180
 She looks, the statue's behind her.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.320
 She thinks about hiding.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.180
 She knows this just makes it more angry.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.820
 She's gonna be found by another human.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:57.700
 She's gonna be warned.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.080
 She's going to find you.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.780
 She keeps walking down that street.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.380
 She sees the church.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.420
 She enters the church.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.920
 And for the first time in any of these nightmares,

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.400
 she feels safe.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.140
 She's in the church and the priest turns around

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:20.360
 and tells her, she's coming for you.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.520
 You need to leave.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:29.380
 After all these nights, after all of these nightmares,

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.320
 she finally gets into the church

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.860
 and she is told she is not even safe here.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.960
 So Tina runs out of the church

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.240
 and she begins running down the street.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.880
 And no matter how fast she runs,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.320
 the statue is right behind her.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.620
 It's right on her heels.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.820
 It's not moving.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.240
 It's just there.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.580
 An inch behind her, no matter how fast

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.340
 she's running down that street,

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:06.640
 the statue is right behind her every step of the way.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:14.660
 When she woke up after that time,

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.780
 she's like, okay, I'm done.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.460
 I really don't think her dad told her anything

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.340
 about what's going on with the statue,

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.580
 but she's not in any of it yet.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.500
 She goes, I keep dreaming about the statue.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.100
 And again, it's not a tiny little statue.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.620
 This is at least based on my Fern measurement system.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.800
 Two to three feet tall.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.640
 So she takes the statue and places it outside.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.280
 It was inside her house this whole time.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.980
 Now it's outside on her doorstep.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.480
 She's like, welcome visitors, meet my haunted statue.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.400
 She places this outside.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.060
 The nightmares immediately cease.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.960
 She never again dreams about trying to get to the church

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.520
 and being followed by the statue

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.880
 of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:08.360
 The next thing that happens is arguably worse than that.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.700
 Because before those dreams would happen

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.120
 every once in a while,

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.180
 but once she moved the statue outside of her house

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.240
 every single night,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.840
 whether she had a dream or a nightmare,

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:31.200
 every single night in her dreams

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.320
 would be totally normal.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.200
 Everything's happening.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.680
 She's just walking around, talking to friends,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.520
 watching a movie.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.520
 She could feel the eyes of the statue watching her.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:51.880
 Every single night, every single dream.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.680
 She could feel this statue staring at her.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.240
 And in the dream, she would realize something was wrong.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.680
 Something fell off and she would look around.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.880
 She would never see the statue in her dream.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:07.220
 But she could sense its gaze upon her.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.200
 She knew it was there somewhere.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.900
 She just couldn't see it.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:18.680
 This happened night after night after night

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.500
 after night after night.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.640
 At some point, and this is so interesting

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.360
 'cause I'm reading this story and this is the part of,

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.280
 okay, I can fact check this.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.280
 If this doesn't work, then maybe it's all made up

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.360
 and it could all be made up, right?

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.320
 All of these stories could be made up.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.960
 But what happens is one of her cousins ends up

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.960
 meeting the pope and getting this rosary blessed by the pope.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.160
 And I actually was like, is that even a thing?

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.320
 I mean, I know the pope blesses stuff.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.500
 So I did some research and yeah, you can do that.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.340
 Apparently they do these like mass blessing type things,

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.180
 ceremonies, I'm obviously not Catholic if you can't tell,

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.340
 but I was like, okay, so at least that checks out.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.660
 This is written by someone who at least,

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.540
 if it is made up at least they know that fact

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.500
 and I didn't know that fact.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.060
 It could all be made up, could be real.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.820
 But she gets this rosary blessed by the pope

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.900
 and she gives it to the sister.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:15.940
 She gives it to Tina.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.140
 And I don't know again how much of the story

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.260
 is being related to the people around them.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.880
 Generally when people are suffering

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.880
 from these types of hauntings, right?

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.980
 Which are very, very hard to prove.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.100
 You don't tell people about it

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.960
 'cause you sound like a lunatic.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.160
 You just sound like a weirdo.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.900
 So I don't think she's like, hey,

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.240
 when you're out there talking to the pope,

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.280
 can you get something blessed?

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.960
 Because I've been being chased by the statue

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.920
 of the Blessed Virgin Mary for the past couple months.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.840
 And honestly, actually this type of haunting

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.560
 you probably wouldn't tell people about

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.740
 'cause it's borderline blasphemous.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.500
 But anyways, she does get a rosary

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.280
 that's blessed by the pope himself

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.860
 and she placed that around the statue's neck

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.180
 along with some other religious iconography.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.060
 And the dreams immediately stopped.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.780
 There was never any other sense

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.620
 that the statue had any ill will towards.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.220
 Tina or the father or Mikey or anyone.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.200
 To this day it sits outside that house.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.960
 Looking like any ordinary statue.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.680
 It's a fascinating story.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.920
 We did a story a long time ago,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.340
 maybe like 200 episodes ago,

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.440
 about a group of three girls who were camping in the woods.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.280
 I don't remember the detail.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.680
 I think they were at like a summer camp.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.200
 I believe it took place in Eastern Europe.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.660
 And the Virgin Mary chased them down a hill.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.600
 And again, that's one of those stories that you go,

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.360
 what is this phenomenon?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.960
 It's definitely, I mean,

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.160
 I don't think I have to give you an intro.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.280
 I mean, I guess I could, Jesus is mom, right?

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.560
 But I'm sure pretty much everyone knew

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.640
 what I was talking about.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.160
 We're talking about a religious figure,

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.480
 not just a religious figure,

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:04.280
 but one that is venerated by a huge group of religious,

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.700
 the Catholic, you know, venerate the Blessed Virgin Mary.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.600
 So it's, you know, it's in their art.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.400
 It's in their iconography and things like that.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.920
 So to have, to, you know, get to the chase,

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.000
 the mom of Jesus running down a hill,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.440
 chasing little girls, it sounds absolutely blasphemous.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.440
 It must be some sort of demonic entity taking that form.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.360
 And then you come across this story

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.800
 and we see a weird combination of events.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.960
 We have a statue that's been around for over, again,

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.280
 they had it for 25 plus years.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:45.280
 The mom dying and then the paranormal activity happening

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.200
 is a super weird combination.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.200
 It would make sense if they started seeing

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.640
 the ghost of their mom.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.440
 If the mom died and then every show,

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.280
 often they'd smell her favorite perfume in the room,

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.560
 that sweet, it's beautiful.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.880
 I wouldn't talk about it on the podcast.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.720
 It is hauntings, but those hauntings,

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.840
 they're a dime a dozen.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.680
 I get it.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.400
 If it's, if you're experiencing it,

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.080
 that's totally awesome, right?

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.360
 I'm not saying you're like, oh man, I miss my mom.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.840
 And then Jason said it was lame,

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.440
 then her spirit's still around.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.720
 Oh, and the mom ghost is like, it's okay.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.040
 Jason's kind of a jerk.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.120
 You know what I mean, right?

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.240
 I wouldn't talk about that.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.920
 It's sweet and beautiful,

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.720
 but it doesn't really tell us anything about,

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.280
 it doesn't tell us anything unique about the human condition

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.920
 or the ghost condition.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.920
 Here we have the mom dying and negative spiritual energy,

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:40.320
 hostile ghost attacks or whatever demonic attacks, right?

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.400
 Engulfing this family,

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.320
 and it's using the vessel,

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:53.000
 it's using the image of Mary to do it.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.440
 You could have a demon disguising itself

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.800
 as a religious figure.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.760
 What I find so fascinating is,

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.000
 why did this start when the mother died?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.080
 So almost like the mother was a calming influence

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:05.920
 over the family.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.160
 I have a lot of questions, honestly.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.000
 I don't know why when the mom died, they lost their house.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.400
 I'm curious about that as well.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.040
 So there could be more facts about the story

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.240
 that we don't know,

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.400
 but it's possible that this statue was always haunted

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:29.880
 and the mother's psychic barrier around the family

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.120
 prevented them from feeling any of it.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.520
 That's a possibility.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:40.040
 Another darker possibility is that when the mom died,

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.440
 that's what caused this whole thing.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:48.240
 But it is a story that we can test.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.440
 Right now that statue is outside of a house

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.240
 and it is wearing a blessed rosary

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.880
 that is keeping whatever is inside of it at bay.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:05.480
 If we really wanted to know

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.000
 what dark forces may lie inside that statue,

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.720
 all we have to do is take the rosary off.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:24.240
