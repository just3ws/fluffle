1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 Is it possible to catch a miracle on video?

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,840
 Would you feel comfortable sleeping in the same room where a man slid his own wrists?

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,320
 And then we take a look at the absolutely bizarre story, I'm shocked I've never heard

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,400
 of this before, about a woman who is claiming she is the reincarnation of Anne Frank.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,920
 Is it possible that a writer from Sweden may have proof that there truly is life after

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,600
 death today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:47,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,960
 I'm your host Jason Garbner, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,200
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,680
 Hope you guys have some cool plans for the week and I'm gonna go see the new Spider-Man

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,200
 movie.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,800
 That looks cool, it's been a while since I've seen a superhero movie in the theater and

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,120
 I like Spider-Man and I guess in this movie, because you know how they have the different

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,760
 Spider-Man like the Tobey Maguire and the Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,480
 This is the first movie where they're gonna combine the universes so for the first time

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,720
 on screen we get to see all three versions of Aunt May and they say it's like I'm ex-war

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
 of you.

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,760
 Just these old women walking around and yeah, so I can't wait to see Marissa Tormey and

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,520
 Sally Fields which they want to remember and then the old lady from the Tobey Maguire,

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,280
 Aunt May and yeah, I cannot wait.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,920
 It'll be, I just can't wait but I hope you guys have plans.

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,520
 Hope you guys have aunt related plans as well.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,920
 Speaking of aunt related, it's not but I need to segue.

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,240
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,160
 Everyone give it up for everyone's favorite aunt man, Alexander.

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,480
 Alexander Healander, everyone give Alexander a big round of applause.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,440
 I'm recording this episode really late at night, this didn't clap so loud.

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,680
 Alexander, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,880
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,480
 Trust me, I totally get it.

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,080
 Just help spread the word about the show.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,440
 That really, really helps out a lot.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
 And then let's not get started just yet.

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,040
 Actually, let's give a shout out for this awesome fan art for Fan Art Friday.

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,520
 Take a look at this one.

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,880
 These are miniatures created by one of our Patreon supporters.

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,400
 I'm living in your walls.

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,440
 I'm living in your walls.

39
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,600
 He posted these up on the Patreon Discord.

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,560
 These are the figures of Jay Son, the swamp wizard.

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
 That's me.

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
 That's me, the little mohawk.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
 And then his son, Mungo Jr.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
 Or maybe he just called him Mungo.

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,840
 I don't think he has a Mungo Jr.

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,640
 But that is his frog son.

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,800
 That's so dope.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,440
 They're doing a campaign and I'm an NPC.

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,400
 I'm a swamp wizard with my boy Mungo.

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
 That's totally dope.

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
 That's amazing, right?

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,600
 Like, who would have thought I would ever be?

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
 Who?

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 I mean, NPC and some dudes campaign.

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,880
 Hopefully, for all I know, these guys are a bunch of lunatics in each game.

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,680
 They're like, "Let's see who can torture Jay Son the most and make Mungo watch."

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
 And I'm like, "No!"

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,360
 I'm trapped in this alternate universe.

59
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
 But amazing.

60
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,000
 That's so awesome.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Thank you so much.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I'm living in your walls.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Really, really appreciate it.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Happy adventures to you and all of your players.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,040
 Alexander, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,880
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

67
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,200
 We are headed all the way out to an aircraft carrier.

68
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,760
 Probably not the best thing to just sneak up on a US aircraft carrier in an unmarked

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
 Durgible, but we're going to do it.

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,800
 We're going to live dangerously.

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,920
 I recently got this sent over to me by Carson, longtime supporter of the show.

72
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,360
 I think he was one of the original listeners of the show, honestly.

73
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,800
 I think he was in the original 14 listeners.

74
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,120
 Really good guy, a Patreon supporter, close personal friend, and he always sends me over

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
 quality stuff.

76
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,920
 He sent me this thing over recently.

77
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,200
 There was this post online where they were talking about, "Hey, veterans, anyone in the

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,320
 military, can you think of a paranormal or weird experience you had during your time

79
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
 serving?

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,000
 And who doesn't like to hear stories like this?"

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,800
 Because at the very least, you're just going to hear maybe some cool war stories.

82
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,760
 At the very most, you might actually get something paranormal related.

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,000
 So Carson, thanks for sending this over.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
 Fascinating stuff.

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
 First one we're going to look at.

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
 I got two of them.

87
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
 It's a really cool list.

88
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,140
 The first one I got was posted by a guy named Silent Implosion.

89
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,640
 This one was caught on video.

90
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,160
 And at the time when it was on video, it was National Geographic was doing some sort of

91
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
 documentary.

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,960
 So you had these camera crews on the deck of this aircraft carrier.

93
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,720
 And it's September 11th, 2003.

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,680
 And we're off the coast of Virginia and there's this aircraft carrier here and this jet is

95
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
 getting ready to take off.

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
 And I put the video in the show notes.

97
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,040
 You'll be able to watch this.

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,040
 And just watching the video is a miracle.

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,880
 But Silent Implosion gives us a little bit more backstory to this.

100
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,200
 So what happens is this F-18, shh, shh, shh, people are doing the danger zone stuff.

101
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,360
 They're like getting down.

102
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,240
 They're moving their arms up.

103
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,160
 And then the pilot's like, "Is it me that's supposed to go?

104
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,560
 This is my first day flying a plane."

105
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,680
 And they're like, "Go, go, go!"

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,560
 And he starts to go down the flat part of the aircraft carrier, shh, flying into that

107
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,800
 danger zone.

108
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,680
 And then the cable snaps.

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,160
 Apparently there's a cable hooked up to these planes to make them fly.

110
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,400
 You love this scientific description.

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,360
 I could have easily done 15 minutes of research on this.

112
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,800
 I was too busy watching the video.

113
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,480
 And singing "Take My Breath Away."

114
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,800
 The jet is taken off and the arresting cable gets stuck.

115
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,360
 And the plane goes over the edge of the aircraft carrier.

116
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
 Now, not in a good way.

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,000
 Because you're like, "Is that what planes do?

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 They don't stay in the aircraft carrier forever.

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,240
 If you love something, you have to let it fly away."

120
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,120
 It goes, it goes, it goes down into the water.

121
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,640
 And I think the dude ejected.

122
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,960
 I'm pretty sure he's fine.

123
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
 But that's not paranormal.

124
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,960
 That's just really good technology, working the way it's intended.

125
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360
 This cable snaps.

126
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,160
 And silent implosion goes, this is what is expected.

127
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,080
 When these cables snap, they whip down the rest of the aircraft carrier.

128
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,280
 I mean, it's this giant tension thing.

129
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,440
 And now it's going, "Waaaaaahhhhhh!"

130
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,920
 Dude, don't call me that.

131
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
 It actually made that noise.

132
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,520
 I don't know if it made a Looney Tunes noise.

133
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,800
 But on the video, as this cable is snapping, we see a guy in a yellow shirt, and they're

134
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,440
 called yellow shirts.

135
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,840
 He's standing there, and the wire is coming, and he jumps up in the air.

136
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,000
 He jumps over this super tensed up wire that's now snapped.

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,600
 He jumps over it, he lands, and then he jumps over it again.

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,760
 Now you're watching the video, and you're thinking, "Oh, you know, it's a huge cable.

139
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,720
 It obviously is enough to, like, support an F-18."

140
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
 And you may be thinking, "You know what?

141
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
 It's a really thick cable.

142
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
 Maybe he saw it coming twice."

143
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,520
 And so I'm like, "Yeah, it's definitely possible."

144
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,000
 But then the camera, this is all caught on video.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,600
 The camera shows the plane go over, and then the camera kind of follows along with the

146
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
 cable.

147
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 We see the yellow shirt jump twice, and then it continues to kind of pan and follow the

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,720
 cable, and you see people just getting knocked over, because they didn't see it coming.

149
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,560
 Like, this one guy straight up had his back to it.

150
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,680
 Yeah, it went, "Bong!"

151
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
 Again, don't call me on the sound effects, but it knocked a bunch of people over.

152
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
 Seven.

153
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
 Seven, really.

154
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,800
 Seven or eight soldiers got knocked down.

155
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,880
 So silent implosion says, "Yeah, this is caught on video," but what happened was he

156
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,760
 was on the aircraft carrier.

157
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,600
 And he talked to the yellow shirt, and the yellow shirt guy said, "I was standing there

158
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
 because it all happened so fast."

159
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,320
 This whole thing's happening so fast, he goes, "I'm standing there," and I imagine

160
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
 this is your job.

161
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,640
 So eventually, like, the first time you do it, you're probably like, "Whoa, that's what

162
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,360
 airplanes do when they take off?

163
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
 Awesome!"

164
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,760
 But then you've been on this aircraft carrier for like two years, you're no longer excited

165
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
 by it.

166
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,240
 You're literally gonna turn your back to a billion dollar piece of machinery to find

167
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
 the laws of gravity.

168
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,400
 But you're like, whatever.

169
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,320
 So the cable snaps, and the yellow shirt says, this is what happened, he goes, "I'm standing

170
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,080
 there," and I heard a voice in my head say, "Jump!"

171
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,200
 So I jumped.

172
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,800
 I did not know what was coming.

173
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,560
 I did not see what was coming.

174
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,680
 I heard a voice say, "Jump!"

175
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,360
 And I jumped.

176
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,400
 And when I landed, the voice returned and said, "Again."

177
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,000
 And I jumped.

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,960
 The other seven or eight servicemen did have to be lifted off.

179
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,800
 And silent implosion goes, they didn't hear any voices.

180
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,880
 So it's possible that they suffered injuries, obviously, but maybe this would have killed

181
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,880
 the yellow shirt, and maybe this was a guardian angel, time traveler, alt...

182
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
 I mean, isn't that...

183
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,560
 And that's a really cool story, because we have the video evidence, we know that it

184
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,680
 happened.

185
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,400
 And now we're getting this paranormal answer for it.

186
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,520
 It's a really, really cool story.

187
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,920
 Alexander, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

188
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,320
 Let's jump off this aircraft carrier.

189
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,920
 We're headed all the way out to Fort Sam in Texas.

190
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:19,560
 I said in the intro, "How would you feel about sleeping in a room where somebody has slit

191
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
 their wrist?"

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,680
 Or really, sleeping in a room where you know someone has died.

193
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,200
 And I think a lot of people would be weirded out about it.

194
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,440
 Some people wouldn't be.

195
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,360
 But I have a friend in the home lending mortgage business and stuff like that, and they were

196
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,520
 telling me that every home...

197
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,200
 I'm not going to say your name because I don't...

198
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,360
 This is part of a business I don't want to interfere with it, but basically she was

199
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,000
 saying, "In a way, every home, someone's died in it."

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,560
 And there's a reason why every home has someone who's died in it.

201
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,160
 Where do you want to die?

202
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,320
 You want to die at home.

203
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,280
 Most people want to die in their homes.

204
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,880
 And so they choose to die in their homes, right?

205
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,880
 And I'm not talking about suicide, but if you're really sick, are you going to go to the hospice?

206
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
 You're going to go to the hospital?

207
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,080
 You're going to go to the retirement home?

208
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,480
 Or are you just going to spend the rest of your days in the place you're the most comfortable?

209
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,440
 So pretty much every living space, unless it's a brand new house, someone's died in there.

210
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,960
 In that place where they built that brand new house, there was probably hundreds of years

211
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,360
 of people getting their heads split open and settlers coming and like torching native encampments

212
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,000
 and all sorts of stuff, right?

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 You'd have all this stuff.

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,800
 You'd have brigands, shooting dudes in the back of the skull and stealing their gold.

215
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,520
 So no matter where you're at, you're basically having a chance to be on cursed land.

216
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,560
 People have been everywhere at this point, but people always are dying at home, but we're

217
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,640
 not at home.

218
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
 We're not at home.

219
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,200
 And I think like this house, I've talked about being haunted, my closet's haunted and

220
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,000
 stuff like that, but because I've made it my home, my energy is here and it's intermingling

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,120
 with some of the other energy here.

222
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
 But on a military base, is it ever really your home?

223
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
 You're basically there.

224
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
 That's where you're stationed.

225
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
 You might have on base housing.

226
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,960
 That's not the situation here at Fort Sam.

227
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,840
 Apparently this was posted by someone going by the name 27 Letters.

228
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,960
 They were saying that they had gotten put on restriction.

229
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,880
 They're in school, in the military, this is in Dennis the Menace.

230
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
 They're doing this thing and they got put on restriction.

231
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,480
 So they're sent to this different facility, this different part of the base where that's

232
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,760
 where they are going to be staying at this point.

233
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,600
 That was going to be their room.

234
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,960
 And he goes, "This room, it just really had bad vibes."

235
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,640
 And that would make sense just from a paranormal aspect.

236
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,360
 You'd have a lot of people, this is your career.

237
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,160
 You're joining the military to maybe leave behind your small town or to start a career

238
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,200
 in the military, maybe it's a family gig.

239
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,960
 And you're in this room because you've done something wrong.

240
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,280
 You might be getting demoted.

241
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,440
 You might be getting kicked out of your career.

242
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
 You might be getting fired, right?

243
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
 So there's going to be a lot of negative energy in this room.

244
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,320
 It's a place where people don't want to be.

245
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,400
 So he's in there and he has a roommate in this room and he just gets the weirdest feeling.

246
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
 He goes, "I don't like this place."

247
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,120
 Now, you guys already know a little bit because obviously, even away in the intro, so you

248
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,440
 guys know a little bit more than this dude, we'll call this guy Mike.

249
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,400
 One night, Mike wakes up and he sees his bed buddy.

250
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,000
 So they're not literally laying next to each other, but there's two beds in there.

251
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,480
 And his buddy is sleeping in the bed next to him, right?

252
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,000
 But when Mike wakes up, he sees his roommate standing at the foot of his bed, staring at

253
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 him.

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,120
 Now, this room's already creepy.

255
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,240
 It's already not the best place to be.

256
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,480
 He knows that he's in trouble, so he's not in the best mental state.

257
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,000
 And he can't figure out why his buddy's just standing there.

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,480
 But whatever, right?

259
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,880
 Military, sometimes it brings in a bunch of wackos, so he just goes back to sleep.

260
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:06,400
 Next morning, he wakes up and his buddy, the bunkmate, will call him Larry.

261
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,440
 Larry goes, "Hey, Mike, dude.

262
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,440
 I know that we're cool and all, but what was up with you standing at the foot of my bed

263
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
 last night?"

264
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,440
 Mike's like, "What are you talking about?

265
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,120
 I wasn't standing at the foot of your bed."

266
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,720
 And Larry goes, "Listen, dude, I woke up in the middle of the night.

267
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,120
 You were standing at the foot of my bed, and I was not able to go back to sleep.

268
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,720
 You were just standing at the foot of my bed staring at me.

269
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
 It was terrifying."

270
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,080
 And Mike goes, "Okay, when did that happen?"

271
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,120
 And Larry said, "It happened over whatever time.

272
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,440
 It's just 3 AM.

273
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,840
 The spooky is time."

274
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,600
 And Mike realizes that's when he woke up and saw Larry standing at the foot of his own

275
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,120
 bed, of Mike's bed.

276
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,040
 So they go to the staff sergeant, they go to the person in charge, whoever it is, and

277
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,760
 they say, "Hey, I know we're on restriction and all that stuff, but is it possible we

278
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,680
 can get another room because we already thought that room was spooky, but something happened

279
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,680
 last night and we were standing at the foot of each other's bed and the dude's like, "Oh,

280
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
 I'm going to stop you guys right there.

281
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,840
 I'm going to stop you guys right there because I have to sleep as well."

282
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,800
 That room, I'm not going to say it's haunted.

283
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,000
 Officially, I'm not going to say that it's haunted, but let me tell you what happened.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,440
 Long time ago, they get a little campfire, they're cooking s'mores all of a sudden.

285
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,720
 A long time ago, on a day just like this, an instructor got busted down, right?

286
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,920
 It actually wasn't a long time ago.

287
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,520
 I looked back over and my notes, it was a year ago.

288
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,760
 This happened the year before Mike and Larry got involved in this, but a year ago there

289
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,280
 was an instructor on base who got busted down, was doing something wrong, and got put on

290
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,960
 restriction and had to stay in this room.

291
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,320
 And then they caught him using his cell phone, which apparently you're not supposed to do

292
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
 in the military.

293
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
 Is that a thing?

294
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,800
 Got put on restriction, got caught using his cell phone, was going to get demoted, was actually

295
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,600
 going to lose rank, lose pay, and he was totally freaking out.

296
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,400
 He was freaking out so much that other people were like, "Dude, you need to calm down.

297
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,360
 You're acting really, really weird."

298
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,520
 But he couldn't calm him down.

299
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,720
 They go, "It's really not a big deal.

300
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
 You'll just work your way back up.

301
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,040
 It's not a huge thing."

302
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,440
 But one day he goes in the room and the next morning they find him and he had slit his

303
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,420
 wrist and OD'd on drugs at the same time, which a lot of people do that when they're

304
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
 committing suicide.

305
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,080
 They'll do more than one.

306
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,320
 This guy killed himself and because he had OD'd and he slit his wrist, they said there

307
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,720
 was blood and puke everywhere.

308
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,080
 So he's vomiting it up all the toxins and he's bleeding out and thus ends the life of this

309
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
 instructor.

310
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,480
 Now, is this story true?

311
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 We don't know.

312
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,760
 We were able to see video evidence of the first one.

313
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
 Is this story true?

314
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
 We don't know.

315
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,480
 But it's interesting nonetheless.

316
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
 It's creepy.

317
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,240
 Obviously anything where you wake up and you're seeing something at the foot of your bed that's

318
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,800
 just instinctively creepy because we're in our most vulnerable state.

319
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,360
 It's interesting that each person is seeing the other person at the foot of the bed.

320
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,800
 My question would be if they...

321
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,080
 None of them ever seemed to look at the other bed.

322
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,640
 If they did, was it empty?

323
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,960
 Like if Larry looked and he saw Mike standing at the foot of the bed and then looked over

324
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,480
 and saw Mike sleeping, then you would know it was a ghost.

325
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,840
 But the more disturbing answer would be Larry waking up seeing Mike at the foot of the bed

326
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,800
 and then looking over and the bed's empty.

327
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,400
 So that means it really is Mike standing at the foot of the bed.

328
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,000
 Or this demon, this spirit, this vengeful phantasm has the ability to assume the shape

329
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 of someone else and hide their original form from view.

330
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,920
 Both are equally terrifying, right?

331
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,360
 Both are equally terrifying if a ghost can actually make you not see something that's

332
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
 there.

333
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,280
 So, yeah, really, really creepy story either way.

334
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,320
 And again, Carson, thanks for standing over.

335
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,480
 27 letters in silent implosion for sharing that with us as well.

336
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
 Alexander, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbindercopter.

337
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
 We are saying goodbye to Fort Sam.

338
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
 They're like, "No, we still need a new room.

339
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,480
 Don't leave us in here."

340
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,600
 They're locking the door.

341
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 Start the experiments.

342
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 We're leaving.

343
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
 We're leaving.

344
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,480
 Goodbye to these guys as they're banging on the door and these ghosts are sneaking up

345
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
 behind them.

346
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,440
 Alexander, we're leaving behind Fort Sam.

347
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,960
 Take us all the way out to Sweden.

348
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,720
 I gotta give a shout out for this story.

349
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,200
 I had never heard this story.

350
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,560
 It's still fascinating to me.

351
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,960
 I think people, long-time listeners of the show know one of the hallmarks of this show

352
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,520
 is finding stuff that's super obscure.

353
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,360
 Like I like to cover stuff that I've never heard of, but every show often I can, and

354
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,000
 I research this stuff all the time, so if I haven't heard of it, it's very likely that

355
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
 most people haven't heard of it.

356
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,880
 But every show often I come across a story and I'm thinking, "How have I not heard this

357
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
 before?"

358
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,400
 How do I not know this story?

359
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
 This seems...

360
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
 It's older, right?

361
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,520
 It's from like the 70s to 60s to 70s.

362
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,680
 It's just super weird.

363
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
 Let's just get into it.

364
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,600
 I'm shocked that I hadn't heard of this, but I want to give a shout out to Brent Swancer

365
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,960
 from Mysterious Universe.

366
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
 He wrote this...

367
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,080
 I've never heard this story before.

368
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,520
 He recently wrote an article about it and I got a lot of information from it and just...

369
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,000
 It's awesome that we're still...

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,360
 I've been in this game for 30 years.

371
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,400
 More 33 years at this point and I'm still learning new stuff.

372
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,800
 And I love sharing that stuff with you.

373
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,720
 There's a woman in Sweden named Barbara Carlin.

374
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,480
 But before she's a woman, she's a baby girl.

375
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
 Me!

376
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
 Me!

377
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
 Me!

378
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,400
 The mom's like holding the baby and goes, "I won't name you Barbara."

379
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,960
 Because in Sweden that's a normal name.

380
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,520
 She constantly has nightmares.

381
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
 Oh no!

382
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,000
 Mommy, I had the nightmare again.

383
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 The men in the uniforms took...

384
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
 I don't know why I'm building up the suspense.

385
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,400
 You've seen the title of the episode.

386
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 I mentioned it in the intro.

387
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
 It took...

388
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,240
 I was like, "Flong ago, back in 1940s."

389
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,320
 You guys know what it is.

390
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,640
 Barbara Carlin.

391
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,760
 I had a bunch more notes.

392
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,720
 I had a bunch more notes where I was going to build the story up.

393
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,400
 And then you were going to find out that Barbara is actually the reincarnation of Anne Frank.

394
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,200
 So, Anne Frank, quick overview.

395
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,480
 I'm sure everyone's familiar with Anne Frank, but you never really know.

396
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,720
 Anne Frank, young Jewish girl.

397
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,320
 The Nazis were rounding up all of the Jews.

398
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,000
 And her and her family lived in an attic for a couple months.

399
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,720
 And eventually the Nazis found them and pulled the family out of the attic.

400
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
 And she died.

401
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,800
 She died in the camp.

402
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 You have that.

403
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,040
 So, young girl, she's writing the diary of Anne Frank.

404
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,960
 So we get to see this story from this young woman's point of view.

405
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,320
 This massive historical event from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl.

406
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,720
 And it's a great book.

407
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,240
 It's pretty much read in every school because on the one hand, it's well-written.

408
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,600
 And it's a great way for kids.

409
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,400
 It has a lot of good vocabulary for kids to read, right?

410
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,040
 And on the other hand, it's just a tale of horror in the resiliency of the human spirit,

411
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
 right?

412
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,040
 It's just so it works on a literary level and it works just on a human level.

413
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,320
 So when Barbara, though, she's born in 1954, we all know who Anne Frank is today, but she

414
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,560
 was born in 1954.

415
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,840
 The diary of Anne Frank was written in 1947.

416
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,360
 And I can't say that it was a huge blockbuster.

417
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,360
 I don't think many people would read it if it wasn't required reading in school, honestly.

418
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,920
 So she says, "Listen, I didn't know about Anne Frank.

419
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,880
 We didn't really know about Anne Frank in Sweden.

420
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,840
 Is there a shift from side to side?"

421
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,680
 Because, I mean, maybe not, right?

422
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,640
 Maybe if you were there at the time you knew about her or when the book was being published,

423
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,960
 I'm sure there was a lot of publicity.

424
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,000
 But in 1954, and the story, as far as I know at that time, wasn't required reading in Sweden.

425
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
 It may not even be required reading.

426
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,680
 Now, but she says she didn't know who Anne Frank was, but she knew her name was Anne Frank.

427
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,080
 And she knew that since the age of three.

428
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,880
 Now she started talking about being Anne Frank and she started saying, "I have these nightmares

429
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,720
 about these men in uniforms kicking down the doors and taking me away."

430
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
 And this is going on for so long her parents take her to a psychiatrist.

431
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,680
 And the psychiatrist, apparently, does not know anything about Anne Frank either.

432
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,840
 Because they go, "Oh, you imaginary friends.

433
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
 Imaginary friends.

434
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
 They just happen, right?"

435
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,200
 You never see this person as who this Anne Frank is.

436
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,520
 It's a passing phase.

437
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
 She'll get over it.

438
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:23,320
 Now, Barbro may have just fade into obscurity at this point and just go, "Oh, you know,

439
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,080
 maybe, maybe I don't really have these memories.

440
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,240
 Maybe it is a passing phase, whatever."

441
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,600
 Or she could have continued to think she was this person named Anne Frank.

442
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,280
 But the reason why we're talking about Barbro today, other than her making this claim, is

443
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,520
 she is a famous author.

444
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,080
 And she actually, well, in Sweden, let me put a little asterisk next to that in Sweden.

445
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,640
 She started writing, she's like a wonder kind when it comes to writing.

446
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,560
 She published her first book of poetry by age 12.

447
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:58,560
 And by the time she was 16, she had 11 books published, including prose as well as poetry.

448
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,040
 And at this point, she kind of stops talking about Anne Frank, not because she doesn't

449
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,560
 believe it, because it constantly just brings about ridicule and a bunch of questions are

450
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
 being asked.

451
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,240
 But at this point, I believe they know Anne Frank is real.

452
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,480
 One point, they're going through a tour of Europe and they end up in Amsterdam and they

453
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,560
 go, "Hey, let's check out the Anne Frank house."

454
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,800
 Which is weird, right?

455
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,480
 If you're, you thought your daughter had some sort of mental illness connected to Anne Frank

456
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,000
 and then you found out Anne Frank was a real person and then you just happened to be in

457
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,760
 the country where the story took place, would you go to the house?

458
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,520
 I think it would depend on if you thought your daughter was stable enough.

459
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,920
 But they go to the house and she's walking around and she goes, "Oh, I totally remember

460
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
 this place."

461
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,320
 This place brings, this place brings back such horrible memories.

462
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,720
 And they're walking around and they go upstairs to like the crawl space, the attic.

463
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,080
 And she starts to have a panic attack.

464
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,560
 "Oh no, this is awful up here."

465
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,360
 And I guess there was like a smaller room that Anne Frank was actually like hanging

466
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,280
 out in like her own little room.

467
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,920
 And Barbara goes in that room and she opens the door and she goes, "Oh, look at the photos.

468
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,400
 The photos of the movie stars are still on the wall."

469
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
 And so apparently Anne Frank, it's been years since I read the book, I guess this part's

470
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 in here.

471
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,960
 She's just cutting out a movie star picture, which is so funny.

472
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,400
 It just shows how kids never change.

473
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,000
 Basically, she had the equivalent of Jonathan Taylor Thomas photos from TigerBee Magazine.

474
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,240
 She had them of stars of the day on the wall.

475
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,800
 And Barbara goes, "Look, the photos are still here."

476
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,600
 And she's saying that to her mom and her mom goes, "What photos?"

477
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,800
 And Barbara looks back at her mom and then when she looks back to the wall, the wall

478
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 is bare.

479
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,560
 There's nothing there.

480
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,760
 I guess that they ended up asking the tour guide about the photos.

481
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,400
 Like, hey, there used to be photos on the wall up there.

482
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,120
 And the tour guide goes, "Oh, yeah, we actually took them down recently because we're going

483
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,360
 to put them under glass because people were scribbling on them.

484
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,000
 They're like, "Oh, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, you're the sexiest."

485
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,080
 They're writing little hearts on there.

486
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,140
 And so the implication is that she was seen into the past.

487
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,480
 She was seen through Anne Frank's eyes.

488
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,080
 And at this point, so now she kind of believes that this is true.

489
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,880
 Like she's kind of had some vindication.

490
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,080
 She had a mild hallucination.

491
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,320
 So she does at this point, seems to totally grow out of this belief.

492
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
 She's Anne Frank.

493
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,440
 She joins the Swedish police services, a mounted officer.

494
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,520
 But while she is moving on with her life, you know, sure, I'm Anne Frank, but you know,

495
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,320
 I got other stuff to do now.

496
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,080
 She's riding her horse, chasing down criminals.

497
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,360
 There's another officer she absolutely hates.

498
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,200
 And she's like, "I don't know why I don't like that guy.

499
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,480
 But I just know I hate his guts."

500
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
 And then she finds out.

501
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,640
 I don't know how she finds out.

502
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,480
 I don't know if she rummages through her garbage or if she found out surfing the Astral Plain.

503
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:59,160
 But she finds out that this cop that she doesn't like, who she randomly hates, is actually

504
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,800
 the reincarnation of a Nazi guard.

505
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,600
 Wouldn't that be interesting?

506
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,200
 Think about all the people that you've disliked or haven't trusted just instinctively.

507
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,960
 And we go, "Ah, he just gives off a weird vibe."

508
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,760
 What if that person killed us in a past life?

509
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,360
 Or maybe not killed us, but maybe they cheered on our death.

510
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,720
 Maybe as you were some gladiator back in ancient Roman times and you were hacking a lion with

511
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
 a sword.

512
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,960
 There was a dude in the stands going, "Boo, you lion.

513
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
 Eat his nuts.

514
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
 Eat his nuts."

515
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,600
 So, maybe that's why that explains why all those people you hate, and you don't know

516
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
 why you hate.

517
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,200
 They wanted a lion to bite your testicles in some past life.

518
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,520
 That's how you die in every iteration of you.

519
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,120
 You're like, "Oh no, you just got a baby pit bull.

520
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,600
 You just sit at home.

521
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,520
 The baby pit bull is cuddling up in your lap."

522
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,520
 You're like, "Oh no, the cycle begins anew."

523
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,280
 So anyways, she said, and then all the memories start come flooding back.

524
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,720
 She's like, "I can't deny that I'm Anne Frank anymore.

525
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
 I just can't."

526
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,240
 There's a bunch of Nazis out there, right?

527
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,720
 There's a bunch of Nazis out there.

528
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,160
 I want to keep running these guys.

529
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,600
 She ends up writing another book called "And the Wolves Howled."

530
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,760
 It's her life story.

531
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,720
 It's a story of two lives, her story of Anne Frank and her story as Barbro.

532
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,240
 It's interesting because one of Anne Frank's living relatives, I think Anne Frank's last

533
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,200
 living relative, kind of co-signed Barbro.

534
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,160
 They met on a book tour and he's like, "Yeah, I do believe that this is the reincarnation

535
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,840
 of my niece, Anne Frank."

536
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,880
 Which is a weird, again, a weird claim to make.

537
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,160
 I don't know how well this man knew Anne Frank.

538
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,840
 Maybe he knew her very well.

539
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,560
 And he sees the same mannerisms in Barbro.

540
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,800
 But today she wrote this book and she kind of went on tour.

541
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,840
 And it was a very, very big story.

542
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,000
 I'm surprised I'd never heard of this before.

543
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,040
 And nowadays though, she left Mounted Police.

544
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,400
 She's like, "There's much of Nazis who work from here."

545
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,320
 And they're like, "Oh, we hear that all the time."

546
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,720
 She leaves the Mounted Police.

547
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,360
 She ends up, nowadays, she's a horse trainer.

548
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,560
 She trains horse riders and she does dressage, which is like dancing horse stuff.

549
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,520
 The horses just like walk around the grass and rich people clap and then like the horse

550
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
 like jumps.

551
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,440
 I don't know.

552
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,400
 So anyways, she does that.

553
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,480
 It's a fascinating story.

554
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,800
 I've never heard of it before.

555
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
 I love stories that I haven't heard of.

556
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,560
 Reincarnation is one of those things that I think is fully plausible.

557
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,280
 Like my belief about what happened when you die, you die, you go to heaven.

558
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,240
 But I don't know.

559
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
 Right?

560
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,920
 And reincarnation is one of those things that it's not outside the realm of possibility

561
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
 for me.

562
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,880
 I would find it really fascinating to be reincarnated over and over again and working

563
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,840
 through your life struggles.

564
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,440
 Why would the two be mutually exclusive?

565
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,960
 Why can't you go through reincarnation until you get it right and then go to heaven?

566
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
 Right?

567
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
 So I don't know.

568
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,200
 I love stories about reincarnation.

569
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,440
 It's one of those things that I'm definitely open to.

570
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,600
 I am always a little suspicious, especially when people start pumping out books on this

571
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,920
 subject about how they're reincarnated of these great, powerful people.

572
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,880
 But you know, Anne Frank was not necessarily a powerful person.

573
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,480
 She was a young girl trying to survive in the midst of maelstrom.

574
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
 And she died.

575
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,720
 You know, her legacy survived, but she died.

576
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,920
 It's interesting though, because as I was reading the story, I thought, shouldn't, if

577
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,800
 you weren't truly the reincarnation of Anne Frank, don't you think you should be doing

578
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,520
 better things with your time?

579
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:46,960
 Like if I was reincarnation of like Martin Luther King Jr. and I was playing Fortnite

580
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,880
 all the time, it seemed like it would be a waste, especially if we're looking at reincarnation

581
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,800
 as moving your soul forward.

582
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:03,920
 Like you would think somebody who faced down evil was such calm, was such childlike calm,

583
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,600
 because that's what she was, right?

584
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,880
 Don't you think you would have a responsibility to be like a social leader, to be a politician,

585
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,600
 to be doing things, to make the world a better place, to guarantee that that never happens

586
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
 again?

587
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,840
 If you're the reincarnation of this great and grand person, don't you have a responsibility

588
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,920
 to carry on that mission?

589
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,000
 But then I was thinking about this as well.

590
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,680
 If you were a little girl, a little Jewish girl, born at really the worst time in the

591
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:51,120
 worst place to be Jewish, and your entire family was cramped into an attic, and you

592
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,480
 sat there, afraid, until people came in and pulled you out of it, and then took you to

593
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,240
 a camp, kept you there.

594
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:11,840
 Your last moments on earth, laying on a cot, surrounded by dozens of other people suffering

595
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:21,120
 these horrible diseases, the smell and the filth, the fear and the loneliness.

596
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:30,400
 If that was the way a little girl's life ended, what better way to enjoy the next existence

597
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:41,080
 by spending it riding horses, magnificent beasts carrying you across grassy fields,

598
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,040
 underneath a crisp blue sky?

599
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,520
 Maybe the point of reincarnation isn't to make the world a better place in the next

600
00:30:51,520 --> 00:31:02,000
 life, but it's to experience the joys that were taken from you in your previous existence.

601
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,560
 I don't know if Barbro's story is real, I don't know if reincarnation is real, but

602
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:14,680
 if they are real, what a beautiful way for the story of Anne Frank to continue.

603
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:22,600
 No longer a frightened little girl, now a grown woman, experiencing all the beauty the

604
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:32,040
 world has to offer.

605
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:44,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

606
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,560
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

607
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,160
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

608
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,920
 Have a great weekend guys.

609
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
 Come on Aunt May, let's go.

610
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
 Ooh, Peter.

611
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
 What?

612
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,760
 What do you say like that Aunt May?

613
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,800
 Well, you're not my Peter, you're from an alternate universe.

614
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,320
 I guess, but it's not, it's okay.

615
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
 It's okay.

616
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,800
 I'm not your real aunt.

617
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,360
 I'm just like, I'm Toby McGuire's aunt.

618
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,040
 I don't know, well, yeah, but you're kind of old.

619
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:19,200
 Hey, just because there's snow on the mountain doesn't mean there's not lava in the volcano.

620
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
 Aunt May.

621
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,780
 (upbeat music)

622
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,360
 (upbeat music)

623
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,940
 (upbeat music)

624
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,520
 (upbeat music)

625
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,100
 (upbeat music)

626
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,860
 - This is the story of a daughter

627
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,540
 of handstands, lemonade stands,

628
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,220
 and first corsages,

629
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,720
 and that perfect driver's license picture.

630
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,140
 - Travelers, this is Carlos.

631
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,980
 - Someone just hit my car.

632
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,260
 - Is everyone okay?

633
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,100
 Are you safe?

634
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,060
 - It's also the story of an insurance company

635
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,740
 that believes people always come first.

636
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,020
 If it matters to you,

637
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,220
 traveler's insurance will help protect it.

638
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,520
 Travelers, it's better under the umbrella.

639
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,560
 Speak to an independent agent today.
