00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 Is it possible to catch a miracle on video?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.840
 Would you feel comfortable sleeping in the same room where a man slid his own wrists?

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.320
 And then we take a look at the absolutely bizarre story, I'm shocked I've never heard

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.400
 of this before, about a woman who is claiming she is the reincarnation of Anne Frank.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.920
 Is it possible that a writer from Sweden may have proof that there truly is life after

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.600
 death today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:47.200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.960
 I'm your host Jason Garbner, I'm having a great day.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.200
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.680
 Hope you guys have some cool plans for the week and I'm gonna go see the new Spider-Man

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.200
 movie.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.800
 That looks cool, it's been a while since I've seen a superhero movie in the theater and

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.120
 I like Spider-Man and I guess in this movie, because you know how they have the different

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.760
 Spider-Man like the Tobey Maguire and the Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.480
 This is the first movie where they're gonna combine the universes so for the first time

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.720
 on screen we get to see all three versions of Aunt May and they say it's like I'm ex-war

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.720
 of you.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.760
 Just these old women walking around and yeah, so I can't wait to see Marissa Tormey and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.520
 Sally Fields which they want to remember and then the old lady from the Tobey Maguire,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.280
 Aunt May and yeah, I cannot wait.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.920
 It'll be, I just can't wait but I hope you guys have plans.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.520
 Hope you guys have aunt related plans as well.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.920
 Speaking of aunt related, it's not but I need to segue.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.240
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.160
 Everyone give it up for everyone's favorite aunt man, Alexander.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.480
 Alexander Healander, everyone give Alexander a big round of applause.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.440
 I'm recording this episode really late at night, this didn't clap so loud.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.680
 Alexander, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.880
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.480
 Trust me, I totally get it.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.080
 Just help spread the word about the show.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.440
 That really, really helps out a lot.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.920
 And then let's not get started just yet.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.040
 Actually, let's give a shout out for this awesome fan art for Fan Art Friday.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.520
 Take a look at this one.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.880
 These are miniatures created by one of our Patreon supporters.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.400
 I'm living in your walls.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.440
 I'm living in your walls.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.600
 He posted these up on the Patreon Discord.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.560
 These are the figures of Jay Son, the swamp wizard.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560
 That's me.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 That's me, the little mohawk.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.920
 And then his son, Mungo Jr.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920
 Or maybe he just called him Mungo.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.840
 I don't think he has a Mungo Jr.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.640
 But that is his frog son.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.800
 That's so dope.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.440
 They're doing a campaign and I'm an NPC.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.400
 I'm a swamp wizard with my boy Mungo.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 That's totally dope.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400
 That's amazing, right?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.600
 Like, who would have thought I would ever be?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 Who?

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 I mean, NPC and some dudes campaign.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.880
 Hopefully, for all I know, these guys are a bunch of lunatics in each game.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.680
 They're like, "Let's see who can torture Jay Son the most and make Mungo watch."

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680
 And I'm like, "No!"

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.360
 I'm trapped in this alternate universe.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.360
 But amazing.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.000
 That's so awesome.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Thank you so much.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 I'm living in your walls.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Really, really appreciate it.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Happy adventures to you and all of your players.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.040
 Alexander, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.200
 We are headed all the way out to an aircraft carrier.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.760
 Probably not the best thing to just sneak up on a US aircraft carrier in an unmarked

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.040
 Durgible, but we're going to do it.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.800
 We're going to live dangerously.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.920
 I recently got this sent over to me by Carson, longtime supporter of the show.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.360
 I think he was one of the original listeners of the show, honestly.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.800
 I think he was in the original 14 listeners.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.120
 Really good guy, a Patreon supporter, close personal friend, and he always sends me over

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.120
 quality stuff.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.920
 He sent me this thing over recently.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.200
 There was this post online where they were talking about, "Hey, veterans, anyone in the

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.320
 military, can you think of a paranormal or weird experience you had during your time

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.320
 serving?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.000
 And who doesn't like to hear stories like this?"

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.800
 Because at the very least, you're just going to hear maybe some cool war stories.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.760
 At the very most, you might actually get something paranormal related.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.000
 So Carson, thanks for sending this over.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.800
 Fascinating stuff.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.800
 First one we're going to look at.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800
 I got two of them.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 It's a really cool list.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.140
 The first one I got was posted by a guy named Silent Implosion.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.640
 This one was caught on video.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.160
 And at the time when it was on video, it was National Geographic was doing some sort of

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
 documentary.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.960
 So you had these camera crews on the deck of this aircraft carrier.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.720
 And it's September 11th, 2003.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.680
 And we're off the coast of Virginia and there's this aircraft carrier here and this jet is

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.680
 getting ready to take off.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.960
 And I put the video in the show notes.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.040
 You'll be able to watch this.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.040
 And just watching the video is a miracle.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.880
 But Silent Implosion gives us a little bit more backstory to this.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.200
 So what happens is this F-18, shh, shh, shh, people are doing the danger zone stuff.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.360
 They're like getting down.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.240
 They're moving their arms up.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.160
 And then the pilot's like, "Is it me that's supposed to go?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.560
 This is my first day flying a plane."

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.680
 And they're like, "Go, go, go!"

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.560
 And he starts to go down the flat part of the aircraft carrier, shh, flying into that

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.800
 danger zone.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.680
 And then the cable snaps.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.160
 Apparently there's a cable hooked up to these planes to make them fly.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.400
 You love this scientific description.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.360
 I could have easily done 15 minutes of research on this.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.800
 I was too busy watching the video.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.480
 And singing "Take My Breath Away."

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.800
 The jet is taken off and the arresting cable gets stuck.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.360
 And the plane goes over the edge of the aircraft carrier.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.360
 Now, not in a good way.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.000
 Because you're like, "Is that what planes do?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 They don't stay in the aircraft carrier forever.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.240
 If you love something, you have to let it fly away."

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.120
 It goes, it goes, it goes down into the water.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.640
 And I think the dude ejected.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.960
 I'm pretty sure he's fine.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.960
 But that's not paranormal.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.960
 That's just really good technology, working the way it's intended.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.360
 This cable snaps.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.160
 And silent implosion goes, this is what is expected.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.080
 When these cables snap, they whip down the rest of the aircraft carrier.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.280
 I mean, it's this giant tension thing.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.440
 And now it's going, "Waaaaaahhhhhh!"

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.920
 Dude, don't call me that.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920
 It actually made that noise.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.520
 I don't know if it made a Looney Tunes noise.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.800
 But on the video, as this cable is snapping, we see a guy in a yellow shirt, and they're

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.440
 called yellow shirts.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.840
 He's standing there, and the wire is coming, and he jumps up in the air.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.000
 He jumps over this super tensed up wire that's now snapped.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.600
 He jumps over it, he lands, and then he jumps over it again.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.760
 Now you're watching the video, and you're thinking, "Oh, you know, it's a huge cable.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.720
 It obviously is enough to, like, support an F-18."

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720
 And you may be thinking, "You know what?

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720
 It's a really thick cable.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720
 Maybe he saw it coming twice."

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.520
 And so I'm like, "Yeah, it's definitely possible."

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.000
 But then the camera, this is all caught on video.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.600
 The camera shows the plane go over, and then the camera kind of follows along with the

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600
 cable.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.600
 We see the yellow shirt jump twice, and then it continues to kind of pan and follow the

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:20.720
 cable, and you see people just getting knocked over, because they didn't see it coming.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.560
 Like, this one guy straight up had his back to it.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.680
 Yeah, it went, "Bong!"

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.120
 Again, don't call me on the sound effects, but it knocked a bunch of people over.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.120
 Seven.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120
 Seven, really.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.800
 Seven or eight soldiers got knocked down.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.880
 So silent implosion says, "Yeah, this is caught on video," but what happened was he

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.760
 was on the aircraft carrier.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.600
 And he talked to the yellow shirt, and the yellow shirt guy said, "I was standing there

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.600
 because it all happened so fast."

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.320
 This whole thing's happening so fast, he goes, "I'm standing there," and I imagine

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320
 this is your job.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.640
 So eventually, like, the first time you do it, you're probably like, "Whoa, that's what

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.360
 airplanes do when they take off?

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.360
 Awesome!"

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.760
 But then you've been on this aircraft carrier for like two years, you're no longer excited

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.760
 by it.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.240
 You're literally gonna turn your back to a billion dollar piece of machinery to find

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.240
 the laws of gravity.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.400
 But you're like, whatever.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.320
 So the cable snaps, and the yellow shirt says, this is what happened, he goes, "I'm standing

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.080
 there," and I heard a voice in my head say, "Jump!"

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.200
 So I jumped.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.800
 I did not know what was coming.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.560
 I did not see what was coming.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.680
 I heard a voice say, "Jump!"

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.360
 And I jumped.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.400
 And when I landed, the voice returned and said, "Again."

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.000
 And I jumped.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.960
 The other seven or eight servicemen did have to be lifted off.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.800
 And silent implosion goes, they didn't hear any voices.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.880
 So it's possible that they suffered injuries, obviously, but maybe this would have killed

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.880
 the yellow shirt, and maybe this was a guardian angel, time traveler, alt...

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.880
 I mean, isn't that...

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.560
 And that's a really cool story, because we have the video evidence, we know that it

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.680
 happened.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.400
 And now we're getting this paranormal answer for it.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.520
 It's a really, really cool story.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.920
 Alexander, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.320
 Let's jump off this aircraft carrier.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.920
 We're headed all the way out to Fort Sam in Texas.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:19.560
 I said in the intro, "How would you feel about sleeping in a room where somebody has slit

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.560
 their wrist?"

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.680
 Or really, sleeping in a room where you know someone has died.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.200
 And I think a lot of people would be weirded out about it.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.440
 Some people wouldn't be.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.360
 But I have a friend in the home lending mortgage business and stuff like that, and they were

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.520
 telling me that every home...

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.200
 I'm not going to say your name because I don't...

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.360
 This is part of a business I don't want to interfere with it, but basically she was

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.000
 saying, "In a way, every home, someone's died in it."

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.560
 And there's a reason why every home has someone who's died in it.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.160
 Where do you want to die?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.320
 You want to die at home.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.280
 Most people want to die in their homes.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.880
 And so they choose to die in their homes, right?

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.880
 And I'm not talking about suicide, but if you're really sick, are you going to go to the hospice?

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.880
 You're going to go to the hospital?

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.080
 You're going to go to the retirement home?

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.480
 Or are you just going to spend the rest of your days in the place you're the most comfortable?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.440
 So pretty much every living space, unless it's a brand new house, someone's died in there.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.960
 In that place where they built that brand new house, there was probably hundreds of years

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:27.360
 of people getting their heads split open and settlers coming and like torching native encampments

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.000
 and all sorts of stuff, right?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 You'd have all this stuff.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.800
 You'd have brigands, shooting dudes in the back of the skull and stealing their gold.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.520
 So no matter where you're at, you're basically having a chance to be on cursed land.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.560
 People have been everywhere at this point, but people always are dying at home, but we're

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.640
 not at home.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.640
 We're not at home.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.200
 And I think like this house, I've talked about being haunted, my closet's haunted and

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:56.000
 stuff like that, but because I've made it my home, my energy is here and it's intermingling

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.120
 with some of the other energy here.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.160
 But on a military base, is it ever really your home?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160
 You're basically there.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.160
 That's where you're stationed.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.160
 You might have on base housing.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.960
 That's not the situation here at Fort Sam.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.840
 Apparently this was posted by someone going by the name 27 Letters.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.960
 They were saying that they had gotten put on restriction.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.880
 They're in school, in the military, this is in Dennis the Menace.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.880
 They're doing this thing and they got put on restriction.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.480
 So they're sent to this different facility, this different part of the base where that's

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.760
 where they are going to be staying at this point.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.600
 That was going to be their room.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.960
 And he goes, "This room, it just really had bad vibes."

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.640
 And that would make sense just from a paranormal aspect.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.360
 You'd have a lot of people, this is your career.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.160
 You're joining the military to maybe leave behind your small town or to start a career

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.200
 in the military, maybe it's a family gig.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.960
 And you're in this room because you've done something wrong.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.280
 You might be getting demoted.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.440
 You might be getting kicked out of your career.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.880
 You might be getting fired, right?

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.440
 So there's going to be a lot of negative energy in this room.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.320
 It's a place where people don't want to be.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.400
 So he's in there and he has a roommate in this room and he just gets the weirdest feeling.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.200
 He goes, "I don't like this place."

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:13.120
 Now, you guys already know a little bit because obviously, even away in the intro, so you

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.440
 guys know a little bit more than this dude, we'll call this guy Mike.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.400
 One night, Mike wakes up and he sees his bed buddy.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.000
 So they're not literally laying next to each other, but there's two beds in there.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.480
 And his buddy is sleeping in the bed next to him, right?

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:38.000
 But when Mike wakes up, he sees his roommate standing at the foot of his bed, staring at

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 him.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.120
 Now, this room's already creepy.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.240
 It's already not the best place to be.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.480
 He knows that he's in trouble, so he's not in the best mental state.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.000
 And he can't figure out why his buddy's just standing there.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.480
 But whatever, right?

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.880
 Military, sometimes it brings in a bunch of wackos, so he just goes back to sleep.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:06.400
 Next morning, he wakes up and his buddy, the bunkmate, will call him Larry.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.440
 Larry goes, "Hey, Mike, dude.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.440
 I know that we're cool and all, but what was up with you standing at the foot of my bed

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.440
 last night?"

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.440
 Mike's like, "What are you talking about?

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.120
 I wasn't standing at the foot of your bed."

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.720
 And Larry goes, "Listen, dude, I woke up in the middle of the night.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:26.120
 You were standing at the foot of my bed, and I was not able to go back to sleep.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.720
 You were just standing at the foot of my bed staring at me.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.160
 It was terrifying."

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.080
 And Mike goes, "Okay, when did that happen?"

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.120
 And Larry said, "It happened over whatever time.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.440
 It's just 3 AM.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.840
 The spooky is time."

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.600
 And Mike realizes that's when he woke up and saw Larry standing at the foot of his own

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.120
 bed, of Mike's bed.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.040
 So they go to the staff sergeant, they go to the person in charge, whoever it is, and

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.760
 they say, "Hey, I know we're on restriction and all that stuff, but is it possible we

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.680
 can get another room because we already thought that room was spooky, but something happened

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.680
 last night and we were standing at the foot of each other's bed and the dude's like, "Oh,

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.680
 I'm going to stop you guys right there.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.840
 I'm going to stop you guys right there because I have to sleep as well."

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.800
 That room, I'm not going to say it's haunted.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.000
 Officially, I'm not going to say that it's haunted, but let me tell you what happened.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.440
 Long time ago, they get a little campfire, they're cooking s'mores all of a sudden.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:26.720
 A long time ago, on a day just like this, an instructor got busted down, right?

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.920
 It actually wasn't a long time ago.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.520
 I looked back over and my notes, it was a year ago.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.760
 This happened the year before Mike and Larry got involved in this, but a year ago there

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.280
 was an instructor on base who got busted down, was doing something wrong, and got put on

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.960
 restriction and had to stay in this room.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.320
 And then they caught him using his cell phone, which apparently you're not supposed to do

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320
 in the military.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.320
 Is that a thing?

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.800
 Got put on restriction, got caught using his cell phone, was going to get demoted, was actually

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.600
 going to lose rank, lose pay, and he was totally freaking out.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.400
 He was freaking out so much that other people were like, "Dude, you need to calm down.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.360
 You're acting really, really weird."

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.520
 But he couldn't calm him down.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.720
 They go, "It's really not a big deal.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.920
 You'll just work your way back up.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.040
 It's not a huge thing."

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.440
 But one day he goes in the room and the next morning they find him and he had slit his

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.420
 wrist and OD'd on drugs at the same time, which a lot of people do that when they're

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.420
 committing suicide.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.080
 They'll do more than one.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.320
 This guy killed himself and because he had OD'd and he slit his wrist, they said there

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.720
 was blood and puke everywhere.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:35.080
 So he's vomiting it up all the toxins and he's bleeding out and thus ends the life of this

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.080
 instructor.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.480
 Now, is this story true?

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.480
 We don't know.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.760
 We were able to see video evidence of the first one.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760
 Is this story true?

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760
 We don't know.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.480
 But it's interesting nonetheless.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.480
 It's creepy.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.240
 Obviously anything where you wake up and you're seeing something at the foot of your bed that's

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.800
 just instinctively creepy because we're in our most vulnerable state.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.360
 It's interesting that each person is seeing the other person at the foot of the bed.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.800
 My question would be if they...

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.080
 None of them ever seemed to look at the other bed.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.640
 If they did, was it empty?

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.960
 Like if Larry looked and he saw Mike standing at the foot of the bed and then looked over

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.480
 and saw Mike sleeping, then you would know it was a ghost.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.840
 But the more disturbing answer would be Larry waking up seeing Mike at the foot of the bed

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.800
 and then looking over and the bed's empty.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.400
 So that means it really is Mike standing at the foot of the bed.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.000
 Or this demon, this spirit, this vengeful phantasm has the ability to assume the shape

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 of someone else and hide their original form from view.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.920
 Both are equally terrifying, right?

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.360
 Both are equally terrifying if a ghost can actually make you not see something that's

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.360
 there.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.280
 So, yeah, really, really creepy story either way.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.320
 And again, Carson, thanks for standing over.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.480
 27 letters in silent implosion for sharing that with us as well.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.480
 Alexander, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbindercopter.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.480
 We are saying goodbye to Fort Sam.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.480
 They're like, "No, we still need a new room.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.480
 Don't leave us in here."

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.600
 They're locking the door.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.600
 Start the experiments.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.600
 We're leaving.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.600
 We're leaving.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.480
 Goodbye to these guys as they're banging on the door and these ghosts are sneaking up

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.480
 behind them.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.440
 Alexander, we're leaving behind Fort Sam.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.960
 Take us all the way out to Sweden.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.720
 I gotta give a shout out for this story.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.200
 I had never heard this story.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.560
 It's still fascinating to me.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.960
 I think people, long-time listeners of the show know one of the hallmarks of this show

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.520
 is finding stuff that's super obscure.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.360
 Like I like to cover stuff that I've never heard of, but every show often I can, and

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.000
 I research this stuff all the time, so if I haven't heard of it, it's very likely that

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.520
 most people haven't heard of it.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.880
 But every show often I come across a story and I'm thinking, "How have I not heard this

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.880
 before?"

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.400
 How do I not know this story?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.400
 This seems...

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400
 It's older, right?

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.520
 It's from like the 70s to 60s to 70s.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.680
 It's just super weird.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.680
 Let's just get into it.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.600
 I'm shocked that I hadn't heard of this, but I want to give a shout out to Brent Swancer

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.960
 from Mysterious Universe.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.960
 He wrote this...

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.080
 I've never heard this story before.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.520
 He recently wrote an article about it and I got a lot of information from it and just...

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.000
 It's awesome that we're still...

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.360
 I've been in this game for 30 years.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.400
 More 33 years at this point and I'm still learning new stuff.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.800
 And I love sharing that stuff with you.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.720
 There's a woman in Sweden named Barbara Carlin.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.480
 But before she's a woman, she's a baby girl.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.480
 Me!

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.480
 Me!

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.480
 Me!

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.400
 The mom's like holding the baby and goes, "I won't name you Barbara."

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.960
 Because in Sweden that's a normal name.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.520
 She constantly has nightmares.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.520
 Oh no!

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.000
 Mommy, I had the nightmare again.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 The men in the uniforms took...

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.400
 I don't know why I'm building up the suspense.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.400
 You've seen the title of the episode.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.400
 I mentioned it in the intro.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400
 It took...

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.240
 I was like, "Flong ago, back in 1940s."

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.320
 You guys know what it is.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.640
 Barbara Carlin.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.760
 I had a bunch more notes.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.720
 I had a bunch more notes where I was going to build the story up.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:06.400
 And then you were going to find out that Barbara is actually the reincarnation of Anne Frank.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.200
 So, Anne Frank, quick overview.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.480
 I'm sure everyone's familiar with Anne Frank, but you never really know.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.720
 Anne Frank, young Jewish girl.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.320
 The Nazis were rounding up all of the Jews.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.000
 And her and her family lived in an attic for a couple months.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.720
 And eventually the Nazis found them and pulled the family out of the attic.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720
 And she died.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.800
 She died in the camp.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.800
 You have that.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.040
 So, young girl, she's writing the diary of Anne Frank.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.960
 So we get to see this story from this young woman's point of view.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.320
 This massive historical event from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.720
 And it's a great book.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.240
 It's pretty much read in every school because on the one hand, it's well-written.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.600
 And it's a great way for kids.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.400
 It has a lot of good vocabulary for kids to read, right?

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:55.040
 And on the other hand, it's just a tale of horror in the resiliency of the human spirit,

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.040
 right?

00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:01.040
 It's just so it works on a literary level and it works just on a human level.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.320
 So when Barbara, though, she's born in 1954, we all know who Anne Frank is today, but she

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.560
 was born in 1954.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.840
 The diary of Anne Frank was written in 1947.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.360
 And I can't say that it was a huge blockbuster.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.360
 I don't think many people would read it if it wasn't required reading in school, honestly.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.920
 So she says, "Listen, I didn't know about Anne Frank.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.880
 We didn't really know about Anne Frank in Sweden.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.840
 Is there a shift from side to side?"

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.680
 Because, I mean, maybe not, right?

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.640
 Maybe if you were there at the time you knew about her or when the book was being published,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.960
 I'm sure there was a lot of publicity.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:38.000
 But in 1954, and the story, as far as I know at that time, wasn't required reading in Sweden.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.600
 It may not even be required reading.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.680
 Now, but she says she didn't know who Anne Frank was, but she knew her name was Anne Frank.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.080
 And she knew that since the age of three.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.880
 Now she started talking about being Anne Frank and she started saying, "I have these nightmares

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.720
 about these men in uniforms kicking down the doors and taking me away."

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.840
 And this is going on for so long her parents take her to a psychiatrist.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.680
 And the psychiatrist, apparently, does not know anything about Anne Frank either.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.840
 Because they go, "Oh, you imaginary friends.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.840
 Imaginary friends.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.840
 They just happen, right?"

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.200
 You never see this person as who this Anne Frank is.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.520
 It's a passing phase.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.520
 She'll get over it.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:23.320
 Now, Barbro may have just fade into obscurity at this point and just go, "Oh, you know,

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.080
 maybe, maybe I don't really have these memories.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.240
 Maybe it is a passing phase, whatever."

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.600
 Or she could have continued to think she was this person named Anne Frank.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.280
 But the reason why we're talking about Barbro today, other than her making this claim, is

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.520
 she is a famous author.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.080
 And she actually, well, in Sweden, let me put a little asterisk next to that in Sweden.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.640
 She started writing, she's like a wonder kind when it comes to writing.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.560
 She published her first book of poetry by age 12.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:58.560
 And by the time she was 16, she had 11 books published, including prose as well as poetry.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.040
 And at this point, she kind of stops talking about Anne Frank, not because she doesn't

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.560
 believe it, because it constantly just brings about ridicule and a bunch of questions are

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.560
 being asked.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.240
 But at this point, I believe they know Anne Frank is real.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.480
 One point, they're going through a tour of Europe and they end up in Amsterdam and they

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.560
 go, "Hey, let's check out the Anne Frank house."

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.800
 Which is weird, right?

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.480
 If you're, you thought your daughter had some sort of mental illness connected to Anne Frank

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.000
 and then you found out Anne Frank was a real person and then you just happened to be in

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.760
 the country where the story took place, would you go to the house?

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.520
 I think it would depend on if you thought your daughter was stable enough.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.920
 But they go to the house and she's walking around and she goes, "Oh, I totally remember

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.920
 this place."

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.320
 This place brings, this place brings back such horrible memories.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:50.720
 And they're walking around and they go upstairs to like the crawl space, the attic.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.080
 And she starts to have a panic attack.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.560
 "Oh no, this is awful up here."

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.360
 And I guess there was like a smaller room that Anne Frank was actually like hanging

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.280
 out in like her own little room.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.920
 And Barbara goes in that room and she opens the door and she goes, "Oh, look at the photos.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.400
 The photos of the movie stars are still on the wall."

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.000
 And so apparently Anne Frank, it's been years since I read the book, I guess this part's

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 in here.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.960
 She's just cutting out a movie star picture, which is so funny.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.400
 It just shows how kids never change.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:25.000
 Basically, she had the equivalent of Jonathan Taylor Thomas photos from TigerBee Magazine.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.240
 She had them of stars of the day on the wall.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.800
 And Barbara goes, "Look, the photos are still here."

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.600
 And she's saying that to her mom and her mom goes, "What photos?"

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.800
 And Barbara looks back at her mom and then when she looks back to the wall, the wall

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.800
 is bare.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.560
 There's nothing there.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.760
 I guess that they ended up asking the tour guide about the photos.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.400
 Like, hey, there used to be photos on the wall up there.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.120
 And the tour guide goes, "Oh, yeah, we actually took them down recently because we're going

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.360
 to put them under glass because people were scribbling on them.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.000
 They're like, "Oh, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, you're the sexiest."

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.080
 They're writing little hearts on there.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.140
 And so the implication is that she was seen into the past.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.480
 She was seen through Anne Frank's eyes.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.080
 And at this point, so now she kind of believes that this is true.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.880
 Like she's kind of had some vindication.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.080
 She had a mild hallucination.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.320
 So she does at this point, seems to totally grow out of this belief.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320
 She's Anne Frank.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.440
 She joins the Swedish police services, a mounted officer.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.520
 But while she is moving on with her life, you know, sure, I'm Anne Frank, but you know,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.320
 I got other stuff to do now.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.080
 She's riding her horse, chasing down criminals.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.360
 There's another officer she absolutely hates.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.200
 And she's like, "I don't know why I don't like that guy.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.480
 But I just know I hate his guts."

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.640
 And then she finds out.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.640
 I don't know how she finds out.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.480
 I don't know if she rummages through her garbage or if she found out surfing the Astral Plain.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:59.160
 But she finds out that this cop that she doesn't like, who she randomly hates, is actually

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.800
 the reincarnation of a Nazi guard.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.600
 Wouldn't that be interesting?

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.200
 Think about all the people that you've disliked or haven't trusted just instinctively.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.960
 And we go, "Ah, he just gives off a weird vibe."

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.760
 What if that person killed us in a past life?

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.360
 Or maybe not killed us, but maybe they cheered on our death.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.720
 Maybe as you were some gladiator back in ancient Roman times and you were hacking a lion with

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.720
 a sword.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.960
 There was a dude in the stands going, "Boo, you lion.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.960
 Eat his nuts.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.960
 Eat his nuts."

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.600
 So, maybe that's why that explains why all those people you hate, and you don't know

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.600
 why you hate.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.200
 They wanted a lion to bite your testicles in some past life.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.520
 That's how you die in every iteration of you.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.120
 You're like, "Oh no, you just got a baby pit bull.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.600
 You just sit at home.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.520
 The baby pit bull is cuddling up in your lap."

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.520
 You're like, "Oh no, the cycle begins anew."

00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.280
 So anyways, she said, and then all the memories start come flooding back.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.720
 She's like, "I can't deny that I'm Anne Frank anymore.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.720
 I just can't."

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.240
 There's a bunch of Nazis out there, right?

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.720
 There's a bunch of Nazis out there.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.160
 I want to keep running these guys.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.600
 She ends up writing another book called "And the Wolves Howled."

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.760
 It's her life story.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.720
 It's a story of two lives, her story of Anne Frank and her story as Barbro.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:27.240
 It's interesting because one of Anne Frank's living relatives, I think Anne Frank's last

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.200
 living relative, kind of co-signed Barbro.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.160
 They met on a book tour and he's like, "Yeah, I do believe that this is the reincarnation

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.840
 of my niece, Anne Frank."

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.880
 Which is a weird, again, a weird claim to make.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.160
 I don't know how well this man knew Anne Frank.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.840
 Maybe he knew her very well.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.560
 And he sees the same mannerisms in Barbro.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.800
 But today she wrote this book and she kind of went on tour.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.840
 And it was a very, very big story.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.000
 I'm surprised I'd never heard of this before.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.040
 And nowadays though, she left Mounted Police.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.400
 She's like, "There's much of Nazis who work from here."

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.320
 And they're like, "Oh, we hear that all the time."

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.720
 She leaves the Mounted Police.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.360
 She ends up, nowadays, she's a horse trainer.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.560
 She trains horse riders and she does dressage, which is like dancing horse stuff.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.520
 The horses just like walk around the grass and rich people clap and then like the horse

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.520
 like jumps.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.440
 I don't know.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.400
 So anyways, she does that.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.480
 It's a fascinating story.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.800
 I've never heard of it before.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.800
 I love stories that I haven't heard of.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.560
 Reincarnation is one of those things that I think is fully plausible.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.280
 Like my belief about what happened when you die, you die, you go to heaven.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.240
 But I don't know.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.240
 Right?

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.920
 And reincarnation is one of those things that it's not outside the realm of possibility

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.920
 for me.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.880
 I would find it really fascinating to be reincarnated over and over again and working

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.840
 through your life struggles.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.440
 Why would the two be mutually exclusive?

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.960
 Why can't you go through reincarnation until you get it right and then go to heaven?

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.960
 Right?

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.960
 So I don't know.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.200
 I love stories about reincarnation.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.440
 It's one of those things that I'm definitely open to.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.600
 I am always a little suspicious, especially when people start pumping out books on this

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:13.920
 subject about how they're reincarnated of these great, powerful people.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.880
 But you know, Anne Frank was not necessarily a powerful person.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.480
 She was a young girl trying to survive in the midst of maelstrom.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.480
 And she died.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.720
 You know, her legacy survived, but she died.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.920
 It's interesting though, because as I was reading the story, I thought, shouldn't, if

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.800
 you weren't truly the reincarnation of Anne Frank, don't you think you should be doing

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.520
 better things with your time?

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:46.960
 Like if I was reincarnation of like Martin Luther King Jr. and I was playing Fortnite

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.880
 all the time, it seemed like it would be a waste, especially if we're looking at reincarnation

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.800
 as moving your soul forward.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:03.920
 Like you would think somebody who faced down evil was such calm, was such childlike calm,

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.600
 because that's what she was, right?

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:14.880
 Don't you think you would have a responsibility to be like a social leader, to be a politician,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.600
 to be doing things, to make the world a better place, to guarantee that that never happens

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.600
 again?

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.840
 If you're the reincarnation of this great and grand person, don't you have a responsibility

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.920
 to carry on that mission?

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.000
 But then I was thinking about this as well.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:43.680
 If you were a little girl, a little Jewish girl, born at really the worst time in the

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:51.120
 worst place to be Jewish, and your entire family was cramped into an attic, and you

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:58.480
 sat there, afraid, until people came in and pulled you out of it, and then took you to

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.240
 a camp, kept you there.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:11.840
 Your last moments on earth, laying on a cot, surrounded by dozens of other people suffering

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:21.120
 these horrible diseases, the smell and the filth, the fear and the loneliness.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:30.400
 If that was the way a little girl's life ended, what better way to enjoy the next existence

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:41.080
 by spending it riding horses, magnificent beasts carrying you across grassy fields,

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:47.040
 underneath a crisp blue sky?

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.520
 Maybe the point of reincarnation isn't to make the world a better place in the next

00:30:51.520 --> 00:31:02.000
 life, but it's to experience the joys that were taken from you in your previous existence.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.560
 I don't know if Barbro's story is real, I don't know if reincarnation is real, but

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:14.680
 if they are real, what a beautiful way for the story of Anne Frank to continue.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:22.600
 No longer a frightened little girl, now a grown woman, experiencing all the beauty the

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:32.040
 world has to offer.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:44.000
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.560
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.160
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.920
 Have a great weekend guys.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.920
 Come on Aunt May, let's go.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.920
 Ooh, Peter.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.920
 What?

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.760
 What do you say like that Aunt May?

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.800
 Well, you're not my Peter, you're from an alternate universe.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.320
 I guess, but it's not, it's okay.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320
 It's okay.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.800
 I'm not your real aunt.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.360
 I'm just like, I'm Toby McGuire's aunt.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.040
 I don't know, well, yeah, but you're kind of old.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:19.200
 Hey, just because there's snow on the mountain doesn't mean there's not lava in the volcano.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.200
 Aunt May.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.780
 (upbeat music)

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.360
 (upbeat music)

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.940
 (upbeat music)

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.520
 (upbeat music)

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.100
 (upbeat music)

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.860
 - This is the story of a daughter

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.540
 of handstands, lemonade stands,

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.220
 and first corsages,

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.720
 and that perfect driver's license picture.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.140
 - Travelers, this is Carlos.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.980
 - Someone just hit my car.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.260
 - Is everyone okay?

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.100
 Are you safe?

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.060
 - It's also the story of an insurance company

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.740
 that believes people always come first.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.020
 If it matters to you,

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.220
 traveler's insurance will help protect it.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.520
 Travelers, it's better under the umbrella.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.560
 Speak to an independent agent today.
