1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 It's the gentle ocean breeze that sweeps you off your feet.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,140
 The 99 holes of championship golf that offer endless possibilities.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,580
 The small town southern charm that embraces you everywhere you go.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,900
 From the beaches in the east to the marshes in the west,

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,900
 there's a special feeling you get on Amelia Island.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,480
 It's a real thing.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,140
 It's an island thing.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,900
 Make it your thing.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,180
 Start planning your Northeast Lorda Beach Escape now at ameliaisland.com.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,700
 A young man visits the doctor,

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,580
 complaining of excruciating testicular pain.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,480
 Little did he know he was about to make medical history.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,380
 Now we meet a man who claims that the second coming of Christ already walks among us.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,380
 He's actually doing interviews with CNN trying to announce to the world his glory.

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,580
 But the mainstream media is silencing Jesus Christ today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:10,380
 [Music]

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
 I'm having a great day.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,380
 Hope you guys have some fun plans for this weekend.

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,580
 I want to give you guys a heads up.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,480
 Next week will be the last week of season 15.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,680
 After next week, I'm going to take two weeks off.

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,780
 I really didn't want to do this in October, but it's just the way that everything worked out.

26
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,780
 I got to take my two weeks off every 50 episodes just to recharge.

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,380
 Otherwise, I don't want the show to ever become a chore, right?

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,180
 And so I need these two weeks too.

29
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,280
 But we're going to do one more week at the beginning of October.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,880
 We're going to have my birthday episode.

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,280
 You're like, "Woohoo, Jason."

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,780
 And then, and then after that amazing spectacular,

33
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,180
 I'm going to continue the week.

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,680
 There'll be other episodes, right?

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,780
 That's not the last one.

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,180
 I'll take two weeks off and then we'll be back for the week before Halloween.

37
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,280
 So I got some goodness planned, but I just don't have the energy to do it right now.

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,080
 But you know who has tons of energy.

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,780
 One of our legacy Patreon supporters, a longtime supporter of the show, a longtime YouTube supporter.

40
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,780
 Give it up for Team Ad.

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,380
 Everyone give a round of applause to Team Ad as he's walking into Dead or Abicum, man.

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,780
 Team Ad, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

43
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,680
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,380
 Just help spread the word about you.

45
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,980
 You're not going to want to support the Patreon after this episode.

46
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,180
 You're like, "I don't know what episode I'm going to end up on."

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,880
 But if you can't support the Patreon even after this episode,

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,280
 that's okay. Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,680
 Team Ad, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit robot.

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,480
 We are sailing all the way out to a hospital somewhere.

52
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,880
 Oh, that's us. That's us rowing this boat.

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,880
 This isn't from a medical journal.

54
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,780
 So we don't have names. We don't have locations.

55
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,680
 This guy's secret must be kept.

56
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,380
 I'm sure the scientists after they finished writing this report,

57
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,880
 they all just shot themselves in the head.

58
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,580
 They're like, "This knowledge is too horrible for this world."

59
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,880
 In this medical journal, it tells the story of a man.

60
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,180
 Let's call him Keith.

61
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,280
 Keith is a 33-year-old man.

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 Now, he has a history of illegal drug use.

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,280
 So smoking the doobie, maybe like eating some mushrooms,

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,780
 maybe a little cocaine here and there.

65
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,580
 But it's in the past. He doesn't do them.

66
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,380
 He's not in the doctor's.

67
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,780
 At least he comes in. He's all shaken up and he's vein killers.

68
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,180
 He has a history of illegal drug use.

69
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,580
 He goes to the hospital and he's like, "Doc, you got to treat me.

70
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,480
 My testicles hurt really, really bad."

71
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,180
 The doctors start asking questions like,

72
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,680
 "Okay, how long have they hurt?"

73
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,680
 And his answer is the first part of this bizarre mystery.

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,680
 So I'm going to post it to you.

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,080
 "How long and how many days would it take for your testicles to hurt

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,280
 before you went to the doctor?"

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,380
 And ladies, you're ovaries.

78
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,680
 It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

79
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,480
 Anything down there, how many days would you have to say

80
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,580
 you use the term excruciating pain?

81
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,280
 Right?

82
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,680
 "How many days would your testicles or ovaries have to hurt

83
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,780
 before you went to the doctor?"

84
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,680
 Me, zero, right?

85
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,780
 A good three hours.

86
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,280
 I'm like, "Ahh, I can't take it anymore."

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,880
 He waited five days.

88
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,380
 He must not have insurance or something.

89
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,080
 I don't know.

90
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
 Or he's just like, "Oh, it'll go away.

91
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,680
 It'll go away as they're throbbing, cartoon-like.

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,380
 They're like the size of grapefruits.

93
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,880
 Anyways, five days of excruciating testicular pain.

94
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,980
 And while he's there, this is not why he went to the doctor.

95
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,180
 The testicular pain is not the reason why he's in a medical journal.

96
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,680
 That's normal, unfortunately.

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,480
 As they're treating this testicle pain, he goes,

98
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,880
 "Hey, you know, while I'm here, I was wondering if you could

99
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
 take a look at something else while you're down there,

100
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,780
 while you're in that region?"

101
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,380
 There's been this weird thing that's going on.

102
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,080
 Um...

103
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,180
 Pfft.

104
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,380
 And the doctor's like, "What?

105
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,380
 That's weird."

106
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,580
 I mean, he's a veteran doctor, right?

107
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,580
 This isn't his first time someone's passed gas in his facility.

108
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,480
 He realizes he's like, "Check in this guy's testicles out."

109
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
 And his face gets farted on.

110
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,580
 That's weird.

111
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,680
 This man, I'm looking right at his crotch,

112
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,180
 and he clearly farted on my face.

113
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,080
 How did that happen?

114
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,980
 He's thinking, "The doctor...

115
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,880
 The doctor's flummoxed!"

116
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,980
 That doesn't make any sense.

117
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,880
 If he was behind him, the fart would have hit his face,

118
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,480
 but he felt like the gas.

119
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,980
 He felt like the air pressure changed.

120
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,380
 He's like, "What?"

121
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,280
 And Keith goes, "Oh, yeah, sorry.

122
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,080
 Since you're down there, I probably should have warned you.

123
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,680
 I passed gas out of my penis."

124
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,780
 This is a true story.

125
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,680
 This isn't a set-up for a joke or anything like that.

126
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,780
 This guy, when he farts, it comes out of his penis.

127
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
 And the doctor's like, "That's ridiculous.

128
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,380
 That's ridiculous.

129
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,080
 He's giving him a bunch of root beer.

130
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
 He's giving him a bunch of beans to make him carbonated."

131
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,180
 He's like, "We must test this."

132
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,980
 And then the guy goes, "Okay, to be fair,

133
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,480
 I don't know if it happened in this sequence of events.

134
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,380
 The medical journal just had these four symptoms.

135
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,280
 But in our version of it, Keith goes,

136
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,180
 "Oh, you know what?

137
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,580
 You made me eat all those beans

138
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,080
 because you have some weird fart finish, you big pervert."

139
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
 I have to go to the bathroom.

140
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,080
 I have to go number two.

141
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,380
 So he goes to a urinal,

142
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,480
 which is just conveniently in the doctor's office

143
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,180
 for the sake of the narrative.

144
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,480
 And the doctor's like, "That's weird.

145
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,380
 He said he was going to go number two,

146
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,880
 which is the universal thing for poop.

147
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,380
 But he's facing..."

148
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,080
 No.

149
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,780
 No way.

150
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,880
 And the doctor's watching the doctor develop

151
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,380
 the new fetish this day.

152
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,580
 This is true.

153
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,780
 This is true.

154
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,680
 The guy begins pooping.

155
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,280
 I can't believe this is true,

156
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,980
 but it is this guy begins pooping out of his penis.

157
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,180
 Now you go, Jason.

158
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,180
 This is clearly fake.

159
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,880
 Did you find this on April Fool's Day?

160
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,980
 This is clearly not true.

161
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,580
 Well, I didn't find it on April Fool's Day.

162
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,480
 But I did find it in the India Times.

163
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,380
 So, but anyways, there is a...

164
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,080
 Everyone just shut off the podcast.

165
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,480
 Even people in India, they're like,

166
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,480
 "That's a rag. Click."

167
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,980
 I did find the medical journal it was reported on.

168
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,280
 It was reported in Cures.com,

169
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,080
 which actually now sounds like a totally fake medical journal.

170
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,580
 It's funny because you read stuff all the time,

171
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,680
 but you don't pronounce it out loud.

172
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,180
 Cures.com.

173
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,180
 So, I haven't even got...

174
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,880
 I have not even gotten to the title of...

175
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,980
 None of this is the title of it, right?

176
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,180
 The Man Who Peed Poop.

177
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,680
 They could have titled it "The Man Who Farts Out of His Weaner."

178
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,180
 No, we haven't even got to the title of this medical journal article yet,

179
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,480
 because that is weird,

180
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,880
 but it's not as weird as we're going.

181
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,180
 So, the doctor's like, "Oh my God, oh my God,

182
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,780
 I have to videotape this on a creepy old VHS camera and save it for later."

183
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,280
 But the doctor goes, "Okay, so you poop out of your penis

184
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,780
 and you fart out of your penis.

185
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,580
 Would that mean..."

186
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,280
 He's just like, "You've guessed it.

187
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,880
 You've guessed it, young man."

188
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,380
 And then, he pees out of his butt hole.

189
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,980
 But that is not the name of the article, either.

190
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,580
 Because what he can do...

191
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,280
 to my remaining two listeners...

192
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,880
 What this man can do...

193
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,380
 This is the name of the paper...

194
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,980
 He...

195
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:59,080
 Can he "jaculate out of his butt hole"?

196
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,480
 I think the term that was used was "copious amounts of semen."

197
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
 Which is...

198
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,880
 Which really, I think should be any amount, right?

199
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,680
 If your semen is coming out of your butt hole,

200
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,380
 it doesn't matter if it's a teaspoon or a gallon, right?

201
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,880
 That's just too much.

202
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
 And he can "jaculate out of his butt hole."

203
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
 This hat...

204
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
 This went on...

205
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,380
 For two years.

206
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,080
 He never went to the doctor for this.

207
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,580
 So, again, I ask...

208
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,380
 How often would you have to "jaculate out of his butt hole"?

209
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,080
 Before you went to the doctor!

210
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,380
 Because I'm sure this guy was out on dates, right?

211
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,580
 He's meeting a hot girl...

212
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,080
 I mean, what I'm not even gonna go into detail.

213
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,180
 I think you guys know exactly where that was headed.

214
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,880
 Two years.

215
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,780
 And so the doctors are like...

216
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,580
 Here's the thing.

217
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,180
 There's x-rays with this...

218
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,280
 There's this medical journal and they said...

219
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,680
 They kept asking him over and over again,

220
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,980
 "Have you ever put anything up your butt?"

221
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,580
 And he's like, "No!"

222
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,980
 And they're like, "Mmm, let's rephrase that question."

223
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,980
 "Have any objects ever gone into your anus?"

224
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,680
 He's like, "No, that's the same question.

225
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,180
 You just use different words."

226
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,680
 Because that's all they can think of.

227
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,480
 Something...

228
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,780
 Because here's the rub!

229
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,080
 This can happen to you!

230
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,680
 But maybe not the first part.

231
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
 So for...

232
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,980
 Maybe this one happened to you.

233
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,580
 The first thing is he went on a cocaine and PCP binge.

234
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,180
 And this led him...

235
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,080
 He was like, "Overdose."

236
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,380
 It put him into a comatose state for three weeks.

237
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,780
 And while he's comatose,

238
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,580
 they had to insert in this catheter.

239
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,380
 And it poked a hole.

240
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,180
 Apparently there's like a pretty thin line

241
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,880
 between your butthole and your penis.

242
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,580
 It poked a hole through it and created like a little fistula

243
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,680
 that mixed stuff up.

244
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,580
 So this is...

245
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,280
 This is true!

246
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,780
 This could happen to you!

247
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,980
 As you're sitting in a doctor's office right now,

248
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,880
 they're like, "One catheter coming up!

249
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,380
 Come on in!"

250
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,080
 You're like, "No!

251
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,680
 No, they're dragging you in!"

252
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,380
 You see the doctor has a creepy VHS camera.

253
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,880
 He's like, "Ah, a new fetish of mine as well."

254
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,680
 You can poke a hole between it.

255
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
 Poop comes out of your wiener

256
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,680
 and seamen shoots out of your butthole.

257
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
 So they fixed it.

258
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,180
 They didn't just go, "We'll see you later!"

259
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,780
 "Thank you for giving us material for this journal."

260
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,380
 They fixed this testicular pain,

261
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,880
 which apparently was unrelated.

262
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,680
 And then they fixed this as well.

263
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,880
 He's doing fine!

264
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,180
 As far as we know,

265
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,380
 apparently he can go two years

266
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,780
 with peeing out of his butthole

267
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,480
 and not mentioning it to anybody.

268
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,080
 If your friend came up to you and said,

269
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
 "Hey man, how's it going?"

270
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,580
 "Ah, dude, I was doing okay, you know,

271
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,680
 but I peed in my pants."

272
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,480
 And then you look and there's like a wet spot

273
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,280
 on the back of your pants.

274
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,780
 You're like, "What?"

275
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,780
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, dude,

276
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,780
 I peed out of my butthole.

277
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,080
 I've been doing that for about a year and a half."

278
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,680
 So any plans this weekend?

279
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,080
 You would say go to the doctor.

280
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,480
 So I'm assuming this dude told nobody.

281
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,480
 And you're out on a date with a sexy girl

282
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,380
 and like, you know, making sweet love to her

283
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,880
 and she's gonna be like, "Did you finish?"

284
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,280
 And you're like, "Yeah, of course."

285
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,180
 And then you roll over on the wall.

286
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,380
 "Okay, that's too much.

287
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,180
 That's too much."

288
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,680
 But anyways, bizarre story and the creepy thing

289
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,180
 is it can happen to you.

290
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,680
 And you're like, the whole time to you're just Jason.

291
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,180
 The story is obviously not true.

292
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,480
 It's obviously not true.

293
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,080
 I'm pretty sure it's true.

294
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,380
 Could be wrong.

295
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,280
 So with that, I am never ever having a caviter

296
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,980
 inserted inside of me.

297
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,580
 T-Mad, if he's still listening, T-Mad,

298
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,880
 we're gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

299
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
 of the carbonar copter

300
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,180
 where you're leaving behind this hospital.

301
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,980
 We are headed all the way out to

302
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,880
 Nairobi.

303
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,680
 (imitates car engine)

304
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,280
 This story was sent to me by churchgoingmule on Twitter.

305
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,380
 A long time listener of the show.

306
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,480
 Really, really appreciate the lead at churchgoingmule.

307
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,680
 He reached out to me and said,

308
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,180
 "Look at this ad I got while I was searching the web."

309
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,280
 And a chill ran down my spine.

310
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,480
 An enemy of my past

311
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,580
 was still around.

312
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,080
 There's a group called Share International.

313
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,080
 And what they do is they believe that

314
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,080
 the new Messiah walks among us.

315
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
 His name is the Matreya.

316
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,580
 And he is the second coming of Jesus Christ.

317
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,580
 And I remember reading about, it was so funny,

318
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
 'cause when churchgoingmule sent this over,

319
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,080
 I was like, "Oh, not this dude again."

320
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
 Right?

321
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,580
 Because this became, it'll become very evident

322
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,580
 how old this conspiracy theory is as we go through it.

323
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,080
 It happened when I was a kid.

324
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,580
 I turned 45 on Monday, October 4th.

325
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,580
 This story really started, I remember being in high school

326
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,580
 and hearing about this, and it scared me because I grew up,

327
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,080
 I still am a Southern Baptist, but I grew up in the church.

328
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
 We watched a thief in the night.

329
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,080
 We watched all these films about the Antichrist coming

330
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
 and he was going to deceive mankind

331
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
 and make everyone get the mark of the beast.

332
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,580
 And that type of stuff terrified me.

333
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,580
 It terrified me.

334
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
 So when I'm in high school and I'm like,

335
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,080
 "Oh dude, I'm totally like kicking it with all these cute girls."

336
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,580
 And then the Antichrist is showing up.

337
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
 I'm seeing about this guy named the Matreya

338
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,080
 and people are like, "Oh, this is the second coming of Christ."

339
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
 And I know that's not Jesus.

340
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,080
 I'm thinking, "Oh man, am I ever going to get to third base?"

341
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,080
 Because, "Will I ever know where my semen comes from?"

342
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,580
 Because this guy might destroy the world.

343
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,080
 So I remember being in high school,

344
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
 'cause I was always into conspiracy theories.

345
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
 I've been researching this stuff since I was like 12.

346
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,080
 So when I was in high school, I was reading about this guy, the Matreya.

347
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,080
 And I was like, "Oh no, this dude is the Antichrist."

348
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,580
 And I remember it scared me.

349
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,580
 I remember for the longest time that the concept scared me,

350
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,080
 that he was already here, that the Antichrist is already here.

351
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,580
 And you can kind of toy around in your head

352
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,580
 about who the Antichrist is and where he would come from.

353
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
 But this was a group saying...

354
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,580
 They were not saying he was the Antichrist, by the way.

355
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,080
 They're like, "This is the reincarnation or the new incarnation of Jesus."

356
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,080
 But I'm like, "Nah, that's the Antichrist."

357
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,080
 But then, you know, time goes on and I discover all these other conspiracy theories

358
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,580
 and, you know, just get older and wiser.

359
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,080
 And totally forgot about this dude.

360
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
 Until... (laughs)

361
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,080
 Go on Mule, send me an article and I'm clicking on the photos.

362
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
 And I remember the photo from high school.

363
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
 I remember this exact photo.

364
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,080
 So I just thought that was an interesting callback to this.

365
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
 Now, you know this is an old conspiracy...

366
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,080
 I'm surprised they're even still around.

367
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,580
 I'm totally surprised they're even still around.

368
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,580
 And when you go to their website, when you go to shareinternational.org,

369
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,580
 they talk about...

370
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,580
 You'll know that the new Jesus Christ is here because of the political upheavals.

371
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,580
 Such as the fall of the Berlin Wall.

372
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,580
 The dissolution of the Soviet Union.

373
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,080
 Remember that?

374
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,580
 Thirty years ago?

375
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
 That's old stuff.

376
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,580
 There's been a ton of political stuff then, but it shows like they're not updating their website.

377
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,080
 They're still advertising for it.

378
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
 Church going Mule saw an advertisement, but there's...

379
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
 What?

380
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
 That's where you end off?

381
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
 The Soviet Union falling apart?

382
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 It's boomer-tier conspiracy theory content.

383
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
 And...

384
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,580
 It worked back then.

385
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,580
 I mean, I don't think their plan was to scare teenagers,

386
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,080
 but it definitely got people's attention.

387
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 The matreya...

388
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,080
 This really comes from the mind of one person.

389
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,080
 The matreya is a Buddhist term, but this version of it comes from a guy named Benjamin Cream.

390
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,080
 And he grew up like us.

391
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,580
 UFO fan, 40 and fan, loved the bazaar, and he just kind of goes through life.

392
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,080
 It's in 1959, he's 37 years old.

393
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 This dude is dead by now.

394
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,580
 That's why, again, I don't know who's running the organization.

395
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,080
 I don't know what the endgame is, but...

396
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:58,580
 Benjamin Cream was 37 years old back in 1959, and he started hearing voices in his head.

397
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,580
 The master begin to communicate with him.

398
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,080
 Now, that ties into another conspiracy theory, that there are these ascended masters,

399
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,080
 and they live in the mountains or the volcanoes or something like that,

400
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:18,080
 and they reach out and they're occasionally finding random people to bestow this gift of knowledge onto.

401
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:24,080
 I mean, yeah, you know, I'm not so much of a skeptic that I don't think that, like, telepathy's fake.

402
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,580
 I'm sure it's possible out of 7 billion people, and I'm sure there is, like, a group of ascended people.

403
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:36,080
 But that's, I do believe in, like, elements of that, but when you start hearing voices in your head,

404
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,580
 it should be the same thing as if your testicles begin to hurt.

405
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:46,080
 How many days do you have to hear the voices in your head before you maybe go seek help?

406
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,580
 But anyways, he's listening to voices in his head, and it tells him, "Hey, the matreah's coming,

407
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,080
 and we're gonna get you ready. We're gonna give you this knowledge to get you ready so you can usher in this new age."

408
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:05,580
 He's a nobody at this point. Someone who always believed in paranormal stuff, and now he's second in command of the end of the world.

409
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,580
 In a good way. See, the interesting thing is, like, he was saying the end of the world,

410
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,580
 if you believe that this guy's Jesus, yeah, it's the end of the world, but it's world peace afterwards.

411
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,580
 But still, as far as I'm concerned, it would be the end of the world, 'cause it's...

412
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,580
 if everything's peaceful, then what's there to do?

413
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:31,080
 Jason, is that really your attitude about, like, the second coming of Christ?

414
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,080
 I just... I... well, let me... let me cite that for a second.

415
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,080
 In 1979, he actually begins making public announcements. The matreah is coming.

416
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,080
 He's right around the corner, all the reporters look, and he goes, "Oh, he was around the other corner, you just missed him."

417
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:55,580
 That's barely a joke, because it wasn't that funny, but for a while, the media was following him.

418
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,580
 Like, for a while, he was actually getting press attention.

419
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:08,580
 In 1982, he began publishing ads and newspapers, saying, "The end of days begins on June 21st, 1982."

420
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:15,080
 And of course that doesn't happen. Like, all of the predictions we've seen on the export and on god-like productions and things like that,

421
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,080
 2012 "Mine Apocalypse," all this stuff, they don't happen. They don't happen.

422
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,580
 Remember what was it? A couple years ago, that guy was buying billboards saying Jesus was coming back and...

423
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:31,080
 See, I had... at that point, I had already lived through so many doomsdays and so many Christ coming back into the world events,

424
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,080
 because I sharpened my teeth on the matreah type of stuff, and now when I hear it, it's like, "Ah, it's nothing."

425
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:43,080
 But back when I was... I was only six when 1982, I wasn't aware of that, but as the story goes on, I am aware of that.

426
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,080
 And I do think that this guy is not Jesus, that he's the Antichrist, and we're all about to be enslaved.

427
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:55,580
 In May of 1982, Benjamin gives a press conference. Again, people are paying attention to this lunacy.

428
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,080
 And he says, "Jesus, this is hilarious. This is the best contest ever."

429
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,580
 He goes, "Guys, listen. Jesus is here." And the reporters are like, "Oh!"

430
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,580
 They're looking around. He's like, "Not here literally, but he's here on Earth."

431
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,580
 I have to stop talking like that to you guys.

432
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,580
 He's living in Brick Lane. Apparently, that's like a neighborhood in London.

433
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,080
 So go out there and find them!

434
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,080
 And the reporters are like, "Nah, we're good." I mean, if the world's gonna end, like you said, in June,

435
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,080
 we're really gonna go out to Brick Lane. And he says, "He, listen.

436
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,080
 He has..." This was really interesting, because as I was reading the story of Benjamin Kreme,

437
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,080
 he's getting these messages, and he's talking about the matreah is coming, the matreah is coming.

438
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:45,580
 The reason why he said that in May 1982 is because he's never met the matreah. Ever.

439
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,580
 Never seen him.

440
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,580
 He just hears the voices in his head, but he knew that he was in Brick Lane.

441
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,580
 So his goal was to get the reporters to go there, start randomly asking people,

442
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,580
 "Are you Jesus? Are you Jesus? Are you Jesus?"

443
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,080
 Until eventually the guy's like, "I will admit I'm Jesus,

444
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,580
 because I was the third person in line you were about to get to me."

445
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,580
 And then Benjamin Kreme would have met... He's never met this guy.

446
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,580
 Remember, this saga started back in 1959.

447
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,580
 That was his first telepathic message.

448
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,580
 Or in 1982, he's never met the guy.

449
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,580
 He has no proof that the matreah exists.

450
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,580
 He also has no proof that that's how he pronounced his name, but we're just gonna keep rolling with it.

451
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,580
 He keeps getting these telepathic messages, and he keeps announcing the end of the world,

452
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,080
 but Harold Camping was that guy who had the same thing.

453
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,080
 You make an announcement, it fails, and then you make another announcement, and no one pays attention.

454
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,080
 And that's what happened here. He kept making announcements, he keeps dating the end of the world,

455
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
 and nothing happens.

456
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,080
 But he now has proof in his saga.

457
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,080
 He now has proof that the matreah exists.

458
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,080
 If you go to a bathroom, this is legit.

459
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,080
 Oh my God, why would you even put this on your website?

460
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,080
 You guys already look like lunatics.

461
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,580
 Out-of-date lunatics, by the way.

462
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,080
 They have on their website proof that matreah exists.

463
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,580
 Apparently, if you... This sounds like creepypasta. This totally sounds like creepypasta.

464
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,580
 If you go to Barcelona, Spain...

465
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,580
 It's a small town, apparently.

466
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,580
 I bet you you just can walk in and out within a couple minutes.

467
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,580
 If you go to Barcelona, Spain, and you go to a bathroom, right?

468
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,080
 It doesn't tell you what bathroom. It doesn't tell you if it's a private bathroom at someone's house,

469
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,080
 or some seedy bathroom at some sex store. You don't know.

470
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:46,080
 If you go to this bathroom, if you look in the mirror, there is a handprint of the matreah.

471
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
 That's proof.

472
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,080
 Now, I understand if you've been on this saga for decades, and you've never seen the dude,

473
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,080
 and you're trying to get reporters to do your dirty work, you kind of lean on anything.

474
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 But that's what?

475
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,580
 Oh, I forgot. I forgot, actually. I left out a key detail.

476
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,580
 It's not just the handprint of the matreah. It's blessed.

477
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,080
 So if you look at it, it, like, cures you.

478
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,080
 And they said even if you look at a photocopy of it, you can get blessings.

479
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,080
 Which, I don't really believe, because I've been researching this story, and then I ate some spicy food,

480
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,580
 and I got a big fat canker store on my lip.

481
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:29,080
 So I don't think I've anything this picture's cursed. It's cursed media.

482
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,080
 He also had this weird conspiracy theory where he kept telling people

483
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,080
 the matreah has visited the headquarters of CNN, and they did a full interview on him.

484
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,080
 And they believe him now. But they are not allowed to air the interview.

485
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,080
 So you just have to write CNN letters and tell them to air the matreah interview,

486
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,080
 and then they'll air it. And then he did that with other news networks as well.

487
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,080
 ABC or CBS or something like that. Which is interesting because I think he was running the same gimmick.

488
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
 It doesn't state it clearly, but I bet you anything.

489
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,080
 Obviously he doesn't know if this guy's doing interviews. He may be getting voices in his head that he's doing interviews.

490
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,080
 He doesn't know for sure. The tapes, he can't prove exist.

491
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,080
 So what you do is, maybe he thinks they do, he gets people to write in this letter campaign,

492
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,580
 air the interview of the matreah, air the interview of the matreah, and eventually CNN goes,

493
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,580
 "Well, who's the matreah? We must find this guy and put him on the news."

494
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,580
 I think that was his tactic. I don't think he actually thought he was being interviewed,

495
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,580
 but that's what he was stating publicly. The matreah has tried going on the record

496
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:39,580
 that he is here to save mankind. He is the second coming of Christ.

497
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,580
 But the media is covering it up.

498
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:49,580
 Now Benjamin Kreme died fairly recently ago, back in 2016. He lived to be 93 years old.

499
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,580
 But their website is as current as September 25th, 2021, so someone is still maintaining it.

500
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,580
 And I couldn't see, you know, a lot of times this stuff is scams, a lot of the stuff, you know, like,

501
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,580
 "Send us $10 and we'll send you a photocopy of a disgusting mirror in Barcelona."

502
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:11,580
 I didn't see anything that scammy. Could be wrong, right? I could be wrong, but I didn't see anything that scammy.

503
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:18,580
 So I don't know who's still running it or why they're running it, because if he was the one who was getting the messages in the head,

504
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:24,580
 then what's going on? But that in and of itself, I think, is an interesting story, but that's not where we're going to end.

505
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,580
 Because let's talk about the photo that I saw. I kept talking about it being scary, and you're like,

506
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,580
 "I said none of that stuff was scary. There's no proof that this guy existed."

507
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,580
 Until we reach Nairobi.

508
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,580
 "Team Atta Land, this carbonicopter, we're in Cueinguer."

509
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:47,580
 Nairobi is June 11th, 1988. That's the worst city to say when you have a kinkersaw in your mouth.

510
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,580
 We're headed to the Church of Bethlehem.

511
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:57,580
 There's a bunch of people sitting around outside, and Mary Sinaita Akatsa comes out.

512
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,580
 She's a local faith healer. Everyone knows who she is. She heals the sick and the blind.

513
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:09,580
 People are singing Bible hymns. Jesus loves me, this Sino form. I don't think that's a Bible hymn actually.

514
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,580
 I think that's for little kids. But anyways, they're singing it.

515
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,580
 Mary Akatsa walks out. She's like, "Okay, everyone, can I get your attention please? Can I get your attention please? Thank you."

516
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,580
 I was just in the church, and you won't believe what happened.

517
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,580
 God told me we're about to be visited by a very, very special guest.

518
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,580
 And I was like, "Ooh, I wonder who it is." And Mary's like, "I'll give you one guest."

519
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,580
 Who would be the most exciting guest that God would say he's coming?

520
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,580
 And we're like, "Hmm, I don't know." They're not really good on their Bible.

521
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,580
 They haven't even read the Bible. They've been singing these slangs the whole time.

522
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:53,580
 Out of the church walks Jesus. He's six foot five inches tall.

523
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,580
 He was wearing spotless white garments. This giant robe.

524
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:04,580
 And he had this little turban hat thing on that had a blue band around it.

525
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,580
 He walks out, he goes, "Guys, he's speaking perfect Swahili with no accent."

526
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,580
 He's like, "Guys, you guessed it." And Mary's like, "They didn't guess right. They didn't guess right."

527
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,580
 He's like, "Well, I guess I should tell you right now. I am Jesus Christ, son of God.

528
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,580
 Look at my spotless robes and this snazzy little hat. Could anyone else have spotless robes enough to be fair?

529
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:31,580
 To be fair, the photograph is super, like, the entire landscape is covered in mud in the photographs of this place.

530
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:38,580
 It was like a church, but I guess the parishioners were outside and apparently there were like a thousand people showed up here.

531
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,580
 So the fact that he did have spotless robes, I'll admit, were...that's pretty legit.

532
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,580
 I don't think I would declare him the son of God. But anyways, he's like, "You are all blessed. Everyone here is blessed.

533
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:56,580
 And I want to let you know that it's almost time. It's almost time for God to come down."

534
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,580
 And he goes, "But before that happens, before the end of the world comes and we're all accepted into heaven,

535
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:08,580
 I will continue to bring blessing upon blessings down to you. You are all blessed. You are all children of God."

536
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,580
 I mean, I'm number one. I'm number one. But in another way, you are also all children of God.

537
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,580
 Mary's nodding. And everyone's like, "Oh my God, dude, no one will believe me. This is so awesome. I'm meeting Jesus."

538
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:29,580
 And then Jesus goes, "It's time for me to leave." And he starts...the thousands of witnesses are watching this.

539
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:38,580
 He begins to hover. And I don't know if there's a slide whistle sound, but he flies up into the sky.

540
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:47,580
 That is the story of Jesus visiting Nairobi. And that happened in the year 1988.

541
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:54,580
 And so this story was quickly latched onto by Benjamin Kreme and saying this was the matreya.

542
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:03,580
 So when you look at photographs, for some reason they have this photograph of this dude, and then they have a photograph of a dirty hand on a mirror,

543
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:10,580
 and they're both equal proof. He says that was the matreya. Here's photographic evidence. And so that's what I saw as a kid.

544
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:19,580
 I saw that photograph and it scared me because I was dumb, right? I was like, "Oh man, how am I supposed to fight a guy with spotless robes?"

545
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:26,580
 But I looked more into this story because for all I know, this photo was some guy opening a new restaurant in town, right?

546
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:34,580
 So I looked into it and the story checks out, save for one detail. And I'm sure you guys can guess which detail doesn't check out.

547
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:49,580
 I dug into this a little bit more and I found some other narratives. Everything else is the same. The date and the minister at the church, everyone there is freaking out because this dude walks out, this 6'5 tall dude walks out.

548
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:59,580
 Everything's the same. One or two of the articles mentions that he has a light. He seems to be emitting this light from his turban, which is easy to fake.

549
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:06,580
 Or else it could be false memory or a mass hysteria. But let's give him the benefit of the doubt. Let's say that he actually did have some sort of angelic glow over his head.

550
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:15,580
 We have the version where he flies into the clouds. That is not true, right? I can only find that reported one place.

551
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:21,580
 The Benjamin Kreeman version actually was not as ridiculous as him flying up to the clouds, to be fair.

552
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:33,580
 The Benjamin Kreeman version was there was a guy who just happened to be in the area named Gernum Singh. And he goes, "You, sir, how would you like to give the Son of God a ride in your car?"

553
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,580
 And the dude said, "Well, okay, sure. I'm not going to turn down that offer."

554
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:44,580
 So the matreya gets in the backseat of the car and they drive just a short while.

555
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:55,580
 And then he gets out of the car and he goes, "Gernum, thank you for the ride, but I got it from here." And he vanishes into thin air.

556
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:03,580
 Now that's always far more convenient, because there's only one witness to that. But it's still pretty dumb, right? It's still pretty ridiculous.

557
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,580
 If he could vanish, then why didn't he do it in front of all of these people? Why did he get driven around the corner?

558
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:18,580
 And then, in another region, this one was actually from a news article written on the event. It said that Gernum Singh, he shows back up, Gernum Singh was his chauffeur.

559
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:31,580
 So he didn't magically appear at the location. What happened was Gernum Singh brought him in the car and then he got out and he went into the church, did a little razzmatazz, and then got back into the car.

560
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,580
 This is so funny. This is so funny.

561
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:43,580
 He drove into a bus station. Gernum Singh drove the second coming of Christ to the bus station, and as he was walking into the bus station, Gernum Singh goes, "Where are you headed?"

562
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,580
 And he turns around and he goes, "Back to heaven."

563
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:54,580
 And then he just gets on a bus! He just gets on a bus! And he's never been seen since.

564
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:02,580
 Fascinating, fascinating story. That photograph scared me for the longest time. I thought that this guy might actually be the anti-Christ.

565
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,580
 I never thought that he was actually the second coming of Christ, but he was one that was going to deceive us, and I didn't want that to happen, right?

566
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:16,580
 I still had a bunch of episodes in the next generation to watch, and it did not happen. But I want to wrap this story up like this.

567
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:27,580
 There's a quote on the Share International website that talks about what things are going to be like when the Christ, when the matreo makes himself known.

568
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,580
 I want to read this to you.

569
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:37,580
 "The Christ will come on the world's television channels, linked together by satellite.

570
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:47,580
 All those with access to television will see his face. He will establish a telepathic rapport with all humanity simultaneously.

571
00:32:47,580 --> 00:33:05,580
 While the Christ is speaking, everyone will feel far more loved than they've ever felt before. That massive outpouring of love will cause hundreds of thousands of miracle cures to take place simultaneously."

572
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,580
 That's terrifying to me.

573
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:18,580
 That idea is so antithetical to what I believe in. That's terrifying to me.

574
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:25,580
 Because I'm wondering now if I read one of these ads when I was a teenager.

575
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,580
 Because the thing is, is that there's two parts of this.

576
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:35,580
 Obviously, with the anti-Christ is coming and you're just walking by a television set and like a best buy, and you just see like,

577
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:44,580
 the stuff you've seen like in the rise of Cobra, G.I. Joe movies and stuff, you see all the televisions change and it's a picture of this stranger you've never seen before.

578
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:52,580
 And it begins talking and you have this gut reaction that this person is not who he says he is.

579
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,580
 But you see everyone else around you just falling to their knees.

580
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,580
 Weeping openly.

581
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,580
 They finally have peace in their hearts.

582
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,580
 And you're just standing there and you don't understand it.

583
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:13,580
 And you start to see other people start to approach the televisions because they just hear people weeping in the electronics department.

584
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,580
 And they're walking closer and you hear it, you turn around and you see other people just falling to their knees.

585
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:26,580
 They're just joy on their face and they're sobbing as they're watching this man who's speaking this message of peace and love.

586
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:35,580
 And you're watching this and you know this person is not who he says he is.

587
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:45,580
 You could easily fall to your feet and pretend to cry just so they don't notice you're different.

588
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,580
 You could go along with it.

589
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,580
 Maybe you do feel a little bit of peace in your heart.

590
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,580
 Things definitely are better.

591
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,580
 There's less pollution.

592
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,580
 There's no more wars, no more crime.

593
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:07,580
 Everyone seems to love each other but you are just going through the motions.

594
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:15,580
 You live in the world you know you live in the world controlled by a demonic entity.

595
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:20,580
 But nobody else realizes it.

596
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
 Or do you know?

597
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,580
 Do you know?

598
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,580
 In the book of Revelation it says even the learned will be deceived.

599
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:37,580
 Even the people who have studied the Bible, studied the Quran, studied the Torah, meditated and refined their mind for decades.

600
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:44,580
 They will also fall prey to this Antichrist.

601
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,580
 It's a terrifying story and it's a terrifying vision.

602
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:55,580
 The loss of free will, even if it's the loss of free will for a paradise, is the worst thing that can happen.

603
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:00,580
 Free will is what separates us from the animals.

604
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:07,580
 With that gone, we're just a planet of servants.

605
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:13,580
 So that is why the idea of the matreah terrified me and I bet you anything I read this ad when I was a teenager.

606
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:22,580
 Because the idea of just passing by a television set and losing your free will to this powerful force.

607
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,580
 Who could fight against that?

608
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:34,580
 I always have this question, if the book of Revelation is real and the devil knows how the story ends, why does he continue to fight?

609
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,580
 And we've discussed that on other episodes.

610
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,580
 But I have a sneaking suspicion the reason why he continues to fight.

611
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:48,580
 Even though the book ends this way, is that he knows there's a clause.

612
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:55,580
 He knows there's a chance that he wins.

613
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:04,580
 And if he does, and this Antichrist comes down and warps our minds and makes us worship him.

614
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,580
 And the kingdom of God falls and the angels are slaughtered in battle.

615
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:18,580
 It may start off as a paradise on earth, one that we greeted with open arms and weeping eyes.

616
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:24,580
 But it will end with eternal hell.

617
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:33,580
 Not just a planet, but a universe ruled over by the darkest entities ever created.

618
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,580
 Truly a terrifying thought.

619
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:44,580
 It just brings back memories of me being a young man, being in fear of what may happen tomorrow.

620
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:53,580
 I may be older, I may be wiser, but I still believe that this can come to pass.

621
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,580
 If not the matreah, someone else.

622
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:07,580
 After all they've been planning the conquest of this reality since before it was created.
