00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 It's the gentle ocean breeze that sweeps you off your feet.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.140
 The 99 holes of championship golf that offer endless possibilities.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.580
 The small town southern charm that embraces you everywhere you go.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 From the beaches in the east to the marshes in the west,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
 there's a special feeling you get on Amelia Island.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.480
 It's a real thing.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.140
 It's an island thing.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.900
 Make it your thing.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.180
 Start planning your Northeast Lorda Beach Escape now at ameliaisland.com.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.700
 A young man visits the doctor,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.580
 complaining of excruciating testicular pain.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.480
 Little did he know he was about to make medical history.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.380
 Now we meet a man who claims that the second coming of Christ already walks among us.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 He's actually doing interviews with CNN trying to announce to the world his glory.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.580
 But the mainstream media is silencing Jesus Christ today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.380
 [Music]

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.280
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.380
 Hope you guys have some fun plans for this weekend.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.580
 I want to give you guys a heads up.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.480
 Next week will be the last week of season 15.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.680
 After next week, I'm going to take two weeks off.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.780
 I really didn't want to do this in October, but it's just the way that everything worked out.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.780
 I got to take my two weeks off every 50 episodes just to recharge.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380
 Otherwise, I don't want the show to ever become a chore, right?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 And so I need these two weeks too.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.280
 But we're going to do one more week at the beginning of October.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.880
 We're going to have my birthday episode.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.280
 You're like, "Woohoo, Jason."

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.780
 And then, and then after that amazing spectacular,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.180
 I'm going to continue the week.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.680
 There'll be other episodes, right?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.780
 That's not the last one.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.180
 I'll take two weeks off and then we'll be back for the week before Halloween.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.280
 So I got some goodness planned, but I just don't have the energy to do it right now.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.080
 But you know who has tons of energy.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.780
 One of our legacy Patreon supporters, a longtime supporter of the show, a longtime YouTube supporter.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.780
 Give it up for Team Ad.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.380
 Everyone give a round of applause to Team Ad as he's walking into Dead or Abicum, man.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.780
 Team Ad, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.680
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.380
 Just help spread the word about you.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.980
 You're not going to want to support the Patreon after this episode.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.180
 You're like, "I don't know what episode I'm going to end up on."

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.880
 But if you can't support the Patreon even after this episode,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.280
 that's okay. Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.680
 Team Ad, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit robot.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.680
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.480
 We are sailing all the way out to a hospital somewhere.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.880
 Oh, that's us. That's us rowing this boat.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.880
 This isn't from a medical journal.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.780
 So we don't have names. We don't have locations.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.680
 This guy's secret must be kept.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.380
 I'm sure the scientists after they finished writing this report,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.880
 they all just shot themselves in the head.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.580
 They're like, "This knowledge is too horrible for this world."

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.880
 In this medical journal, it tells the story of a man.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.180
 Let's call him Keith.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.280
 Keith is a 33-year-old man.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.280
 Now, he has a history of illegal drug use.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.280
 So smoking the doobie, maybe like eating some mushrooms,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.780
 maybe a little cocaine here and there.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.580
 But it's in the past. He doesn't do them.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.380
 He's not in the doctor's.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.780
 At least he comes in. He's all shaken up and he's vein killers.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.180
 He has a history of illegal drug use.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.580
 He goes to the hospital and he's like, "Doc, you got to treat me.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.480
 My testicles hurt really, really bad."

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.180
 The doctors start asking questions like,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.680
 "Okay, how long have they hurt?"

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.680
 And his answer is the first part of this bizarre mystery.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 So I'm going to post it to you.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.080
 "How long and how many days would it take for your testicles to hurt

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.280
 before you went to the doctor?"

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.380
 And ladies, you're ovaries.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.680
 It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.480
 Anything down there, how many days would you have to say

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.580
 you use the term excruciating pain?

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.280
 Right?

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.680
 "How many days would your testicles or ovaries have to hurt

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.780
 before you went to the doctor?"

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.680
 Me, zero, right?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.780
 A good three hours.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.280
 I'm like, "Ahh, I can't take it anymore."

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.880
 He waited five days.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.380
 He must not have insurance or something.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.080
 I don't know.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.080
 Or he's just like, "Oh, it'll go away.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.680
 It'll go away as they're throbbing, cartoon-like.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.380
 They're like the size of grapefruits.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.880
 Anyways, five days of excruciating testicular pain.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.980
 And while he's there, this is not why he went to the doctor.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.180
 The testicular pain is not the reason why he's in a medical journal.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.680
 That's normal, unfortunately.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.480
 As they're treating this testicle pain, he goes,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.880
 "Hey, you know, while I'm here, I was wondering if you could

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.880
 take a look at something else while you're down there,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.780
 while you're in that region?"

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.380
 There's been this weird thing that's going on.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.080
 Um...

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.180
 Pfft.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.380
 And the doctor's like, "What?

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.380
 That's weird."

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.580
 I mean, he's a veteran doctor, right?

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.580
 This isn't his first time someone's passed gas in his facility.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.480
 He realizes he's like, "Check in this guy's testicles out."

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.480
 And his face gets farted on.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.580
 That's weird.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.680
 This man, I'm looking right at his crotch,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.180
 and he clearly farted on my face.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.080
 How did that happen?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.980
 He's thinking, "The doctor...

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.880
 The doctor's flummoxed!"

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.980
 That doesn't make any sense.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.880
 If he was behind him, the fart would have hit his face,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.480
 but he felt like the gas.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.980
 He felt like the air pressure changed.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.380
 He's like, "What?"

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.280
 And Keith goes, "Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.080
 Since you're down there, I probably should have warned you.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.680
 I passed gas out of my penis."

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.780
 This is a true story.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.680
 This isn't a set-up for a joke or anything like that.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.780
 This guy, when he farts, it comes out of his penis.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.580
 And the doctor's like, "That's ridiculous.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.380
 That's ridiculous.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.080
 He's giving him a bunch of root beer.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.080
 He's giving him a bunch of beans to make him carbonated."

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.180
 He's like, "We must test this."

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.980
 And then the guy goes, "Okay, to be fair,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.480
 I don't know if it happened in this sequence of events.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.380
 The medical journal just had these four symptoms.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.280
 But in our version of it, Keith goes,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.180
 "Oh, you know what?

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.580
 You made me eat all those beans

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.080
 because you have some weird fart finish, you big pervert."

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.080
 I have to go to the bathroom.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.080
 I have to go number two.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.380
 So he goes to a urinal,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.480
 which is just conveniently in the doctor's office

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.180
 for the sake of the narrative.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.480
 And the doctor's like, "That's weird.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.380
 He said he was going to go number two,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.880
 which is the universal thing for poop.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.380
 But he's facing..."

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.080
 No.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.780
 No way.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.880
 And the doctor's watching the doctor develop

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.380
 the new fetish this day.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.580
 This is true.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.780
 This is true.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.680
 The guy begins pooping.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.280
 I can't believe this is true,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.980
 but it is this guy begins pooping out of his penis.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.180
 Now you go, Jason.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.180
 This is clearly fake.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.880
 Did you find this on April Fool's Day?

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.980
 This is clearly not true.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.580
 Well, I didn't find it on April Fool's Day.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.480
 But I did find it in the India Times.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.380
 So, but anyways, there is a...

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.080
 Everyone just shut off the podcast.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.480
 Even people in India, they're like,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.480
 "That's a rag. Click."

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.980
 I did find the medical journal it was reported on.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.280
 It was reported in Cures.com,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.080
 which actually now sounds like a totally fake medical journal.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.580
 It's funny because you read stuff all the time,

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.680
 but you don't pronounce it out loud.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.180
 Cures.com.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.180
 So, I haven't even got...

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.880
 I have not even gotten to the title of...

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.980
 None of this is the title of it, right?

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.180
 The Man Who Peed Poop.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.680
 They could have titled it "The Man Who Farts Out of His Weaner."

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.180
 No, we haven't even got to the title of this medical journal article yet,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.480
 because that is weird,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.880
 but it's not as weird as we're going.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.180
 So, the doctor's like, "Oh my God, oh my God,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:17.780
 I have to videotape this on a creepy old VHS camera and save it for later."

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.280
 But the doctor goes, "Okay, so you poop out of your penis

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.780
 and you fart out of your penis.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.580
 Would that mean..."

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.280
 He's just like, "You've guessed it.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.880
 You've guessed it, young man."

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.380
 And then, he pees out of his butt hole.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.980
 But that is not the name of the article, either.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.580
 Because what he can do...

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.280
 to my remaining two listeners...

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.880
 What this man can do...

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.380
 This is the name of the paper...

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.980
 He...

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:59.080
 Can he "jaculate out of his butt hole"?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.480
 I think the term that was used was "copious amounts of semen."

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.480
 Which is...

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.880
 Which really, I think should be any amount, right?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.680
 If your semen is coming out of your butt hole,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.380
 it doesn't matter if it's a teaspoon or a gallon, right?

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.880
 That's just too much.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.880
 And he can "jaculate out of his butt hole."

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.880
 This hat...

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.480
 This went on...

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.380
 For two years.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.080
 He never went to the doctor for this.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.580
 So, again, I ask...

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.380
 How often would you have to "jaculate out of his butt hole"?

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.080
 Before you went to the doctor!

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.380
 Because I'm sure this guy was out on dates, right?

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.580
 He's meeting a hot girl...

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.080
 I mean, what I'm not even gonna go into detail.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.180
 I think you guys know exactly where that was headed.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.880
 Two years.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.780
 And so the doctors are like...

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.580
 Here's the thing.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.180
 There's x-rays with this...

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.280
 There's this medical journal and they said...

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.680
 They kept asking him over and over again,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.980
 "Have you ever put anything up your butt?"

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.580
 And he's like, "No!"

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.980
 And they're like, "Mmm, let's rephrase that question."

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.980
 "Have any objects ever gone into your anus?"

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.680
 He's like, "No, that's the same question.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.180
 You just use different words."

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.680
 Because that's all they can think of.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.480
 Something...

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.780
 Because here's the rub!

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.080
 This can happen to you!

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.680
 But maybe not the first part.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.680
 So for...

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.980
 Maybe this one happened to you.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.580
 The first thing is he went on a cocaine and PCP binge.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.180
 And this led him...

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.080
 He was like, "Overdose."

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.380
 It put him into a comatose state for three weeks.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.780
 And while he's comatose,

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.580
 they had to insert in this catheter.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.380
 And it poked a hole.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.180
 Apparently there's like a pretty thin line

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.880
 between your butthole and your penis.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.580
 It poked a hole through it and created like a little fistula

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.680
 that mixed stuff up.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.580
 So this is...

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.280
 This is true!

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.780
 This could happen to you!

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.980
 As you're sitting in a doctor's office right now,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.880
 they're like, "One catheter coming up!

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.380
 Come on in!"

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.080
 You're like, "No!

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.680
 No, they're dragging you in!"

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.380
 You see the doctor has a creepy VHS camera.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.880
 He's like, "Ah, a new fetish of mine as well."

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.680
 You can poke a hole between it.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.680
 Poop comes out of your wiener

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.680
 and seamen shoots out of your butthole.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.680
 So they fixed it.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.180
 They didn't just go, "We'll see you later!"

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.780
 "Thank you for giving us material for this journal."

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.380
 They fixed this testicular pain,

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.880
 which apparently was unrelated.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.680
 And then they fixed this as well.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.880
 He's doing fine!

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.180
 As far as we know,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.380
 apparently he can go two years

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.780
 with peeing out of his butthole

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.480
 and not mentioning it to anybody.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.080
 If your friend came up to you and said,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.080
 "Hey man, how's it going?"

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.580
 "Ah, dude, I was doing okay, you know,

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.680
 but I peed in my pants."

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.480
 And then you look and there's like a wet spot

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.280
 on the back of your pants.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:49.780
 You're like, "What?"

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.780
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, dude,

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.780
 I peed out of my butthole.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.080
 I've been doing that for about a year and a half."

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.680
 So any plans this weekend?

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.080
 You would say go to the doctor.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.480
 So I'm assuming this dude told nobody.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.480
 And you're out on a date with a sexy girl

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.380
 and like, you know, making sweet love to her

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.880
 and she's gonna be like, "Did you finish?"

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.280
 And you're like, "Yeah, of course."

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.180
 And then you roll over on the wall.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.380
 "Okay, that's too much.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.180
 That's too much."

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.680
 But anyways, bizarre story and the creepy thing

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.180
 is it can happen to you.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.680
 And you're like, the whole time to you're just Jason.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.180
 The story is obviously not true.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.480
 It's obviously not true.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.080
 I'm pretty sure it's true.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.380
 Could be wrong.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.280
 So with that, I am never ever having a caviter

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.980
 inserted inside of me.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.580
 T-Mad, if he's still listening, T-Mad,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.880
 we're gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.880
 of the carbonar copter

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.180
 where you're leaving behind this hospital.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.980
 We are headed all the way out to

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.880
 Nairobi.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.680
 (imitates car engine)

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.280
 This story was sent to me by churchgoingmule on Twitter.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.380
 A long time listener of the show.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.480
 Really, really appreciate the lead at churchgoingmule.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.680
 He reached out to me and said,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.180
 "Look at this ad I got while I was searching the web."

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.280
 And a chill ran down my spine.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.480
 An enemy of my past

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.580
 was still around.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.080
 There's a group called Share International.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.080
 And what they do is they believe that

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.080
 the new Messiah walks among us.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.080
 His name is the Matreya.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.580
 And he is the second coming of Jesus Christ.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.580
 And I remember reading about, it was so funny,

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.580
 'cause when churchgoingmule sent this over,

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.080
 I was like, "Oh, not this dude again."

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.080
 Right?

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.580
 Because this became, it'll become very evident

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.580
 how old this conspiracy theory is as we go through it.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.080
 It happened when I was a kid.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.580
 I turned 45 on Monday, October 4th.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.580
 This story really started, I remember being in high school

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.580
 and hearing about this, and it scared me because I grew up,

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.080
 I still am a Southern Baptist, but I grew up in the church.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.080
 We watched a thief in the night.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.080
 We watched all these films about the Antichrist coming

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.080
 and he was going to deceive mankind

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.080
 and make everyone get the mark of the beast.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.580
 And that type of stuff terrified me.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.580
 It terrified me.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.580
 So when I'm in high school and I'm like,

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.080
 "Oh dude, I'm totally like kicking it with all these cute girls."

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.580
 And then the Antichrist is showing up.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.580
 I'm seeing about this guy named the Matreya

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.080
 and people are like, "Oh, this is the second coming of Christ."

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.080
 And I know that's not Jesus.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.080
 I'm thinking, "Oh man, am I ever going to get to third base?"

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.080
 Because, "Will I ever know where my semen comes from?"

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.580
 Because this guy might destroy the world.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.080
 So I remember being in high school,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.080
 'cause I was always into conspiracy theories.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.080
 I've been researching this stuff since I was like 12.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.080
 So when I was in high school, I was reading about this guy, the Matreya.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.080
 And I was like, "Oh no, this dude is the Antichrist."

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.580
 And I remember it scared me.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.580
 I remember for the longest time that the concept scared me,

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.080
 that he was already here, that the Antichrist is already here.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.580
 And you can kind of toy around in your head

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.580
 about who the Antichrist is and where he would come from.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.580
 But this was a group saying...

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.580
 They were not saying he was the Antichrist, by the way.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.080
 They're like, "This is the reincarnation or the new incarnation of Jesus."

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.080
 But I'm like, "Nah, that's the Antichrist."

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.080
 But then, you know, time goes on and I discover all these other conspiracy theories

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.580
 and, you know, just get older and wiser.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.080
 And totally forgot about this dude.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.080
 Until... (laughs)

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.080
 Go on Mule, send me an article and I'm clicking on the photos.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.080
 And I remember the photo from high school.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080
 I remember this exact photo.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.080
 So I just thought that was an interesting callback to this.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.080
 Now, you know this is an old conspiracy...

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.080
 I'm surprised they're even still around.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.580
 I'm totally surprised they're even still around.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.580
 And when you go to their website, when you go to shareinternational.org,

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.580
 they talk about...

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:49.580
 You'll know that the new Jesus Christ is here because of the political upheavals.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.580
 Such as the fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.580
 The dissolution of the Soviet Union.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.080
 Remember that?

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.580
 Thirty years ago?

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.580
 That's old stuff.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.580
 There's been a ton of political stuff then, but it shows like they're not updating their website.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.080
 They're still advertising for it.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.080
 Church going Mule saw an advertisement, but there's...

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080
 What?

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.080
 That's where you end off?

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.080
 The Soviet Union falling apart?

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.080
 It's boomer-tier conspiracy theory content.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080
 And...

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.580
 It worked back then.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.580
 I mean, I don't think their plan was to scare teenagers,

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.080
 but it definitely got people's attention.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.080
 The matreya...

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.080
 This really comes from the mind of one person.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.080
 The matreya is a Buddhist term, but this version of it comes from a guy named Benjamin Cream.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.080
 And he grew up like us.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.580
 UFO fan, 40 and fan, loved the bazaar, and he just kind of goes through life.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.080
 It's in 1959, he's 37 years old.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.080
 This dude is dead by now.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.580
 That's why, again, I don't know who's running the organization.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.080
 I don't know what the endgame is, but...

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:58.580
 Benjamin Cream was 37 years old back in 1959, and he started hearing voices in his head.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.580
 The master begin to communicate with him.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:07.080
 Now, that ties into another conspiracy theory, that there are these ascended masters,

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:11.080
 and they live in the mountains or the volcanoes or something like that,

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:18.080
 and they reach out and they're occasionally finding random people to bestow this gift of knowledge onto.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:24.080
 I mean, yeah, you know, I'm not so much of a skeptic that I don't think that, like, telepathy's fake.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.580
 I'm sure it's possible out of 7 billion people, and I'm sure there is, like, a group of ascended people.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:36.080
 But that's, I do believe in, like, elements of that, but when you start hearing voices in your head,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.580
 it should be the same thing as if your testicles begin to hurt.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:46.080
 How many days do you have to hear the voices in your head before you maybe go seek help?

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.580
 But anyways, he's listening to voices in his head, and it tells him, "Hey, the matreah's coming,

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:57.080
 and we're gonna get you ready. We're gonna give you this knowledge to get you ready so you can usher in this new age."

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:05.580
 He's a nobody at this point. Someone who always believed in paranormal stuff, and now he's second in command of the end of the world.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.580
 In a good way. See, the interesting thing is, like, he was saying the end of the world,

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:15.580
 if you believe that this guy's Jesus, yeah, it's the end of the world, but it's world peace afterwards.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.580
 But still, as far as I'm concerned, it would be the end of the world, 'cause it's...

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.580
 if everything's peaceful, then what's there to do?

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:31.080
 Jason, is that really your attitude about, like, the second coming of Christ?

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.080
 I just... I... well, let me... let me cite that for a second.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.080
 In 1979, he actually begins making public announcements. The matreah is coming.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.080
 He's right around the corner, all the reporters look, and he goes, "Oh, he was around the other corner, you just missed him."

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:55.580
 That's barely a joke, because it wasn't that funny, but for a while, the media was following him.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.580
 Like, for a while, he was actually getting press attention.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:08.580
 In 1982, he began publishing ads and newspapers, saying, "The end of days begins on June 21st, 1982."

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:15.080
 And of course that doesn't happen. Like, all of the predictions we've seen on the export and on god-like productions and things like that,

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.080
 2012 "Mine Apocalypse," all this stuff, they don't happen. They don't happen.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.580
 Remember what was it? A couple years ago, that guy was buying billboards saying Jesus was coming back and...

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:31.080
 See, I had... at that point, I had already lived through so many doomsdays and so many Christ coming back into the world events,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.080
 because I sharpened my teeth on the matreah type of stuff, and now when I hear it, it's like, "Ah, it's nothing."

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:43.080
 But back when I was... I was only six when 1982, I wasn't aware of that, but as the story goes on, I am aware of that.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:49.080
 And I do think that this guy is not Jesus, that he's the Antichrist, and we're all about to be enslaved.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:55.580
 In May of 1982, Benjamin gives a press conference. Again, people are paying attention to this lunacy.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:01.080
 And he says, "Jesus, this is hilarious. This is the best contest ever."

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.580
 He goes, "Guys, listen. Jesus is here." And the reporters are like, "Oh!"

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.580
 They're looking around. He's like, "Not here literally, but he's here on Earth."

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.580
 I have to stop talking like that to you guys.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.580
 He's living in Brick Lane. Apparently, that's like a neighborhood in London.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.080
 So go out there and find them!

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:24.080
 And the reporters are like, "Nah, we're good." I mean, if the world's gonna end, like you said, in June,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.080
 we're really gonna go out to Brick Lane. And he says, "He, listen.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.080
 He has..." This was really interesting, because as I was reading the story of Benjamin Kreme,

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.080
 he's getting these messages, and he's talking about the matreah is coming, the matreah is coming.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:45.580
 The reason why he said that in May 1982 is because he's never met the matreah. Ever.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.580
 Never seen him.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:54.580
 He just hears the voices in his head, but he knew that he was in Brick Lane.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.580
 So his goal was to get the reporters to go there, start randomly asking people,

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.580
 "Are you Jesus? Are you Jesus? Are you Jesus?"

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.080
 Until eventually the guy's like, "I will admit I'm Jesus,

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.580
 because I was the third person in line you were about to get to me."

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.580
 And then Benjamin Kreme would have met... He's never met this guy.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:17.580
 Remember, this saga started back in 1959.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.580
 That was his first telepathic message.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.580
 Or in 1982, he's never met the guy.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.580
 He has no proof that the matreah exists.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.580
 He also has no proof that that's how he pronounced his name, but we're just gonna keep rolling with it.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:34.580
 He keeps getting these telepathic messages, and he keeps announcing the end of the world,

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:39.080
 but Harold Camping was that guy who had the same thing.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:44.080
 You make an announcement, it fails, and then you make another announcement, and no one pays attention.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.080
 And that's what happened here. He kept making announcements, he keeps dating the end of the world,

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.080
 and nothing happens.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.080
 But he now has proof in his saga.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.080
 He now has proof that the matreah exists.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.080
 If you go to a bathroom, this is legit.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.080
 Oh my God, why would you even put this on your website?

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.080
 You guys already look like lunatics.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.580
 Out-of-date lunatics, by the way.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.080
 They have on their website proof that matreah exists.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.580
 Apparently, if you... This sounds like creepypasta. This totally sounds like creepypasta.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.580
 If you go to Barcelona, Spain...

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.580
 It's a small town, apparently.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.580
 I bet you you just can walk in and out within a couple minutes.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.580
 If you go to Barcelona, Spain, and you go to a bathroom, right?

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:35.080
 It doesn't tell you what bathroom. It doesn't tell you if it's a private bathroom at someone's house,

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.080
 or some seedy bathroom at some sex store. You don't know.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:46.080
 If you go to this bathroom, if you look in the mirror, there is a handprint of the matreah.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.080
 That's proof.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.080
 Now, I understand if you've been on this saga for decades, and you've never seen the dude,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.080
 and you're trying to get reporters to do your dirty work, you kind of lean on anything.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.080
 But that's what?

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.580
 Oh, I forgot. I forgot, actually. I left out a key detail.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.580
 It's not just the handprint of the matreah. It's blessed.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.080
 So if you look at it, it, like, cures you.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.080
 And they said even if you look at a photocopy of it, you can get blessings.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.080
 Which, I don't really believe, because I've been researching this story, and then I ate some spicy food,

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.580
 and I got a big fat canker store on my lip.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:29.080
 So I don't think I've anything this picture's cursed. It's cursed media.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:34.080
 He also had this weird conspiracy theory where he kept telling people

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.080
 the matreah has visited the headquarters of CNN, and they did a full interview on him.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.080
 And they believe him now. But they are not allowed to air the interview.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.080
 So you just have to write CNN letters and tell them to air the matreah interview,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.080
 and then they'll air it. And then he did that with other news networks as well.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:59.080
 ABC or CBS or something like that. Which is interesting because I think he was running the same gimmick.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.080
 It doesn't state it clearly, but I bet you anything.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.080
 Obviously he doesn't know if this guy's doing interviews. He may be getting voices in his head that he's doing interviews.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.080
 He doesn't know for sure. The tapes, he can't prove exist.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:17.080
 So what you do is, maybe he thinks they do, he gets people to write in this letter campaign,

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.580
 air the interview of the matreah, air the interview of the matreah, and eventually CNN goes,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.580
 "Well, who's the matreah? We must find this guy and put him on the news."

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:28.580
 I think that was his tactic. I don't think he actually thought he was being interviewed,

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.580
 but that's what he was stating publicly. The matreah has tried going on the record

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:39.580
 that he is here to save mankind. He is the second coming of Christ.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.580
 But the media is covering it up.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:49.580
 Now Benjamin Kreme died fairly recently ago, back in 2016. He lived to be 93 years old.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.580
 But their website is as current as September 25th, 2021, so someone is still maintaining it.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:59.580
 And I couldn't see, you know, a lot of times this stuff is scams, a lot of the stuff, you know, like,

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:04.580
 "Send us $10 and we'll send you a photocopy of a disgusting mirror in Barcelona."

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:11.580
 I didn't see anything that scammy. Could be wrong, right? I could be wrong, but I didn't see anything that scammy.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:18.580
 So I don't know who's still running it or why they're running it, because if he was the one who was getting the messages in the head,

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:24.580
 then what's going on? But that in and of itself, I think, is an interesting story, but that's not where we're going to end.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.580
 Because let's talk about the photo that I saw. I kept talking about it being scary, and you're like,

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.580
 "I said none of that stuff was scary. There's no proof that this guy existed."

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.580
 Until we reach Nairobi.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.580
 "Team Atta Land, this carbonicopter, we're in Cueinguer."

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:47.580
 Nairobi is June 11th, 1988. That's the worst city to say when you have a kinkersaw in your mouth.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.580
 We're headed to the Church of Bethlehem.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:57.580
 There's a bunch of people sitting around outside, and Mary Sinaita Akatsa comes out.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:02.580
 She's a local faith healer. Everyone knows who she is. She heals the sick and the blind.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:09.580
 People are singing Bible hymns. Jesus loves me, this Sino form. I don't think that's a Bible hymn actually.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.580
 I think that's for little kids. But anyways, they're singing it.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:18.580
 Mary Akatsa walks out. She's like, "Okay, everyone, can I get your attention please? Can I get your attention please? Thank you."

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.580
 I was just in the church, and you won't believe what happened.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.580
 God told me we're about to be visited by a very, very special guest.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.580
 And I was like, "Ooh, I wonder who it is." And Mary's like, "I'll give you one guest."

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:39.580
 Who would be the most exciting guest that God would say he's coming?

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.580
 And we're like, "Hmm, I don't know." They're not really good on their Bible.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.580
 They haven't even read the Bible. They've been singing these slangs the whole time.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:53.580
 Out of the church walks Jesus. He's six foot five inches tall.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:58.580
 He was wearing spotless white garments. This giant robe.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:04.580
 And he had this little turban hat thing on that had a blue band around it.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.580
 He walks out, he goes, "Guys, he's speaking perfect Swahili with no accent."

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.580
 He's like, "Guys, you guessed it." And Mary's like, "They didn't guess right. They didn't guess right."

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.580
 He's like, "Well, I guess I should tell you right now. I am Jesus Christ, son of God.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.580
 Look at my spotless robes and this snazzy little hat. Could anyone else have spotless robes enough to be fair?

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:31.580
 To be fair, the photograph is super, like, the entire landscape is covered in mud in the photographs of this place.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:38.580
 It was like a church, but I guess the parishioners were outside and apparently there were like a thousand people showed up here.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.580
 So the fact that he did have spotless robes, I'll admit, were...that's pretty legit.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:49.580
 I don't think I would declare him the son of God. But anyways, he's like, "You are all blessed. Everyone here is blessed.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:56.580
 And I want to let you know that it's almost time. It's almost time for God to come down."

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.580
 And he goes, "But before that happens, before the end of the world comes and we're all accepted into heaven,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:08.580
 I will continue to bring blessing upon blessings down to you. You are all blessed. You are all children of God."

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:14.580
 I mean, I'm number one. I'm number one. But in another way, you are also all children of God.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.580
 Mary's nodding. And everyone's like, "Oh my God, dude, no one will believe me. This is so awesome. I'm meeting Jesus."

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:29.580
 And then Jesus goes, "It's time for me to leave." And he starts...the thousands of witnesses are watching this.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:38.580
 He begins to hover. And I don't know if there's a slide whistle sound, but he flies up into the sky.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:47.580
 That is the story of Jesus visiting Nairobi. And that happened in the year 1988.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:54.580
 And so this story was quickly latched onto by Benjamin Kreme and saying this was the matreya.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:03.580
 So when you look at photographs, for some reason they have this photograph of this dude, and then they have a photograph of a dirty hand on a mirror,

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:10.580
 and they're both equal proof. He says that was the matreya. Here's photographic evidence. And so that's what I saw as a kid.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:19.580
 I saw that photograph and it scared me because I was dumb, right? I was like, "Oh man, how am I supposed to fight a guy with spotless robes?"

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:26.580
 But I looked more into this story because for all I know, this photo was some guy opening a new restaurant in town, right?

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:34.580
 So I looked into it and the story checks out, save for one detail. And I'm sure you guys can guess which detail doesn't check out.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:49.580
 I dug into this a little bit more and I found some other narratives. Everything else is the same. The date and the minister at the church, everyone there is freaking out because this dude walks out, this 6'5 tall dude walks out.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:59.580
 Everything's the same. One or two of the articles mentions that he has a light. He seems to be emitting this light from his turban, which is easy to fake.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:06.580
 Or else it could be false memory or a mass hysteria. But let's give him the benefit of the doubt. Let's say that he actually did have some sort of angelic glow over his head.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:15.580
 We have the version where he flies into the clouds. That is not true, right? I can only find that reported one place.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:21.580
 The Benjamin Kreeman version actually was not as ridiculous as him flying up to the clouds, to be fair.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:33.580
 The Benjamin Kreeman version was there was a guy who just happened to be in the area named Gernum Singh. And he goes, "You, sir, how would you like to give the Son of God a ride in your car?"

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:37.580
 And the dude said, "Well, okay, sure. I'm not going to turn down that offer."

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:44.580
 So the matreya gets in the backseat of the car and they drive just a short while.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:55.580
 And then he gets out of the car and he goes, "Gernum, thank you for the ride, but I got it from here." And he vanishes into thin air.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:03.580
 Now that's always far more convenient, because there's only one witness to that. But it's still pretty dumb, right? It's still pretty ridiculous.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:08.580
 If he could vanish, then why didn't he do it in front of all of these people? Why did he get driven around the corner?

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:18.580
 And then, in another region, this one was actually from a news article written on the event. It said that Gernum Singh, he shows back up, Gernum Singh was his chauffeur.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:31.580
 So he didn't magically appear at the location. What happened was Gernum Singh brought him in the car and then he got out and he went into the church, did a little razzmatazz, and then got back into the car.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.580
 This is so funny. This is so funny.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:43.580
 He drove into a bus station. Gernum Singh drove the second coming of Christ to the bus station, and as he was walking into the bus station, Gernum Singh goes, "Where are you headed?"

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:48.580
 And he turns around and he goes, "Back to heaven."

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:54.580
 And then he just gets on a bus! He just gets on a bus! And he's never been seen since.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:02.580
 Fascinating, fascinating story. That photograph scared me for the longest time. I thought that this guy might actually be the anti-Christ.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:08.580
 I never thought that he was actually the second coming of Christ, but he was one that was going to deceive us, and I didn't want that to happen, right?

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:16.580
 I still had a bunch of episodes in the next generation to watch, and it did not happen. But I want to wrap this story up like this.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:27.580
 There's a quote on the Share International website that talks about what things are going to be like when the Christ, when the matreo makes himself known.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.580
 I want to read this to you.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:37.580
 "The Christ will come on the world's television channels, linked together by satellite.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:47.580
 All those with access to television will see his face. He will establish a telepathic rapport with all humanity simultaneously.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:33:05.580
 While the Christ is speaking, everyone will feel far more loved than they've ever felt before. That massive outpouring of love will cause hundreds of thousands of miracle cures to take place simultaneously."

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.580
 That's terrifying to me.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:18.580
 That idea is so antithetical to what I believe in. That's terrifying to me.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:25.580
 Because I'm wondering now if I read one of these ads when I was a teenager.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.580
 Because the thing is, is that there's two parts of this.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:35.580
 Obviously, with the anti-Christ is coming and you're just walking by a television set and like a best buy, and you just see like,

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:44.580
 the stuff you've seen like in the rise of Cobra, G.I. Joe movies and stuff, you see all the televisions change and it's a picture of this stranger you've never seen before.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:52.580
 And it begins talking and you have this gut reaction that this person is not who he says he is.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:58.580
 But you see everyone else around you just falling to their knees.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.580
 Weeping openly.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.580
 They finally have peace in their hearts.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.580
 And you're just standing there and you don't understand it.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:13.580
 And you start to see other people start to approach the televisions because they just hear people weeping in the electronics department.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:18.580
 And they're walking closer and you hear it, you turn around and you see other people just falling to their knees.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:26.580
 They're just joy on their face and they're sobbing as they're watching this man who's speaking this message of peace and love.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:35.580
 And you're watching this and you know this person is not who he says he is.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:45.580
 You could easily fall to your feet and pretend to cry just so they don't notice you're different.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.580
 You could go along with it.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.580
 Maybe you do feel a little bit of peace in your heart.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.580
 Things definitely are better.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.580
 There's less pollution.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.580
 There's no more wars, no more crime.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:07.580
 Everyone seems to love each other but you are just going through the motions.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:15.580
 You live in the world you know you live in the world controlled by a demonic entity.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:20.580
 But nobody else realizes it.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.580
 Or do you know?

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.580
 Do you know?

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.580
 In the book of Revelation it says even the learned will be deceived.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:37.580
 Even the people who have studied the Bible, studied the Quran, studied the Torah, meditated and refined their mind for decades.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:44.580
 They will also fall prey to this Antichrist.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.580
 It's a terrifying story and it's a terrifying vision.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:55.580
 The loss of free will, even if it's the loss of free will for a paradise, is the worst thing that can happen.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:00.580
 Free will is what separates us from the animals.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:07.580
 With that gone, we're just a planet of servants.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:13.580
 So that is why the idea of the matreah terrified me and I bet you anything I read this ad when I was a teenager.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:22.580
 Because the idea of just passing by a television set and losing your free will to this powerful force.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.580
 Who could fight against that?

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:34.580
 I always have this question, if the book of Revelation is real and the devil knows how the story ends, why does he continue to fight?

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.580
 And we've discussed that on other episodes.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:41.580
 But I have a sneaking suspicion the reason why he continues to fight.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:48.580
 Even though the book ends this way, is that he knows there's a clause.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:55.580
 He knows there's a chance that he wins.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:04.580
 And if he does, and this Antichrist comes down and warps our minds and makes us worship him.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:09.580
 And the kingdom of God falls and the angels are slaughtered in battle.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:18.580
 It may start off as a paradise on earth, one that we greeted with open arms and weeping eyes.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:24.580
 But it will end with eternal hell.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:33.580
 Not just a planet, but a universe ruled over by the darkest entities ever created.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.580
 Truly a terrifying thought.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:44.580
 It just brings back memories of me being a young man, being in fear of what may happen tomorrow.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:53.580
 I may be older, I may be wiser, but I still believe that this can come to pass.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.580
 If not the matreah, someone else.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:07.580
 After all they've been planning the conquest of this reality since before it was created.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.580
