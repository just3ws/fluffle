 British Swim School. Make a splash.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 When a fire breaks out in an apartment complex, all the residents rush to save each other.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 But when the firefighters show up and they begin to douse the flames, that's when the mystery begins.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 And then we travel to Belize to ask the question, "Can a serial killer kill someone they've never met?"

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 [Music]

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carviner. I'm having a great day.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm feeling a lot better too, so hopefully that is apparent in my voice.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Feeling much, much better. Someone who always makes me feel better. Always giving me a ride around town.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Everyone stand up and give a round of applause to one of our Thanksgiving live stream contributors.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 It's Church Going Mule. Everyone give a big round of applause for Church Going Mule.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I'm riding around on his back. Wee!

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Church Going's also sent in a ton of stories as well. Long time supporter of the show. Long time listener of the show.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Church Going Mule, you're going to be the captain of the pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it. Trust me, I get it.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. That helps out so much. I understand not being able to give money financially.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 But if you can just tell your friends and family about it or put up flyers like I have in the show notes, that also really, really helps out the show.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I really appreciate it. Oh, and we are going to do a Christmas Eve live stream. It will be 5pm Pacific Standard Time.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 If you want to join us for that, it will probably be about an hour long, I'm thinking.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 So Christmas Eve live stream. I think that's all of the general notes that I have to start off with.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Church Going Mule, I'm going to go ahead and get ready to catch them in your clompers there. Church Going Mule, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're headed all the way out to Mexico.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 *Burps*

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I want to take this Durgible in it sounds like a really happy cat.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 We're headed out to Altamira. That's in the Canarios subdivision in Mexico.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 This story is fairly recent. This story is taking place like last week, mid-December 2021.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 So this story still has a lot of fresh witness statements on it.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 It's 4 in the morning.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And Fabiola Bounostro and her husband are sleeping in their little apartment complex in Altamira.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 *Burps*

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And then *Burps*

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 They're like what is psycho coming into the house? Are we about to be stabbed to death in bed?

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 That's supposed to be the sound of a fire alarm. So Fabiola jumps up. She's like oh no.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And she hears the neighbor's fire alarm going off.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 *Burps*

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And she's like get up husband, get up husband. And he's like what?

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I was having a beautiful dream about stabbing you to death in the shower.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 She wakes him up and they run over to the neighbor's apartment. There's like smoke coming out of the door.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 *Burps*

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Fiery noises and stuff.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And the intense heat and the intense heat.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And they hear someone coughing on the other side of the door and screaming.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 There's someone trapped in this fiery apartment.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So they do...it's always tough in these types of situations. Like you're not supposed to like open the door.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 But you also are not supposed to let people roast alive.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 So I don't know if I'd be brave enough to open the door.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 But anyways, they go to open the door and at this point their neighbors are like showing up with buckets of water.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And I guess that would make the difference of whether or not I'd open the door if I thought we could put it out.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 If I was in a hallway and I was like oh, I wonder what's going on in here.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Ah, and I was going to burn alive.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 But if my neighbors were standing there with water buckets and they're like Jason, you're the one with free hands.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Can you open the door please? I'm like I'm scared.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So they're throwing water into the room and Fabiola and her husband see a woman in the middle of this burning room.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And they reach in and they pull her out.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Pull her out of this room.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 The whole complex gets evacuated because of this.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And the firefighters are showing up.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 [Makes fire noises]

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Firemen jumping out.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Squeaky squeaky. Those are their boots. Those are their boots.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 They're walking up the stairs. They're putting the fire out.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And now all of the residents are out on the street corner and they start talking about what happened.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And Fabiola goes, "Yeah, it was actually the fire started right next to ours. It was like our neighbor."

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 "Yeah, we had to go over there and we had to rescue her. We had to rescue her right there."

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And Fabiola goes to like point to her.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 The woman's gone.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And then her husband's looking around.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 He's like, "I don't see her either."

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And Fabiola's like, "Oh no, she was just here. The woman that we rescued from the fire was just here."

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 But now she's not.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And the crowd of people, the crowd of residents kind of looked for this girl.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 They got a description of her, but no one could find her.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And one of the residents goes, "That apartment next to you? There's not anyone there. There's no one living there."

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Fabiola and her husband kind of look at each other.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 They're like, "There was someone there just a couple minutes ago."

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 So after the firefighters do their job and they go, "Wait."

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 [Makes fire noises]

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 They wait until the sound effect stops before everyone else kind of shuffles back into the apartment complex.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 The more curious among them, including Fabiola and her husband,

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 go upstairs. I think it was taking place like on the fourth floor.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 So they go up to the apartment and they open the door and it's wet and it's charred.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 The place is pretty charred up. The fire didn't completely destroy the place.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 But it was empty.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 There's no furniture, no television, no PlayStation, nothing.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 All that was there was a bucket, a charred nightstand,

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 which I'm assuming was a normal nightstand before the events of the night.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 A little bench, a mirror.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And because this story was reported in Spanish, so there's a bit of translation errors,

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 but in a velodora ahumada, a velodora ahumada,

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 which directly translates as a smoked candle.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 So I don't know what that is.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I mean, obviously I'm gonna guess it's a candle that was used.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 A used candle, which would point out how the fire started, this used candle.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 But other than that, there was nobody there.

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And the residents now believe that in some sort of odd way,

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 if I'm just so fascinating, the residents kind of believe, I won't say all of them,

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 maybe 30% of them, we didn't take a poll, but there are residents now who believe that Fabiola and her husband

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 are really all the people who were thrown water into the apartment.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 They rescued a ghost.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 This was a ghost trapped in this apartment.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And she's now free to wander the world, to go buy a slurpee, whatever.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Fascinating story for a couple different reasons.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 One, what we're looking at is the traditional Phantom Hitchhiker type story, right?

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 A couple driving down the road, they see a girl, she looks like she's a teenager,

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 maybe on the way to her prom, or she got dumped by her boyfriend, whatever.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And you drive her home, and then when you get to your house, she turns back,

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 and all that's left is a soaking wet jacket.

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 If I left a detail out, usually this happens at night in the rain,

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 and the guy gives the girl the jacket, and then when they turn around,

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 they pull up to the girl's house, they get her there, and then when they look in the back seat,

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 there's just a soaked jacket.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And then they go to the house and they ask, "Hey, that girl, she totally ruined my jacket."

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And the people in the house go, "Oh, our daughter, Anne, died on a horrible night just like this,

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 and I killed her, I'm confessing I, the dad killed her."

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 But no, you know, she died on a car crash, or she's headed to prom,

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 got her head chopped off by maniac, and so this is a Phantom Hitchhiker story.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 They're very, very popular.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I think it's one of the first urban legends kids really here.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 We have that in a different setting, because that's essentially what this is.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 If it's a ghost story, we have someone being rescued from a location they don't want to be in,

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 and being set free.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 So on a simple urban legend, and this has been reported in the media,

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 so I'm not saying like this is an urban legend, but from a simple urban legend standpoint,

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 it sounds like that.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I came across a story on coast2coastam.com, which is one of the seven websites they check every single day.

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 I love it, I get a ton of good stuff from there.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And they got it from millennio.com, which is a Mexican news website.

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 But we have this, obviously it's a couple different ways we look at it.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 We have the rational way that there is a used candle in an abandoned apartment,

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 and this woman was squatting there.

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 She was on the run from like the IRS, or her ex, or whatever, or she's some assassin.

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And I mean, whatever whimsical or tragic backstory you want for this woman,

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 and she knocks over the candle, she causes the fire, gets trapped, she's rescued,

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 and then when she's outdoors, she's like, "Oh, I'm out of here, do not...

138
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I'm on the run! I gotta keep doing what I'm doing, running!"

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 She disappears into the darkness.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 It's 4 a.m. when this all happens.

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Or the idea that it is a ghost, it's a Phantom Hitchhiker type story,

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 but I was reading the story and I go, "Dude, what if it's... both?"

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Kind of, right?

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Because I'm a contrarian, I just can't handle it being cut and dry.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I was reading the story and I thought, "Okay, so there is a smoked candle,

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 a used candle, whatever it is, in the room, and that might have started the fire,

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 but it seemed to be a pretty big fire.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I don't know what else would have been combustible in that room."

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And the way it was described now, again, maybe I described it as this roaring inferno,

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 and it was just a slight fire.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 There's really no such thing as a slight fire.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 We don't know how much room of it was, how much surface area was on fire,

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 but again, again, one square foot or ten square feet, I'm out of there.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 But I was reading this and I thought, "Dude, what if... conspiracy cap fully on?

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 What if this woman is on the run, this wasn't where she normally lives,

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 she's not a ghost, she's kind of a squatter,

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 and she was there performing some sort of ritual?"

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And she's there, I mean, to be the perfect place, right?

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 If you're gonna summon some sort of horrible demon or do something that, you know,

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 you're gonna do something that could be risky, you're not gonna do it at your own house.

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I mean, you could, you'd be adult, you'd definitely lower the private value

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 when Baphomet is always sitting on your toilet.

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 So imagine someone, and I started thinking,

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I wonder how often this happens at empty real estate houses and things like that,

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 where you break into this house, you perform your ritual there.

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 A mirror, a candle, a bench.

167
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Those are all things humans use, right?

168
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 But those are also things, those are also things that are used in rituals.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 I just find that so fascinating, I mean, that's what you would do if you were dealing with high-level magic,

170
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 high-level summoning, you go to a place that's not yours, you're doing this ritual, it goes wrong,

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 the room, it goes so wrong, the room erupts in flames, the ritual's gone wrong, you leave the scene.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 You get out of there and you leave.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Well, if she did open something, did she close it?

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 What's the repercussions of her performing this ritual wrong?

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Is that next door apartment to Fabiola and her husband no longer abandoned, no longer empty?

176
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Instead, there's something there, some primal force sitting in the dark apartment,

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 waiting for someone to open that door again.

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I mean, in that scenario, you would want it to be the ghost, right?

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 You would definitely want it to be the ghostly hitchhiker in a scenario like that,

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 but that's what I was thinking when I was reading this article, I thought.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 This could be something far darker than just someone on the run, or a Phantom Hitchhiker type story.

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 This could have been someone trying to summon something.

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 It went sideways.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 She left and that rift, that door, still there.

185
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 It's always creepy to think, I mean, you have no control over what your neighbors do,

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 whether or not they're squatters or just irregular neighbors.

187
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 They could be working with dark forces, either accidentally or on purpose,

188
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 but even if their kids are just goofing off with a Ouija board, they're right next to your really thin walls.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 You're sharing a single wall with some 13-year-old girl's room,

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 and your friends are constantly doing Ouija boards, and they're like, "What? This doesn't work.

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 This is lame."

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And you're constantly being possessed in your house.

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 "Ah, Bobby will not ask you to dance.

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Ah."

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And you're flipping out, your eyeballs are bulging out.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 But you just never know, right? You never know what your neighbors are up to.

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And that's really a good segue for our next story.

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Church going mule, I'm going to toss you the keys of the Carbenter copter.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 We're leaving behind.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Up to Mira.

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 We're headed all the way out to Belize.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 [imitates carbenter copter]

203
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Church going mule is flying us over to Belize,

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 and as he's doing that, I'm going to turn around,

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 I'm going to look to you sitting in the backseat of the Carbenter copter.

206
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I'm like, "Okay, so I got to warn you, this story's really creepy."

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 This story's really creepy.

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I'm getting the emails.

209
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I probably get them at the end of every season.

210
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 "Hey Jason, the show's getting a little too dark, and I don't know why that happens.

211
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 I kind of just report the stories that I find.

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 But this story intrigued me so much that I actually postponed other stories.

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 They're not going to get done until next season.

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 It's going to be two weeks because I'm taking my season break."

215
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 This story's really creepy, and it is really dark,

216
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 so I'm giving you this warning, but I just sometimes you just got to cover them.

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 This story is so bizarre.

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 But if you don't want to hear something really disturbing, I will see you Friday.

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I mean, again, it is Christmas time.

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I'm probably going to plan it out better, but man, this story's nuts.

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Church going mule, bring us over Belize City.

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 That's in the Belize district, in the country of Belize.

223
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I don't know. They just must not have a really good naming team over there,

224
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 a marketing team or whatever.

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It's September 8th, 1998, and in Belize City, there is a young girl named Cherily Nicholas.

226
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 She's 13 years old.

227
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 She's walking to school.

228
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 She never gets there.

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And the parents start looking for her, and the police start looking for her,

230
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 and the neighborhood starts looking for her, and no one can find Cherily Nicholas.

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 October 9th, 1998.

232
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Cherily Nicholas is found in a pool of water off the highway.

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 She suffered 40 stab wounds.

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 One of her arms was almost completely severed, and before she was killed, she was raped.

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 When the police get to this body, they're investigating the scene, trying to process it,

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 both in a mental way, how could this even happen, as well as just process the evidence.

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And they come across an alarming discovery.

238
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Cherily is not wearing the clothes that she wore when she was abducted,

239
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 so they go, they must have kept her alive for a period of time, but how, for how long?

240
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 She's not wearing the same clothes she was wearing when she was abducted.

241
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Must have taken her shopping or had clothes available for her.

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And as they're continuing to process this scene, someone points out,

243
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 "Sir, sir, the clothes that she's wearing, the clothes that Cherily Nicholas is wearing right now,

244
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 those are the clothes of J Blades."

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 The officer goes, "Who, who's J Blades?"

246
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And the cop says, "J Blades is a nine-year-old girl who went missing two days ago."

247
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 So the cops now believe that Cherily was most likely kept alive from September 8th to just two days ago.

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 When whoever this maniac was kidnapped another girl off the street.

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 A replacement? Who knows.

250
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 J Blades was missing until around six months later,

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 when her skull and a few of her bones were found in the wilderness,

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 sitting next to Cherily's backpack.

253
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 March 23rd, 1999, Jackie Fern Malick, 12-year-old girl.

254
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 She was playing at her school playground. She disappears.

255
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Later found dead.

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 June 26th, 1999, Erica Willis, eight-year-old girl.

257
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Missing, murdered, body is found.

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 February 15th, 2000, Noemi Hernandez, 14-year-old girl.

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Suffers the same fate as the previous four. Five children in total.

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Kidnapped, raped, murdered, body dumped in the middle of nowhere.

261
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 This serial killer is known as the Belize Ripper.

262
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 They really can't name anything that doesn't have the word "Belize" in it.

263
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 But he's known as the Belize Ripper, aka Jack the Butcher.

264
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Because what he was doing to these kids.

265
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And I'm leaving out some of the most... I'm trying to make it as least gruesome as possible.

266
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 But it was bad.

267
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 What he was doing was awful.

268
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 So the police are hunting for him. But they never caught this guy.

269
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 They never have ever solved this case. It's actually considered the nation of Belize's biggest cold case.

270
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Who was Jack the Butcher?

271
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Look, I had a couple suspects, right? They arrested a couple people, but nothing ever really panned out.

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And so we always have to go down this route with serial killers, because they never seem to stop on their own.

273
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 The serial killer kind of drops out of the hunting grounds.

274
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Authorities always go, "Well, he may have moved. He may have died. Killed himself or got killed in a car accident."

275
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Or he might be in prison.

276
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Like, those are always... You could look at the slight possibility of someone like the BTK killer who took a break.

277
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Who didn't do anything for years and years and years of their own volition.

278
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 It's super rare, though.

279
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 You always got to look at, "It's this, that, and the other thing."

280
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 But to me, that's not even the creepiest part of what we're going to talk about.

281
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 It's a true crime story. I hate to say a standard true crime story, but we do have these.

282
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 We have serial killers running around doing atrocious things to people.

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 But that's not the reason why I basically stopped the presses on the other episode I was going to do,

284
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 to tell this dark, dark story at the height of the Belize Ripper slain's.

285
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 The police started investigating similar crimes. They're trying to look at any clue of who this guy could be.

286
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And on November 6, 1998, near the Old Civic Center...

287
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 If you're in the area, maybe you know where that's at, but near the Old Civic Center,

288
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Samantha Gordon, a 15-year-old girl, goes missing.

289
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 She's found two days later.

290
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Her bruised and bloody body is found floating in the sea.

291
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 She was stabbed to death.

292
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 So the police believe that she might be part of the Jack the Butcher murder spree.

293
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So they go out there and they check on it. They're investigating it.

294
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And he had nothing to do with this murder. They ended up arresting four young men

295
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 and convicted them for this murder.

296
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Now was that... was the death of Samantha Gordon a copycat?

297
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Or was it just... was this woman unfortunately going to be beset upon by these four men, no matter what?

298
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And they just happened to kill her in a way that was kind of reminiscent.

299
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And it's interesting because when we look at the slayings of Jack the Butcher,

300
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 his bodies are found way after the children are initially missing.

301
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 But with this Samantha Gordon one, it was only two days.

302
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 So I think that probably keyed the officers off that this might not be related.

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And it wasn't related.

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 February 15, 1999, in Corozal Town, and this is another part of the country of beliefs,

305
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Becky Gil-Harry, 13-year-old girl, goes missing.

306
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 She is found dead. She was strangled.

307
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Is this him? Is this him changing his MO back in February 15, 1999?

308
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Do police officers investigate this?

309
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Family friend of the Gil-Harry's.

310
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Family friend of Becky's family.

311
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Robert Hill, 22-year-old man, murdered her.

312
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Took this 13-year-old girl and strangled her. Friend of the family.

313
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So now you're starting to think, is this some sort of copycat thing?

314
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Like the first four guys, we don't have much information on them.

315
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 They could have been hooligans. I'm not excusing it, but there are unfortunately different stages of murder, right?

316
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 There's a bunch of money to the mob type of murder, and then there's abducted from your playground murder.

317
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And that's just, it's an unfortunate striation of the way you have victims.

318
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 I don't know what the first girl's thing was. She could have burned them on a bad drug deal.

319
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I don't know. She could have just been a random...

320
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 If she was a random choice, I would think they were trying to do a copycat murder, is what I'm saying.

321
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 But with, we have this... I don't think Becky Gil-Harry owed money to the mob.

322
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 13-year-old girl goes missing, and we know she didn't, because we know more information about this murder.

323
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Robert Hill, family friend, 22-years-old. What was it, a copycat?

324
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 June 1999, in the town of Orange Walk, Karen Cruz.

325
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 You're like, Jason, please just let this episode stop, bro. You've been naming off these...

326
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I know, I know. Trust me, this is the last one. We're gonna wrap it up here.

327
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 And this is the doozy for me. This is the one that...

328
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Karen Cruz, a 10-year-old girl, goes missing.

329
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I mean, she is raped and murdered and left out in a field.

330
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And again, the police are still investigating this, as has Jack the Butcher struck again.

331
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 It was her uncle. Her uncle who lived next door to her.

332
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 He was obsessed with this 10-year-old niece.

333
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Neighbors, that's what they said. They go, "Yeah, dude, he was super creepy with her. He's always watching her."

334
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 His name was Antonio Beza, his 38-years-old, tried and convicted for the murder of his niece.

335
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 This is so terrifying to me.

336
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I can wrap my head around a serial killer. I can wrap my head around someone being so broken

337
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 that they can't function in normal human society, so they figure that it is not them

338
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 that is the little one, it is not them that is the child among giants.

339
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 They're the giant and the rest of the world are children, and man was meant to be hunted.

340
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And if only we could coal the weak and let the rain wash down on the sinners.

341
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 All of that stupid delusional nonsense that basically they never grew out of their 12-year-old edgy phase.

342
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 That's a serial killer. And I can wrap my head around a serial killer.

343
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 I can wrap my head around lunatics.

344
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 I can wrap my head around people snapping as much as I hate it as much as that's the scariest story for me, someone snapping.

345
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 But what I find so weird and so creepy about this is there's a couple different ways we could look at this.

346
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Antonio Beza, 38-year-old man living next door to his niece Karen Cruz, 10-year-old girl.

347
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 It's possible that this dude was always a sicko.

348
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 It's possible that from day one this dude was a sicko and he might have moved next to the house so he could be close to Karen.

349
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And he'd been stalking her for the longest time and then he couldn't handle it anymore.

350
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 He went after her, took her life.

351
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And I can wrap my head around that.

352
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Not saying it's good, but I've seen evil like that in the world.

353
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 So if I just saw that as a headline I'd be like, "That's a tragedy."

354
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 But it wouldn't shock me, right? That's unfortunate.

355
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 It doesn't shock us anymore.

356
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Then let's look at a paranormal answer.

357
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 What happens when you have evil come to town?

358
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 What happens when you have raw, unfiltered, malignant darkness show up at a location?

359
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 When you shine a light, the light spreads.

360
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 You have the flashlight and it makes the perfect circle, but the light is more than that.

361
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 The light branches off everywhere and you can see it doesn't just light up what you're looking at.

362
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 It kind of lights up everything around you.

363
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 You know, you're aiming the light right here.

364
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Do we see the same thing with evil?

365
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 It could be encased in a single man.

366
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 It could be this possession, this darkness encased in this human being.

367
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 If he went to a Jamba Juice and he's not actively murdering anyone right now, would other people feel that?

368
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Would that evil kind of infest off of him?

369
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Is that a word?

370
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Would the evil just kind of crawl off of him, ooze off of him?

371
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Almost like a venom symbiote type of thing.

372
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Leaving little patches of it.

373
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 We've actually talked about it.

374
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I don't even remember the episode about it, but we talked about it on a past episode about,

375
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 "Can you leave emotional or psychic or magical landmines?"

376
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Damn it, what episode was that?

377
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 That was a good one.

378
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Hopefully one of you guys remember that one, but I can't put it in the show notes.

379
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I have no idea what it was.

380
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 We create this stuff by being so evil, so is it possible?

381
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Because we have at least three other victims that Jack the Butcher never saw,

382
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 but I'm making the claim that he is responsible for their deaths,

383
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 because I think they probably were copycats.

384
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Even the first one.

385
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 It may not have been, but I'm thinking these were copycats, right?

386
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 And it wasn't because this man was walking around the leaves, murdering and butchering these children,

387
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 and it was just letting off so much psychic energy it was infesting other people.

388
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 These dudes would have never done this.

389
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Never ever thought about doing any of this stuff.

390
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Antonio Beyes was totally innocent, never had any creepy dark thoughts,

391
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 until he became infested with this stuff.

392
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 But that's not even the creepiest...

393
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 When I was reading this, and I was saying it in the parenth...

394
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Now you guys see how I read articles.

395
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 My mind's just kind of going off in all sorts of ways,

396
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 but even when I was saying this paranormal answer, I go, "That's not even the creepiest answer."

397
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Because even though I hate the stories about people just snapping and then like losing it,

398
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 that's not even the creepiest version, stepping on some sort of psychic landmine.

399
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Yeah, it's disturbing, but the creepiest version to me is most likely the truest one.

400
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 What I honestly think was going through Antonio Beyes's head was this.

401
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 He was obsessed with that little girl.

402
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 He was obsessed with his 10-year-old niece.

403
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 He was a creep. He was a pervert.

404
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 He was a weirdo, like I said in the first example,

405
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 but instead of just not being able to contain that anymore,

406
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 not being able to contain this madness anymore, he lashed on this girl,

407
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 he was methodical about it.

408
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 He knew for years he was going to violate and murder his niece.

409
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 He fantasized about it.

410
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 He wanted it.

411
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 But he couldn't have it. It was just so close yet so far away.

412
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 It's just so creepy that this guy with the niece,

413
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 this guy was living next door as this uncle,

414
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 I'm sure he seemed to be the friendliest guy.

415
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 I'm sure even neighbors might have told Karen's parents,

416
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 "Hey, that uncle's kind of creepy."

417
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Generally, they'll just be like, "Yeah, Uncle Antonio, he's kind of a weirdo."

418
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Ha ha ha.

419
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And the neighbors are like, "No, you don't understand.

420
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 This guy's like totally like pervin' on your kid."

421
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 A lot of times families will kind of brush that stuff off.

422
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Always to their detriment.

423
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 But imagine that.

424
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Imagine living next to someone.

425
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Imagine having this guy in your family who's sitting there at the dinner table,

426
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 seeming to be the funnest guy in the world,

427
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 hanging out, volunteering a babysit,

428
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 and he wants to do the unspeakable to your child,

429
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 and the only thing that's stopping him is he thinks he will get caught.

430
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 So he lets those images and fantasies and feelings simmer inside of him

431
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 until one day a string of murders is publicized all over.

432
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 The news, the television, newspaper.

433
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He's watching these programs and he's reading the paper and he thinks,

434
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 "Now is the time."

435
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Absolutely terrifying.

436
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 A string of serial killings happening in this city,

437
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 and six more other people who have nothing to do with those crimes

438
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 are arrested for murder, similar murders.

439
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Time bombs.

440
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Time bombs in human society just waiting to go off.

441
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Just looking for a moment that they believe they can kill someone and get away with it.

442
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 So as the holidays begin,

443
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 and you gather with your family,

444
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 you travel maybe across the city, maybe across the country,

445
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 to go see your loved ones.

446
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Just remember,

447
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 behind every firm handshake,

448
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 behind every smiling face,

449
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 you may be standing next to a monster.

450
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 A monster who hides themselves so well,

451
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 you can never imagine the dark images that crawl within their mind.

452
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And hopefully you'll never get to know that.

453
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Hopefully you'll never have to see into their mind

454
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 or see the actions they lay upon the earth.

455
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 But whether it's a serial killer who has perfected their craft,

456
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 or just a pervert uncle sitting on the porch,

457
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 staring at his niece as she plays with her friends,

458
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 you never really know who you're standing next to.

459
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 You never really know who you call a friend.
