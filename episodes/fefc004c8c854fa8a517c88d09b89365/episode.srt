1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 The ghost pepper has a reputation.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,100
 So does a ghost pepper wing that doesn't send you into tears make any sense?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,000
 Does to us.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 That's why Popeyes ghost pepper wings are the perfect balance of flavor and fire.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
 Popeyes starts with intensely cravable flavor,

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,900
 adds the right amount of kick to keep things interesting,

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,100
 not inferno-ing,

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,900
 and then offers them at only $5 for six pieces.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,300
 Because in New Orleans, we like to taste our food.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,400
 Not cry over it.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
 Call us crazy.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,800
 Love that chicken from Popeyes.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,400
 Limited time at participating U.S. restaurants price may vary, additional terms apply.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,500
 A sheriff's deputy goes for a jog,

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,200
 and his entire life changes.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,400
 And then we take a look at the story of the grinning man.

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,600
 Tall, lanky, maniacal smile.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,500
 He stares at you from the darkness.

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,400
 His insanity is his greatest weapon.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,500
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:05,200
 [Music]

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,700
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter.

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,800
 I'm having a great day.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,700
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,500
 We're gonna go ahead and jump right into this because we got a lot of stuff to cover.

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,600
 So let's go ahead and put on our jumping pants and wee down the...

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,400
 That's...

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,100
 I'm gonna sit down the rabbit hole, but that always sounds so stupid.

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
 Just a hole.

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,200
 Wee, we're going down the hole.

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,800
 We're gonna fall all the way down this hole.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,000
 We have to find new modes of transportation since the Carvener copter got blown up,

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,300
 but we fall all the way down the hole to Azalea, Oregon.

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,800
 Now, I have no idea where that's at, but it sounds pretty.

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
 It sounds serene.

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
 It sounds peaceful.

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,600
 And we're specifically going back to March 19, 1991.

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,700
 Hair metal was on its way out.

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,800
 Grunge was on its way in.

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,500
 Next year, Terminator 2 was going to be released at Theaters.

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,900
 And I was...

43
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,400
 14 years old when this story took place.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,600
 Odd, really?

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,900
 17 and 94, so yeah, I was 14 years old.

46
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,200
 I was a freshman in high school as the story took place.

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,900
 Not like that has any bearing on the story itself, but...

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,800
 I just want you to imagine Little Jason in his cross colors, big, giant African medallion,

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,400
 and baggy pants on backwards in this story.

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,100
 And I'm standing like a B-boy.

51
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,100
 I'm just in the background of every part of the story standing just like that.

52
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,500
 Now, I have to have a little levity because this story gets a little grim.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,400
 What we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be talking about the story of Tommy Gibson.

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,200
 Tommy Gibson was a two and a half year old boy playing in his yard.

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,900
 And he's just kind of messing around, chasing caterpillars,

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,500
 sticking sticks and ant holes, stuff like that, stuff that kids do.

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,800
 And his father, Larry Gibson, Sheriff's deputy, says,

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,200
 "Hey, hey Tommy, Tommy, don't go anywhere, wait till your sister comes out.

59
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,000
 But you gotta stay in the yard."

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,600
 And he's like, "Okay."

61
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,000
 So, and Larry Gibson's like, "Okay, my son's gonna...

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,200
 He's a good boy, he's not gonna do anything."

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,500
 So he leaves the yard and goes for a jog, like he had planned to do.

64
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,100
 Now, generally when he goes on his jog, he keeps his 45 on him, his sidearm,

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,600
 he goes for the jog, he keeps it on him for protection.

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,100
 He also is having a serious issue with cats, feral cats in the area.

67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,600
 Rrraaaww! Not giant ones, but like little ones,

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,100
 but still they're kind of damaging the property and he was shooting the cats.

69
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,700
 So, automatically all you cat lovers out there are like, "That guy is a scumbag."

70
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,200
 But I'm just telling you what he was doing.

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,500
 He was shooting cats, not for fun, he was just getting them off of his property.

72
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,000
 He goes for his jog.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,900
 At some point during the jog, his wife, Tommy's mom, here's a gunshot.

74
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,200
 And she goes, "Oh, Larry! Casual animal abuse! So romantic!"

75
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
 And she just keeps washing the dishes.

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,800
 I don't know, maybe she was an attorney, that was sexist,

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,800
 but anyway, she's doing something in the house.

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
 She hears the gunshot.

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,700
 She eventually goes, "Oh, I need to go out and get Tommy."

80
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:14,900
 Changes diaper and then do the laundry and/or run a successful company because I'm a CEO.

81
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,500
 I don't know.

82
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,600
 So anyways, so she goes out to find Tommy.

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
 He's missing.

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,500
 She's like, "Hmm, where could that little scoundrel be?"

85
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 She's looking around for him, "Tommy! Tommy!"

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,100
 Can't find him.

87
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,100
 She's starting to get worried because he's two and a half left out in this front yard.

88
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,500
 45 minutes after he left, Larry Gibson gets back to his house from his jog and he's like,

89
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,700
 "Oh, man. Oh, man, I can't. It was a good jog, man. I've been running for 45 minutes.

90
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,700
 Look at my watch. Remember that, honey? 45 minutes is when I left 45 minutes ago."

91
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,100
 And she's like, "Yeah, yeah. Why are you acting so weird?"

92
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,400
 He's like, "I'm just out of breath."

93
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,200
 And she goes, "Well, you're going to have to be even more out of breath because our son's missing,

94
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,000
 so we got to find him so start running around looking for our son."

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,500
 Now, they end up calling the police, obviously.

96
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,300
 Police come out.

97
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,100
 And at this point, Larry's panicking. The mom's panicking.

98
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,800
 They have a daughter, an older daughter as well. Everyone's panicking. The police show up.

99
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,300
 Police are trying to calm everyone down and Larry's like, "You know what? No, dude. Screw this, dude."

100
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,200
 He's like, "I'm going to go take my shower." They're like, "You are awfully sweaty."

101
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,500
 He's like, "Yeah, I was jogging for 45 minutes here."

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,600
 My wife saw me come back 45 minutes later and she's like, "That's kind of weird."

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,200
 Anyway, so he's like, "I'm so sweaty. I'm going to go take a shower, nice, hot, relaxing shower,

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,600
 put on my cop uniform."

105
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,700
 And the other cops at this point are like, "That's a weird thing, but maybe he just really needs a shower

106
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,900
 and he wants to have the authority of his uniform as he's looking for his son."

107
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,200
 So anyways, he goes in these showers. They're not waiting around for him, but

108
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,300
 he's like reading a magazine on the toilet. They're like, "Hey, Larry, we're trying to search for your kid.

109
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,300
 Are you going to come out?" And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be in a second. I'm sorry.

110
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,000
 I'm just reading this article. It's really good."

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,600
 And then they hear like the hot water turn on and he's like waiting for it to get hotter.

112
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,300
 They're like, "But anyways, so they're already searching for the kid. They don't want to wait around for him."

113
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,100
 Larry eventually comes out of the shower and he's wearing his uniform, starts searching for the kid as well.

114
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,000
 They can't find him. They're interviewing all the neighbors. They're interviewing the family members.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
 They're trying to figure out what's going on.

116
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,400
 Now, the only thing that they know is there was a gunshot fired at some time, but the wife was like,

117
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,100
 "There's most likely my husband's shooting a cat."

118
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,700
 And he goes, "I did. I shot a cat."

119
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,900
 And the investigators found a cat with a bullet hole through it on his property.

120
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,300
 Like, it was walking along the fence and a bullet went through it and killed it.

121
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,100
 So cops are like, "Okay, that explains the gunshot, but it doesn't explain where the kid is."

122
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,400
 So they keep looking.

123
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,100
 He is then told by his boss, "You don't have to come to work. Really, just go home. Take your uniform off.

124
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,800
 Just relax. We got this handle." And he's like, "No. Gotta help find my son. I know that he's out there.

125
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,300
 I can feel it. I can feel it on my bones."

126
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,800
 They're like, "Well, just stay at home."

127
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,600
 Okay? They don't openly want to say he's a suspect because he's a brother.

128
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,300
 He's a brother of the badge.

129
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,400
 But he's a suspect.

130
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,100
 They don't want him driving around in a cop car, but he disobeys orders, gets in his cop car,

131
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,500
 and he begins searching local rest areas looking for whoever took his son.

132
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,000
 Now, the FBI eventually comes out because it's a kidnapping.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
 And they begin interviewing the neighbors.

134
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,000
 And the neighbors go, "Hmm. You know, I did see like this beige van pull up,

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,700
 and there's like this white man and this white woman get out.

136
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,400
 And then, you know, I didn't see them actually take Tommy,

137
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,600
 but I did see these suspicious people around the house.

138
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,600
 And Larry's like, "Aha! Yes. Those are the people who took my son."

139
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 And the cops are like, "Well, it's possible. Possible. We'll look into it."

140
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,300
 Quit popping out of nowhere, Larry. You can't just keep doing that every time we find a clue.

141
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,700
 The police get a letter that's never been disclosed to the public,

142
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,200
 and it was signed "Spot on the Road" that contained information that they believe,

143
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,600
 that they, that led them to believe that the person who wrote the letter,

144
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,800
 knows what happened to little Tommy.

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,900
 But they've never disclosed what's in the letter.

146
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
 And then the case goes cold.

147
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,800
 There's really no leads outside of the van that pulled up.

148
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,500
 In 1993, there was a song, I love this song too,

149
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,800
 it was a song by Soul Asylum called "Runaway Train."

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,900
 And it's a song about runaways, and in the song, in the videos,

151
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,500
 they would show pictures of kids who had gone missing.

152
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,400
 And I didn't know this, but every country, or every region, I guess, had different photos.

153
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,100
 So the photos we saw in the American version of the video

154
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,200
 was different than the photos they showed in the British version of the video,

155
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,800
 or the South American version of the video, things like that.

156
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,600
 Out of that video, it's amazing to think.

157
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,100
 That video found 26 kids, not the video itself.

158
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,800
 The video didn't grow legs and start walking around,

159
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,800
 but because of that video, because of those photographs, 26 kids were found.

160
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,000
 One of them, though, said, "My family was abusive when I ran away,

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,100
 because they were abusive and I was at my boyfriend's house and your video came on.

162
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,000
 Thanks a lot, jerks."

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 She told them that, she went to a concert of theirs and said,

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,700
 "You guys ruined my life."

165
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,400
 Because I went back to a really bad environment.

166
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,500
 But 25, 25 happy endings.

167
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 And Tommy's image was in "Runaway Train" in 1993.

168
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,900
 I love that song. It's still a great song.

169
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,000
 1994, Larry Gibson is arrested for manslaughter.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,800
 And this is the working theory that the cops had.

171
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,000
 He shot the cat and the bullet went clean through the cat,

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 because it's a 45.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,500
 He goes clean through the cat and hit his son.

174
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,300
 And he found that his son had been hit and was bleeding out and panicked.

175
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,200
 So he hit the body and then went on the rest of his jog.

176
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,400
 When he came back, the cat, the kid was missing and he's like,

177
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,100
 "Oh, I'm just gonna go take a shower."

178
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,200
 And they think that he used his squad car to hide the body in and then dump it somewhere.

179
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,300
 That was what they argued in court.

180
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,400
 His daughter eventually said that she had seen him beat Tommy.

181
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,200
 She saw Larry beat Tommy until he went limp,

182
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 put him in a black trash bag, threw it in the back of the police car, drove away.

183
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 And then the FBI started to believe that when they were looking at notes,

184
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
 they said the cops interviewed the neighbors.

185
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,200
 They didn't mention anything about a beige van.

186
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
 But when the FBI interviewed the neighbors, they did.

187
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,200
 So they started thinking that Larry was basically witness tampering

188
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,900
 and telling them to say this, say this.

189
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,600
 So with two possible theories of how he died,

190
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,400
 either he was shot accidentally or the daughter saw him beat him to death,

191
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,300
 no real evidence of either one.

192
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,500
 Just a hunch.

193
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,300
 I mean, absolutely no evidence.

194
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,600
 And apparently, like people said, "Oh, he confessed to me that he killed the boy."

195
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,200
 But it was all hearsay.

196
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
 He denied all of it.

197
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,700
 No body, nothing.

198
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,100
 He gets convicted, oddly enough.

199
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,200
 Three years in prison for manslaughter was his sentence.

200
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,700
 So it was this weird hedge thing where they convicted him of a very, very minor charge.

201
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,600
 I mean, like manslaughter is a major charge, but three years in prison is really nothing.

202
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,900
 You can do that standing on your head.

203
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,200
 And then he gets out of prison and he still denies to this day

204
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,300
 I had nothing to do with the death of my son.

205
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,800
 I don't know who did it.

206
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,700
 He did say at one point in an interview with the police,

207
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,000
 he goes, when he was originally being investigated,

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,700
 they said, "Is it possible that you shot the cat and the bullet hit your son?"

209
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,500
 And he goes, "I guess it's possible.

210
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,300
 I mean, that would make sense, wouldn't it?

211
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,900
 But I didn't hide the body."

212
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,400
 He goes, "My brother-in-law who also lived there may have hid the body and not have told me,

213
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,800
 but I didn't hide the body."

214
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,200
 It's...

215
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,100
 So that also made them suspicious.

216
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,700
 But anyways, he got out and he's like, "I'm free, I'm free, and now I will find the real killers."

217
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,300
 I mean, kidnappers of my kid.

218
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,600
 Last we saw of Larry Gibson.

219
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
 I believe he's still alive.

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,300
 He's a country western musician.

221
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,700
 He moved to, I think it was Idaho or Montana.

222
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,000
 You might just be traveling that area.

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,400
 You can listen to his songs online.

224
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,000
 I'll have the website in the show notes.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,700
 I can't put any of his songs here, but feel free to listen to them.

226
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,400
 The best part of the website is...

227
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,500
 It's an old website and it warns you when you go to the photos page.

228
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,800
 This page is graphics heavy.

229
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,600
 If you're on dial up, it may take a while for all the pictures to load.

230
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,100
 A charming end to a chilling story.

231
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,400
 Did he actually accidentally shoot his son?

232
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,000
 And was able to clean up the crime scene in 20 minutes, including all the blood on the grass.

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,100
 The kid was silent the whole time.

234
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:38,700
 Nobody saw anything as he bagged this kid up, hid him, went on a jog,

235
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,500
 endured a police search as they were searching the area they didn't find the body.

236
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,700
 Then he's able to put the body into his police car without anyone noticing.

237
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,200
 And then dumping it without anyone seeing him.

238
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,500
 Did he beat a kid?

239
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,300
 Like her story kind of came out of the blue.

240
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,900
 Did he beat him?

241
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,500
 Put him in a trash bag, throw him in the back of the car and the mom not see him beat him?

242
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,900
 Did the boy not make any noise when he beat some?

243
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,100
 What's bizarre is like, I think the guy probably did do it.

244
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,900
 I don't think I'm not giving this whole thing like he's innocent.

245
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,000
 I just think it's weird that he got convicted with absolutely no evidence.

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,800
 Just hunches and what people were saying.

247
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,100
 And a sheriff's deputy for a member of law enforcement to be prosecuted successfully for something like this

248
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,900
 with no evidence is bizarre because normally it's the other way around.

249
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,200
 Normally there's that code of silence.

250
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,500
 I think one of the key pieces of evidence is that spot on the road letter.

251
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,700
 It either exonerates him completely or it damns him to his three-year prison sentence.

252
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,200
 But we don't know what that letter says.

253
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,500
 I think they're keeping that under wraps because of that.

254
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:02,000
 But whatever, guilty or innocent, Tommy is missing, presumed to be dead.

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,800
 And the father on his search for the real killers is playing honky-tonks, granges, and the occasional wedding.

256
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,300
 Maybe he'll find the killer in those places.

257
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,100
 Maybe he finds the killer every time he looks in the mirror.

258
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,600
 Let's go ahead and move on to another story.

259
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,000
 When it's a little more upbeat unless you are scared of maniacs in your bedroom.

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,200
 So this is again a bizarre story because it kind of falls into an area where is it?

261
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,000
 What is this phenomenon?

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,300
 Some people may classify it as a ghost.

263
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,400
 There's been a lot of effort to classify it as an alien.

264
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,800
 Is it a demon?

265
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,100
 Who knows?

266
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,300
 Hopefully you never have to find out.

267
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,000
 Tonight, you go to sleep.

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,100
 You're lying in bed comfortable in the safety of your own home.

269
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,100
 But out of your sleep, you sense something in your room.

270
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,400
 It's so palpable it wakes you up.

271
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:15,400
 And you're laying there in the darkness and you know there's something there that shouldn't be.

272
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,800
 You don't have to see it.

273
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,600
 You don't have to hear it.

274
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,500
 You just know.

275
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:33,400
 And that feeling of dread that is just washing over you freezes you in place and you feel the foot of your bed become a little heavier.

276
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,200
 Something has now joined you in your bed.

277
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:46,000
 You don't want to look, but you feel compelled to.

278
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:55,900
 Whether it's curiosity, whether it's caution, whether it's blind fear of what will happen if you don't look.

279
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,300
 You roll over and you see it.

280
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:06,300
 He's sitting on the edge of your bed and his face has a grin so wide.

281
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,900
 It's inhuman.

282
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:15,200
 It's a mixture of both fiendish delight and torment pain.

283
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,300
 You can't tell it's both and neither.

284
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,700
 His eyes are wild.

285
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:29,700
 He's staring at you and he's rubbing his chest with his hands just rubbing himself up and down just staring at you.

286
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:39,100
 Silently you just hear the sound of the fabric as his hands brush against his chest and then he's gone.

287
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:45,100
 You still have this after image of course of this thing that was at the foot of your bed in your bed with you.

288
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,800
 You can't get it out of your mind.

289
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 And if you think Jason is just telling a spooky story because he knows a lot of people listen to the podcast at night.

290
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:04,400
 That story I just told you was exactly what happened to young women between the year 1976 and 1979 in Glasgow, Scotland.

291
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,200
 Most specifically there was an area, it was the Crosshill District in Glasgow.

292
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,900
 And oddly enough they could fit it into a time period 4pm to 9pm.

293
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,300
 Now usually in that time period.

294
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,700
 But not all the time.

295
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,700
 Because the story I told you was later at night a woman was in bed with her husband.

296
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,800
 She woke up.

297
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,700
 The grinning man was sitting at the foot of her bed describing what she said he was wildly rubbing his chest.

298
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,600
 Which it's funny because if you wake up and there's something standing at the foot of your bed just staring at you.

299
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,300
 That's quite terrifying.

300
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,600
 Or if you wake up and you see a little girl standing in the corner of your room.

301
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,100
 That's very scary.

302
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:50,100
 But if you woke up in the middle of the night and you saw that shadowy figure at the end of your bed.

303
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,100
 Not just standing there silently but spinning around like a top with his arms stuck out.

304
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,800
 And his tongue just wagging.

305
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:08,300
 Each time Revolutiony sees tongue going "Uhhh, whoa, whoa" that's creepier. We have this thing where there's what we expect to be normal behavior and what's abnormal behavior.

306
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,700
 And it's funny because that also comes into the paranormal.

307
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:20,900
 When I was reading the story the grinning man does such crazy creepy things that it elevates it to other than just like a girl jumping with a rope.

308
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,000
 Like a little ghost girl. Not just a regular girl jumping rope but like a ghost girl jumping.

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,500
 If instead of the girl, the ghost girl you could have them like you're walking down the hallway and you see a ghost girl riding a tricycle.

310
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:39,400
 But what if you're walking on the hallway and you saw the ghost girl rolling around on the ground like she was a pig going "Krrrrk"

311
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,200
 That's 10 times creepier and that's what's so disturbing about this grinning man phenomenon.

312
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,300
 For three years you had multiple women spotting this thing.

313
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
 Here's another example.

314
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,000
 Two teenage girls were walking home one day.

315
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,100
 They see a bald grinning man.

316
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,500
 They said he appeared to be in his 50s and he wore a like a one-piece leotard.

317
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,100
 So almost like a dancer's clothes.

318
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
 So you saw his hands.

319
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,800
 You saw above the neck and you saw his feet.

320
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,900
 I don't know if he was wearing shoes.

321
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,100
 Again, it'd be creepier if he wasn't.

322
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,300
 And the way he's moving is very herky jerky.

323
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,600
 It's like he can't control his body.

324
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,400
 Each step is some sort of spasm as he's moving towards them.

325
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,100
 Far cr-- That's to me creepier than if he was running full bore at me.

326
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,700
 Because I know how to deal with something that's running at me.

327
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:35,300
 But if someone's like "Krrrk" and they're like making these weird movements, that's way creepier.

328
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,100
 Those girls start running.

329
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,000
 They turn around.

330
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,400
 They look.

331
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,800
 He's completely gone and it's just a long shot trail where they're at.

332
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,500
 And they're like, "We know he didn't pass us."

333
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,800
 And he didn't run the other way because he couldn't run that fast.

334
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,100
 Where did he go?

335
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,300
 One time, I thought this was so creepy.

336
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,700
 A woman came out of her house to get the milk jugs, because you know it's back in 1976.

337
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,900
 She goes out to get the milk jugs.

338
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,700
 She looks up and she sees the grinning man across the street just jogging in place.

339
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,000
 What is up with this guy?

340
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,500
 Only women saw him.

341
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,500
 I think they had like a total of like between like 11 and 17 sightings.

342
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,400
 Only seen by women.

343
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,800
 And some women were reportedly so disturbed by it, they moved away.

344
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,100
 It was such a creepy thing to see.

345
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,300
 What's so bizarre about the grinning man is it doesn't really fall into any particular category.

346
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:36,500
 It's human, but human type things can be cryptids and it is restricted to a certain geographical location,

347
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,300
 which would make you think of something like a Bigfoot or a Levelyn Frog or something like that.

348
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,700
 But then it exhibits these ghostly things where it can vanish right in front of you.

349
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,300
 Cryptids normally like scurry off into the woods.

350
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
 That's why people think they're more like animalistic.

351
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,700
 They're more like realistic type things.

352
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,100
 He can disappear right in front of you.

353
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,300
 He can enter your home.

354
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,000
 He can move.

355
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 He can enter your home unannounced where you won't notice him.

356
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,600
 But when he's at the foot of your bed, he can give you a sense of dread.

357
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,500
 So you do notice him.

358
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:11,000
 You're walking down a dark hallway and you know something's behind you and you don't want to look.

359
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,100
 It's the grinning man.

360
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,400
 The fact that only women could see him is such a bizarre detail to the whole story.

361
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
 So you have all these...

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,200
 It's just such a weird story because when you think about stuff like Friday the 13th...

363
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,000
 I know movies aren't documentaries, but when you talk about stuff like Friday the 13th,

364
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,400
 they take place at Camp Crystal Lake when you talk about Nightmare on Elm Street.

365
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,600
 It takes place on Elm Street.

366
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:40,300
 So you have all this stuff that is very area specific and so are cryptids with like the Levelyn Frog like I was talking about.

367
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,900
 But to have this neighborhood place for three years with this creature that only women can see,

368
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,600
 it's...

369
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,800
 It seems so sex-based.

370
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,200
 It seems so perverted.

371
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,700
 Mixed with that insanity plus that horrible face.

372
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,500
 There's very few things people can do that's more unsettling than an unearned grin.

373
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,800
 If I tell a joke, I expect someone to smile.

374
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
 I demand it almost.

375
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,300
 But if I'm talking to someone and as I'm talking to them,

376
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,400
 they just start getting this huge grin on their face.

377
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,100
 You're just walking in a room and someone turns to you and they have a huge smile.

378
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,600
 It's very, very disconcerting.

379
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,000
 It might be some evolutionary thing about people showing their teeth.

380
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,800
 It might just be because it's very out of place.

381
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,100
 If you walk into a room and someone's making a sad face, you're gonna go like,

382
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,300
 "Oh man, what's the matter?"

383
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,000
 But if you walk into a room and someone has a wide grin, you're not gonna go,

384
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,900
 "What's so funny?"

385
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,900
 You're gonna be like, "Slowly back out of the room."

386
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,600
 I would at least if someone's generally laughing when they think something's funny.

387
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,000
 Like, I've never seen anyone just sit in a room just smiling wildly.

388
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,400
 The grinning man...

389
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,800
 It's also referred to as the "girning man" of Scotland, but...

390
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,400
 And there's a grinning man in America.

391
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,500
 We'll cover that on a future episode because that's more of an ailing thing.

392
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,400
 And I don't think there's a connection between the two.

393
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,000
 I've tried working out connections with those, but there just doesn't seem to be any connection.

394
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,400
 The experiences of the women...

395
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,100
 Well, one grinning man in America was seen by a man, only one man,

396
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,300
 and then this one's only by women in this other country.

397
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,800
 The only thing that they have in common is they're bald and they have grins.

398
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,800
 Which might sound like a lot in common. We'll cover that on another episode, but...

399
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,800
 I mean, you know, when you lock your doors to your house, when you get into your bed,

400
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,300
 you assume those things are safe and you assume, worst-case scenario,

401
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,600
 someone's gonna kick down your door, you're gonna hear it,

402
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,900
 you're gonna be prepared, or maybe you're asleep and someone jumps on top of you

403
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,000
 and you have to start wrestling them and things like that.

404
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,800
 Obviously, worst-case scenario is you get a knife through your head while you're sleeping,

405
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,100
 but you're like, "Jason, I'm not gonna bed tonight."

406
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,100
 But you know what I mean? Like, there are certain things we can prepare for.

407
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:42,800
 You don't prepare to have a silent visitor/creature show up at the edge of your bed,

408
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,600
 but if you do, you do plan that if you woke up and there was a man sitting on the edge of your bed,

409
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,300
 how you would fight back.

410
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,000
 But if that man was rubbing his chest and smiling at you,

411
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,900
 there's just such a bizarre scenario jogging in place,

412
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,100
 just moving in a creepy fashion, those would all kind of set you off.

413
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
 That would activate your flight response.

414
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,000
 How would you fight someone who was jogging in place?

415
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,300
 Like, you would yell at them, tell them to stop and they would keep doing it,

416
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,900
 and they're, "I'm gonna bust you a good one, mate! I'm gonna bust you a good one!"

417
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,100
 Like, how? And then you get there and he's just looking at you jogging in place.

418
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,600
 I feel like you'd almost be too afraid to hit him.

419
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,200
 This guy's obviously insane.

420
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,700
 But what happens when you mix the insanity with magic?

421
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,300
 You get something that really can't be stopped,

422
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,700
 that can get you anywhere it wants to.

423
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,900
 But to me, the weirdest part of this story is why did it stop?

424
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,000
 Did it get what it wanted and it wanted to scare 17 women?

425
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,100
 Wanted to be a lasting impression in their brain?

426
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,900
 Did it move on to somewhere else?

427
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,800
 I think that's what happened.

428
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,100
 I think it's become more discreet.

429
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,800
 Instead of popping up 17 times over the course of about three years in one neighborhood,

430
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 take your show on the road.

431
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,600
 You can only rob so many banks in a city before they get wise to you.

432
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,800
 You can only pass so many counterfeit bills before they know what to look for.

433
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,400
 Maybe Scotland was just a little training ground for it,

434
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,300
 for it went worldwide.

435
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,100
 Because if someone saw this now, in the middle of Idaho,

436
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,200
 they would think it was a one-off thing, that only they experienced.

437
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,300
 Some creepy apparition ghost demon thing that they saw.

438
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,800
 Is it stood in the bushes, this tongue sticking out.

439
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,000
 And then blinks out of existence.

440
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,800
 There would be no one hunting for it if no one knew it existed.

441
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,600
 I think that seeing it at the end of your bed,

442
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,800
 rubbing its chest, which is just such a bizarre image,

443
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,600
 is creepy.

444
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,100
 But what would almost be even more creepy than that?

445
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,200
 If it was doing that, but was invisible.

446
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,700
 The grinning man may still be in Scotland.

447
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,500
 It may have taken the show on the road, but it may have become more discreet.

448
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,900
 So now when you're walking down the hallway,

449
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,700
 and you get that kind of chill up the back of your neck,

450
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,700
 you don't want to look, you don't turn around, but you feel compelled to.

451
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,800
 And you turn around,

452
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,400
 (sighs)

453
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,400
 hallway's empty, it's just you.

454
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,900
 Just outside of our field of vision,

455
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,000
 invisible to the human eye,

456
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,500
 may be a tall, bald man,

457
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,100
 rubbing his chest right behind you,

458
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:47,800
 grinning wildly at all the fun he's having.
