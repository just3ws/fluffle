00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 The ghost pepper has a reputation.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.100
 So does a ghost pepper wing that doesn't send you into tears make any sense?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.000
 Does to us.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 That's why Popeyes ghost pepper wings are the perfect balance of flavor and fire.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.500
 Popeyes starts with intensely cravable flavor,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.900
 adds the right amount of kick to keep things interesting,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.100
 not inferno-ing,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.900
 and then offers them at only $5 for six pieces.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.300
 Because in New Orleans, we like to taste our food.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.400
 Not cry over it.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 Call us crazy.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.800
 Love that chicken from Popeyes.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.400
 Limited time at participating U.S. restaurants price may vary, additional terms apply.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.500
 A sheriff's deputy goes for a jog,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.200
 and his entire life changes.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.400
 And then we take a look at the story of the grinning man.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.600
 Tall, lanky, maniacal smile.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.500
 He stares at you from the darkness.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.400
 His insanity is his greatest weapon.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.500
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.200
 [Music]

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.700
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.800
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.700
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.500
 We're gonna go ahead and jump right into this because we got a lot of stuff to cover.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.600
 So let's go ahead and put on our jumping pants and wee down the...

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.400
 That's...

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.100
 I'm gonna sit down the rabbit hole, but that always sounds so stupid.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.100
 Just a hole.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.200
 Wee, we're going down the hole.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.800
 We're gonna fall all the way down this hole.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.000
 We have to find new modes of transportation since the Carvener copter got blown up,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.300
 but we fall all the way down the hole to Azalea, Oregon.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.800
 Now, I have no idea where that's at, but it sounds pretty.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.200
 It sounds serene.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.600
 It sounds peaceful.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 And we're specifically going back to March 19, 1991.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.700
 Hair metal was on its way out.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.800
 Grunge was on its way in.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.500
 Next year, Terminator 2 was going to be released at Theaters.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.900
 And I was...

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.400
 14 years old when this story took place.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.600
 Odd, really?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.900
 17 and 94, so yeah, I was 14 years old.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.200
 I was a freshman in high school as the story took place.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.900
 Not like that has any bearing on the story itself, but...

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.800
 I just want you to imagine Little Jason in his cross colors, big, giant African medallion,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.400
 and baggy pants on backwards in this story.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.100
 And I'm standing like a B-boy.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.100
 I'm just in the background of every part of the story standing just like that.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.500
 Now, I have to have a little levity because this story gets a little grim.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.400
 What we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be talking about the story of Tommy Gibson.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.200
 Tommy Gibson was a two and a half year old boy playing in his yard.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.900
 And he's just kind of messing around, chasing caterpillars,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.500
 sticking sticks and ant holes, stuff like that, stuff that kids do.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.800
 And his father, Larry Gibson, Sheriff's deputy, says,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.200
 "Hey, hey Tommy, Tommy, don't go anywhere, wait till your sister comes out.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.000
 But you gotta stay in the yard."

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.600
 And he's like, "Okay."

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.000
 So, and Larry Gibson's like, "Okay, my son's gonna...

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.200
 He's a good boy, he's not gonna do anything."

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.500
 So he leaves the yard and goes for a jog, like he had planned to do.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.100
 Now, generally when he goes on his jog, he keeps his 45 on him, his sidearm,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.600
 he goes for the jog, he keeps it on him for protection.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.100
 He also is having a serious issue with cats, feral cats in the area.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.600
 Rrraaaww! Not giant ones, but like little ones,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.100
 but still they're kind of damaging the property and he was shooting the cats.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.700
 So, automatically all you cat lovers out there are like, "That guy is a scumbag."

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.200
 But I'm just telling you what he was doing.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.500
 He was shooting cats, not for fun, he was just getting them off of his property.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.000
 He goes for his jog.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.900
 At some point during the jog, his wife, Tommy's mom, here's a gunshot.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.200
 And she goes, "Oh, Larry! Casual animal abuse! So romantic!"

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.200
 And she just keeps washing the dishes.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.800
 I don't know, maybe she was an attorney, that was sexist,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.800
 but anyway, she's doing something in the house.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.400
 She hears the gunshot.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.700
 She eventually goes, "Oh, I need to go out and get Tommy."

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.900
 Changes diaper and then do the laundry and/or run a successful company because I'm a CEO.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.500
 I don't know.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.600
 So anyways, so she goes out to find Tommy.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.800
 He's missing.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.500
 She's like, "Hmm, where could that little scoundrel be?"

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.500
 She's looking around for him, "Tommy! Tommy!"

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.100
 Can't find him.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.100
 She's starting to get worried because he's two and a half left out in this front yard.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.500
 45 minutes after he left, Larry Gibson gets back to his house from his jog and he's like,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.700
 "Oh, man. Oh, man, I can't. It was a good jog, man. I've been running for 45 minutes.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.700
 Look at my watch. Remember that, honey? 45 minutes is when I left 45 minutes ago."

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.100
 And she's like, "Yeah, yeah. Why are you acting so weird?"

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.400
 He's like, "I'm just out of breath."

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.200
 And she goes, "Well, you're going to have to be even more out of breath because our son's missing,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.000
 so we got to find him so start running around looking for our son."

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.500
 Now, they end up calling the police, obviously.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.300
 Police come out.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.100
 And at this point, Larry's panicking. The mom's panicking.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.800
 They have a daughter, an older daughter as well. Everyone's panicking. The police show up.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.300
 Police are trying to calm everyone down and Larry's like, "You know what? No, dude. Screw this, dude."

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.200
 He's like, "I'm going to go take my shower." They're like, "You are awfully sweaty."

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.500
 He's like, "Yeah, I was jogging for 45 minutes here."

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.600
 My wife saw me come back 45 minutes later and she's like, "That's kind of weird."

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.200
 Anyway, so he's like, "I'm so sweaty. I'm going to go take a shower, nice, hot, relaxing shower,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.600
 put on my cop uniform."

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.700
 And the other cops at this point are like, "That's a weird thing, but maybe he just really needs a shower

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.900
 and he wants to have the authority of his uniform as he's looking for his son."

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.200
 So anyways, he goes in these showers. They're not waiting around for him, but

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.300
 he's like reading a magazine on the toilet. They're like, "Hey, Larry, we're trying to search for your kid.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.300
 Are you going to come out?" And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be in a second. I'm sorry.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.000
 I'm just reading this article. It's really good."

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.600
 And then they hear like the hot water turn on and he's like waiting for it to get hotter.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.300
 They're like, "But anyways, so they're already searching for the kid. They don't want to wait around for him."

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.100
 Larry eventually comes out of the shower and he's wearing his uniform, starts searching for the kid as well.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.000
 They can't find him. They're interviewing all the neighbors. They're interviewing the family members.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.400
 They're trying to figure out what's going on.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.400
 Now, the only thing that they know is there was a gunshot fired at some time, but the wife was like,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.100
 "There's most likely my husband's shooting a cat."

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.700
 And he goes, "I did. I shot a cat."

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.900
 And the investigators found a cat with a bullet hole through it on his property.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.300
 Like, it was walking along the fence and a bullet went through it and killed it.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.100
 So cops are like, "Okay, that explains the gunshot, but it doesn't explain where the kid is."

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.400
 So they keep looking.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.100
 He is then told by his boss, "You don't have to come to work. Really, just go home. Take your uniform off.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.800
 Just relax. We got this handle." And he's like, "No. Gotta help find my son. I know that he's out there.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.300
 I can feel it. I can feel it on my bones."

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.800
 They're like, "Well, just stay at home."

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.600
 Okay? They don't openly want to say he's a suspect because he's a brother.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.300
 He's a brother of the badge.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.400
 But he's a suspect.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.100
 They don't want him driving around in a cop car, but he disobeys orders, gets in his cop car,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.500
 and he begins searching local rest areas looking for whoever took his son.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.000
 Now, the FBI eventually comes out because it's a kidnapping.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.500
 And they begin interviewing the neighbors.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.000
 And the neighbors go, "Hmm. You know, I did see like this beige van pull up,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.700
 and there's like this white man and this white woman get out.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.400
 And then, you know, I didn't see them actually take Tommy,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.600
 but I did see these suspicious people around the house.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.600
 And Larry's like, "Aha! Yes. Those are the people who took my son."

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.600
 And the cops are like, "Well, it's possible. Possible. We'll look into it."

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.300
 Quit popping out of nowhere, Larry. You can't just keep doing that every time we find a clue.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.700
 The police get a letter that's never been disclosed to the public,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.200
 and it was signed "Spot on the Road" that contained information that they believe,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.600
 that they, that led them to believe that the person who wrote the letter,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.800
 knows what happened to little Tommy.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.900
 But they've never disclosed what's in the letter.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.900
 And then the case goes cold.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.800
 There's really no leads outside of the van that pulled up.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.500
 In 1993, there was a song, I love this song too,

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.800
 it was a song by Soul Asylum called "Runaway Train."

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.900
 And it's a song about runaways, and in the song, in the videos,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.500
 they would show pictures of kids who had gone missing.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.400
 And I didn't know this, but every country, or every region, I guess, had different photos.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.100
 So the photos we saw in the American version of the video

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.200
 was different than the photos they showed in the British version of the video,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.800
 or the South American version of the video, things like that.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.600
 Out of that video, it's amazing to think.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.100
 That video found 26 kids, not the video itself.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.800
 The video didn't grow legs and start walking around,

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.800
 but because of that video, because of those photographs, 26 kids were found.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.000
 One of them, though, said, "My family was abusive when I ran away,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.100
 because they were abusive and I was at my boyfriend's house and your video came on.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.000
 Thanks a lot, jerks."

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 She told them that, she went to a concert of theirs and said,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.700
 "You guys ruined my life."

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.400
 Because I went back to a really bad environment.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.500
 But 25, 25 happy endings.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.500
 And Tommy's image was in "Runaway Train" in 1993.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.900
 I love that song. It's still a great song.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.000
 1994, Larry Gibson is arrested for manslaughter.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.800
 And this is the working theory that the cops had.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.000
 He shot the cat and the bullet went clean through the cat,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 because it's a 45.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.500
 He goes clean through the cat and hit his son.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.300
 And he found that his son had been hit and was bleeding out and panicked.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.200
 So he hit the body and then went on the rest of his jog.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.400
 When he came back, the cat, the kid was missing and he's like,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.100
 "Oh, I'm just gonna go take a shower."

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.200
 And they think that he used his squad car to hide the body in and then dump it somewhere.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.300
 That was what they argued in court.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.400
 His daughter eventually said that she had seen him beat Tommy.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.200
 She saw Larry beat Tommy until he went limp,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.200
 put him in a black trash bag, threw it in the back of the police car, drove away.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.200
 And then the FBI started to believe that when they were looking at notes,

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.600
 they said the cops interviewed the neighbors.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.200
 They didn't mention anything about a beige van.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.200
 But when the FBI interviewed the neighbors, they did.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.200
 So they started thinking that Larry was basically witness tampering

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.900
 and telling them to say this, say this.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.600
 So with two possible theories of how he died,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.400
 either he was shot accidentally or the daughter saw him beat him to death,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.300
 no real evidence of either one.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.500
 Just a hunch.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.300
 I mean, absolutely no evidence.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.600
 And apparently, like people said, "Oh, he confessed to me that he killed the boy."

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.200
 But it was all hearsay.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.800
 He denied all of it.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.700
 No body, nothing.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.100
 He gets convicted, oddly enough.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.200
 Three years in prison for manslaughter was his sentence.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.700
 So it was this weird hedge thing where they convicted him of a very, very minor charge.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.600
 I mean, like manslaughter is a major charge, but three years in prison is really nothing.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.900
 You can do that standing on your head.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.200
 And then he gets out of prison and he still denies to this day

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.300
 I had nothing to do with the death of my son.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.800
 I don't know who did it.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.700
 He did say at one point in an interview with the police,

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.000
 he goes, when he was originally being investigated,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.700
 they said, "Is it possible that you shot the cat and the bullet hit your son?"

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.500
 And he goes, "I guess it's possible.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.300
 I mean, that would make sense, wouldn't it?

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.900
 But I didn't hide the body."

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.400
 He goes, "My brother-in-law who also lived there may have hid the body and not have told me,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.800
 but I didn't hide the body."

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.200
 It's...

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.100
 So that also made them suspicious.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.700
 But anyways, he got out and he's like, "I'm free, I'm free, and now I will find the real killers."

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.300
 I mean, kidnappers of my kid.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.600
 Last we saw of Larry Gibson.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.000
 I believe he's still alive.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.300
 He's a country western musician.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.700
 He moved to, I think it was Idaho or Montana.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.000
 You might just be traveling that area.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.400
 You can listen to his songs online.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.000
 I'll have the website in the show notes.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.700
 I can't put any of his songs here, but feel free to listen to them.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.400
 The best part of the website is...

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.500
 It's an old website and it warns you when you go to the photos page.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.800
 This page is graphics heavy.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.600
 If you're on dial up, it may take a while for all the pictures to load.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.100
 A charming end to a chilling story.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.400
 Did he actually accidentally shoot his son?

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.000
 And was able to clean up the crime scene in 20 minutes, including all the blood on the grass.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.100
 The kid was silent the whole time.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:38.700
 Nobody saw anything as he bagged this kid up, hid him, went on a jog,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.500
 endured a police search as they were searching the area they didn't find the body.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.700
 Then he's able to put the body into his police car without anyone noticing.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.200
 And then dumping it without anyone seeing him.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.500
 Did he beat a kid?

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.300
 Like her story kind of came out of the blue.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.900
 Did he beat him?

00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:00.500
 Put him in a trash bag, throw him in the back of the car and the mom not see him beat him?

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.900
 Did the boy not make any noise when he beat some?

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.100
 What's bizarre is like, I think the guy probably did do it.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.900
 I don't think I'm not giving this whole thing like he's innocent.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.000
 I just think it's weird that he got convicted with absolutely no evidence.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.800
 Just hunches and what people were saying.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:27.100
 And a sheriff's deputy for a member of law enforcement to be prosecuted successfully for something like this

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:33.900
 with no evidence is bizarre because normally it's the other way around.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.200
 Normally there's that code of silence.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.500
 I think one of the key pieces of evidence is that spot on the road letter.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.700
 It either exonerates him completely or it damns him to his three-year prison sentence.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.200
 But we don't know what that letter says.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.500
 I think they're keeping that under wraps because of that.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:02.000
 But whatever, guilty or innocent, Tommy is missing, presumed to be dead.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.800
 And the father on his search for the real killers is playing honky-tonks, granges, and the occasional wedding.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.300
 Maybe he'll find the killer in those places.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.100
 Maybe he finds the killer every time he looks in the mirror.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.600
 Let's go ahead and move on to another story.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:26.000
 When it's a little more upbeat unless you are scared of maniacs in your bedroom.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.200
 So this is again a bizarre story because it kind of falls into an area where is it?

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.000
 What is this phenomenon?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.300
 Some people may classify it as a ghost.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.400
 There's been a lot of effort to classify it as an alien.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.800
 Is it a demon?

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.100
 Who knows?

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.300
 Hopefully you never have to find out.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.000
 Tonight, you go to sleep.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.100
 You're lying in bed comfortable in the safety of your own home.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.100
 But out of your sleep, you sense something in your room.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.400
 It's so palpable it wakes you up.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:15.400
 And you're laying there in the darkness and you know there's something there that shouldn't be.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.800
 You don't have to see it.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.600
 You don't have to hear it.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.500
 You just know.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:33.400
 And that feeling of dread that is just washing over you freezes you in place and you feel the foot of your bed become a little heavier.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.200
 Something has now joined you in your bed.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:46.000
 You don't want to look, but you feel compelled to.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:55.900
 Whether it's curiosity, whether it's caution, whether it's blind fear of what will happen if you don't look.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.300
 You roll over and you see it.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:06.300
 He's sitting on the edge of your bed and his face has a grin so wide.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.900
 It's inhuman.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:15.200
 It's a mixture of both fiendish delight and torment pain.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.300
 You can't tell it's both and neither.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.700
 His eyes are wild.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:29.700
 He's staring at you and he's rubbing his chest with his hands just rubbing himself up and down just staring at you.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:39.100
 Silently you just hear the sound of the fabric as his hands brush against his chest and then he's gone.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:45.100
 You still have this after image of course of this thing that was at the foot of your bed in your bed with you.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.800
 You can't get it out of your mind.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:53.800
 And if you think Jason is just telling a spooky story because he knows a lot of people listen to the podcast at night.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:17:04.400
 That story I just told you was exactly what happened to young women between the year 1976 and 1979 in Glasgow, Scotland.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:10.200
 Most specifically there was an area, it was the Crosshill District in Glasgow.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.900
 And oddly enough they could fit it into a time period 4pm to 9pm.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.300
 Now usually in that time period.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.700
 But not all the time.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.700
 Because the story I told you was later at night a woman was in bed with her husband.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.800
 She woke up.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.700
 The grinning man was sitting at the foot of her bed describing what she said he was wildly rubbing his chest.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:37.600
 Which it's funny because if you wake up and there's something standing at the foot of your bed just staring at you.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.300
 That's quite terrifying.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.600
 Or if you wake up and you see a little girl standing in the corner of your room.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.100
 That's very scary.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:50.100
 But if you woke up in the middle of the night and you saw that shadowy figure at the end of your bed.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.100
 Not just standing there silently but spinning around like a top with his arms stuck out.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.800
 And his tongue just wagging.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:08.300
 Each time Revolutiony sees tongue going "Uhhh, whoa, whoa" that's creepier. We have this thing where there's what we expect to be normal behavior and what's abnormal behavior.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.700
 And it's funny because that also comes into the paranormal.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:20.900
 When I was reading the story the grinning man does such crazy creepy things that it elevates it to other than just like a girl jumping with a rope.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.000
 Like a little ghost girl. Not just a regular girl jumping rope but like a ghost girl jumping.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.500
 If instead of the girl, the ghost girl you could have them like you're walking down the hallway and you see a ghost girl riding a tricycle.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:39.400
 But what if you're walking on the hallway and you saw the ghost girl rolling around on the ground like she was a pig going "Krrrrk"

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:45.200
 That's 10 times creepier and that's what's so disturbing about this grinning man phenomenon.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.300
 For three years you had multiple women spotting this thing.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.300
 Here's another example.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.000
 Two teenage girls were walking home one day.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.100
 They see a bald grinning man.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:19:00.500
 They said he appeared to be in his 50s and he wore a like a one-piece leotard.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.100
 So almost like a dancer's clothes.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.100
 So you saw his hands.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.800
 You saw above the neck and you saw his feet.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:08.900
 I don't know if he was wearing shoes.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.100
 Again, it'd be creepier if he wasn't.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.300
 And the way he's moving is very herky jerky.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.600
 It's like he can't control his body.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.400
 Each step is some sort of spasm as he's moving towards them.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.100
 Far cr-- That's to me creepier than if he was running full bore at me.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.700
 Because I know how to deal with something that's running at me.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:35.300
 But if someone's like "Krrrk" and they're like making these weird movements, that's way creepier.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.100
 Those girls start running.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.000
 They turn around.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.400
 They look.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.800
 He's completely gone and it's just a long shot trail where they're at.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.500
 And they're like, "We know he didn't pass us."

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.800
 And he didn't run the other way because he couldn't run that fast.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.100
 Where did he go?

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.300
 One time, I thought this was so creepy.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.700
 A woman came out of her house to get the milk jugs, because you know it's back in 1976.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.900
 She goes out to get the milk jugs.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:02.700
 She looks up and she sees the grinning man across the street just jogging in place.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.000
 What is up with this guy?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.500
 Only women saw him.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.500
 I think they had like a total of like between like 11 and 17 sightings.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.400
 Only seen by women.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.800
 And some women were reportedly so disturbed by it, they moved away.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.100
 It was such a creepy thing to see.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:28.300
 What's so bizarre about the grinning man is it doesn't really fall into any particular category.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:36.500
 It's human, but human type things can be cryptids and it is restricted to a certain geographical location,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.300
 which would make you think of something like a Bigfoot or a Levelyn Frog or something like that.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.700
 But then it exhibits these ghostly things where it can vanish right in front of you.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.300
 Cryptids normally like scurry off into the woods.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.300
 That's why people think they're more like animalistic.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.700
 They're more like realistic type things.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.100
 He can disappear right in front of you.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.300
 He can enter your home.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.000
 He can move.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 He can enter your home unannounced where you won't notice him.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.600
 But when he's at the foot of your bed, he can give you a sense of dread.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.500
 So you do notice him.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:11.000
 You're walking down a dark hallway and you know something's behind you and you don't want to look.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.100
 It's the grinning man.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:18.400
 The fact that only women could see him is such a bizarre detail to the whole story.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.000
 So you have all these...

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.200
 It's just such a weird story because when you think about stuff like Friday the 13th...

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.000
 I know movies aren't documentaries, but when you talk about stuff like Friday the 13th,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.400
 they take place at Camp Crystal Lake when you talk about Nightmare on Elm Street.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.600
 It takes place on Elm Street.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:40.300
 So you have all this stuff that is very area specific and so are cryptids with like the Levelyn Frog like I was talking about.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.900
 But to have this neighborhood place for three years with this creature that only women can see,

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.600
 it's...

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.800
 It seems so sex-based.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.200
 It seems so perverted.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.700
 Mixed with that insanity plus that horrible face.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:59.500
 There's very few things people can do that's more unsettling than an unearned grin.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.800
 If I tell a joke, I expect someone to smile.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.800
 I demand it almost.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.300
 But if I'm talking to someone and as I'm talking to them,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.400
 they just start getting this huge grin on their face.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.100
 You're just walking in a room and someone turns to you and they have a huge smile.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.600
 It's very, very disconcerting.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.000
 It might be some evolutionary thing about people showing their teeth.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.800
 It might just be because it's very out of place.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.100
 If you walk into a room and someone's making a sad face, you're gonna go like,

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.300
 "Oh man, what's the matter?"

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.000
 But if you walk into a room and someone has a wide grin, you're not gonna go,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.900
 "What's so funny?"

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.900
 You're gonna be like, "Slowly back out of the room."

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.600
 I would at least if someone's generally laughing when they think something's funny.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.000
 Like, I've never seen anyone just sit in a room just smiling wildly.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.400
 The grinning man...

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.800
 It's also referred to as the "girning man" of Scotland, but...

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.400
 And there's a grinning man in America.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.500
 We'll cover that on a future episode because that's more of an ailing thing.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.400
 And I don't think there's a connection between the two.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.000
 I've tried working out connections with those, but there just doesn't seem to be any connection.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.400
 The experiences of the women...

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.100
 Well, one grinning man in America was seen by a man, only one man,

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.300
 and then this one's only by women in this other country.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.800
 The only thing that they have in common is they're bald and they have grins.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.800
 Which might sound like a lot in common. We'll cover that on another episode, but...

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.800
 I mean, you know, when you lock your doors to your house, when you get into your bed,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.300
 you assume those things are safe and you assume, worst-case scenario,

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.600
 someone's gonna kick down your door, you're gonna hear it,

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.900
 you're gonna be prepared, or maybe you're asleep and someone jumps on top of you

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.000
 and you have to start wrestling them and things like that.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.800
 Obviously, worst-case scenario is you get a knife through your head while you're sleeping,

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.100
 but you're like, "Jason, I'm not gonna bed tonight."

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.100
 But you know what I mean? Like, there are certain things we can prepare for.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:42.800
 You don't prepare to have a silent visitor/creature show up at the edge of your bed,

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.600
 but if you do, you do plan that if you woke up and there was a man sitting on the edge of your bed,

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.300
 how you would fight back.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.000
 But if that man was rubbing his chest and smiling at you,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.900
 there's just such a bizarre scenario jogging in place,

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.100
 just moving in a creepy fashion, those would all kind of set you off.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.100
 That would activate your flight response.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.000
 How would you fight someone who was jogging in place?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.300
 Like, you would yell at them, tell them to stop and they would keep doing it,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.900
 and they're, "I'm gonna bust you a good one, mate! I'm gonna bust you a good one!"

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.100
 Like, how? And then you get there and he's just looking at you jogging in place.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.600
 I feel like you'd almost be too afraid to hit him.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.200
 This guy's obviously insane.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.700
 But what happens when you mix the insanity with magic?

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.300
 You get something that really can't be stopped,

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.700
 that can get you anywhere it wants to.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.900
 But to me, the weirdest part of this story is why did it stop?

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.000
 Did it get what it wanted and it wanted to scare 17 women?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.100
 Wanted to be a lasting impression in their brain?

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.900
 Did it move on to somewhere else?

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.800
 I think that's what happened.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.100
 I think it's become more discreet.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:02.800
 Instead of popping up 17 times over the course of about three years in one neighborhood,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.800
 take your show on the road.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.600
 You can only rob so many banks in a city before they get wise to you.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.800
 You can only pass so many counterfeit bills before they know what to look for.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.400
 Maybe Scotland was just a little training ground for it,

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.300
 for it went worldwide.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:25.100
 Because if someone saw this now, in the middle of Idaho,

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.200
 they would think it was a one-off thing, that only they experienced.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.300
 Some creepy apparition ghost demon thing that they saw.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:37.800
 Is it stood in the bushes, this tongue sticking out.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.000
 And then blinks out of existence.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.800
 There would be no one hunting for it if no one knew it existed.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.600
 I think that seeing it at the end of your bed,

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.800
 rubbing its chest, which is just such a bizarre image,

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.600
 is creepy.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:57.100
 But what would almost be even more creepy than that?

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:02.200
 If it was doing that, but was invisible.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.700
 The grinning man may still be in Scotland.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.500
 It may have taken the show on the road, but it may have become more discreet.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.900
 So now when you're walking down the hallway,

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.700
 and you get that kind of chill up the back of your neck,

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.700
 you don't want to look, you don't turn around, but you feel compelled to.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.800
 And you turn around,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.400
 (sighs)

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.400
 hallway's empty, it's just you.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.900
 Just outside of our field of vision,

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.000
 invisible to the human eye,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.500
 may be a tall, bald man,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.100
 rubbing his chest right behind you,

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:47.800
 grinning wildly at all the fun he's having.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.900
