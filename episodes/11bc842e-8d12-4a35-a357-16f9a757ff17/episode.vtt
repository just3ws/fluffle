WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.680
 Bong.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.680
 Bong.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 Oh, what's that?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.680
 Huh?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 What?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 What's going on?

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.680
 Bong.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.680
 Oh, no.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.680
 That's the sound of a clock.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 The striking midnight right now.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.680
 12 more of those.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 12 more of those.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 Bong noises.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 Right in your ears.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 Bong.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 They're coming at you.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 Oh, no.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 What could possibly be going on?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.680
 And then a ghost walked into my bedroom and said,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 "Tonight, you're going to be visited by three ghosts, Jason."

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 The ghost of podcast past.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 I'm sure you can guess the other two, right?

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680
 Present and future.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 Oh, no.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.680
 Are they going to be scary ghosts?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 Maybe.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 I guess we'll find out because you must now do a show.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 Do a podcast.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 That's what you do, right?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.680
 It's your thousands episode.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 The ghost--that was the ghost mispronouncing that, not me.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.680
 Ghost, you better learn how to pronounce words.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 Yes, it's episode 1000 of Dead Rabbit Radio, and we're going to take a look at some creepy

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 tales from my past, the present, and the future.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 You guys know the gimmick, right?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 On today's 1000th episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 Bong.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:53.680
 Hey, everyone.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 Welcome back to another episode.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.680
 That's not another episode.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 It's episode 1000 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 Who would have ever thought we would get this far?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 Not me.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 Not me.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 I have a whole numbering system that's only three digits.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.680
 I don't know what I'm going to do now to keep track of this stuff.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.680
 I guess just add another digit, but thank you so much for--what's my normal intro?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.680
 Hey, everyone.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.680
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.680
 I'm your host, Jason Garvener.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.680
 I'm having a splendid day.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.680
 I hope you're having a splendid day as well.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.680
 We're walking around the snowy streets the day after Christmas morning, and we're going

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.680
 to talk about some stuff.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.680
 We're going to talk about some stuff that I have to clear up.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 There's this one story that I know you guys.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.680
 I know some of you guys have been like, "Dude, is he ever going to address that?"

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.680
 Or what's going on?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680
 We'll get to that in a second.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 Then we got some cool stuff to talk about.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 If this is your first episode, maybe listen to the first 999 episodes.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.680
 Oh, I guess I should start off by saying that.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.680
 This is an episode 1000.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.680
 This is most likely episode 1005.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.680
 I've made some errors numbering episodes.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.680
 People have pointed that out.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.680
 I would say thank you.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.680
 Thank you for letting me know I made that error 100 episodes ago.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 It would take me forever to try to correct it.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 Anyway, guys, seriously, thank you guys for being on this journey.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.680
 Whether this is your first episode, and that'll be a weird one, or your thousandth episode,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680
 welcome.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.680
 Thank you for being part of the fluffle part of the Dream Team that is Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.680
 And since you're so special, you're going to be our captain, our pilot, this episode today.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.680
 Let's go ahead and start off.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.680
 I'm going to give you the keys of the Jason Jalampi.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.680
 Let's leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 Drive us all the way out to Portugal.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.680
 [Portugal]

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.680
 And as we're driving out there, the Ghost of Christmas Pass jumps out of the trunk.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.680
 And he's like, "Hey guys, I'm along for this journey as well, because we're headed back into the past."

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.680
 [Lulu]

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.680
 Specifically, we're headed back to episode 914.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.680
 Transmorphers and interactive adventure.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 And I'm like, "No, that was the scariest episode I ever did.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.680
 I'm trying to fight the time travel.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.680
 No, no, I'm punching clocks."

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680
 But it's useless.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.680
 It's useless.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.680
 Eventually, we are back on July 18th, 2022.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.680
 That is when I put out Transmorphers.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.680
 And interactive adventure.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680
 I love doing interactive adventures.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.680
 They're a lot of fun, but they're also a lot of work.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.680
 They have to kind of happen organically.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 I really just can't sit down and go, "I'm going to try to find a bunch of associated stories it takes forever.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
 It takes forever to put together just any episode of this podcast."

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.680
 But it's extra work when I'm trying to come up with a theme, right?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 Have all these stories that are kind of related.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.680
 I usually get one maybe every one or two seasons.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680
 So maybe out of a hundred episodes, there's one interactive adventure.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.680
 I love them.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.680
 You guys seem to enjoy them as well.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.680
 But little did you know.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.680
 Some people knew.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.680
 Some people knew and they made it very well known that they knew.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.680
 They were laughing at me.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:59.680
 Little do most people know that in episode 914, I just wanted to talk about people turning into things that aren't human.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.680
 Because that's a big fear of mine.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.680
 I think the idea, and it's very...

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.680
 If I turned into a tree, but I don't remember being a human, I'm totally fine with that.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 As long as I'm well watered and I'm in a cool spot, maybe I'm a palm tree on a beach.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.680
 I can throw coconuts and pirates.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.680
 Or like a big oak tree with a swing.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.680
 So kids are swinging.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.680
 I keep breaking my branches just to watch them fall.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680
 Hehehe.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.680
 As long as I'm like a cool tree, not like a weeping willow or something lame, sitting in a swamp.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.680
 That would suck.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.680
 Got frogs all over me.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.680
 But also, I wouldn't care if I was just a tree and didn't have a human mind.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.680
 But if I was a tree, I mean how many times can you watch the sunset before you're like,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.680
 "Can you plant me closer to the house so I can watch Disney+?"

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 The idea of being, having a human consciousness trapped in the body of a beast or like an inanimate object terrifies me.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.680
 Terrifies me.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.680
 And I've always tried placing where I got that fear.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.680
 I often quote the Doctor Who episode.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.680
 And there's a Doctor Who movie about a man who turned into a statue.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.680
 I think that terrified me.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.680
 I think Josie Packard turning into a doorknob on "The Twin Peaks."

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680
 That sounds so great.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680
 It's so weird.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.680
 Josie Packard became a doorknob or a knob on a dresser if you got to be specific.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.680
 That stuff terrifies me.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.680
 So I found these related stories that were about people changing into things.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.680
 And again, it was fairly organic.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.680
 Like I think I had one or two stories like that and then I just stumbled across two more.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.680
 Well, one of those stories.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.680
 I was like, "Oh, this would be so terrifying."

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.680
 And it's funny, if you listen to the way I talk about the pigman from Portugal.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.680
 So a couple of people know where this one's going.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.680
 The way I talk about the story of the pigman from Portugal.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.680
 I'll put the episode on the show notes.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.680
 I'm like telling it.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.680
 I'm telling it as if it's a real story because I don't know.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.680
 I don't know.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.680
 See, here's the thing.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.680
 I live in the world of the paranormal.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.680
 So when I hear things that other people would think that's unbelievable,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.680
 I go, "Maybe, maybe."

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.680
 You know, that might be true.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.680
 You might be able to become a pig person.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.680
 And this story I found on the X-board and just a brief overview.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.680
 These four young men were walking home from a bar one night.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.680
 They looked down the alleyway and they saw like a monstrous sight.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.680
 The silhouette of a creature standing at the end of this alleyway had a t-shirt that was too tight.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.680
 So his stomach was showing and they described it as a bifurcated belly.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.680
 So like the fat fold in upon itself.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.680
 He had like a sunflower hat or like a wide brim hat and had a purse on as well.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.680
 And these four men beat it up because they were drunk and they were scared.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.680
 They beat this thing up and they took his purse and all that was in the purse was some kernels of corn.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:07.680
 And I told that story the same way I would talk about something I read in the New York Times.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.680
 I do a little more mood building, but you know what I mean?

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.680
 Like, "Wow, maybe this happened and if you pick number three, you're a pig person."

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.680
 I released the episode.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.680
 This is back when episodes were still getting released on YouTube.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.680
 Imagine if you walked into a dinner party

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.680
 and you had a big pudding stain on your back.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.680
 But you don't know it. You don't know what you're like, "Oh no, that's dessert."

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.680
 That way when I get hungry, I just take my jacket off and lick it.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.680
 You don't know the pudding stains there.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.680
 And you walk into this party and you're waving at people and people are like, "Hey, what's going on?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680
 You know, hey, what's up, man?"

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.680
 And you start to hear people snickering.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.680
 Oh my God.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.680
 You don't know where they're snickering at.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.680
 Maybe they're snickering at that loser who came in behind you.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.680
 Yeah, that guy's totally lame, but not me.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.680
 You hear a little bit of snickering here and there.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:07.680
 But the longer you have the dinner party, the more it just becomes outright laughter.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.680
 And then you realize they're literally pointing at you and then finally someone comes up and goes,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.680
 "Hey, buddy, you got some pudding on your back."

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.680
 That's what happened with this pig man of Portugal story.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.680
 And everyone who pointed this out, they didn't do it in a mean-hearted way,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.680
 but it was funny because I saw the YouTube comments start to roll in.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.680
 And people started...

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.680
 People originally were just like, "LOL, I can't believe you talked about the pig man of Portugal."

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.680
 And then sure enough, people started to say, "Hey, that's a real story, dude."

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.680
 Like, that's an inside joke.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.680
 It's a real story, but it's about this guy.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.680
 I'm like, "What are they talking about?"

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.680
 So it turns out...

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.680
 It turns out that the story is real in a sense.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.680
 And I did not know this at the time.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.680
 I started piecing this together through YouTube comments and I started doing some research and I'm like,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.680
 "Uh-oh, oh no, this is not going to end well."

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.680
 And what sucks is I left the episode up.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.680
 I left the episode up on the podcast, but the YouTube video, I go,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.680
 "I'm going to private this YouTube video for now."

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.680
 It was out for a while.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.680
 Most people who watched it on YouTube watched it like within a day or two of it coming out.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.680
 Nobody even noticed that I private it.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.680
 I'm going to private it for now and see what I'm going to do.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.680
 Really, I couldn't do much because I thought for a second,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.680
 maybe I can edit out the pig man of Portugal segment.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.680
 But it was a "Choose Your Adventure" segment.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.680
 It would be odd if people go, "I pick number three. How come there's no number three?"

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.680
 And then the rest of the episode, I think the pig man of Portugal might have been the second story,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.680
 for the rest of the episode, I kept referencing the pig man story.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.680
 So I listen to the episode and I go, "It would be butchered.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.680
 I would have to take everything out."

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.680
 I didn't want to.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.680
 I will take out stuff if I have to.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.680
 And that is something I do have to...

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.680
 Because sometimes I'm covering these Reddit threads and...

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.680
 You never know.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.680
 I could put something out and someone contact me and go,

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:22.680
 "Hey, that was a story that I told and I never thought it would be on a podcast.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.680
 Can you take that out?"

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.680
 That's never happened to me.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680
 That's never happened to me.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.680
 One person...

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:35.680
 There is one person who did that, but one, I could never prove it was the same person

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.680
 who originally wrote the story on Reddit because the account got deleted.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.680
 They came a couple months later and was like, "Hey, can you take that story down?"

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.680
 And before I could even answer them, they then had a list of demands.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:55.680
 Like I had to then have a 10-minute apology inserted in and I had to write a letter to the mayor or something.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.680
 I'm super bizarre and I was like, "I don't know what's going on here.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.680
 This is crazy.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.680
 I'm just gonna leave it up."

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.680
 I would love to talk more about these emails I'm getting from this person,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.680
 but I feel like I would just be drawing more attention to what I can only...

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.680
 This is so bizarre.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.680
 Maybe in a future segment, I will, but he was actually making the original story weirder.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.680
 But if somebody came to me and said, "The mayor has ever moved an axe.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.680
 Can you take this down?"

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.680
 I may not be able to completely take it down, but I might be able to add something.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.680
 10-minute long apology.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.680
 I don't know what that guy was on about.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.680
 But anyways, I'm looking at this.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.680
 I can't really edit it out.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.680
 I'll private it on YouTube, which I regret now because I didn't know this when you private a video on YouTube

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.680
 and then when you put it back, all the comments are gone.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.680
 All the comments are gone, which sucks because I hate doing that.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:53.680
 But the reason why this video started getting a bunch of attention was because it is a true story,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.680
 but it's not about a man turning into a pig.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
 That's what I figured.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.680
 I go, and I think I said in the episode, I go, "Could you imagine like being a human

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.680
 and then turning into a pig so your clothes would get smaller?"

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.680
 And you would steal a hat to wear to kind of cover your face.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.680
 It might not be the type of hat you would normally wear.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.680
 You purse full of corn because you're eating stuff and you're still trying to hold on

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.680
 to the remnants of your humanity.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.680
 Turns out that what I actually did was your lovable naive podcaster.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.680
 He just wants to talk about pig people and ghosts, clones, all this stuff.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:35.680
 All of a sudden, I was standing in the middle of a war, apparently.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.680
 I'm vaguely aware of Ethan Ralph.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.680
 Ethan Ralph is the host.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.680
 I think it's a podcast on YouTube called the Killstream.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.680
 And he also has a website called the Ralph Retort, apparently.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.680
 I know that he... I had to look somewhere.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.680
 I had too much research, though, to figure out what was going on because in the YouTube comments,

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.680
 people were laughing.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.680
 Laughing and they're like, "Oh my God.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.680
 You fell for the Portugal Pigman story?"

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.680
 And I was like, "Yeah, it was a cool story."

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.680
 They said, "That really happened."

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.680
 So what happened was Ethan Ralph, apparently...

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.680
 I don't know how I would classify him.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.680
 I think alt-right.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.680
 I think that's even how he classifies himself, but Ethan Ralph is an alt-right.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.680
 And if that labels wrong, I apologize, but...

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.680
 Because I'm doing all this research and people are calling them all sorts of different things.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.680
 So I'm trying to find the one thing that I saw comment.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.680
 So let's just say, and if I'm wrong, you can put it in the YouTube comments.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.680
 I'm sure you guys will be laughing about it anyways.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.680
 Ethan Ralph, alt-right commentator.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.680
 He runs with Nick Fuentes. He's kind of in that circle.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.680
 Well, apparently, he has beef with this website called Kiwi Farms.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.680
 And they were basically were set up to monitor Christian activity.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.680
 And then they just said, "Let's look at the internet as a whole and find these LOL cows."

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.680
 So you have Kiwi Farm and Ralph, Ethan Ralph, fighting.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.680
 Well, apparently, Ethan Ralph used to beef with this guy named Andy Worsky.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.680
 Who I actually am familiar with.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.680
 I remember him way back in 2016 when he was just putting out YouTube videos all the time.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.680
 So you have Andy Worsky and Ethan Ralph are fighting. Kiwi Farms and Ethan Ralph are fighting.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.680
 Ethan Ralph and Nick Fuentes are friends.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.680
 And then there's me. There's me.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.680
 A guy who just wants to tell a story about a shapeshifting pigman.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.680
 That I found on the X-board and I thought was really cool.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.680
 Well, it turns out that...

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.680
 Because someone goes, "I got a lot of comments." They go, "Jason, there's an actual video footage of this attack."

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:53.680
 What it was was Ethan Ralph went to Portugal because that's where Andy Worsky, like, his ethnicity is.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.680
 I don't know if he was born there, but, you know, he's Portuguese.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:03.680
 So Ethan Ralph goes there to troll Andy Worsky.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.680
 And while he is there, he's like, live streaming and people know his location.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.680
 So two people, I guess, followed him to Portugal and beat him up on camera.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.680
 There's a video of Ethan Ralph getting beat up and he is wearing a shirt.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.680
 Like, as he's getting beat up, his shirt gets pulled up.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:30.680
 So you can see his stomach and he's wearing like a sun hat and he has like a man purse on him.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:38.680
 All of a sudden, I found myself standing and like, basically there's this war going on between all these factions.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.680
 And I'm just walking through the middle of this battleground going,

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.680
 "Anyone's seeing a pig person? I'm looking for some fun stories for my paranormal podcast."

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.680
 And I remember when that came out, I thought, I don't know what to do.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.680
 Like, I just... Here's the thing, because the show's daily, I just kept putting out episodes,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.680
 but in the background, I'm thinking, I don't know what to do.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.680
 I can add an intro to it in that episode. That was one idea.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:09.680
 But I go, it wouldn't make any sense to go, "Hey, this next story is super political. This next story is so political, I wouldn't have covered it."

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.680
 If I had known, but enjoy, I could have added an out...

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.680
 Because it was a couple of days, like it took a couple of days for these comments to start rolling in.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.680
 I was like, "Okay, so now what do I do?" And I go, "You know what? I'll just address it on a later episode."

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.680
 So now here we are, 80 episodes later, I'm addressing it.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:37.680
 I think the episode still works. I think it's a fun story. And the reason... I think it's important to...

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:44.680
 Listen, I know that I'm naive, and I know that I want this stuff to be real.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.680
 Like, I get that. That's part of me. And we've told stories that turned out not to be real.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.680
 I don't tell a story that I know isn't real.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.680
 Unless we're going to dissect it, or we're going to go, "This is white."

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.680
 Like, monkeys don't exist, obviously. I don't believe in that.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.680
 We talk about that all the time. We dissect it, we look at it, we make fun of it.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.680
 I don't read creepypasta. That I know is fake. If I know it's fake, I would never have covered it.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.680
 If I knew this was a meme, I would have never covered it.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.680
 But I get that that's me. That is my ghost of Christmas past.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:20.680
 That naivety of me when I read this stuff.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.680
 Because I was like, "Oh dude, this is really cool."

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.680
 Like, even though it was creepy, it was really cool. And then it turns out it was...

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.680
 It was just such a weird situation to be in. It really was.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:36.680
 And it was a situation that I just didn't know how to rectify.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.680
 Or if it even really needed to be rectified.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.680
 I think if everyone involved... I think most people wouldn't care.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.680
 I don't think Ethan Ralph or Nick Fuentes or Andy Worsky or Kiwi Farms.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.680
 I don't think they would care at the end of the day.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.680
 I think they might all think it's funny. I don't know.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.680
 Maybe Ethan Ralph wouldn't think it was funny.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.680
 I think if you looked at it and you go, "Oh, he was tricked."

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.680
 He was honestly tricked by this.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.680
 I think then you could go, "Well, that's ridiculous."

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.680
 Like, he heard this story and he thought it was real.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.680
 I wasn't super stressed out about it. I was puzzled more than anything.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.680
 I was puzzled and I didn't know what to do next.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.680
 So I just kind of let it sit there. I did put the YouTube episode in private.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.680
 But I kept the podcast episode up. It's never been edited.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.680
 I still think it's a good episode. It sucks that that story is fake.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.680
 I wouldn't much rather have a world where there are pig people walking around.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.680
 But that's part of the nature of being a paranormal researcher.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.680
 So that is my Ghost of Christmas past.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.680
 I wanted to give you guys a little bit of...

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.680
 Well, I guess I also needed to correct that story.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.680
 I needed to correct that story. I just didn't know how.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.680
 So there you go. That's how we do it.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.680
 But, you know, that's that. We have that done 80 episodes late.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.680
 Let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider and jump off the highest point in Portugal.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.680
 Let's glide all the way out to a mortuary.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.680
 [Hair hang glider]

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:11.680
 Luckily, the Ghost of Christmas past used to be a burglar when he was still alive.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:18.680
 So he's going to Jimmy open this lock and we're going to walk into this morgue and make yourself comfortable.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.680
 We're on all these recently deceased bodies.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.680
 I got my feet up on a table.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.680
 The reason why we're sitting in this morgue is because it's so funny.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:35.680
 The stuff that we don't cover on the show.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:49.680
 I have a list of stories that are some of the most disturbing pieces of content I think I could put out.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.680
 And it's so funny to think about what the show...

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.680
 At a certain point, I'm going to have to start a second podcast.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.680
 I really just come to that point and it's not...

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.680
 I can't let it interfere with the five episodes a week of Dead or Abbot Radio, but...

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.680
 Well, you go...

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:11.680
 The other thing is you can just not tell those disturbing stories.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.680
 I've always thought about...

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.680
 Well, not always.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.680
 Probably in the past year of starting a side podcast called Dead After Dark.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.680
 Which is...

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.680
 I mean, guys, seriously.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.680
 I almost need to get these stupid stories off my hard drive.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:32.680
 Just because when I'm looking through stuff, I was like, "Oh, Ziya, seriously, why do I keep this file here?"

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.680
 I said, "Hide this file. Just dark stuff."

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.680
 And I guess that's the thing. I could just not do them.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:46.680
 I really like doing the TikToks because that allows me to itch my true crime scratch.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.680
 Or is it scratch my true crime itch?

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.680
 Because I really love true crime and I don't cover a lot on this show.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:58.680
 Because what I've learned is that people who love paranormal don't like hearing about people getting brutally murdered.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.680
 I've realized that. It took me a couple of years.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.680
 People who love true crime, it's nothing.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.680
 It's nothing.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.680
 They can totally read a story about kids getting sliced in half and then switch to a ghost story.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.680
 It's like a continuation.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.680
 And then those kids became ghosts and they haunt the house to this day.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.680
 But people who are into the paranormal, people who are into UFOs don't want to hear that stuff at all.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.680
 They don't want to hear any of it.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:27.680
 And it's so funny because when I started the podcast, I thought, "Paranormal conspiracy true crime."

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.680
 I've been talking a lot in those early episodes too about the Venn diagram of these things kind of colliding.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.680
 And I think I overestimated that Venn diagram.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.680
 I think true crime is more separate.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.680
 I think people who are into paranormal, they can listen to the cool conspiracy theories.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.680
 And people who are into conspiracy theories can listen to the paranormal stuff.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.680
 But the hardcore true crime stuff.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.680
 And that's why nowadays I only do one true crime story a week.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.680
 And it's not any of the gruesome stuff.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.680
 Jason, I'll disagree with that. You've told some horrible stuff on here.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.680
 Yeah, trust me, it gets worse.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.680
 Like, I have these files ready to go.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.680
 So I'm always thinking about doing a side podcast.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.680
 But what's interesting is looking at the stuff I don't cover.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:20.680
 For example, there's two stories that I've mentioned multiple times.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:26.680
 One story, people go, "Are you going to cover it? Are you going to cover it?" I still get emailed to this day about that story.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.680
 And the other one, I've mentioned two or three times and nobody talks about it.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:36.680
 And it's super interesting to me that nobody ever even asks about the second one.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:42.680
 The first story that I've mentioned once or twice on the podcast is "Lost Summer."

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:53.680
 And it's a story about my personal experiences involving the world of conspiracy and the world of the paranormal.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.680
 And it took place over the course of about a summer.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.680
 And I will never tell that story on the podcast.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:09.680
 I've never told that story to anyone ever.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.680
 And the reason why is because it involves other people.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.680
 So, like, if I'm telling a ghost story, if I'm saying, "Yeah, me, Josh, and how we went out ghost hunting and da da da da da da,"

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:25.680
 who cares? They're not going to lose their job. The mayor of the town's not going to chase them if they ever went ghost hunting.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:38.680
 But if there's a conspiracy story, I can't tell that story because we're going through things together.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:48.680
 And for me to then years later, I mean, it's been, what, 12, 13 years for me to just talk about it nonchalantly on a podcast,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:59.680
 when someone was at first confiding in me, for me to then tell that story,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:06.680
 when this person was talking to me, I didn't have a podcast. It was just me and this person having this conversation.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:18.680
 There's also the thing is the story is, it's several things. It's bizarre. It's unbelievable. It's anticlimactic.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:25.680
 And in a weird way, even though I experienced it, parts of it may not be true.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:32.680
 Not in the sense that I made anything up, but things that this person was telling me may not have been true.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:40.680
 So decisions that were made based on conversations, you know, you understand, someone's telling you something,

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:47.680
 some of it may be true and some of it may be false. And to be honest, I don't even know if this person is still alive.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:26:00.680
 I don't even know if this person is still alive. But I feel like I would be betraying what they told me for entertainment on a podcast.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:07.680
 That's the first story. People have asked me multiple times, are you ever going to tell "Lost Summer" or are you ever going to tell "Lost Summer"?

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:16.680
 And it's so funny because it's getting hyped up and it's super anticlimactic. And if I told it, you'd be like, huh, that's it?

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:27.680
 But you still have to have that. You still have to have, if someone's telling you something and I've had people email me about stories I've done,

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:34.680
 high ranking people in the world of conspiracy theory have emailed me and said,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:41.680
 "Would you like more information on this topic?" But you can't tell anyone about it.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:47.680
 And I told them, I go, nowadays as a researcher, I research stuff to share it.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.680
 See, back then, "Lost Summer", it was just about the acclamation of knowledge for myself.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:00.680
 I told this person more recently, a couple years ago, they said, "I can give you more information on it, but it's just for you."

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:06.680
 I said, "I appreciate that, but the researcher I am today is to share the knowledge."

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.680
 So I politely declined the conversation.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:18.680
 And they said, "Thank you." I mean, that was fair. I was coming at it at that level.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.680
 Now, if they had said, "Let's talk about this and I don't care if it's on the podcast," that would have been a different situation.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:32.680
 But the acclamation of knowledge for myself, that there's nothing wrong with me being a researcher like that, but I'm not their researcher anymore.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:40.680
 The story that I've mentioned a couple times that nobody ever asks about, which I think has the best title out of all of them,

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.680
 is the snuff film from outer space.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:54.680
 Now, the reason why I don't tell that story, I've had that story ready to go for probably a year and a half to two years.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.680
 It is sitting right in my ready to go file. It's kind of like my storage center.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:11.680
 I look at it all the time. The snuff film from outer space, the reason why I don't cover it, and it's so interesting because I see a lot of parallels

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.680
 between myself and this man known as Timothy. There's this guy named Timothy.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:24.680
 And I see parallels between us. He says that, "What happened?" And see, here's the thing, I don't want to go into a ton of detail on it.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:35.680
 I'm still debating on whether or not to do it. The problem is, is that you cannot tell the story without completely doxing private citizens.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:49.680
 There's no way to tell the story without that because what he believes is that he saw a murder take place on a beach and then it was turned into a staged suicide.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:56.680
 He saw it and someone he was fishing with that night saw it. They covered it up. They made the body look like a suicide.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:03.680
 But if you go to Google Earth and go to these direct coordinates, which is this house backyard, I mean, this guy goes hardcore.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.680
 He lists names and addresses and personal photos of people. He's dropping this stuff all over the internet.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:15.680
 He's dropping it all over 4chan. He's dropping it all over Quora. He's dropping it all over Reddit.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:23.680
 Personal photos of these people, addresses. If you put in this, and I feel like I'm just teasing you at this point,

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:34.680
 but if you put in this Google coordinates, you will get the backyard of this house and there's bloodstains. What he says are bloodstains on the beach.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:47.680
 And he said the people who murdered this girl are so powerful, their arms dealers according to him, the people who murdered her are so powerful that they want the image viewed from space.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.680
 They want, it's basically their own personal snuff film. They want to be reminded.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:30:01.680
 Now this whole thing happened quite a few years ago and I checked it. I checked it right before coming here to edit it.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.680
 The picture's still up. The picture of the bloody beach.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:13.680
 What's interesting is that he says, and I verified this back in the day. He was correct. If you change it to street view, it's not there.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:24.680
 But if you do it to the global view, it's there. And he says they're using their powerful connections, this family, so they can view this snuff film from space.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.680
 Let me get a date for that. I mean, I got the document right here. 2015 is when it happened.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:36.680
 It's an interesting look at a man who believes in a conspiracy theory. It's also an interesting look at a man suffering from mental illness.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:48.680
 Because I told you kind of a very, very bare bones version of it. He also, the buddy with him, apparently got shot with some sort of mind control beam.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:56.680
 And if I remember correctly, let me look at my notes here real quick. I mean, I guess I am kind of doing it as much as I can.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:05.680
 He got mind manipulated. He said the other witness got mind manipulated and got 30 years in prison. He doesn't say what his buddy did.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:14.680
 He got mind manipulated. He went to prison for 30 years. Now it's Timothy's job to stop the snuff film from outer space.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:21.680
 Here's the thing. Here's the real tragic thing. And this is where I kind of see parallels between myself and Timothy.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.680
 I did a ton of research on this. I really did look all this stuff up. I have these notes here.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:37.680
 There was a young woman who committed suicide. He names the girl and he goes, "This girl was shot on the beach." But they made it look like she committed suicide.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:44.680
 I looked it up and she did die on the day that he said she did.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:51.680
 I couldn't verify that she died of a suicide. Very rarely will they put that in a death notice, right? But they have like...

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:59.680
 And the thing is, I'm looking at this story and I've been looking at it for a year and a half. And I go, or two years, however long it was,

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:08.680
 I go, "I can't tell this story without doxing these people." And this girl killed herself.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:17.680
 Like this family is dealing with the tragedy of one of their loved ones taking her life. And I don't even think they know this guy's out there.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:24.680
 I think they have no idea that Timothy is running around the internet claiming that she was murdered.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:34.680
 Not only was she murdered, but they're controlling satellites in space so they can be reminded of that.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.680
 They want to see that snuff footage from outer space.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:45.680
 And I think it's so interesting because I... That's pretty much the segment. Because I did do this segment as much as I could.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.680
 So giving you the Google coordinates... See, that's the thing. Like on the one hand, there's a legal thing of me putting out stuff that can get...

00:32:51.680 --> 00:33:00.680
 That's doxing. That's 100% doxing when I'm releasing the information of an adversarial element of a story.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.680
 When I'm talking about like a haunted Kmart and I go, and I'll say this a lot of times, I'm like, "It's on 3rd Street in Claremont."

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:11.680
 So if you want to swing on by... The Kmart's not doing anything wrong.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.680
 Right, I'm not saying that this family is doing anything wrong, but Timothy is.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:29.680
 So if I have a podcast where I give out Google coordinates or even just put it in the show notes, even though I would be disputing the conspiracy theory and I do, I don't think what he's saying is true.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.680
 And actually, I know what he's saying isn't true because he changes his argument based on where he's at.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:44.680
 Posted on Reddit as, "Look at this mystery. Look at what's going on." He posted on 4chan as Hillary Clinton killed this girl.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:50.680
 When he posted it on 4chan, he posted on the poll board, the Politically Incorrect Board, back in 2018.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:34:00.680
 He titled it, "Information that will lead to Hillary Clinton's arrest. This blood is displayed like a sick trophy on Google Earth. The Clintons faked her suicide the next day."

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:09.680
 So that's not true. See, we can look back to his earliest versions. He changes the story for the audience, but it's still a picture.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.680
 I mean, it is a Google Earth photograph of these people's backyard.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:21.680
 And the girl who died, committed suicide, she's one of the members of those families.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:28.680
 So I would basically be giving out the address of a grieving family whose young daughter killed herself.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:36.680
 And this is why I say me and Timothy are so similar. And I hope this isn't super boring for you.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:43.680
 I look at this and I go, "What's the difference between him looking at this and thinking that it's a conspiracy theory?"

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:51.680
 What we know for a fact is that a young girl died. I think she was in her 20s. I keep saying her young girl, but I'm, you know, 46.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:57.680
 He keeps saying that she was murdered, and this is a cover-up of the highest level.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:04.680
 What's the difference between me? I remember a long time ago, I did an episode. I'll put it in the show notes, but it was about a young couple.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:10.680
 They took a boat off to go to an island in the middle of the night.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:19.680
 And there's like four photos that were taken on a cell phone of like them on this island and her standing next to this lighthouse.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:32.680
 And then they went missing. A couple days later, they found his body floating in the bay, and she's never been seen again.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.680
 It's a true crime story. It actually happened. It's a mystery to this day.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.680
 Fairly recent one. I think it's only been in the past couple years, right? Put it in the show notes.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:52.680
 In that episode, I talk about it, and then I go, "What if she got sucked away by a ghost? What if some paranormal darkness was on that island?"

00:35:52.680 --> 00:36:01.680
 That episode's always kind of stuck with me. One, I think it's a really good story, not necessarily the way it's told it, but as a mystery in and of itself.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.680
 But that episode's always stuck with me because at the end of the day, that's a real person who's missing.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.680
 And I said a ghost might have done it.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:16.680
 Now, do I believe 100% that a ghost did it? Am I going around the internet saying that a ghost did it? No.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.680
 I mean, I did announce it on a podcast, but...

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:28.680
 And that's not the only true crime story that I've done that with. I do it a lot. I do it a lot.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.680
 And so I look at the way I approach true crime.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:41.680
 Dude, the TikToks, sorry, sometimes I can't even keep a straight face when I'm doing one of the true crime TikToks.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:48.680
 The latest one, I had a little stuffed gingerbread man dancing around. It was about this woman, this mother, who got brutally stabbed to death.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:57.680
 I didn't set out to go, "Let's make the funniest TikTok." I just happened to have a stuffed gingerbread man that I got for Christmas, and I thought he was cool looking.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.680
 So I held him up in the video, and I started laughing at him.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:12.680
 Anyways, I do look at that, and I go, "Me? The way that all kind of spin theories. Am I really that different than Timothy?"

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:18.680
 I think the difference is that I then don't go around the internet saying, "This is the only theory."

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:27.680
 But I mean, we've covered episodes. I can't think of any off the top of my head, but we've covered episodes where people have committed suicide, and I'll go, "But what if...

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:35.680
 What if it was a suicide demon? What if it was a curse of the social sciences building?" All sorts of stuff, right?

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:44.680
 So I think about that. Actually, it's funny. I should keep this article up on my Ready to Go page, just to remind me that, yeah.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.680
 What's... At the end of the day, what's the difference?

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.680
 Like, I guess there's a bunch of differences. I'm not suffering from a crippling mental illness.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.680
 I'm not running around the internet trying to promote this. I keep saying that when I put out a podcast every single day.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:05.680
 It's like one of the biggest paranormal podcasts out there. I can no longer say, "Well, you know, more people see that stuff than they hear this podcast."

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:11.680
 So that's not even close. I think it's a cool story. If I could... I mean, that's basically it.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.680
 I've now told it in as much detail as I can. That's really it.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:26.680
 The only thing I'm not giving out is the coordinates. And really, it's just photos of this backyard with what look like two big splotch stains.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:34.680
 He says she was murdered. Everyone else says it was suicide at her apartment, too, not that she was killed there.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:41.680
 So, yeah, I mean, if I didn't... It's an interesting story. That is the story, the snuff film from outer space.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:50.680
 That's as much as I can tell it because, yeah, you just got to be careful because, again, there's a chance that the family has no idea that this guy's going around spreading this stuff.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:56.680
 And it's not just the family, but the friends and the family and the community. They don't know that this guy's saying all this stuff.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.680
 And I've thought about it. Would you rather not know?

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:08.680
 He's talking about it to this day. Like, he's still posting stuff all over trying to get this story to be exposed.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.680
 And I think it does need to be exposed in the sense that it's not true. It needs to be exposed for being a lie.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:20.680
 And I can clearly say that because whatever website he's on, he changes the circumstances.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:28.680
 If it was true, then it's true everywhere. But if he goes to a place that hates Hillary Clinton and he goes, "Hillary Clinton did this,"

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.680
 then you're obviously just changing the story to get the audience. And they didn't believe it either.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:41.680
 Politically incorrect, they tore him to pieces. They tore him to pieces. They go, "That's not true. That's not true." They shredded him.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.680
 I guess also he was a repeat caller on Info Wars back in 2018.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:53.680
 There's a Bitshoot video of that episode, but a legend has it that Bitshoot video is still buffering to this day.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:01.680
 I tried watching that Bitshoot episode months ago and it will not load. It will not load.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:07.680
 But it's crazy. It's crazy. And is there a comparison between me and him? I think in a way there is.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:14.680
 I think in a way there is. I think in a way that sometimes I might be a little tasteless when it comes to some of my true crime stuff.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:19.680
 I know that I laugh a lot when ghosts, when I'm talking about a kid getting killed and turning into a ghost.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.680
 But a lot of times we don't even know if that kid ever existed. That's one thing.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:33.680
 Interesting story. Interesting story. There's a man out there right now who believes that there's a powerful family that is filming a snuff film shot from space.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:42.680
 He is spending a lot of time trying to convince the rest of us that it is true, but I don't think it is. I think it's...

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:49.680
 I think it's a sad story. I don't know why he's so fixated on it, though. That's what's so weird.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:59.680
 And you could go, "Maybe he's fixated on it because he did see something." It was interesting because on 4chan they pointed out that

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:05.680
 when he was telling the story, he goes, "Yeah, me and my friend just got done fishing and we caught like a 30 pound bass."

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:13.680
 And they're like, "Really? That's how much of a boomer you are? You're trying to explain a conspiracy to us, but you still got to talk about your giant fish you caught."

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:22.680
 And what is this? They tore him to pieces. Not just because of the fish thing, but they're shooting holes in it. It's just such a weird story.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:30.680
 It's not, you know, it's not unusual, though, for what we see. We do see people fixate on things when we do the show.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:39.680
 And let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous carbon helicopter. We are leaving behind Timothy.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:46.680
 We hope that he gets the help he needs. He's definitely suffering from some sort of obsessive disorder.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:56.680
 Possible mind melting ray? That's the thing I don't ever really understand. If these people are so powerful and they know that these two guys saw it

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:03.680
 because they used the mind melting ray or the mind Mindy, whatever it was, on his buddy who then got 30 years in prison,

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:11.680
 why don't they just execute these people? If I was powerful enough, I would just kill everybody involved. That's totally what I would do. That's what I would do all the time.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:24.680
 But anyways, that's actually a good segue. Believe it or not, that's a good segue. Let's all hop in the carbon helicopter, take us up, up and away, fly us out of this morgue, and all the way out to the future.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:31.680
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:39.680
 And there we are. We're just sitting in the cockpit of the carbon helicopter and we're watching the future laid out in front of us.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:52.680
 And this is a really interesting place to be. This will be short. I'm not going to ramble on for a long time, but it's so funny. When I started this show, a thousand episodes ago, a thousand and five episodes ago.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:43:10.680
 I never would have thought it would have gotten here. And it's funny. I couldn't have imagined what it is. Like, I could imagine... I don't know what... I mean, like, I imagined I would still be doing a podcast of some sort, but the fact that you're listening to it is amazing.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:17.680
 Right? I'm sitting down, came home from a long walk, pulled my microphone up and started doing this.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:24.680
 It's funny, going back to where I was when I sat down to record episodes one, two, and three, I kind of recorded them back to back.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:33.680
 The idea of sitting down and going, "I'm going to do a daily podcast, a solo daily podcast," that's nuts.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:41.680
 Like, I knew that I had to be daily. I knew if it was weekly, I would have given up. I would have procrastinated and not done anything until the day before.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:53.680
 I mean, I do that now. I do that now. I just do it five days a week instead of one, but I know me. I was like, I need to be busy every single day with the podcast.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:59.680
 And if it was a weekly show, I would not be busy for five days. I'd be playing Minecraft or whatever, and then I'd rush an episode out.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.680
 Now I rush out episodes five days a week, but...

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:08.680
 And now we're here, a thousand episodes, four years later.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:17.680
 And in one sense, I guess I could imagine what it would be like, but I didn't imagine it would be like this.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:24.680
 That makes sense. I don't even know what I thought it was going to be.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:30.680
 But it's interesting because then I don't really know what it will be in the future.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:42.680
 Like, I know what I would want it to be, is I want the show to pretty much be the same.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:51.680
 I think, you know, if you listen to... I did an episode early on. I don't remember which one it was, but I was talking about like my best episode, my worst episode.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:58.680
 I don't have those anymore, because I think the show has become so...

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.680
 Like, I know what makes a bad episode now. Like, early on I didn't, and I would record...

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.680
 There's a couple of episodes I was like, "Oh, that's awful. How did that even get released?"

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:18.680
 I'll be honest, this episode that I'm telling you, this is my second draft. I recorded 40 minutes of a other version of this, and I didn't like it.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:23.680
 Like, I sat in this hot closet and sweated out for 40 minutes talking about...

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.680
 And different stuff, actually, not even the same stories.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.680
 I talked about the big man in Portugal, and then I talked about some other stuff, and I said, "No, this is boring."

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.680
 And I went outside the closet. I didn't go outside, it's like 70 degrees out there.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.680
 I went outside the closet and sat and watched a little bit of YouTube and go, "Okay, let's try this again."

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:46.680
 And so I think now I know... There's a whole episode about the coronavirus that's unreleased.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.680
 Like, it's a good 40 minutes, and this episode came out like March of 2020.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.680
 Well, it didn't come out. I recorded it, and I go, "It's boring."

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:59.680
 There's a lot of episodes like that that are just sitting on my hard drive. They're not entertaining.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:06.680
 And so I think now I can't think of an episode in the past like 800 episodes that I think wasn't good.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.680
 Do I think they're all great? No. I think some, I love the story about the tree.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.680
 See, that's what's funny. I'll say, I love the story.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.680
 As far as the way I told it, as far as the episode was put together, I'm not for sure.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.680
 But I love the story about the tree murderer, and I love the story about the kids in Miami versus the demons.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.680
 It's just like all of these things I can just kind of pick out.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:36.680
 But it's like, you know, how do I envision the show in the future? I want it to be the same.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:41.680
 It's so funny because if you listen to those early episodes, there's no catchphrases.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:47.680
 That's one thing I've loved about doing this show, is it's evolved so naturally.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.680
 There was this YouTuber I started watching recently, and I watched maybe four or five videos,

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.680
 and I was like, how long have they been around? And they had just started.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.680
 They had just started, but they had all these catchphrases and all of these funny end jokes.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.680
 And I was like, this is so artificial.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.680
 Like this person came in and probably has a team behind her.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.680
 And they had written all, like this is what you need. You need these type of catchphrases.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.680
 You need this sign in and sign off and da da da da da.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.680
 And maybe that is how people do it. But like early episodes, we don't have the vehicles.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.680
 You don't have to listen to every episode.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.680
 Welcome back to another episode of DidRabbit Radio.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.680
 Like all of these things evolved over time.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.680
 And that's what I like about it. Like you can feel it grow organically.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.680
 What's funny is I had completely forgotten about the conspiracy cap.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.680
 Someone recently reminded me of that.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:45.680
 And I was like, oh yeah, do we have a warning, a conspiracy cap? Like 200 episodes.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.680
 And I didn't get rid of it because I just forgot.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:55.680
 But yeah, I couldn't have thought that it would be where it's at.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.680
 But now the show seems very settled, right? All of those intro elements are the same.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.680
 There's little differences. I'm a little more jokey during the intro.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.680
 You know, during the telling you what the two stories are going to be.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.680
 But I couldn't have guessed that it would have taken this form.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.680
 I would like it to just kind of stay this way.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.680
 I would like for the show to have a bigger audience.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.680
 That's nothing against you.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.680
 Because the bigger the audience, the more things we can do.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.680
 I would have always talked about this. I want to do on the road stuff.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:31.680
 Just record out of hotel rooms.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.680
 And visit some of these places.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:40.680
 And it really wouldn't change anything about the show itself.

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.680
 See, we would still be doing five days a week show.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:50.680
 But imagine if we did a show, did an episode in Dudley Town, Connecticut, or Stole, Kansas.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.680
 Interviewing. I mean, it would just be so great.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.680
 I would love to do like maybe every show often.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.680
 Not during the five days. See, I like the five days a week being the same.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:05.680
 But maybe we have like a Saturday or a Sunday interview every once in a while with people, real people.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.680
 Not authors. Not paranormal researchers.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.680
 But real ghost stories from people in these towns.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.680
 Or them telling us to get out. There are no ghosts. All that stuff. I love it.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:20.680
 I would love that, right?

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.680
 But I'll be honest with you.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.680
 I might have mentioned this before, but I'm not for sure.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:30.680
 When I came back from vacation this year, the beginning of September,

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:41.680
 I was so depressed that I didn't want to do the podcast anymore.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.680
 And it was nothing against the podcast.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:50.680
 I had one of those depressions, and these are the worst type of depressions, that wasn't caused by anything.

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:56.680
 I was just depressed. I just sit there.

00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.680
 And I started talking about wrapping up the show. What would that look like?

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:05.680
 I mean, obviously I make money from the show now that if I quit doing the show,

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.680
 I would have to get another job to supplement the money that I'm making from the show now.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:16.680
 I would have to replace that income because it's become part of how I'm paying my bills and getting groceries and things like that.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.680
 And I remember sitting there and I was thinking, like, what does the end of the show look like?

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.680
 How does this end?

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:30.680
 And it was nothing against the show. It was just, I was in that depression, and I remember I kept putting out episodes.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.680
 Because that's what I do. I put out episodes.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.680
 But I was doing stuff on the back end.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:43.680
 Like, usually when I do an episode, I keep multiple copies of each episode, and I have it formatted in a certain way.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.680
 Basically creating these barriers from data corruption.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:52.680
 And I'm also creating versions of this that you can remaster it at some point.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.680
 I have a raw audio.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:58.680
 Like, I have an edited version that's pretty raw.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:07.680
 So at any point, if we start getting a bunch of money, we can do full remasters of episodes. Some of them need it.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:14.680
 And I stop doing those little things behind the scenes. And I go, what's the point? What's the point? I'm going to be quitting this podcast soon enough.

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:20.680
 But I knew, because, you know, I've struggled with depression. It doesn't happen as often as it used to.

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:26.680
 But I knew, and that's why I kept putting out episodes, that I wasn't depressed because of the show.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:33.680
 It wasn't the show. I was just depressed. There was something chemical, most likely, that powered through it.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:38.680
 But I do have to look at what does the end of the show look like?

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:42.680
 Like, that is an interesting question to ask.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.680
 What does the end of the show look like?

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:51.680
 And when I say, and I've been saying, some of you guys might have noticed it. I've been saying it a lot.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.680
 The show's going to go on for much, much longer. We're just getting started. We're just getting started.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:59.680
 That's a response to how I felt in September.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:06.680
 Like, I'm saying that stuff more now. You guys might notice it now that I've said that out loud.

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.680
 Because I have been saying that more in the past couple of months. I've been saying it on live stream.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.680
 I've been saying it in the episodes. We're just getting started. We've got so many more episodes coming out.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:21.680
 I'm saying that because of how I felt in September, where I was like, the show could end this week.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.680
 And I'd be okay.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:34.680
 But that wouldn't be true. I was just depressed. I could have also said I could have lost my job this week and that would be okay.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.680
 I could have nothing to eat this week and I would be okay because I was just depressed.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.680
 And I pushed through it. It was only lasted about a week and a half.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.680
 I just pushed through it. I go, just keep putting out your episodes.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:51.680
 Because you need to. You can't go, I'm going to take another week off. I just come back from like a, quite a long break actually.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:58.680
 Because I was gone visiting my mom. So yeah, I powered through it. Because I knew what it was.

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.680
 It was a chemical depression. It wasn't caused by any real life events.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:10.680
 But then I started thinking like, what does the show look like? And I honestly don't see the show ending for a long time.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:17.680
 I have a ton of stories to cover. There's more stories all the time.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:24.680
 Maybe some of them may be fake like the big man. But there's always more stories to cover and I love covering them.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:38.680
 I do. My fear, and we'll wrap it up like this, is the last episode will come abruptly.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.680
 There were so many times when I record an episode and I go, what if I die now?

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:49.680
 What if I died before I even edit this? That's a cool episode. What if I died before I edit it?

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.680
 But obviously, you know, dying is something that I have to take into account.

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.680
 I want this show to outlive me. And not just because I'm egotistical about the show.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.680
 It's the research I want to outlive me.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:08.680
 All of those show notes, all of those stories that people can then find stuff about.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:14.680
 Maybe disprove a story they thought was true or maybe go down a rabbit hole of a story they never heard of before.

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:20.680
 So that's something that I've been trying to work on. You know, with Lipson, my podcast provider,

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:27.680
 once my bill stops getting paid, I believe everything disappears within 30 to 90 days.

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:35.680
 Like the website just, everything's gone. This isn't like a YouTube channel. You pay to have your podcast hosted.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:43.680
 So I'm putting, you know, measures in place like that. I have relatives that have passwords and something happens to me.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:51.680
 They can log in, maybe change it from, I pay $40 a month hosting, you know, drop it down to five or something like that.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:59.680
 I'm currently trying to get my stuff up on the Internet Archive, but you know, I have a thousand episodes. It's taken a while.

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:06.680
 But I am, I'm trying to look at what the show, the future as the show, I hope it's the same. I love doing this show.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:12.680
 I think it's a great format. I think it definitely can be improved. I think definitely there are things, the show's not perfect.

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.680
 When I say I want it to be the same, I mean more like the feeling of it.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:27.680
 Like if all of a sudden we're bringing in 50,000 views an episode, we're making $10,000 a week,

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:40.680
 I don't want that to change the feeling of it. You know, you know what I mean? We may, I'd be like, okay, let's go someplace.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:50.680
 Let's get a recording studio set up. But the man behind the mic, I can't be different. I'll grow, I'll mature.

00:55:50.680 --> 00:56:00.680
 I think when I listen to those early episodes, I sound not tonally, but I get some of those things. They sound immature.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:08.680
 We've done a lot of growing in four years, Jason. You know what I mean? Some of the stuff is like, dude, that's super cringe, bro. Why'd you say that?

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:16.680
 But I think the tone of the show is the same. It's the story of a dude, like I've always said.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:28.680
 And I think this is the same thing from that very first episode to this one. It's your friend you work with who walks up to you during lunch and goes, dude, you won't believe what I saw on the internet today.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:37.680
 That's Dead Rabbit Radio. That's the show. And I think it's always been like that, and I don't want that to ever change.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:45.680
 The recording equipment can get better. The audio quality can get better. You know, know how to mix stuff better.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:51.680
 I think I've gotten better by just doing two stories in episode. Three stories was way too much. I didn't have confidence.

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.680
 Generally, that meant that I didn't have confidence in one or more of those stories, so I crammed three stories into it.

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:02.680
 Right now, the episodes are about 45 minutes long, and I do two stories each, and that's perfect for me. Those are changes that work.

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:08.680
 I don't interrupt the story so much anymore. You listen to early episodes like Sam the Sand Down Clown.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:16.680
 I step all over myself that whole episode. I'm interrupting. That's a really cool story. I spend the whole time interrupting myself.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:24.680
 So changes like that. And I saw those errors now. Who knows, you know, 500 episodes from now, am I going to look back at these episodes and go,

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:30.680
 "Oh, you made a lot of errors." Hopefully, right? You want to grow. But anyways, I'm going on too long. I'm going on too long.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.680
 I know you've done doing your dishes and now you're just sitting there.

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:41.680
 But I'm trying to death-proof the show. That's kind of something I'm in the mood. I don't plan on dying anytime soon, but nobody does.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.680
 I don't have any health problems. I'm actually fit as a fiddle.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:52.680
 But it would be nice to death-proof the show, have it somewhere where it won't just disappear.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:58.680
 But yeah, that is the... I kind of gave up the ghost of future. Did he show up? I don't remember. I don't remember the ghost of future.

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:05.680
 Ghost of future? Whatever. Ghost of future past? That's X-Men. The ghost of future Christmas? Christmas future? Whatever.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.680
 You can hear my voice is starting to get hoarse because I've been talking too long.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:16.680
 But I love you guys. I love you guys. I really do. I die after this episode right after I'm done editing it.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:23.680
 You know that. Know that. That I love you guys. And this has been an awesome journey. And we are just getting started.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:29.680
 And I hope you guys believe that because I believe it too. I do believe the show is growing.

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:35.680
 I actually know that's a fact. I can look at the graphs, but it's... it's...

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:41.680
 It's going to be an awesome journey and I hope you stay with us. You don't have to listen to every episode, honestly.

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:47.680
 If you pop in every couple months, check out an episode so you're still here. That's fine too.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:52.680
 Or just keep listening to your thoughts as you go to bed. Go, "Who Jason's doing okay?"

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:57.680
 Because I think about you guys. I really do. I really do. I think about you guys.

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:01.680
 I know some of you guys on a first name basis. I know some of you guys on an internet name basis.

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:06.680
 And some of you guys I just know are out there. We may never interact with each other.

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:11.680
 But I know we're part of something bigger and that thing is called DeadRabber Radio and I appreciate...

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.680
 I appreciate you being on this journey with me.

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:18.680
 So go ahead and wrap it up if you know all the words. Say it with me.

 I feel swift here for new Flex Super Glue. What's truly amazing is that our Flex Super Glue is so strong that just one drop virtually welds itself to the surface and can lift over three tons.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:56.680
 Forget those old super glues. Get the one that's new. Flex Super Glue. Go to FlexSealProducts.com/3tonLeft to learn more about how one drop lifted three tons.
