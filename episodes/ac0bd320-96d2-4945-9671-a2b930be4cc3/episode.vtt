00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 A prospector finds a mysterious rock, an Uber driver pulls up to Walmart to pick up his

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.440
 latest ride, and two friends and their dog are on a trip to Yellowstone Park.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.280
 What do all of these stories have in common?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.840
 They're incredibly terrifying to me and scare me to death today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:32.840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.840
 I'm having a great day.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.680
 A little asterisk next to that one.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 I'm having a great day.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.920
 I really do hope you guys are having a great day.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, HotDiggityDane.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.840
 HotDiggityDane, thank you so much for supporting the show.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.520
 Sorry for that long pause.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.520
 I do thank you.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.520
 I'm just thinking of that Mickey Mouse Club song.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 I can't say HotDang, HotDiggityDane.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.280
 I don't know the song apparently, but you know what I'm talking about.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.800
 I mean, assuming you're six years old and you're listening to this podcast, HotDogHotDogHotDiggityDog,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.640
 that's the song.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.680
 That was a waste of 30 seconds of my podcast.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.560
 If you can't celebrate the Patreon though, that's okay too.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.960
 Just help get the word out about the show.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.160
 That also helps a lot.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.960
 Now, HotDiggityDane, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.360
 We're gonna go for a little drive to Skokie, Illinois.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.120
 On Mondays, you don't have to listen to Monday's episode to get this one, but on Monday's episode,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 I did a segment on intrusive thoughts.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.520
 Those are thoughts that pop in our head.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.600
 They're totally unwanted.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.160
 We would never act on them, but they're scary.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.800
 We go, "Why am I thinking about pushing my mom off a cliff?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
 I love my mom."

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 Also, there's no cliffs around, so it's not physically possible, but you're sitting next

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 to your loved one.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.920
 You think about doing them harm or saying something really rude to them, or you think

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.000
 about self-harm, or you think about robbing a bank.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.120
 And sometimes it can get to the point where you stop going to banks because you're afraid

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.120
 you might rob one.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.480
 Even though you would never do it.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.280
 You don't own any of the tools.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.040
 You're not a fan of the movie Heat.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040
 You wouldn't do it.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 Point is intrusive thought.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.800
 Something you wouldn't act on, but your brain's putting the thought in your head.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400
 And everybody gets them.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.680
 And I discussed some of my intrusive thoughts on that episode.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.480
 I thought it would be "fun" to find some stories that actually are related to intrusive thoughts

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
 I've had.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.640
 So if you haven't listened to Money's episode, that's totally fine, but we'll be talking

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.640
 about, I'll explain them, because some of you are like, "What?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640
 Why are you afraid of that?

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.640
 I'll kind of explain it."

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.160
 So, hot-digity Dane, we're driving out to Skokie, Illinois.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.240
 It's May 30th, 2017.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.440
 It's about 5 a.m. and the Jason Jalopy's sitting outside of a Walmart in Skokie, Illinois.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.920
 Hot-digity Dane goes, "Hey, can I go in and buy some groceries?"

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.640
 And I'm like, "Whatever you do, do not leave this car, because I know what's going to happen."

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.680
 We're sitting there and we see a car pull up to the front of Walmart.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.640
 That is driven by Grant Nelson.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.720
 He's a 34-year-old Uber driver.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.480
 And he had just gotten a call, an Uber request, to pick up a 16-year-old girl named Eliza

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480
 Wozny.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.520
 So, he sees this young girl walk out of Walmart and get into his Uber.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.440
 He starts to drive away.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.800
 Within two minutes of that car leaving Walmart, Eliza pulls out a machete and a knife and

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.560
 begins attacking Grant Nelson.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.600
 When police looked at the video footage, when they were trying to piece this whole thing

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.320
 together, they know that she was in Walmart.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.920
 So they're watching the video footage at Walmart and they see this 16-year-old girl walk into

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920
 this 24-hour Walmart.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.720
 This is a great product placement for Walmart, right?

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.200
 I've said their name like 10 times.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.800
 I'm sure they're going to love this episode.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.760
 He had a call from CEO later on.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.240
 The Eliza Watkins walked into your local neighborhood, Walmart.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.200
 She walks to the sporting goods section, gets a knife, gets a machete, which they sell right

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.360
 off the rack, right?

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.520
 You can just go up and you can just pick them up off the rack.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.960
 They're not locked up.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.320
 Walks out of Walmart, steals them.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.640
 Someone might have questioned her, right?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.600
 10-year-old girl's trying to buy two edged weapons at 5 a.m.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.680
 Someone might have said, "Hey, don't do that.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.160
 Or can I see your ID?"

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.360
 Or "You're not a murderer.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360
 Are you?"

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.080
 They have a little pop-up button like when you buy cigarettes.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.560
 Are you over 18?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.000
 Are you a murderer?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.680
 She walks out, shoplifts these weapons.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.640
 And then I'm assuming in some way concealed them as Grant Nelson was pulling up.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.920
 She did it literally while she was waiting for the Uber.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.360
 So she called him to meet her there when he got the weapons and then as she was coming

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.680
 out the car pulled up.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.040
 I'm assuming she had them concealed in some way because you're not going to let anyone

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.400
 in your car if they're carrying just one of those two, right?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.280
 You're like, "Huh, a knife, but luckily no machete.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.800
 Hop on in, ma'am."

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800
 She must have had them in like a backpack or something like that.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.240
 Big jacket, I don't know.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.280
 But anyways, so she walks out and gets in the car with Grant.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.240
 She begins attacking Grant. He gets all cut up in his face and his neck and his chest.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.920
 He eventually is able to get out of his car and he's running through this neighborhood.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.000
 Again, it's very early in the morning and there's a condo building and he runs up to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.640
 the lobby and he's banging on the door screaming out for help.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.240
 They call authorities.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.760
 As the rescue personnel gets there, they actually follow a trail of blood from the street across

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.680
 the grass into the lobby of the condo building.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680
 Car is gone.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.720
 And now the police are looking for the car.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.560
 They actually find it a couple blocks away.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.120
 It was crashed.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.120
 So the cops find this car that's been crashed.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.640
 No one is in the car.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.960
 But Grant's cell phone is there.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.400
 And right on the cell phone, it shows that he had picked up a fare just a couple minutes

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.400
 ago under the name Eliza Wozny.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.600
 The cops are now looking for her.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.480
 They find her hiding behind an office building covered in blood, still gripping her knife

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.200
 in machete.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.320
 Grant Nelson died the next day.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.320
 He didn't make it.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.200
 I mean, he was pretty badly injured.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.480
 The cops ask Eliza why she did it and she's like, "I don't know.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.160
 I don't know why I did it."

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.080
 And they're like, "You obviously had this plan.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080
 You went into Walmart.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.280
 You shopped, lived through this stuff and you called the Uber driver.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.280
 Why would you do it?"

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.280
 She's like, "I don't know.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.320
 I don't know why I did it."

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.360
 Fast forward three years later, August 2020.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.640
 This recently just had a new development.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.720
 She sentenced to 27 years for murder.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.600
 A 16-year-old girl is now going to be in prison for 27 years.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.800
 Lawyers ask, "Why'd you do it?"

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.880
 Judge asks, "Why you do it?"

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.000
 Psychologists ask, "Why you do it?"

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.840
 Every time she answers the same thing.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.480
 I don't know.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.360
 That terrifies me at the most core level of my being.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.960
 That was one of my intrusive thoughts, was people just snapping.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.960
 I've never, ever snapped.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.400
 I've been in a lot of fights and I talked about this.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.320
 I've been in a lot of fights in my life from about age six to about 36.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.800
 I was always getting in fistfights.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.840
 I've been in fights my entire life.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.920
 Then I ran out of people to fight when I moved.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.440
 I no longer lived in bad neighborhoods.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.440
 I don't fight anymore.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.680
 Then I go start doing Brazilian jiu-jitsu and stuff like that.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.680
 That's fine.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.520
 Maybe not if you're anti-street fighting, which is how I engage the knit for 30 years

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.480
 of my life, but I've never lost control.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.400
 I've never, ever lost control.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.880
 The idea of people snapping and losing control and not knowing why they do something terrifies

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.880
 me.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.200
 Because I always think, "Well, if that happened to them, what if it could happen to me?"

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.640
 But you have to think like, obviously there's stuff like chemicals sometimes involved, falling

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.280
 into a vat of chemicals and becoming a joker.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.560
 Sometimes there's drugs involved, alcoholism involved.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.720
 Sometimes you can look at supernatural causes like demon possession.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.960
 Those stories really scare me because it's about losing control.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960
 I don't drink.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.960
 I don't do drugs.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.640
 I drink super rarely, super, super rarely.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.760
 Couple times a year maybe.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.560
 And I'll drink a beer and I'll be like, "Oh, that's it.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.560
 That's it.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.560
 My vision's getting hazy.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.720
 I'm not in control anymore."

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:12.280
 I think I have OCD from my fear of alcohol equals alcoholism and alcoholism equals losing

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.280
 control.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.280
 It's this whole thing.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.240
 I did talk about it in a lot of the Monday episode, but you didn't have to listen to that

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.240
 episode.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.320
 But the idea, that stuff scares me, but the idea of somebody just one day waking up and

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.960
 deciding to murder somebody absolutely terrifies me.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.920
 It terrifies me on two levels.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.360
 One of thinking, "Could that happen to me?"

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.840
 Now, this person may have had a lifelong mental illnesses, but they don't, I mean, again,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.360
 there's no, they look at all the paperwork.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.840
 They're like, "We don't know why she didn't."

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.840
 It wasn't even like I wanted to know what it was like to kill someone.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.960
 That stupid edge lord excuse.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.840
 It's just she never reveals it.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.240
 It's spooky, man.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.760
 It's also scary for the victims, right?

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.240
 I could be on the other side of the coin.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.840
 I could be like, "I'm totally calm and peaceful."

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.800
 "Oh, lookit, there's a 16-year-old girl walking by this coffee shop."

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.320
 And then I just get chopped up, dude.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.320
 That's actually to me less scary, because I think I could take her.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.320
 Not in a car.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.160
 See, your defensive options are really limited in a car, but, oh man, I don't think I could

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.400
 be an Uber driver.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.320
 We were always told not to pick up strangers and stuff like that.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.160
 And now we, most people have jobs where they do it.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.080
 Taxi cabs have kind of done that.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.520
 Actually, that's the definition of a taxi cab.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.840
 They're like seasoned veterans of the taxi industry.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.680
 I think that's the thing, right?

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.640
 Or did I just make up that stereotype?

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.960
 It's a generational thing.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960
 It's passed down.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.120
 Fathers are talking to their little sons.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.880
 It's a dirty world out there.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.640
 Sometimes streets gotta get cleaned.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.760
 They're showing them this documentary about taxi driving called Taxi Driver.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.320
 This is your life now, son.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.680
 So both of those, that scares me on just a core level.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.640
 That idea of being able to snap like that.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.640
 Because I've never done that.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.880
 I've never, I've gotten mad obviously before and I've been thinking, dude, I'm about to

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.680
 knock this dude out.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.520
 But, I'll always try to use my words first.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.920
 And I've never gotten so mad that I've acted out physically.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.920
 Never.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.480
 I've gotten so mad that I've punched somebody out of anger.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.200
 It's always out of this situation.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.320
 The talking has ended.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.800
 This situation now has only one way to be resolved.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.720
 It's very, very calm.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.920
 Because people who get mad and fight lose fights.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.040
 And that was an early, early lesson I learned.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.520
 Actually, now that I say that, when I was a little, this is funny, in a little self therapy,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.840
 when I was a little kid, I would, you get so mad, I would start fighting other little

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840
 kids.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.680
 And I wonder if that, I wonder, and I stopped doing that because I was constantly losing

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.120
 fights.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.760
 When you're, I was a big kid too, so I was strong.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.880
 But if you get mad during the fight, you lose.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.240
 If you're calm during the fight, you have a better chance of winning.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.240
 It's not guaranteed obviously.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.640
 I'm not saying if you're calm, you pick a fight with Mike Tyson, you're like, "Oh, I

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640
 got this guys.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.640
 I've been drinking green tea all day."

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.240
 It's still a risk.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.120
 But it's a more calculated risk.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.920
 So anyways, the idea of losing control terrifies me.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.680
 Maybe that's why I was never a fan of the Incredible Hulk as well.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.360
 Let's go ahead and move on our next story.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.520
 Hot Diggity Dane, we are going to hop in a new vehicle I just invented.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.640
 The Wabbit Wagon.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.120
 It's an old stagecoach with horses and stuff like that.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.000
 Hot Diggity Dane's like, "Dang it dude, this vehicle sucks.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.080
 It's super slow and I gotta feed the horses."

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080
 I'm like, "Ah, they're cool.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.240
 Just feed them a couple of carrots.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.400
 Make sure they don't bite your fingers off."

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.160
 The reason why we have the Wabbit Wagon is because we are, that's so stupid.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.760
 The reason why we have that is we're going back in time.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.200
 Let's go back to the year 1858.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.200
 We're back in time.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.040
 We're riding the CPI colored wagon down a dusty trail.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.480
 I found this story from an article called "When Giants Roamed the Earth" by Mark Rose.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.840
 We're going to talk more about the main point of that article in a separate episode because

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.120
 I think it's pretty fascinating.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.880
 We've covered giants before, but this kind of has a unique view on them.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.240
 But in this article he starts talking about how for a while there was the stories going

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.240
 around of people.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.240
 I don't want to give away the Indian.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.240
 I don't want to give away the Indian.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.000
 So anyways, Mark Rose talks about in 1858 the Alta California newspaper gets a letter

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.360
 from Friedrich Leichenberg M.D.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.840
 So this German doctor writes this letter in "Dear Alta California Newspaper, let me tell

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.520
 you the story about a prospector and a dangerous thing that once happened."

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:29.240
 Then he puts dot, dot, dot, and then he puts in parentheses wiggly lines as we flash back.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.200
 We're going to meet a prospector.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.160
 His name is Ernest Fluchterspiegel.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.160
 And Ernest is away from the work camp one day.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.680
 He's doing what he does best, finding gold.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.280
 Actually, if I think about it, if he was the best at finding gold, he probably wouldn't

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.280
 be working anymore.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.360
 He probably would have found enough to not have to work.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.040
 But anyways, he's looking for gold.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.280
 He's walking around with his pickaxe and other stereotypical prospector stuff.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.360
 He has like a pan full of water and he has like clothes on.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.440
 You know, I'm sure they weren't naked out there.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.160
 He finds this geode as he's looking for gold.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160
 What?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160
 Intarnation is this.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.160
 This is one of them rocks.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160
 You crack open.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.840
 It's all pretty inside, he says.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.920
 In an oddly southern accent considering he's a German immigrant, he takes the geode and

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.800
 he does what we all do with geodes.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.000
 He breaks it open.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.160
 I've actually never had that.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160
 I've never been able to do that.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.360
 I always thought it would be pretty awesome.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.680
 But I guess I could just go buy one and just smash it on the ground and be like, "Oh, it's

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680
 okay."

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.440
 And he breaks it open and it's beautiful crystal inside, makes him go, "Ooh."

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.520
 But there's something else going on with this geode.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.440
 There's a half pint of liquid inside of it.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.840
 It's like, "What?

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.840
 Intarnation?"

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.400
 So he touches the liquid.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400
 Hmm.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400
 That's what I thought.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.400
 It was a liquid.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400
 My observation was correct.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.400
 Now, if you came across a strange liquid, let's say you walked into your house tomorrow.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.320
 You saw a rock sitting in your fridge and it was full of liquid.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.240
 You might drink it, right?

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.240
 You might.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.880
 You might think, "Oh, I don't remember leaving that five million year old rock in my fridge,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.080
 but here it is.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.760
 Everything in my fridge is edible," you say as you're eating a milk carton.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.960
 He takes this rock full of a half pint of clear liquid and he drinks it.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:25.200
 He starts walking back to base camp and he's like, "I've done a lot of bad things in my

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.200
 life.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.640
 I'm starting to think I shouldn't have drank that fluid.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.760
 I think that might be the ultimate regret."

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.320
 As he's walking to base camp, he starts to feel some pain.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.680
 "Oh, my stomach.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.080
 Oh, man.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.080
 After a hard day's work, I wouldn't expect my stomach to hurt."

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.480
 That's a little bit of foreshadowing.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.440
 He's like, "Oh," and then he keeps walking.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.960
 He's like, "Oh, man, my feet feel so heavy."

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.520
 I think I've run out of puns.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.520
 He gets to the base camp.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.520
 That was it.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.520
 That was the only two we could come up with.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.840
 It was like a five mile journey.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.360
 He's thinking, "Uh, do I rocks in my socks?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.360
 Is that a pun?

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.360
 No.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.360
 Rocks in my brain?

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.360
 I don't know.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.160
 Anyways, he can't come up with any either."

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.560
 By the time he gets to base camp, he's walking super stiff.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.160
 People think it's Frankenstein attack, but it's not.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.480
 It's just this guy, Ernest, walking up to them.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.840
 And he's like, "Guys, guys, help me, help me."

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.280
 I think I'm turning into a rock.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.280
 And they're like, "What?

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.720
 Which would be the only way to react to that?"

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.240
 So hey, Jerry, how's it going?

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.320
 Oh, it's going great, but I might be turning into a stalactite.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.320
 What?

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.800
 So anyways, he's walking all stiff and he's like, "Oh, I drank this geode juice."

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.200
 Which again, Alyssa, what?

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.640
 I drank this geode juice and ever since then, everything in me is getting hard and stiff.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640
 Dang it.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640
 Why didn't I have an erection joke?

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.640
 Because it's fine.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.720
 The moment's passed.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.520
 He's like, "Ahh!"

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.440
 And he starts complaining about pain in his epigastric region and his left hypochondriac

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.880
 region, which I thought, "Those are fake.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.880
 Those are real places.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.000
 Your left hypochondriac is where your spleen is.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Weird.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.160
 Epigastric is your stomach and all that stuff."

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160
 He's like, "Ahh!

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160
 My epigastric!"

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.640
 They're looking up a medical dictionary.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.440
 They're like, "Oh, his stomach hurts."

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.560
 He's like, "Ahh!"

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:26.760
 And then eventually, they can see his skin actually turning to mineral.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.800
 He died a very agonizing death.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.040
 He turned into a rock.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.200
 And then in the bizarre turn of events, I don't know why they would do this, obviously they

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.400
 watched this guy turn into a rock.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400
 That's his cause of death, right?

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400
 He's a rock now.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.600
 He's not alive.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.240
 They do an autopsy on him.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.120
 They get a doctor to show up to do an autopsy and he's like, "Guys, you could have told

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120
 me he was a rock."

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.760
 And he brought all of his medical supplies.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.760
 He has a scalpel.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.000
 He's like, "I gotta go back home."

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.920
 He comes back with a chisel and a mallet.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.000
 They eventually do an autopsy on this guy.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.240
 When they chisel his chest apart, his heart is now just a solid piece of red jasper rock.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.240
 Spooky.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.200
 You're like, "It's not really spooky, Jason."

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.640
 It's a guy who drank juice out of a rock and became a rock.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.400
 It's not really bone chilling.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.640
 Well, if you'll remember my Monday episode, one of the weird intrusive thoughts that I've

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.880
 had was, "I wanna eat.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.600
 I wanna eat if I go into a Wiccan magic store and I see it's super specific.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.120
 If I go into like a magic supply store, if I see polished rocks, I wanna swallow them.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.560
 I don't want to swallow them.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.400
 I don't want to swallow them.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.600
 But my brain goes, "Dude, you totally wanna swallow those things, don't you?"

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600
 And I'd be like, "No, I don't."

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600
 And they're like, "Yeah, you do.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.600
 Come on."

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.880
 And they didn't swallow at least one of them.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880
 They totally wouldn't hurt you.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.380
 I never have.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.640
 That's the thing with an intrusive thought.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.440
 It makes you think like, "Oh, I wanna just yell at this person.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.240
 They're irritating me so much."

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.240
 But then you're like, "No, this person I really love a lot.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.080
 Why am I having these negative thoughts about a person that I love and care about?"

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.120
 It's like that with me and magical rocks.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.280
 I don't know where it came from.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.920
 I remember the first time it happened I was at a magical supply store buying books or

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.640
 tarot cards or something like that.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.120
 And I was like, "Oh, dude, those rocks, you should eat those rocks.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.040
 I'm just super bizarre."

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.560
 And it happened every single time I went into that store.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.520
 And then I would go into other magical supply stores and I would see a bunch of rocks and

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.080
 I'd be like, "I don't wanna eat those."

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.560
 But see, it would become...

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.480
 See, here's the thing because I think I already mentioned this.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.320
 If you let the intrusive thought grow and grow, it becomes OCD, it becomes obsessive-compulsive

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.320
 disorder.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.320
 So you'll have...

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.040
 There is a possibility where I say, "I don't go into magic stores anymore."

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.840
 One, because it's a waste of money, but two, you're afraid if you go in there you're gonna

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840
 swallow rocks.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.320
 I never have and I actually just kept going to the stores.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.320
 It was basically like...

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.920
 And I kept spending my money.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:53.720
 But it was one of those things like I could have developed a fear of magic witchcraft

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.360
 stores and had more money or I could have just said, "It's just a stupid thought.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.600
 I would never actually do that.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.160
 I didn't know what the term was back then.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
 I know now it's an intrusive thought."

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.840
 The story is super spooky to me because it involves a guy ingesting a rock.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.640
 It involves a guy finding a beautiful rock and wanting to swallow it.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.200
 Now this one was just the juice, but that's a matter of semantics.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.280
 Like, it's rocks.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.240
 It's rocks all the way down.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.440
 This story, I shouldn't have to add to this point, the story is cool as it is.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.440
 It's totally fake.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.720
 It's a fake story.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.720
 It was a joke.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.120
 The doctor didn't exist.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.120
 The dude didn't exist.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.880
 I knew that when I was reading the story.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.920
 That's why I thought Epigastric and Left Hypocondria Act.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.160
 I thought those were terms that the fake doctor was using to see if the editor of the newspaper

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160
 was smart enough.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.680
 Those are actual terms.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.400
 But the story never happened.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.440
 It was a story that doctor didn't exist, earnest, flikal, spygol or whatever his name was.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.440
 It doesn't matter.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440
 I'm not insulting him.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440
 He's a fictional character.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.440
 It doesn't exist.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.540
 There was a time.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.540
 You can do it these days.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.540
 You can do it these days.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.720
 It's still absolutely hilarious.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.400
 There was a time where it was all the rage to make up new stories about petrified people.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400
 Mark Twain did it.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.680
 Mark Twain, Master Troll did it.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.920
 And make up stories about giants.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.400
 There's a lot of people saying, "Oh, I found a giant."

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400
 It was totally made up.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.520
 It was totally made up.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.720
 Not all giant skeletons were fictional, but most of them were.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720
 Most of them were.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.120
 There are stories about giant skeletons going way back into antiquity.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.360
 And we'll cover some of those too.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.860
 But this was fake.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.860
 And most of the stories when people go, "Oh, there's reports of giants in the 1850s.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.860
 They were just fake."

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.820
 Yellow journalism is the term.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.460
 But still, I saw this story and I was like, "Yeah, stupid.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.460
 Too many."

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.020
 What are the chances of me coming across the story where a dude eats a rock?

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.500
 Again, I was researching something else and found this story and I go, "There we go.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:55.060
 That goes in my bone chilling episode that everyone else is like, "Dude, that's obviously

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.060
 fake."

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:01.200
 Also, this isn't an intrusive thought, but I also have a fear of becoming a statue or

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.200
 a tree.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.120
 Like, ever since I was a little kid, I saw an episode of Doctor Who, which apparently

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.600
 never existed.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.440
 I saw an episode of Doctor Who.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.880
 I think I've talked about this before.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.320
 When I was a kid, my dad watched a ton of sci-fi.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.440
 We watched an episode of Doctor Who and it was like four or five different doctors.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.840
 It was the first -- this was like in the '80s, 'cause I'm like 43.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.560
 It was like the first couple doctors.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.000
 It was the first time that multiple doctors had been in a show together and the bad guy

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.140
 was trying to find the secret to immortality and all the doctors were trying to stop him

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.660
 'cause this guy couldn't have that ability.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.820
 They're like, "That's only for us.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.620
 That's only for us, Doctor Who."

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.860
 And he ends up getting to this alien layer and he finds out that the secret to immortality

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:45.900
 is he becomes a statue, a sentient statue frozen in place forever.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.980
 He'll never die now.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.940
 But they show him freezing and he's screaming, "No, no, this isn't what I meant.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.020
 I should have read the fine print.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.740
 No!"

00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:00.720
 And the four or five doctors, whoever was there, looked at him and they just walked away.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.920
 Like they weren't gonna rescue this dude.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.360
 He was trapped until the end of time, until the heat death of the universe.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.440
 He would be a statue frozen in place.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.880
 His mind still thinks, but his eyes shut.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.280
 His soul trapped in cement.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.560
 I had to have been -- that was probably like in the mid '80s, '86, '80s.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.560
 I would have been like 10, 11 years old.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.440
 Absolutely terrified me and I've tried looking for that.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.460
 Probably that movie's never existed.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.020
 I've even talked about it on this show and I've had some of you guys try to go, "Was

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.020
 this it?

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.020
 Was this it?"

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.020
 No.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.020
 It never existed.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.020
 Childhood fear of mine, even to this day.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.500
 He turned it into a statue and now we got this guy drinking a geode.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.460
 It's like two things combined into one.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.460
 Hot Diggity Dane.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.540
 Hot Diggity Dane is like, "Seriously dude?

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.540
 This is the episode I'm in.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.380
 The episode where you keep going.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.380
 Oh, that's spooky."

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.900
 It's a fake letter, but a guy who turned into a statue.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.240
 But Hot Diggity Dane is a trooper just like the rest of you.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.280
 We got one more of these to cover.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.040
 Let's hop in that Carbentercopter.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040
 Hot Diggity Dane.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.600
 We are leaving behind old, timey California.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.240
 We are headed out to Yellowstone National Park.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.600
 Helicopter is flying over the vents.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.040
 It's July 20th, 1981.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.280
 David Allen Kerwin.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.800
 He's 24 years old.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.960
 And his friend Ronald Ratliff are driving around and they say, "Hey, let's swing by

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.960
 Yellowstone.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.960
 They're on a road trip.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.960
 Let's swing by Yellowstone.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.260
 Let's go see what all this hot water is all about."

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.700
 We don't have that where we live.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.820
 It's all cold water.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.300
 And Ratliff's dog, Moosey, is also there.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.380
 So they got their dog in the back of the truck.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:40.100
 These two guys pull up to the Celestine Pool.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:47.620
 The pickup truck stops and they open the doors and Moosey jumps out of the car and starts

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.620
 running.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.940
 That's what dogs will do, right?

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.340
 Most dogs won't do this though.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:58.360
 He then jumped into Celestine Pool, 200 degrees Fahrenheit boiling water.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:04.560
 Because the elevation of water boils at like 190 or something up there.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560
 So that's horrible, right?

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.840
 But that's not the end of the story.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:12.080
 Ronald and David pursue the dog and they get to the pool and the dog is in the boiling

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.080
 water.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.520
 Now it's a middle of the day.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.080
 There's a bunch of people there and everyone's freaking out about what's going on.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:24.580
 But then something happens that makes everyone's attention turn from the dog to David.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.860
 David begins to motion like he's going to jump into the pool of boiling water to save

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.100
 the dog.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.780
 Onlookers begin screaming and "Don't do it!

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.140
 Don't do it!"

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.580
 And he's taken a couple steps back like he's going to run and jump.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.580
 And Ronald turns to his friend and says "Don't do it.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.820
 Don't go in there."

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.920
 And David says "Like hell I won't."

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.880
 And he jumps head first into the boiling water.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.640
 I mentioned on Monday's episode this weird thing about pouring boiling water on myself.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640
 I've never done it.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.720
 I would never want to do it.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.080
 When I'm boiling water I think "Oh, I just poured on my head."

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.160
 Intrusive thought.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.240
 If someone else poured it on me, I'm not going to have a great day, but that doesn't scare

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.240
 me.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.320
 And like I said, if someone forces me to pour it on me, it doesn't bug me either.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.520
 It has to be a, it's a weird quirk.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.540
 It has to be me willingly pouring boiling water on myself.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.500
 Very bizarre thing.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.580
 So he jumps into the boiling water.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.580
 It's so funny.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.700
 I knew this story by heart.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.740
 I went and got a single source for this story.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.900
 I knew this story by heart.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.500
 I'd read it years ago.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.660
 I really didn't even, I'm not even looking at my notes other than to remember the dude's

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.700
 names and the dates.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.820
 I remember everything about the story from the time I read it because it terrified me.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:42.340
 He jumps into the boiling water and the people are now speechless.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.160
 Nobody knows what's going to happen next.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.420
 And they see Ronald.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.180
 He swims through the water and he grabs Moosey.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.820
 He gets a hold of the dog.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.520
 But then David goes underwater, completely underwater.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.360
 And then they see the dog start to drift away.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.060
 So they realize that he's no longer holding onto the dog.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.200
 He's most likely dead at this point.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.280
 David resurfaces though and he's swimming, swimming through this boiling water.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.960
 He gets to the shore.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.200
 He can't get out of the water completely.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.900
 Ronald runs over to help him out.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.620
 Ronald actually gets second degree burns on his feet from the scalding water.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.500
 They pull David out and he says, "That was stupid.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.860
 How bad am I?

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.020
 That was a stupid thing I did."

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.400
 He's completely blind.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.420
 He can't see what's going on with his body.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.500
 And his burns are so intense, he can't feel anything either.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:41.840
 He has suffered third degree burns over 100% of his body.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.560
 That's your butthole is burned.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.160
 That's the inside of your nostrils burned.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.400
 That's every single inch of his body was completely blistered and peeling.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.940
 The muscles had started to cook.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.960
 One of the people decided, I don't know what was going through this shoe's head, right?

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.520
 They just pulled this guy out of boiling water.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.720
 Someone goes, "Take your shoes off.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720
 Take your shoes off."

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.720
 Maybe he had Air Jordans on.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.480
 They didn't want to ruin them or something like that.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:12.460
 One of these rescuers takes one of his shoes off and all the skin of his feet just come

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.500
 out with the shoe.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:20.580
 It just is like when you cook tomato soup and it skims on the top, except he was the

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.580
 tomato.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.580
 You get it.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.580
 You get it.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.740
 I don't think I needed an analogy for that.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.100
 It's like when you make nacho cheese, right?

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.580
 But you just take one chip and all the cheese comes off of that one chip.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.580
 Probably wasn't a smart thing.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.280
 I don't know what he was thinking to take off this dude's shoe.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.720
 I hope he stopped at the one shoe.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.960
 I hope he didn't go, "Oh, that was disgusting, but maybe the other shoe isn't so gross."

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.360
 Now let's take off his jacket.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.920
 Like I mean, that guy's obviously boiled alive.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.240
 They take him to the hospital.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.240
 He dies the next day.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.680
 The dog dies as well.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.960
 Apparently, this is a common thing.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.920
 Not super common, but dogs are constantly jumping into the water.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.000
 That's like a, I guess dogs are just stupid.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.800
 Just dogs are just dumb.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.460
 You never hear of a cat jumping into a hot spring.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:11.620
 But that story, I remember reading that story years ago and I was like, "Uhhh."

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.660
 Again, I mean, I get it.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.500
 You wanting to, first, I wasn't even his dog.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.980
 It was Ronald's dog, right?

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:25.220
 But secondly, if I saw a dog jump in boiling water, I'd be, it's not going to be the highlight

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.220
 of my week.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.420
 Obviously, I'm going to be pretty bummed out.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:32.000
 I would not in a million years jump in a boiling water.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.280
 I don't even know if I'd jump in a boiling water for a close friend of mine, right?

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:43.080
 Because at a certain point, I had the opportunity once to, I don't want to get into that story,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:49.760
 but I've had to put myself in situations where I may have gotten badly burned by flame.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:56.080
 But I don't know if I'm going to, I'm not, first off, first off, as my good friend is

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.080
 in this hot spring.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.380
 First off, hey dude, sorry, I'm not a really good swimmer to begin with.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.740
 So like, even if I was able to get you, now there's two people in the hot water.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.700
 It wasn't a pun, that was a literal thing.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.780
 I'm not even a good swimmer.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.820
 So even if it was like lukewarm water, sorry bro.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:20.180
 But the idea of jumping into head first, head first, I don't know why that's worse, right?

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.700
 It's boiling water.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:26.500
 But jumping head first into boiling water and then being pulled out blind and so much

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:31.760
 damage to you that you can't feel any pain, just terrifies me man.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.520
 The stories actually make me a little sick to my stomach.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.520
 It's really weird.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.040
 Now I know I run the risk of people now just sending me tons of stories about people boiling

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.040
 alive.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.120
 Again, it doesn't bug me.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:48.240
 It has to be a very specific thing where you do it on purpose of your own free will.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.640
 That's what's terrifying to me.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:56.480
 And I think all of those stories, the eating the rock or drinking the fluid, the Uber driver,

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.580
 or the girl in particular, and the jumping and boiling water, they all play into the

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.100
 same thing.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.180
 Losing control.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.540
 One of them is a mental losing control where she just snaps one day.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.060
 Nobody knows why she did it.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.460
 She may not even know why she did it, which is more terrifying.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.580
 The other two are losing physical control.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.400
 One guy literally turned into a rock and lost control over his body.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.620
 That was fake though, but it's still spooky.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.580
 It's still spooky.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:27.040
 This other one, he tried to be a hero and ended up dying, which is one of the ultimate

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.200
 ways you lose control, right?

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.200
 Because you kind of now no longer have a body.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.040
 I don't know, maybe it's totally awesome floating around and stuff like that, being

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.720
 a ghost, but I don't know.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.120
 I love being alive.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.240
 So yeah, all of these stories play into that idea of losing control or even just being

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.960
 so badly burned you can't even feel any sensation.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.240
 The skin of your foot could kind of just slough off and you not even realize it.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.720
 You're like, "Oh, why is that guy holding my shoe?

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.420
 Why is that guy holding my shoe full of lasagna?

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.420
 When did he bring lasagna?"

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.980
 Oh wait, I can't see, so I couldn't even see it.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:02.140
 But these are all utterly terrifying stories to me and one way or the other.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:07.340
 I really have no other way to end this episode other than, one, if you have intrusive thoughts,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.340
 they're totally normal.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.900
 Again, I want to hit that home because a lot of people suffer in silence and a lot of people

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.140
 think that they're mean people, that they're evil people.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.260
 How could I think these thoughts about people I love?

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.060
 How could I think these thoughts about myself?

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.960
 They're totally normal.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.320
 They're unwanted thoughts.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.800
 If you are walking around and you want to put boiling water on your head and you can't

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.920
 wait until you get and find a cauldron big enough for you, that's something you need

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.400
 to address with a psychiatrist, right?

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.160
 If you love shoplifting knives at Walmart and you can't wait until Uber's available in your

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.800
 area, that's something you address with a psychiatrist.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.520
 But when you're sitting next to someone and you have a thought where you just want to

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.900
 scream in their face and tell them to shut up, or you want to harm yourself or harm someone

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.220
 else, but you would never do those things.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.780
 You get these thoughts totally normal.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.100
 Just roll with them.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.100
 Just acknowledge what they are.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.220
 Say they're intrusive thoughts.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.100
 I'm not going crazy.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:07.420
 And you'll be surprised how less scary things will be unless your job is finding spooky stories

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.140
 to talk about and then you decide to use yourself as an example.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.620
 And hopefully these two episodes have helped you.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.000
 I really kind of put myself on the line for these.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.560
 I think they're fairly funny, but I'm putting myself out there.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.760
 I hope you guys are able to go, "Hey, I've had thoughts like that.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.640
 Maybe not as ridiculous as eating rocks, but I'm okay.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640
 I'm okay.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.680
 I know what they are now and I hope these two episodes are able to help you find a little

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.800
 bit of humor in something that 95% of the world population deals with.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.760
 You are not going crazy.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.600
 It's totally normal."

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.200

 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.940
 Have a great day, guys.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.700
 I'm actually going to go cook some soup right now.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.700
 Some boiling hot soup.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.700
 It's not a joke.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.700
 I'm starving.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.700
 I'm going to eat some soup.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.700
 I love you guys.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.220
 Have a great one.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.800
 (upbeat music)

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.380
 (upbeat music)

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.960
 (upbeat music)

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.540
 (upbeat music)

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.120
