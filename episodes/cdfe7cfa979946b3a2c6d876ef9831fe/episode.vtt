00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 What happens when your alibi is the worst alibi ever?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.660
 And then we take a look at a topic that's particularly scary to me and one of the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.120
 reasons why I'll never use them. We're gonna look at murders caused by Ouija

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.300
 boards today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.800
 [Music]

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.040
 host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.520
 You know, I had this girl come over yesterday and she fengshui'd my apartment.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.680
 She came over and she's like, "Move this here and move that there and do this and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.440
 do that." And you're thinking, "Why'd you let her boss you around for four hours

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.200
 right after you got off work?" Well, she brought a vacuum cleaner and a bunch of

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.800
 cleaning supplies. She could have turned the place into an ISIS training camp for

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.040
 all I cared. She brought a vacuum cleaner. The place looks... the place is spotless.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.860
 Well, little little asterisks next to that. The living room, kitchen, that whole area

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.120
 is spotless. I got to move some boxes around my bedroom, but yeah. I was just

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.440
 like, "Do whatever. I don't care." And she's like, "Can I move this?" I was like, "I don't care."

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.800
 She's like, "What if this one here I go, I don't care. I go, I really don't care. I'm

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.360
 not like totally picky about where stuff goes." But she wanted to just fengshui'd

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.160
 it up. It looks great. She even made a little corner. She's like, "Here, let's put

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.600
 this pillow down on the ground." So when girls come over, there's supposed to be a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.720
 girl spot and I'm like, "That looks creepy." I said, "If a sheriff walked into my

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.760
 apartment and saw what you set up right over there, he would have put me in handcuffs."

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.480
 So that's the one thing I said I don't want. And I also said, "Don't touch my

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.600
 mic. Don't go anywhere near my mic. I don't want you even in that corner of the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.160
 room." And every so often she'd be kind of walking around and she'd get over there

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.440
 and I'd be like, "Huh?" She's like, "Oh, oh, sorry." But thanks for coming over and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.120
 totally cleaning my apartment. You know how many times I've tried kidding women to

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.000
 do that. They'll come over and let me do all sorts of horrible things to them, but

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.120
 ask them to take the garbage out when they leave and they're like shocked that

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.720
 I would dare do a thing. And then this girl, just a friend of mine, comes over

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.640
 and busts ass on a Sunday. Just cleaned it all up. So thank you. Not gonna use your

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.200
 real name, but thank you, young maiden, for fengshui in my place. And we'll see

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.280
 if it works. It's definitely worth... At one point I flipped a carpet over

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.360
 because we couldn't vacuum it. It was too shaggy because my apartment is kind of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.760
 like a combination of floor rugs. And I flipped it over and about $3 and change

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.200
 fell out of it. I go with that. It was almost like opening up a portal to another

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.520
 dimension. I didn't even know change could stick to a carpet, but apparently it

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.240
 can. Anyways, thank you for fengshui in my apartment. Anyway, okay, so, but let's go

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.160
 ahead and move on to our first story. Now, our first story, let's take a little trip.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.080
 Let's take a trip to a police investigation room. Interrogation room,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.480
 that's the word I'm looking for, interrogation room. We are in Washington

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.280
 Canyon, Virginia. And there's two police detectives sitting around. Do cops still

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.840
 smoke cigarettes? I guess they probably can't smoke in doors either. But there are

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.440
 two cops with nicotine patches sitting in this interrogation room. And there's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.080
 this 23-year-old kid sitting across the table from them. His name is James Michael

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.800
 Wright. It was very, very recent. This just came out in the news. So James is sitting

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.880
 there at the table. Two cops are sitting there chewing nicotine gum. Got some

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.600
 losanges in there as well. And so the cops are like, "James, you just have to tell us

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.880
 why you did it." James is just sitting there and he goes, "I told you guys. I told

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.600
 you guys a hundred times. It was an accident. It was an accident. Why won't

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.320
 you believe me?" And the two cops look at each other and they go, "You accidentally

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.920
 murdered a person." James is like, "Yes! Thank you! I'm so glad you finally got it."

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.040
 And then the cops go, "You accidentally murdered three people on three separate

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.920
 occasions." And he goes, "Finally, thank you. In this nightmare end, do you believe me

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.720
 now?" James Michael Wright is a carny, or was a carny. He may... This is all a legend,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.760
 but anyways, he was a carny. He worked for this traveling carnival, which of

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.440
 course is like the most stereotypical occupation for a serial killer, other than

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.480
 just putting on your resume serial killer. So he's a carny and people started

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.240
 noticing that he was hanging out with these young women and they weren't coming

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.400
 back. They were disappearing. One of them was related to one of his coworkers at

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.040
 the carnival and then other ones were like girls that he met at the carnival.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.560
 But what happened was he got on a car accident. The cops had actually been

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.040
 looking for him, but when he got on a car accident, the cops are like, "Oh, now we

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.320
 know where he's at. He's in the hospital." So they went to the hospital to

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.800
 interviewed him and they started asking him about these girls that he was with.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.960
 So the first victim, no, not victim, the first person who had an accident was that

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.440
 it was February 28th, 2019, so very, very recent, February 28th. James says, "Okay,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.400
 listen, I was dating this girl and we did get a bit in a fight and during the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.280
 fight, I accidentally shot her and then a barrister body by my house." And the cops

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.960
 are like, "That is completely ridiculous." He's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on."

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.280
 So yes, it does sound a little convenient that I did happen to be engaged in a

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.520
 fight with somebody and then I accidentally shot them, but it can happen.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.160
 Accidents happen. That's what we all know, right? And the cops are like, "Oh my god."

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.480
 In March 9th, so what is that? Well, that's easy to do. Nine days later. March 9th,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.840
 he's having sex with this other girl in the middle of the woods and everything's

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.520
 fine. There's no fight, no problem at all. So, and after they're done having sex,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.120
 after they're done with the love-making session, James and the woman get up and

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.640
 start walking through the forest and he sees an animal run by and he pulled a

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.680
 swears to God, "This is what happened." He sees an animal run by. He pulls his gun

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.880
 out to shoot the animal. The animal is moving so fast and as he continues to

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.280
 aim his gun right when he thinks he can shoot the animal, the gun is aiming at

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.320
 the back of the girl's head and he kills her. Total accident. He did not mean to

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.760
 kill her, but he's like, "Great. Nine, this happened nine days ago. I just

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.680
 accidentally killed someone and again I killed this person. This is terrible." He

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.960
 then hides her body underneath a log by his house. March 17th. How many days is

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.160
 that? It doesn't matter. What, two weeks since the last one? Now imagine if this

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.200
 guy's telling the truth. He's not, but imagine if this guy's telling the truth.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.080
 How bad does your luck have to be to accidentally kill someone on the 28th?

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.360
 Because I could see you're getting in a fight and then maybe fighting over the

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.600
 gun or something stupid like that or you're in a fight and it's a crime of

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.520
 passion. I guess it's not really an accident, but to accidentally kill someone

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.920
 on the 20th of February, nine days later, you accidentally kill someone else. At

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.800
 this point, I would just become a hermit, not hang out with anyone. On March 17th,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.240
 James is just on a walk, just on a nice nature stroll with this young woman. All

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.080
 these victims are like, I think the youngest one was 16 and the oldest one

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.880
 was in her like early 20s. They're all quite young. He's walking with this woman,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.360
 enjoying the nature. They didn't have sex, they haven't been in a fight. He's

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.880
 thinking, he's in the clear. He's thinking there's not gonna be any

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.000
 accidents today. I'm not gonna instigate any way that I could possibly

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.200
 accidentally kill someone with this damn, damn gun and he pulls the gun out and

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.800
 he's looking at it and he trips on a log and she turns back to the head. And

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.640
 that's not it. Because then he's like, okay great, now I gotta get rid of this

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.280
 body. So he throws the body in the back of his pickup truck and while he's driving

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.120
 the pickup truck, the body accidentally, accidentally guys, police officers totally

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.600
 believe this, accidentally the body flew out of the back of his pickup truck into

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.600
 the river and I don't think they found her body yet. But so obviously the cops

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.240
 don't believe any of this, but the cops also have some other issues here. Their

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.080
 biggest one is he casually really killed three people in less than a month. Three

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.280
 women just shot him quote unquote accidentally. So now they're really

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.000
 thinking he was a carny, so that's incredibly suspicious, but he

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.960
 worked for a type of company that moved from region to region. So now police are

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.480
 having to go through every place that that carnival's been at with him and

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.760
 having to match up victim profiles and stuff like that. So definitely is

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.520
 considered a serial killer because he killed three women, but he may have

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.000
 killed a lot more. Hopefully not, hopefully not. I do though have to say I

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.680
 would have loved to just be in that interrogation room as he was valiantly

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.000
 trying to fight that. These were all accidents officer. These are all

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.240
 accidents. I totally didn't mean to do that. Here, give me your gun and I'll show

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.080
 you they're like no no no no. Just stay there and we don't believe you. We need

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.600
 some more nicotine. Let's go ahead and move on to our, why can't cops smoke in

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.720
 an interrogation room? Actually I'm kind of making this statement and I don't know

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.760
 maybe they can. I doubt it. I'm sure some lawyer would be like oh my god my

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.240
 asthma, but it's like that's very intimidating. Actually you know what I'm

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.760
 pretty sure they do smoke in interrogation rooms. I'm pretty sure they do, but they

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.440
 should if they don't they should be able to because if you don't like cigarette

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.160
 smoke, BFD dude you're in an interrogation room and if you don't mind

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.240
 smoke just like hey officer give me a cigarette and then you build that report.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:27.240
 So I had to take a nicotine break after talking about all that stuff. Man being

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.000
 addicted to stuff sucks. But now we're gonna talk about me actually that is a

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.600
 great segue. We're gonna talk about being addicted to Ouija boards. So you know I

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.000
 have done it. I did a full episode I think or a full segment on Ouija boards a

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.480
 while back. Not a fan of them. I've never used them. I think either they're a waste

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.640
 of time because it's psychosomatic movement and it's just like a stupid

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.800
 parlor game and I don't care or they're real and a bunch of demons are gonna get

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.320
 me. Like there's it's one of the two. It's either a total waste of time and

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.280
 it's fake or it is actually opens up a gateway and I have better things to do

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.480
 with my time and I don't want giant gateways opened up. So I've always just

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.400
 kind of stayed away from them. Like my sister used to make them. She's not like

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.040
 she was woodcarver and stuff like that. She's like working for a factory. She

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.000
 would make them somehow. She'd make them on paper or some cutting board or

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.960
 something like that and whatever. I've never just really liked them. I've just

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:38.800
 never been. It's a combination of they're stupid and I'm scared of them. So I

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.000
 don't mess with them. It's funny because I'll do tarot cards and palm readings. I'll

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.520
 do tarot cards and I'll read palms. I'm not letting anyone else do that stuff

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.800
 because I know how the gimmick works. But you know I'm not gonna

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.160
 pay a psychic to do that stuff but I know how to do it myself. So I mean like

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.760
 stuff like that I'm fine with. I've never really done any sort of divination and

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.480
 any sort of mirror scrying or throwing chicken bones. None of that stuff. But I

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.360
 think that the risk reward is less. If I throw a couple chicken bones I'm just

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.800
 making my floor dirty and then I'll have this drunk come over and clean it up

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.120
 again. No that was a one-shot deal man. I don't think that that took a while.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.200
 I hope for it to convince someone to do that. Actually she called me up and she

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.760
 goes hey I want to come over and punctuate your place. I've been thinking a lot

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:29.160
 about it. So you have to keep it clean. But anyways that aside it's just been

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.560
 something that I've always been really kind of like because I don't know. Like

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.120
 if I knew 100% that it was fake I'd be like fine whatever. No no even then would

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.920
 be a waste of time. But what I'm getting at I think just by this introduction you

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.600
 can kind of tell my relationship with Ouija boards. It's not a love-hate

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.160
 relationship. It's a don't-care-or-terrified relationship. And then I read

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.480
 these articles and I realize again why I don't mess with Ouija boards. Why I

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.920
 don't mess with Ouija boards at all. Let's go ahead. Put my fears aside.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.960
 You may be fine with them. But let's put our fear aside. Climb into the dead

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.560
 rabbit-durgible. And we're gonna leave wherever we just were. We're gonna leave

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.840
 Virginia. And as we're flying away we hear the guy going I swear God it was

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:19.360
 an accident. It was an accident. Officer yuck yuck. And we're flying away. And we're

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.760
 going to Prescott Arizona. We're actually also going back in time to the

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.640
 year 1933. So it's just everything's super dusty. People are sepia toned. There's

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.120
 not a lot of food. The music sucks. It's a terrible terrible time to be alive. The

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.880
 only good thing about being alive in the 1930s is knowing like let's say you were

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:47.080
 20 in the 30s. You would be 50 by the time the 50s rolled around. Is my math

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.760
 right? No you'd be 40. Like you would the only good thing about being alive in the

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.440
 30s is knowing eventually you would like get to see like the Beatles and Elvis

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.720
 show up. If you were elderly in the 30s you were you were SOL. That would be the

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.400
 worst thing to be. But anyways we're going back to 1933. And we're going to

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:11.800
 meet a mother and her teenage daughter. The mother is Dorothea Irene Turley. That

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:17.360
 is an old name. And if you thought that name was super old her daughter's name is

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.440
 Maddie. I actually know a girl named Maddie and she's kind of cool. She's a

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:27.160
 little weird. But she'll sue me now. But anyways so Maddie I've known modern day

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.400
 Maddie's. But Dorothea I'd never. Dorothea is on the border of straight up

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.320
 calling someone diarrhea or Dorothea diarrhea. Like it's right on that board.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.920
 Sorry if I have a listener named Dorothea. Anyways so Dorothea was a regular

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.720
 user of a Ouija board. She loved the Ouija board. It was something that she used all

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.360
 the time. They were sold as both products of entertainment and a way to

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.040
 contact the debt. But like anything some people take it super super seriously.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.960
 Video games are meant to be an entertaining distraction slash art

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.560
 form to some. But some people like that's all they ever do. This was her

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.080
 Super Smash Brothers. This Ouija board thing. And she's sitting there with the

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.000
 Ouija board one day and her and her teenage daughter are playing it. There's dust

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.240
 everywhere. They have to keep dusting off the Ouija board and they're really

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.960
 hungry. They got no food. But they do have this form of entertainment. They're

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.800
 playing the Ouija board. And the Ouija board for whatever reason spells out for

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:29.960
 Maddie to kill her father. Now if it's fake. Not the story. The story is real. But

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.200
 again if the Ouija board's fake it's super easy to manipulate people with

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.000
 these things as well. If Dorothea wanted her husband dead for whatever reason it

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.360
 would be easy to make it go to kill daddy or whatever like that. But that wasn't

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:48.800
 the argument here. At the time Dorothea just goes Maddie you have to do what the

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.000
 board says. And Maddie's like I don't know about that. And her quote Dorothea's

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.160
 quote was the board cannot be denied. Almost like a religious text. A voice

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.960
 from beyond telling them what to do. So Maddie goes we need to double check this.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.560
 There has to be a way to verify this. Should we pray? And Dorothea's like no no no.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:14.600
 I have these spirit cards we'll use. I'll use these spirit cards to see if this is

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.560
 the right path of action. I don't know what they were. It could have been some

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.760
 spin-off of the Ouija board. It could be a variation to tarot cards. But anyways

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.920
 they would consult their spirit cards and it confirmed that Maddie had to kill

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:32.680
 her father. Now her father is milking the cows at this time. Like it's in the

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:38.120
 middle it's either early morning or mid-afternoon. Because it's farm time.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.680
 This isn't late at night. He's not out of the bar or something like that. He's

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:47.040
 getting milk so the family can survive. And as he walks up he gets these two

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.480
 pails of milk. And he's like mm-hmm. Can't wait to drink this cow pus. This

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.640
 unpasteurized cow pus. He's carrying in the looking at how delicious it is. It's

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.480
 all clumpy. His daughter grabs the shotgun and is walking behind him. And he

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.360
 does... I mean dude it's a farm. People are carrying shotguns all the time. He's not

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.520
 even really thinking why does my daughter have a shotgun. Imagine you

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.720
 right now walking on the street and you turn around and one of your relatives is

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.240
 carrying a shotgun behind you. You'd be very very worried. But back then everyone

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.200
 had shotguns. He's walking and he sees his daughter behind him with the shotgun.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.280
 Doesn't think twice about it. But suddenly gets two shotgun blasts through

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.160
 the back. He drops dead. And it doesn't really say how the police get involved in

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.960
 this. So maybe they noticed he was missing. I don't think the family would

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.800
 report it. But anyways the cops get involved and they arrest them. And at

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.920
 first the daughter, Maddie, says it was an accident. I was walking with the shotgun

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.520
 and I tripped and I fell and I shot him twice. And the cops go "that's a good

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.440
 story. It's a good story kid." But both shotgun blasts were in the exact same

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.260
 spot. So you would have had to shoot and then re-aim it and shoot again. Like the

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.680
 recoil. And she's like "uhh, dad nab it. Physics! Physics got me again." So then the

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.440
 story came out about... Then she goes "well my mom told me to because the Ouija board

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.980
 told her to." And it was this whole thing. So the police started to think that she

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.280
 wanted the husband dead. But Dorothy is like "no no no no no. The Ouija board made

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.380
 us. The Ouija board made us. I never wanted him dead but the Ouija board told

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.360
 me to and the board can't be denied. That's actually not a good defense in

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.780
 court." But what happened to these people? Maddie, young teenage Maddie, was sent to a

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.320
 reform school. That was it. One of those like hard-ass reform schools you see in

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.540
 those 70s exploitation films. But this one was in the 30s. So again just a

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.360
 dusty version of how much a girl's sitting around smoking cigarettes. She did

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.820
 that. The mom got sentenced to 15 years to life but that ruling got overturned on

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:50.540
 appeal. And she walked. Both people really didn't pay for the crime and it was all

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.820
 because the Ouija board. They blew this dude away. Super bizarre. I would just

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.900
 imagine... I just imagined that they got found guilty and then the appeal judge

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.140
 goes "I don't know what to do. I don't know if she should be let go. Let me

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.060
 consult my Ouija board." The Ouija board's like "let her go, let her go. Also kill your

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.680
 husband." And the circle continues. But that's not the only... There's actually

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.980
 quite a few deaths by Ouija boards. I found them in this article from Mysterious

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.720
 Universe's website, which is a great website. But these are the two most

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.560
 interesting ones. So the next one, if you want to read the other four, I mean

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.600
 there's a ton of them, but these are the two that I thought were the most

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.040
 interesting. Let's hop back into the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're going to Minko,

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.360
 Oklahoma. We're going to your 2001. So we're gonna forget all that old-timey

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.500
 superstitious nonsense. This is new timey superstitious nonsense. This is 2001.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.620
 This is February. And these people are sitting in this house in Oklahoma and

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:48.060
 they're playing with their Ouija board. Now this one we have a whole new group of

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:53.980
 characters. We have Carol. She's a grandma. She's 53 years old. You have her

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.620
 adult daughter Tammy and then you have a 10 year old granddaughter and a 15 year

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.580
 old granddaughter. And it's late one night and they're playing the Ouija board.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.920
 Now again, Carol absolutely loved the Ouija board. This was her Grand Theft Auto 5.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.800
 This is what she lived for. She's playing it all the time. They're sitting

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.000
 around having fun with this Ouija board. And this night they get a particular

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.400
 message. This story is weird, by the way. If you thought the first one was just like

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.360
 oh maybe she tried murdering because she wanted to get out of marriage. This one

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.400
 is straight up bizarre. They're playing with the Ouija board. And Tammy's husband

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:36.260
 is asleep in the bedroom playing with the Ouija board. And the Ouija board spells

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:42.120
 out to kill Tammy's husband, Brian. The family just kind of sits there for a

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.440
 second. It's at night. Candles going. Spooky time. They're having fun and it

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.220
 says to kill Brian. And Carol sitting there looking at the Ouija board. She

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:57.700
 stands up, goes into the kitchen, gets a knife. Now Tammy and the granddaughters

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.760
 are sitting in this room as Carol's doing this. They watch her go into the

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:08.340
 kitchen, grab a knife, go into the bedroom where Brian is asleep. Tammy and her

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:14.160
 daughters are sitting in this living room here. They hear Brian cry out for help

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:23.180
 suddenly. "Help me! Help me!" And they just sit there and do nothing until he

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:31.820
 stops moaning in pain and dies. So Carol then comes out of the bedroom with the

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:37.540
 knife and tries to attack the 15 year old granddaughter. And at this point Tammy

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.340
 wrestles the knife away from her. She's 53 years old. She's a grandma. I'm pretty

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.040
 sure her daughter could take her, but she gets the knife away from the grandma

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.640
 and says we have to go. We have to go. We have to go because now they are kind of

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.840
 snapping out of it. There is a dead body. There is a murder victim in the next

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.040
 room that the grandma just killed. So all the girls, and this is again, is such a

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.720
 weird detail. All the girls pile into the car and they let the grandma drive. The

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.680
 woman who just killed a dude, they go, "You drive! You drive shotgun!" and the mom

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.600
 hops into the passenger seat. Crazy grandma gets in the driver's seat. They

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.540
 start driving on the road and almost immediately Carol, the grandma, crashes

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:18.140
 the car in a street pole with the intent of killing all of them in a car

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:24.180
 accident. It doesn't work, but she breaks both of her ankles. She then hobbles out

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.900
 of the car. Everyone hobbles out of the car at that point because it's a smoking

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.980
 mess. She hobbles out of the car, walks up to her 15 year old granddaughter and

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:37.540
 is like, "Ugh!" and she pushes her 15 year old granddaughter into incoming

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.480
 traffic almost getting hit by a car. At that point, the grandma takes off

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.200
 through the forest. When the cops find her a couple hours later, both ankles are

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:51.920
 still broken. She's totally naked in the middle of the woods. No drugs or alcohol

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.760
 in her system. No history of mental illness. No history of like high stress.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.120
 No domestic strife in the house. She just completely broke that night because of

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.160
 one message in the Ouija board and she was sentenced to a psychiatric hospital.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.060
 And it's funny because as I was telling that story, I realized I didn't

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.620
 verify any of that. I got all of that stuff from one website. So I'm gonna take

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.900
 a quick break here. I'm gonna make sure this story is true. Hold on one second.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:23.380
 Yeah, totally true. Just looked it up. Actually happened. It's so funny because

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.100
 as I was reading that, I was like, "This sounds too good to be true." When I was

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.660
 doing the research, sometimes I get caught up in the research and it's not

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.580
 until I start talking about it out loud that I go, "Hmm, that sounds a little

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:42.040
 weird." Nope, totally true. Tons of news articles on actual news websites, local

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.440
 news websites talking about this murder. It's weird because I had never heard of

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.680
 it and you think it would be something that is more well known. A Ouija board

00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:01.640
 driving a woman to kill fairly recently within our lifetimes. A woman who by all

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:09.100
 accounts was totally normal before this night getting a message and murdering a

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.780
 person and then attempting to murder other people and then running away with

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:18.500
 broken feet and then finding her naked in the middle of the woods. We talk about

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:24.560
 on this show. We talk about portals and haunted places and cursed places and

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:31.460
 things like that. But there's something uniquely terrifying about being able to

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:36.740
 curse the place you're in right now, almost by accident. Accidents have kind

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.180
 of been a big theme this episode, but I don't think when I think at the very

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.160
 most Carol and Tammy and the granddaughters thought this was a fun

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:52.980
 game that they talked to spooky ghosts. But the idea of it inviting in some sort

00:23:52.980 --> 00:24:00.320
 of malevolent demon into that house that prompts this insane series of events

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.700
 that took place over the course of maybe what a half hour if that to go from a

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:11.140
 loving family to a murder. Tammy was actually accused of accessory to murder

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.540
 because helping the grandma kind of get away but those charges were dropped. But

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:22.060
 to go from a peaceful family environment to a murder, a getaway, multiple

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.020
 attempted murders and then someone doing what would seem to be physically

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:32.600
 impossible, running out into the dark night with broken legs, stripping their

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.680
 clothes off as they run wild through the forest and dark branches scratching

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:42.200
 their skin. What was her, what was she going through mentally? What visions and

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.400
 things were she seen in her head? And the thing is, is like I honestly don't

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:51.440
 know which version of this story is scarier. We have a version where a

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.420
 family's playing with the Ouija board at night, it's dark, the candles are lit, and

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:03.260
 somewhere in those shadows something is opened. And a dark force, a demon, is

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.220
 crawling through the darkness of the living room towards Carol. It's unseen

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.500
 to the rest of the family. They're just having fun with this game and this

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:21.780
 creature is creeping up behind them. A shadow in a world of shadows and it

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:33.000
 creeps up her back and crawls into her brain and turns her into a murderer. Or

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.680
 none of that happened but a totally perfectly normal human being who never

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:48.580
 committed a violent act in their life snapped and murdered a man in cold

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:55.020
 blood. I don't know which one's scarier because you can avoid playing with

00:25:55.020 --> 00:26:00.940
 Ouija boards and not having to worry about that fidgety creature standing in

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.500
 your closet waiting for you to turn your back before it gets you. You can avoid

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:13.120
 doing that but can you avoid simply going insane one day? Can you avoid living a

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:19.840
 perfectly normal life? Getting married, having kids, having grandkids, birthday

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:26.520
 parties, anniversaries, retirements, and then one day you're plunging a knife into

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:34.520
 a man's chest. One requires some sort of belief in the spiritual and the other

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:42.320
 one simply requires belief that humans can hide deep, deep evil and they don't

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.220
 need a Ouija board to access it.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.340

 Meet Zack. His work-life balance is anything but balanced but when he gets

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:25.360
 on the bike he becomes Zen Zack. Zen Zack exists outside of time. His heartbeat

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:31.820
 sounds like a melodrum circle. The only notification he hears is the sound of

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.860
 the ocean so if you want to reach him talk to the ocean. Zen Zack is so Zen

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:40.900
 because he has 24/7 expert claim service with Geico which is totally chill.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.780
 Geico motorcycle, expert coverage for both your sides.
