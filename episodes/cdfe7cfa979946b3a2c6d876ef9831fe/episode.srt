1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 What happens when your alibi is the worst alibi ever?

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,660
 And then we take a look at a topic that's particularly scary to me and one of the

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,120
 reasons why I'll never use them. We're gonna look at murders caused by Ouija

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,300
 boards today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,800
 [Music]

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,040
 host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,520
 You know, I had this girl come over yesterday and she fengshui'd my apartment.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,680
 She came over and she's like, "Move this here and move that there and do this and

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,440
 do that." And you're thinking, "Why'd you let her boss you around for four hours

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,200
 right after you got off work?" Well, she brought a vacuum cleaner and a bunch of

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,800
 cleaning supplies. She could have turned the place into an ISIS training camp for

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,040
 all I cared. She brought a vacuum cleaner. The place looks... the place is spotless.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,860
 Well, little little asterisks next to that. The living room, kitchen, that whole area

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,120
 is spotless. I got to move some boxes around my bedroom, but yeah. I was just

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,440
 like, "Do whatever. I don't care." And she's like, "Can I move this?" I was like, "I don't care."

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,800
 She's like, "What if this one here I go, I don't care. I go, I really don't care. I'm

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,360
 not like totally picky about where stuff goes." But she wanted to just fengshui'd

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,160
 it up. It looks great. She even made a little corner. She's like, "Here, let's put

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,600
 this pillow down on the ground." So when girls come over, there's supposed to be a

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,720
 girl spot and I'm like, "That looks creepy." I said, "If a sheriff walked into my

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,760
 apartment and saw what you set up right over there, he would have put me in handcuffs."

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,480
 So that's the one thing I said I don't want. And I also said, "Don't touch my

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,600
 mic. Don't go anywhere near my mic. I don't want you even in that corner of the

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,160
 room." And every so often she'd be kind of walking around and she'd get over there

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,440
 and I'd be like, "Huh?" She's like, "Oh, oh, sorry." But thanks for coming over and

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,120
 totally cleaning my apartment. You know how many times I've tried kidding women to

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,000
 do that. They'll come over and let me do all sorts of horrible things to them, but

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,120
 ask them to take the garbage out when they leave and they're like shocked that

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,720
 I would dare do a thing. And then this girl, just a friend of mine, comes over

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,640
 and busts ass on a Sunday. Just cleaned it all up. So thank you. Not gonna use your

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,200
 real name, but thank you, young maiden, for fengshui in my place. And we'll see

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,280
 if it works. It's definitely worth... At one point I flipped a carpet over

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
 because we couldn't vacuum it. It was too shaggy because my apartment is kind of

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,760
 like a combination of floor rugs. And I flipped it over and about $3 and change

36
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,200
 fell out of it. I go with that. It was almost like opening up a portal to another

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,520
 dimension. I didn't even know change could stick to a carpet, but apparently it

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,240
 can. Anyways, thank you for fengshui in my apartment. Anyway, okay, so, but let's go

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,160
 ahead and move on to our first story. Now, our first story, let's take a little trip.

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,080
 Let's take a trip to a police investigation room. Interrogation room,

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,480
 that's the word I'm looking for, interrogation room. We are in Washington

42
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,280
 Canyon, Virginia. And there's two police detectives sitting around. Do cops still

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,840
 smoke cigarettes? I guess they probably can't smoke in doors either. But there are

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,440
 two cops with nicotine patches sitting in this interrogation room. And there's

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,080
 this 23-year-old kid sitting across the table from them. His name is James Michael

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,800
 Wright. It was very, very recent. This just came out in the news. So James is sitting

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,880
 there at the table. Two cops are sitting there chewing nicotine gum. Got some

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,600
 losanges in there as well. And so the cops are like, "James, you just have to tell us

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,880
 why you did it." James is just sitting there and he goes, "I told you guys. I told

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,600
 you guys a hundred times. It was an accident. It was an accident. Why won't

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,320
 you believe me?" And the two cops look at each other and they go, "You accidentally

52
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,920
 murdered a person." James is like, "Yes! Thank you! I'm so glad you finally got it."

53
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,040
 And then the cops go, "You accidentally murdered three people on three separate

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,920
 occasions." And he goes, "Finally, thank you. In this nightmare end, do you believe me

55
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,720
 now?" James Michael Wright is a carny, or was a carny. He may... This is all a legend,

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,760
 but anyways, he was a carny. He worked for this traveling carnival, which of

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,440
 course is like the most stereotypical occupation for a serial killer, other than

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,480
 just putting on your resume serial killer. So he's a carny and people started

59
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,240
 noticing that he was hanging out with these young women and they weren't coming

60
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,400
 back. They were disappearing. One of them was related to one of his coworkers at

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,040
 the carnival and then other ones were like girls that he met at the carnival.

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
 But what happened was he got on a car accident. The cops had actually been

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,040
 looking for him, but when he got on a car accident, the cops are like, "Oh, now we

64
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,320
 know where he's at. He's in the hospital." So they went to the hospital to

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,800
 interviewed him and they started asking him about these girls that he was with.

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,960
 So the first victim, no, not victim, the first person who had an accident was that

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,440
 it was February 28th, 2019, so very, very recent, February 28th. James says, "Okay,

68
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,400
 listen, I was dating this girl and we did get a bit in a fight and during the

69
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,280
 fight, I accidentally shot her and then a barrister body by my house." And the cops

70
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,960
 are like, "That is completely ridiculous." He's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on."

71
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,280
 So yes, it does sound a little convenient that I did happen to be engaged in a

72
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,520
 fight with somebody and then I accidentally shot them, but it can happen.

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,160
 Accidents happen. That's what we all know, right? And the cops are like, "Oh my god."

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,480
 In March 9th, so what is that? Well, that's easy to do. Nine days later. March 9th,

75
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,840
 he's having sex with this other girl in the middle of the woods and everything's

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,520
 fine. There's no fight, no problem at all. So, and after they're done having sex,

77
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,120
 after they're done with the love-making session, James and the woman get up and

78
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,640
 start walking through the forest and he sees an animal run by and he pulled a

79
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,680
 swears to God, "This is what happened." He sees an animal run by. He pulls his gun

80
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,880
 out to shoot the animal. The animal is moving so fast and as he continues to

81
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,280
 aim his gun right when he thinks he can shoot the animal, the gun is aiming at

82
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,320
 the back of the girl's head and he kills her. Total accident. He did not mean to

83
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,760
 kill her, but he's like, "Great. Nine, this happened nine days ago. I just

84
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,680
 accidentally killed someone and again I killed this person. This is terrible." He

85
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,960
 then hides her body underneath a log by his house. March 17th. How many days is

86
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,160
 that? It doesn't matter. What, two weeks since the last one? Now imagine if this

87
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,200
 guy's telling the truth. He's not, but imagine if this guy's telling the truth.

88
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,080
 How bad does your luck have to be to accidentally kill someone on the 28th?

89
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,360
 Because I could see you're getting in a fight and then maybe fighting over the

90
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,600
 gun or something stupid like that or you're in a fight and it's a crime of

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,520
 passion. I guess it's not really an accident, but to accidentally kill someone

92
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,920
 on the 20th of February, nine days later, you accidentally kill someone else. At

93
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,800
 this point, I would just become a hermit, not hang out with anyone. On March 17th,

94
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,240
 James is just on a walk, just on a nice nature stroll with this young woman. All

95
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,080
 these victims are like, I think the youngest one was 16 and the oldest one

96
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,880
 was in her like early 20s. They're all quite young. He's walking with this woman,

97
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,360
 enjoying the nature. They didn't have sex, they haven't been in a fight. He's

98
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,880
 thinking, he's in the clear. He's thinking there's not gonna be any

99
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,000
 accidents today. I'm not gonna instigate any way that I could possibly

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,200
 accidentally kill someone with this damn, damn gun and he pulls the gun out and

101
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,800
 he's looking at it and he trips on a log and she turns back to the head. And

102
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,640
 that's not it. Because then he's like, okay great, now I gotta get rid of this

103
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,280
 body. So he throws the body in the back of his pickup truck and while he's driving

104
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,120
 the pickup truck, the body accidentally, accidentally guys, police officers totally

105
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,600
 believe this, accidentally the body flew out of the back of his pickup truck into

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,600
 the river and I don't think they found her body yet. But so obviously the cops

107
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,240
 don't believe any of this, but the cops also have some other issues here. Their

108
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,080
 biggest one is he casually really killed three people in less than a month. Three

109
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,280
 women just shot him quote unquote accidentally. So now they're really

110
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,000
 thinking he was a carny, so that's incredibly suspicious, but he

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,960
 worked for a type of company that moved from region to region. So now police are

112
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,480
 having to go through every place that that carnival's been at with him and

113
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,760
 having to match up victim profiles and stuff like that. So definitely is

114
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,520
 considered a serial killer because he killed three women, but he may have

115
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,000
 killed a lot more. Hopefully not, hopefully not. I do though have to say I

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,680
 would have loved to just be in that interrogation room as he was valiantly

117
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,000
 trying to fight that. These were all accidents officer. These are all

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,240
 accidents. I totally didn't mean to do that. Here, give me your gun and I'll show

119
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,080
 you they're like no no no no. Just stay there and we don't believe you. We need

120
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,600
 some more nicotine. Let's go ahead and move on to our, why can't cops smoke in

121
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,720
 an interrogation room? Actually I'm kind of making this statement and I don't know

122
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,760
 maybe they can. I doubt it. I'm sure some lawyer would be like oh my god my

123
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,240
 asthma, but it's like that's very intimidating. Actually you know what I'm

124
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,760
 pretty sure they do smoke in interrogation rooms. I'm pretty sure they do, but they

125
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,440
 should if they don't they should be able to because if you don't like cigarette

126
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,160
 smoke, BFD dude you're in an interrogation room and if you don't mind

127
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,240
 smoke just like hey officer give me a cigarette and then you build that report.

128
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,240
 So I had to take a nicotine break after talking about all that stuff. Man being

129
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,000
 addicted to stuff sucks. But now we're gonna talk about me actually that is a

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,600
 great segue. We're gonna talk about being addicted to Ouija boards. So you know I

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,000
 have done it. I did a full episode I think or a full segment on Ouija boards a

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,480
 while back. Not a fan of them. I've never used them. I think either they're a waste

133
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,640
 of time because it's psychosomatic movement and it's just like a stupid

134
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,800
 parlor game and I don't care or they're real and a bunch of demons are gonna get

135
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,320
 me. Like there's it's one of the two. It's either a total waste of time and

136
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,280
 it's fake or it is actually opens up a gateway and I have better things to do

137
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,480
 with my time and I don't want giant gateways opened up. So I've always just

138
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,400
 kind of stayed away from them. Like my sister used to make them. She's not like

139
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,040
 she was woodcarver and stuff like that. She's like working for a factory. She

140
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,000
 would make them somehow. She'd make them on paper or some cutting board or

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,960
 something like that and whatever. I've never just really liked them. I've just

142
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,800
 never been. It's a combination of they're stupid and I'm scared of them. So I

143
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,000
 don't mess with them. It's funny because I'll do tarot cards and palm readings. I'll

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,520
 do tarot cards and I'll read palms. I'm not letting anyone else do that stuff

145
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,800
 because I know how the gimmick works. But you know I'm not gonna

146
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,160
 pay a psychic to do that stuff but I know how to do it myself. So I mean like

147
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,760
 stuff like that I'm fine with. I've never really done any sort of divination and

148
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,480
 any sort of mirror scrying or throwing chicken bones. None of that stuff. But I

149
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,360
 think that the risk reward is less. If I throw a couple chicken bones I'm just

150
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,800
 making my floor dirty and then I'll have this drunk come over and clean it up

151
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,120
 again. No that was a one-shot deal man. I don't think that that took a while.

152
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,200
 I hope for it to convince someone to do that. Actually she called me up and she

153
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,760
 goes hey I want to come over and punctuate your place. I've been thinking a lot

154
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,160
 about it. So you have to keep it clean. But anyways that aside it's just been

155
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,560
 something that I've always been really kind of like because I don't know. Like

156
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,120
 if I knew 100% that it was fake I'd be like fine whatever. No no even then would

157
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,920
 be a waste of time. But what I'm getting at I think just by this introduction you

158
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,600
 can kind of tell my relationship with Ouija boards. It's not a love-hate

159
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,160
 relationship. It's a don't-care-or-terrified relationship. And then I read

160
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,480
 these articles and I realize again why I don't mess with Ouija boards. Why I

161
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,920
 don't mess with Ouija boards at all. Let's go ahead. Put my fears aside.

162
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,960
 You may be fine with them. But let's put our fear aside. Climb into the dead

163
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,560
 rabbit-durgible. And we're gonna leave wherever we just were. We're gonna leave

164
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,840
 Virginia. And as we're flying away we hear the guy going I swear God it was

165
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,360
 an accident. It was an accident. Officer yuck yuck. And we're flying away. And we're

166
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,760
 going to Prescott Arizona. We're actually also going back in time to the

167
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,640
 year 1933. So it's just everything's super dusty. People are sepia toned. There's

168
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,120
 not a lot of food. The music sucks. It's a terrible terrible time to be alive. The

169
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,880
 only good thing about being alive in the 1930s is knowing like let's say you were

170
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,080
 20 in the 30s. You would be 50 by the time the 50s rolled around. Is my math

171
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,760
 right? No you'd be 40. Like you would the only good thing about being alive in the

172
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,440
 30s is knowing eventually you would like get to see like the Beatles and Elvis

173
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,720
 show up. If you were elderly in the 30s you were you were SOL. That would be the

174
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,400
 worst thing to be. But anyways we're going back to 1933. And we're going to

175
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,800
 meet a mother and her teenage daughter. The mother is Dorothea Irene Turley. That

176
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,360
 is an old name. And if you thought that name was super old her daughter's name is

177
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,440
 Maddie. I actually know a girl named Maddie and she's kind of cool. She's a

178
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,160
 little weird. But she'll sue me now. But anyways so Maddie I've known modern day

179
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,400
 Maddie's. But Dorothea I'd never. Dorothea is on the border of straight up

180
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,320
 calling someone diarrhea or Dorothea diarrhea. Like it's right on that board.

181
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,920
 Sorry if I have a listener named Dorothea. Anyways so Dorothea was a regular

182
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,720
 user of a Ouija board. She loved the Ouija board. It was something that she used all

183
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,360
 the time. They were sold as both products of entertainment and a way to

184
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,040
 contact the debt. But like anything some people take it super super seriously.

185
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,960
 Video games are meant to be an entertaining distraction slash art

186
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,560
 form to some. But some people like that's all they ever do. This was her

187
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,080
 Super Smash Brothers. This Ouija board thing. And she's sitting there with the

188
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,000
 Ouija board one day and her and her teenage daughter are playing it. There's dust

189
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,240
 everywhere. They have to keep dusting off the Ouija board and they're really

190
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,960
 hungry. They got no food. But they do have this form of entertainment. They're

191
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,800
 playing the Ouija board. And the Ouija board for whatever reason spells out for

192
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,960
 Maddie to kill her father. Now if it's fake. Not the story. The story is real. But

193
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,200
 again if the Ouija board's fake it's super easy to manipulate people with

194
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,000
 these things as well. If Dorothea wanted her husband dead for whatever reason it

195
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,360
 would be easy to make it go to kill daddy or whatever like that. But that wasn't

196
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,800
 the argument here. At the time Dorothea just goes Maddie you have to do what the

197
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,000
 board says. And Maddie's like I don't know about that. And her quote Dorothea's

198
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,160
 quote was the board cannot be denied. Almost like a religious text. A voice

199
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,960
 from beyond telling them what to do. So Maddie goes we need to double check this.

200
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,560
 There has to be a way to verify this. Should we pray? And Dorothea's like no no no.

201
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,600
 I have these spirit cards we'll use. I'll use these spirit cards to see if this is

202
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,560
 the right path of action. I don't know what they were. It could have been some

203
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,760
 spin-off of the Ouija board. It could be a variation to tarot cards. But anyways

204
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,920
 they would consult their spirit cards and it confirmed that Maddie had to kill

205
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,680
 her father. Now her father is milking the cows at this time. Like it's in the

206
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,120
 middle it's either early morning or mid-afternoon. Because it's farm time.

207
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,680
 This isn't late at night. He's not out of the bar or something like that. He's

208
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,040
 getting milk so the family can survive. And as he walks up he gets these two

209
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,480
 pails of milk. And he's like mm-hmm. Can't wait to drink this cow pus. This

210
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,640
 unpasteurized cow pus. He's carrying in the looking at how delicious it is. It's

211
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,480
 all clumpy. His daughter grabs the shotgun and is walking behind him. And he

212
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,360
 does... I mean dude it's a farm. People are carrying shotguns all the time. He's not

213
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,520
 even really thinking why does my daughter have a shotgun. Imagine you

214
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,720
 right now walking on the street and you turn around and one of your relatives is

215
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,240
 carrying a shotgun behind you. You'd be very very worried. But back then everyone

216
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,200
 had shotguns. He's walking and he sees his daughter behind him with the shotgun.

217
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,280
 Doesn't think twice about it. But suddenly gets two shotgun blasts through

218
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,160
 the back. He drops dead. And it doesn't really say how the police get involved in

219
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,960
 this. So maybe they noticed he was missing. I don't think the family would

220
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,800
 report it. But anyways the cops get involved and they arrest them. And at

221
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,920
 first the daughter, Maddie, says it was an accident. I was walking with the shotgun

222
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,520
 and I tripped and I fell and I shot him twice. And the cops go "that's a good

223
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,440
 story. It's a good story kid." But both shotgun blasts were in the exact same

224
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,260
 spot. So you would have had to shoot and then re-aim it and shoot again. Like the

225
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,680
 recoil. And she's like "uhh, dad nab it. Physics! Physics got me again." So then the

226
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,440
 story came out about... Then she goes "well my mom told me to because the Ouija board

227
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,980
 told her to." And it was this whole thing. So the police started to think that she

228
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,280
 wanted the husband dead. But Dorothy is like "no no no no no. The Ouija board made

229
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,380
 us. The Ouija board made us. I never wanted him dead but the Ouija board told

230
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,360
 me to and the board can't be denied. That's actually not a good defense in

231
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,780
 court." But what happened to these people? Maddie, young teenage Maddie, was sent to a

232
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,320
 reform school. That was it. One of those like hard-ass reform schools you see in

233
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,540
 those 70s exploitation films. But this one was in the 30s. So again just a

234
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,360
 dusty version of how much a girl's sitting around smoking cigarettes. She did

235
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,820
 that. The mom got sentenced to 15 years to life but that ruling got overturned on

236
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,540
 appeal. And she walked. Both people really didn't pay for the crime and it was all

237
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,820
 because the Ouija board. They blew this dude away. Super bizarre. I would just

238
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,900
 imagine... I just imagined that they got found guilty and then the appeal judge

239
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,140
 goes "I don't know what to do. I don't know if she should be let go. Let me

240
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,060
 consult my Ouija board." The Ouija board's like "let her go, let her go. Also kill your

241
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,680
 husband." And the circle continues. But that's not the only... There's actually

242
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,980
 quite a few deaths by Ouija boards. I found them in this article from Mysterious

243
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,720
 Universe's website, which is a great website. But these are the two most

244
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,560
 interesting ones. So the next one, if you want to read the other four, I mean

245
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,600
 there's a ton of them, but these are the two that I thought were the most

246
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,040
 interesting. Let's hop back into the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're going to Minko,

247
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,360
 Oklahoma. We're going to your 2001. So we're gonna forget all that old-timey

248
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,500
 superstitious nonsense. This is new timey superstitious nonsense. This is 2001.

249
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,620
 This is February. And these people are sitting in this house in Oklahoma and

250
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,060
 they're playing with their Ouija board. Now this one we have a whole new group of

251
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,980
 characters. We have Carol. She's a grandma. She's 53 years old. You have her

252
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,620
 adult daughter Tammy and then you have a 10 year old granddaughter and a 15 year

253
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,580
 old granddaughter. And it's late one night and they're playing the Ouija board.

254
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,920
 Now again, Carol absolutely loved the Ouija board. This was her Grand Theft Auto 5.

255
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,800
 This is what she lived for. She's playing it all the time. They're sitting

256
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,000
 around having fun with this Ouija board. And this night they get a particular

257
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,400
 message. This story is weird, by the way. If you thought the first one was just like

258
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,360
 oh maybe she tried murdering because she wanted to get out of marriage. This one

259
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,400
 is straight up bizarre. They're playing with the Ouija board. And Tammy's husband

260
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:36,260
 is asleep in the bedroom playing with the Ouija board. And the Ouija board spells

261
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:42,120
 out to kill Tammy's husband, Brian. The family just kind of sits there for a

262
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,440
 second. It's at night. Candles going. Spooky time. They're having fun and it

263
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,220
 says to kill Brian. And Carol sitting there looking at the Ouija board. She

264
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,700
 stands up, goes into the kitchen, gets a knife. Now Tammy and the granddaughters

265
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,760
 are sitting in this room as Carol's doing this. They watch her go into the

266
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,340
 kitchen, grab a knife, go into the bedroom where Brian is asleep. Tammy and her

267
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:14,160
 daughters are sitting in this living room here. They hear Brian cry out for help

268
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:23,180
 suddenly. "Help me! Help me!" And they just sit there and do nothing until he

269
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:31,820
 stops moaning in pain and dies. So Carol then comes out of the bedroom with the

270
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,540
 knife and tries to attack the 15 year old granddaughter. And at this point Tammy

271
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,340
 wrestles the knife away from her. She's 53 years old. She's a grandma. I'm pretty

272
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,040
 sure her daughter could take her, but she gets the knife away from the grandma

273
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,640
 and says we have to go. We have to go. We have to go because now they are kind of

274
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,840
 snapping out of it. There is a dead body. There is a murder victim in the next

275
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,040
 room that the grandma just killed. So all the girls, and this is again, is such a

276
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,720
 weird detail. All the girls pile into the car and they let the grandma drive. The

277
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,680
 woman who just killed a dude, they go, "You drive! You drive shotgun!" and the mom

278
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,600
 hops into the passenger seat. Crazy grandma gets in the driver's seat. They

279
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,540
 start driving on the road and almost immediately Carol, the grandma, crashes

280
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,140
 the car in a street pole with the intent of killing all of them in a car

281
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:24,180
 accident. It doesn't work, but she breaks both of her ankles. She then hobbles out

282
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,900
 of the car. Everyone hobbles out of the car at that point because it's a smoking

283
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,980
 mess. She hobbles out of the car, walks up to her 15 year old granddaughter and

284
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,540
 is like, "Ugh!" and she pushes her 15 year old granddaughter into incoming

285
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,480
 traffic almost getting hit by a car. At that point, the grandma takes off

286
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,200
 through the forest. When the cops find her a couple hours later, both ankles are

287
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,920
 still broken. She's totally naked in the middle of the woods. No drugs or alcohol

288
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,760
 in her system. No history of mental illness. No history of like high stress.

289
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,120
 No domestic strife in the house. She just completely broke that night because of

290
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,160
 one message in the Ouija board and she was sentenced to a psychiatric hospital.

291
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,060
 And it's funny because as I was telling that story, I realized I didn't

292
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,620
 verify any of that. I got all of that stuff from one website. So I'm gonna take

293
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,900
 a quick break here. I'm gonna make sure this story is true. Hold on one second.

294
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,380
 Yeah, totally true. Just looked it up. Actually happened. It's so funny because

295
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,100
 as I was reading that, I was like, "This sounds too good to be true." When I was

296
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,660
 doing the research, sometimes I get caught up in the research and it's not

297
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,580
 until I start talking about it out loud that I go, "Hmm, that sounds a little

298
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:42,040
 weird." Nope, totally true. Tons of news articles on actual news websites, local

299
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,440
 news websites talking about this murder. It's weird because I had never heard of

300
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,680
 it and you think it would be something that is more well known. A Ouija board

301
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:01,640
 driving a woman to kill fairly recently within our lifetimes. A woman who by all

302
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:09,100
 accounts was totally normal before this night getting a message and murdering a

303
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,780
 person and then attempting to murder other people and then running away with

304
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,500
 broken feet and then finding her naked in the middle of the woods. We talk about

305
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,560
 on this show. We talk about portals and haunted places and cursed places and

306
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:31,460
 things like that. But there's something uniquely terrifying about being able to

307
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,740
 curse the place you're in right now, almost by accident. Accidents have kind

308
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,180
 of been a big theme this episode, but I don't think when I think at the very

309
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,160
 most Carol and Tammy and the granddaughters thought this was a fun

310
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:52,980
 game that they talked to spooky ghosts. But the idea of it inviting in some sort

311
00:23:52,980 --> 00:24:00,320
 of malevolent demon into that house that prompts this insane series of events

312
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,700
 that took place over the course of maybe what a half hour if that to go from a

313
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,140
 loving family to a murder. Tammy was actually accused of accessory to murder

314
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,540
 because helping the grandma kind of get away but those charges were dropped. But

315
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:22,060
 to go from a peaceful family environment to a murder, a getaway, multiple

316
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,020
 attempted murders and then someone doing what would seem to be physically

317
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:32,600
 impossible, running out into the dark night with broken legs, stripping their

318
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,680
 clothes off as they run wild through the forest and dark branches scratching

319
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:42,200
 their skin. What was her, what was she going through mentally? What visions and

320
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,400
 things were she seen in her head? And the thing is, is like I honestly don't

321
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,440
 know which version of this story is scarier. We have a version where a

322
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,420
 family's playing with the Ouija board at night, it's dark, the candles are lit, and

323
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:03,260
 somewhere in those shadows something is opened. And a dark force, a demon, is

324
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:08,220
 crawling through the darkness of the living room towards Carol. It's unseen

325
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,500
 to the rest of the family. They're just having fun with this game and this

326
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:21,780
 creature is creeping up behind them. A shadow in a world of shadows and it

327
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:33,000
 creeps up her back and crawls into her brain and turns her into a murderer. Or

328
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,680
 none of that happened but a totally perfectly normal human being who never

329
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,580
 committed a violent act in their life snapped and murdered a man in cold

330
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,020
 blood. I don't know which one's scarier because you can avoid playing with

331
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,940
 Ouija boards and not having to worry about that fidgety creature standing in

332
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,500
 your closet waiting for you to turn your back before it gets you. You can avoid

333
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:13,120
 doing that but can you avoid simply going insane one day? Can you avoid living a

334
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,840
 perfectly normal life? Getting married, having kids, having grandkids, birthday

335
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,520
 parties, anniversaries, retirements, and then one day you're plunging a knife into

336
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:34,520
 a man's chest. One requires some sort of belief in the spiritual and the other

337
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:42,320
 one simply requires belief that humans can hide deep, deep evil and they don't

338
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,220
 need a Ouija board to access it.

339
