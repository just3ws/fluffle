1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,280
 What happens when the world of true crime and perverts collide?

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,760
 It makes a big mess.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,040
 And then, and then we take a look at the story of a man

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,040
 who loved drugs so much, he turned himself into one today

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,080
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,660
 (upbeat music)

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,800
 (upbeat music)

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,420
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,500
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,580
 I'm your host Jason Carvener.

24
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,860
 I'm having a great day.

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,060
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

26
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,380
 Hope you guys had a great weekend.

27
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,020
 It's actually still Thursday for me here.

28
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,820
 I'm recording some episodes up,

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,700
 so I can take a little vacation this weekend.

30
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,660
 I'm just gonna read.

31
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,140
 Just gonna spend the whole weekend reading

32
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,500
 and getting stuff ready for future episodes

33
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,700
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

34
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,340
 And we couldn't have future episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio

35
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,940
 without people who support the show.

36
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,260
 And speaking of supporters right now,

37
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,580
 there's a little red dot on my chest.

38
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,460
 It's moving around.

39
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,860
 Give a round of applause for the man

40
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,700
 who's about to shoot me.

41
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,940
 It's Sniper.

42
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,020
 Sniper is our newest Patreon supporter.

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,860
 Sniper, go ahead.

44
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,980
 You don't have to shoot me.

45
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,820
 You don't have to shoot me.

46
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,860
 Come on down from your perch.

47
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,940
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

48
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,180
 You guys can't support the Patreon.

49
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,220
 I totally understand.

50
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,460
 Another great way to help support the show

51
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,020
 is to spread the word.

52
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,420
 Let your friends, family, and coworkers know about the show.

53
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,060
 That also really ensures the future of the show.

54
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,820
 So Sniper, go ahead and take off your night vision goggles

55
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,540
 'cause we're gonna do some day driving.

56
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,780
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy

57
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,340
 and we are going to head on out too.

58
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,580
 New Orleans in Louisiana.

59
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,420
 (car horn honks)

60
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,580
 Cars driving down the road.

61
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,860
 You know, every show often,

62
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,940
 I get the criticism about the show.

63
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,500
 That people go, the show used to be better.

64
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,300
 The show used to be better back the first 50 episodes

65
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,140
 or better or whatever.

66
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,340
 And that's fine.

67
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,700
 I can take criticism, but I don't understand.

68
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,100
 I think there's a kind of a difference between

69
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,700
 what the show is and how some people view it.

70
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,140
 It's like a news show.

71
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,980
 I report the stories that are presented to me,

72
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,820
 either that I find or people recommend.

73
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,500
 And whenever I hear that criticism

74
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,420
 or that it's not really a criticism,

75
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,620
 it's just that that's their opinion.

76
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,320
 To me, it's the same thing as if you walked up

77
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,260
 to a journalist and said,

78
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,220
 "Hey man, I really like the news better."

79
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,660
 Back on September 11th.

80
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,620
 It was super exciting.

81
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,180
 I was glued to my television for like two weeks.

82
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,980
 September 11th, 2001.

83
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,580
 How come you don't do news like that anymore?

84
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,180
 Journalists would go, because thankfully,

85
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,540
 it doesn't happen that much or at all, nothing that big.

86
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,480
 So it's the same thing.

87
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,620
 The show is the stories that are presented to me.

88
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,580
 So yeah, sure, I had like ageless travel back then.

89
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,540
 The ocean at night.

90
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,980
 I had some classic episodes, but I don't do ARGs.

91
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,260
 I really don't, I'll touch on creepypastas every once

92
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,100
 in a while.

93
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,420
 I do the stories that I find,

94
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,820
 and I generally do them while I find them.

95
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,180
 That again, and it's a valid opinion,

96
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,580
 but I just think there's a disconnect

97
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,580
 between what the show is.

98
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,820
 And I think people do kind of confuse it sometimes

99
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,900
 with shows that cover ARGs

100
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,300
 or like these long myth building episodes

101
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
 and things like that.

102
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,980
 That being said,

103
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,820
 (laughs)

104
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,140
 that all being said,

105
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,220
 Sniper, go ahead and pull outside of this house

106
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,780
 in New Orleans, Louisiana, the year is 2019.

107
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,940
 And there's a young babysitter walking into a house.

108
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,500
 Now, apparently there's a thing called a babysitter app

109
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,760
 where you can pull, it sounds like something

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,860
 a serial killer would design, right?

111
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,140
 It's like Grubhub, but for serial killers,

112
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,900
 you can order babysitters to come to your house.

113
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,220
 That's terrifying.

114
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,260
 Why would anyone create this app or use this app?

115
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,500
 But apparently there are babysitter apps

116
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,380
 where you can order babysitters.

117
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,420
 They're so, so spooky.

118
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,700
 There's this guy, his name is Rutledge Diaz IV.

119
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,540
 He's 29 years old and he has a younger brother named Corey,

120
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,740
 17 year old younger brother,

121
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,100
 who unfortunately severely disabled.

122
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,060
 He can't bathe himself, he has to wear a diaper,

123
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,500
 he can't really go anywhere,

124
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,420
 he's just this disabled dude

125
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,260
 who's like mentally disabled and physically disabled.

126
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,820
 And Rutledge can't really take care of him,

127
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,620
 so he calls up his Grubhub for babysitters

128
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,060
 and orders a babysitter.

129
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,140
 I can't even say without laughing,

130
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,260
 it sounds like something.

131
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,260
 Dracula would use.

132
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,700
 Rutledge though is not Dracula,

133
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,860
 he has this babysitter come to take care

134
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,780
 of his younger brother Corey,

135
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,340
 'cause he has to make money.

136
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,900
 Babysitters aren't free.

137
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,220
 So using this app,

138
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,180
 Corey is actually able to get the help that he needs.

139
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,660
 So I mean, he's 17 years old,

140
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,580
 he's almost an adult physically,

141
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,660
 so you have to carry him around, he's pretty heavy.

142
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,060
 I'm complaining about it,

143
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,340
 that's why I'm not a babysitter.

144
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,700
 I'm like, aw, it sucks.

145
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,340
 You're too heavy, lose some weight.

146
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,180
 You have to carry him around,

147
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,060
 they have this giant car seat for him to go in,

148
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,900
 they pick him up, put him in the car seat,

149
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,020
 drive around town, maybe he just likes to like,

150
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,260
 look out the window, it doesn't say,

151
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,380
 they just say that he has a giant car seat.

152
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,940
 I don't know why that details in the story,

153
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,020
 but I just find it amusing.

154
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,380
 And he wears diapers all the time.

155
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,940
 Now, he's constantly pooping his diapers,

156
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,300
 and he can't get mad at them, right?

157
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,260
 He doesn't know any better.

158
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,940
 Babies like has the mind of a baby.

159
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,860
 Babies don't know better,

160
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,380
 he's constantly pooping his diaper.

161
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,180
 But there's a lot of babysitters that use this app,

162
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,700
 there's a lot of babysitters that take care of Corey,

163
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,220
 kind of gets known in town that

164
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,820
 Corey can be a little difficult,

165
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,460
 but overall, he's probably a good guy.

166
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,260
 November 13th, 2019.

167
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,300
 Police, we have a warrant!

168
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,940
 They kicked down his door.

169
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,460
 Rutledge Diaz is like, what's going on, what's going on?

170
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,700
 Cops come storming, I don't know if it was that dramatic.

171
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,660
 He just knocked and he opened the door.

172
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,500
 But in my version, breaking through windows

173
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,940
 and knocking over piles of diapers

174
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,300
 and making a little barricade,

175
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,420
 Rutledge is hiding behind a giant car seat.

176
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,020
 What do you officers want?

177
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,700
 There is no Corey, apparently.

178
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,740
 Doesn't exist, it's not like,

179
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,780
 it's not like Joker's fake girlfriend

180
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,820
 like all the babysitters just hallucinated this giant baby.

181
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,420
 Plot twist, Rutledge is Corey.

182
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,020
 Rutledge allegedly is a big old pervert.

183
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,020
 Definitely there's a heart allegedly on that one.

184
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,620
 Rutledge allegedly came up with this plan.

185
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,060
 I really, really like pooping my pants.

186
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,020
 And I bought this giant car seat

187
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,780
 and I don't know what to use it for.

188
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,100
 If only there was a way I could combine my love of pooping

189
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,060
 and being cleaned with this app that I discovered,

190
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,660
 that I could order women to come into my house.

191
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,900
 Aha, I have it.

192
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,180
 So he begins, as he's coming up with an idea,

193
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,060
 he's pooping his pants, he's like, aha.

194
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,860
 An idea has come to me instead of a light bulb,

195
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,060
 it's just a big brown load in his pants.

196
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,900
 He loves, again, this is all a legend.

197
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,100
 This last song will say it, but he loves pooping his pants.

198
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,540
 You definitely have to say allegedly before that.

199
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,300
 And he loves women cleaning it up.

200
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,980
 So he actually thought this would be a great idea

201
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,820
 to combine the two like Reese's Peanut Butter Cup,

202
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,100
 but you don't wanna know where the chocolate's coming from.

203
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,460
 Babysitters are constantly, this goes on for a while,

204
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,840
 but eventually one of them, she visited the house 10 times

205
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,560
 and she thought this doesn't,

206
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,940
 this seems a little suspicious.

207
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,300
 I went over to his house, I realized he was really good

208
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,700
 at Super Smash Brothers, but then like he's like,

209
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,620
 gaga-googoo, and he's pooping his pants.

210
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,100
 Like I thought it was bizarre,

211
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,900
 that he was able to make a martini,

212
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,660
 but I don't know, maybe that's the one thing

213
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,060
 this baby can do.

214
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,700
 So the cops do a rest of him,

215
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,500
 apparently in Louisiana, I did not know this.

216
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,220
 It's good to know if you live in Louisiana

217
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,060
 and you're thinking about being a criminal,

218
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,420
 if you commit labor fraud in Louisiana,

219
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,860
 basically if you hire someone under false pretenses,

220
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,620
 that's human trafficking, that's a 10 year charge.

221
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,100
 If you tell someone, hey, why don't you come over,

222
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,540
 I'll pay you to like wash my car and they get over there

223
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,260
 and you're like, oh no, I want you to paint my fence

224
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,340
 instead, Tom Sawyer?

225
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,580
 That would basically be human trafficking.

226
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,020
 He was facing 40 years in prison for this scheme.

227
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,400
 He was basically charged with sexual battery

228
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,420
 because while he was pooping his pants,

229
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,560
 the women were cleaning him

230
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,260
 and he was getting gratification from that.

231
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,900
 So that's where those charges came from.

232
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,380
 Got charged with four counts of human trafficking

233
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,140
 and one count of possession

234
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,660
 of a controlled dangerous substance.

235
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,460
 I'll give you one guess as to what drug he was on.

236
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,660
 So if you ever go over to a house

237
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,940
 and there's a giant baby smoking meth,

238
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,780
 could be this guy.

239
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,620
 And actually I just realized

240
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,500
 I don't have to say allegedly,

241
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,660
 he actually got sentenced on this.

242
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,460
 Five years probation.

243
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,780
 We do have another story, another similar story

244
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,860
 in Phoenix, Arizona.

245
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,540
 I'm not gonna go into too much detail about it

246
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,500
 'cause it's pretty much the exact same story.

247
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,940
 But I did think it was weird.

248
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,980
 This guy also used the babysitter app.

249
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,940
 I think that's gonna be a huge issue forward.

250
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,300
 If I just learned out

251
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,100
 that you could order a babysitter to your house

252
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,900
 and if I know about it,

253
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,780
 then there's a whole bunch of lunatics.

254
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,060
 There's a whole bunch of weirdos

255
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,020
 who happened to be reading the news that day.

256
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,360
 They found out about this as well.

257
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,780
 But this guy was using the same thing.

258
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,660
 His name is Paul Anthony Machaka,

259
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,300
 30 year old man.

260
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,460
 He told people he had Down syndrome

261
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,100
 and pretended to be his mom through the babysitter app

262
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,460
 was hiring babysitters and the mom,

263
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,740
 quote unquote, the mom was saying,

264
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,460
 "My son, he's such a good boy,

265
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,820
 "but when he poops his pants, you better punish him."

266
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,420
 And give him a nice long bath.

267
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,020
 Babysitter's are like, "What?"

268
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,140
 But hey, you know, it's whatever.

269
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,460
 It's $18 an hour.

270
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,140
 And it was this weird scheme.

271
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,300
 His parents did not know he was doing this.

272
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,540
 He was living at home.

273
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,700
 The mom, the fake mom would say,

274
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,900
 "My son's gonna be at some random location

275
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,740
 "in Phoenix, Arizona."

276
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,100
 It's like, where's Waldo?

277
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,660
 But involving a pervert.

278
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,460
 "My son's gonna be at some random location

279
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,740
 "in Phoenix, Arizona."

280
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,900
 Well, tell you where he's at.

281
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,740
 You don't actually have to go searching for him.

282
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,660
 There's like a timer.

283
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,460
 Where in the world is Carmen San Diego?

284
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,300
 You find him at this random location.

285
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,140
 You don't find him.

286
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,980
 We'll tell you where he's at.

287
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,980
 He's basically say, "Pick me up at the mall.

288
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,260
 "Take him to a neutral location."

289
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,100
 Doesn't say for sure,

290
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,260
 but I'm assuming like a hotel room or something like that.

291
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,180
 And if you pooped his pants, you punish him.

292
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,100
 You put him in the corner,

293
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,480
 but and then give him a nice long bath.

294
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,300
 And then you drop him off at another random location.

295
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,460
 They're using random, not a cut of fine, this guy.

296
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,020
 They're just imagining a pervert.

297
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,860
 And it's all, "Bing!"

298
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,580
 He does this for months.

299
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,420
 He does this for like,

300
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,820
 he gets away with this for like 10 months

301
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,540
 and three different babysitters are washing them.

302
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,100
 And a lot of times in their washroom bathtub,

303
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,260
 he's like, "More, more washy wash, more washy wash."

304
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,100
 And he would get like,

305
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,260
 I don't know if he made baby voices,

306
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,660
 but he was getting really mad

307
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,020
 and they had to vigorously wash his genitals.

308
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,700
 And one of the babysitters finally goes,

309
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,340
 "Listen, this is super suspicious.

310
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,340
 "I got me a lot of money doing this,

311
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,460
 "but now I'm suspicious."

312
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,260
 And so she followed him home.

313
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,180
 She followed another babysitter dropping him off.

314
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,980
 She followed him home like straight up,

315
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,620
 Nancy drewed this dude.

316
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,260
 And when he walked into his house,

317
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,580
 she went up, knocked on the door and was like,

318
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,260
 "Hey, I'm your son's babysitter.

319
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,100
 "Just wanna be clear,

320
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,860
 "your son does have Down syndrome, right?

321
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,060
 "And you want us to punish him when he poops his pants."

322
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,940
 And the mom, the mom answers the door is like,

323
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,540
 "Hey, Paul, Paul,

324
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
 "I think we have something to talk about.

325
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,700
 "This woman's telling me that you're a bad, bad boy

326
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,140
 "when you poop your pants."

327
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,100
 He has not been sentenced yet.

328
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,500
 So allegedly, all that stuff was alleged.

329
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,780
 He got arrested down in 2018

330
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,220
 and hasn't been charged yet.

331
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,020
 So I don't know if he's putting it off.

332
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,540
 'Cause you know, a lot of times when you get arrested,

333
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,020
 you have the chance to drag the trial out

334
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,860
 as long as possible.

335
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,020
 You have the right to a speedy trial.

336
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,860
 But if you have a lawyer and you have money,

337
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,140
 you can make it last as long.

338
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,020
 Like you can keep doing delays.

339
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,740
 And if you're free on bail, why rush it?

340
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,940
 Why rush the trial?

341
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,660
 So you just keep delaying it over and over again

342
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,500
 if you have the money for it.

343
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,940
 So that could be what he's doing.

344
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,900
 It's all a legend.

345
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,140
 Maybe he is a good boy and not a bad boy.

346
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,980
 I don't know.

347
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,700
 I don't want to determine that

348
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,420
 'cause I might give him a boner either way, allegedly.

349
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
 But that is that story.

350
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,020
 Kind of piggybacked on the other one.

351
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,660
 Bunch of perverts running around in diapers.

352
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,500
 Now, it's time to end pervert land.

353
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,780
 There's not a button to do that.

354
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,620
 You know what, dude?

355
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,940
 Tumblr disappears.

356
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,940
 Sniper, I want you to get us out of pervertville.

357
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,940
 Call in that carpenter copter.

358
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,500
 (imitates car engine)

359
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,140
 We're all jumping on board.

360
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,460
 Got the machine guns manned in case a bunch of babies,

361
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,580
 human babies are chasing us.

362
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,820
 (imitates car engine)

363
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,660
 World War Z.

364
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,620
 They're like pooping.

365
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,980
 They're making a giant poop mountain towards us.

366
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,740
 Sniper, go ahead and take us out of here.

367
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,700
 We are headed out to Nebraska.

368
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,820
 (imitates car engine)

369
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,860
 This story was sent to me by Mason,

370
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,820
 a long-time listener of the show,

371
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,380
 long-time supporter of the show.

372
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,060
 And I don't know if even he understood

373
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,740
 the gravity of this story.

374
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,060
 Really, really appreciate it.

375
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,100
 Sent me a lot of good stuff.

376
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,020
 Really big supporter of the show.

377
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,940
 But I don't know if even he understands

378
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,260
 the gravity of the story because I didn't get it

379
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,140
 until maybe 10 minutes before recording this podcast.

380
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,620
 Check this out.

381
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,020
 All the information I got from this

382
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,740
 is from a website called iflscience.com.

383
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,100
 It's an article written by James Felton.

384
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,620
 And it's based on a medical report

385
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,020
 that was recently written by a bunch of doctors.

386
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,580
 So in Nebraska, there is a man,

387
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,220
 we don't have his name 'cause this was written

388
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,660
 in a medical journal.

389
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,380
 We're gonna call him Alexander.

390
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,260
 He's 30 years old and he has had some difficulties

391
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,300
 with his life.

392
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,540
 He's an opioid addict.

393
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,980
 He's suffering from major depression

394
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,500
 and he has decided to stop taking his bipolar medication.

395
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,140
 And his family obviously is not happy with that.

396
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,420
 They wanna support him.

397
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,140
 But they're starting to notice he's having these

398
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,060
 wild mood swings around the house.

399
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,060
 Dealing with all of that stuff isn't fun

400
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
 and then not taking their medications

401
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,460
 and really just compounding it.

402
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,140
 But he's decided, like many people

403
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,180
 who suffer from mental illness,

404
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,780
 he's decided to self-medicate.

405
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,300
 Doesn't want the pharmaceutical medications.

406
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,580
 No, he's gonna self-medicate using recreational stuff.

407
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,380
 He decides to try magic mushroom tea.

408
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,580
 And that's where you take one of those

409
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,180
 special magic mushrooms, the cyclobin,

410
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,100
 blah, blah, blah, Latin stuff, mushrooms.

411
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,180
 And you pour hot water over it

412
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,820
 and it makes a psychoactive tea, a magic mushroom tea.

413
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,500
 So he's like, has his legs crossed,

414
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,940
 his little Mr. Miyagi moment.

415
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,260
 He's pouring Mr. Miyagi super driven out.

416
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,300
 He's catching flies that don't exist.

417
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,820
 He's pouring the little teapot over the magic mushrooms

418
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,460
 and he's brewing this tea and he's like, hmm, yes.

419
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,820
 Now, recently they just passed along organ,

420
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,740
 allowing veteran groups to be able to use

421
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,820
 magic mushrooms for depression therapy.

422
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,460
 There's actually a lot of studies.

423
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,020
 I'm not a huge fan of hallucinogenics.

424
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,200
 I don't use them.

425
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,220
 I have a lot of friends who do

426
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,740
 and I don't judge them for doing it,

427
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,900
 but I'm not a hallucinogenic fan myself.

428
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,620
 But they passed a law saying,

429
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,460
 we can use this for therapy.

430
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,020
 There are a lot of studies showing

431
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,940
 that it works for depression and drug abuse, drug addiction.

432
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,800
 So it would make sense that he was suffering from depression.

433
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,140
 He's suffering from an opioid addiction.

434
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,900
 He thinks maybe I can help alleviate that

435
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,780
 by drinking this magic mushroom tea.

436
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,980
 Specifically, he was looking at the idea of micro dosing,

437
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,180
 where you take tiny, like super tiny amounts of it over time

438
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,780
 so you don't get the full effect.

439
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,800
 Micro dosing, the science is still out on that.

440
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,980
 But someone who already has a drug addiction,

441
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,200
 it's probably not the best path to go on

442
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,780
 'cause you start off micro dosing,

443
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,660
 eventually you're mega dosing because you're a drug addict.

444
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,860
 You're just changing your drug of choice.

445
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,420
 But maybe magic mushrooms will end all of that, right?

446
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,060
 That's the idea, I'll have an awakening.

447
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,020
 So he bruises magic mushroom tea.

448
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,860
 Now that might've worked

449
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,140
 if he had gone about the standard plan.

450
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,220
 Like an organ, you can do the magic mushrooms,

451
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,020
 but it has to be in a controlled environment.

452
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,860
 It has to be given out by a certified doctor

453
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,980
 or something like that.

454
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,980
 He takes this tea, he smells that the steam's coming off the tea.

455
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,220
 This tea is psychoactive at this point.

456
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,740
 And he goes to take a drink and he goes,

457
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,220
 "No, no, that's where the norm is."

458
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,380
 He puts the tea cup down, he gets a little cotton ball.

459
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,100
 He pulls out a syringe.

460
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,700
 He puts the syringe in the tea

461
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,420
 and filters out the impurities through the cotton ball.

462
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,500
 (mimics machine noise)

463
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,940
 Syringes make that noise, don't you know?

464
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,020
 He injects himself with the magic mushroom tea.

465
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,620
 It begins to flow through his veins.

466
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,700
 Couple days later, his family finds him.

467
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,980
 He's laying on the floor.

468
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:55,380
 I have in my notes extreme confusion.

469
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,220
 That was the best way I could say extreme confusion.

470
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,100
 He was lit, he was gone.

471
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,980
 He was so high days later and he can't talk.

472
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,380
 He's just kind of flopping around.

473
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,020
 Obviously the family's immediately alarmed by that,

474
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,060
 but he's also yellow.

475
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,880
 He's turned yellow.

476
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,660
 The area's full of diarrhea.

477
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,100
 Those two guys from the first story,

478
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,260
 they're like taking notes, they're like,

479
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,300
 "What was his recipe?"

480
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,140
 He was yellow, he was pooping everywhere,

481
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,660
 and as the family comes in, he can't talk,

482
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,460
 he's extremely confused, he looks at them,

483
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,260
 and he begins to vomit blood.

484
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,500
 This isn't creepypasta, this isn't a medical journal.

485
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,060
 They obviously called 911.

486
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,260
 He's taken to the hospital.

487
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,980
 His organs are failing, his lungs are failing.

488
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,840
 He has septic shot extreme liver damage,

489
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,020
 which is what gave him jaundice.

490
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,100
 Also one of the symptoms they noted was nausea.

491
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,500
 That's the least of your problems.

492
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,740
 When you're having diarrhea and throwing up blood

493
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,900
 at the same time, do they really need to put down

494
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,180
 his tummy hurt?

495
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,780
 We know he has nausea.

496
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,920
 His organs are failing.

497
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,660
 And on top of all of that, the doctors realized

498
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,620
 this dude is tripping balls.

499
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,060
 Like this dude is out of it.

500
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,380
 Now they can obviously figure out that he injected this T.

501
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,140
 I don't think he injected the T and was like,

502
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,740
 "Oh, now I'm gonna watch a couple episodes of The Simpsons."

503
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,620
 And then maybe I'll start going to conspiracy websites.

504
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,620
 Like I like that he got lit right away.

505
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,140
 So they would have found the syringe,

506
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,580
 they would have found the T and the mushrooms,

507
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,780
 all of that stuff.

508
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,820
 But he's in the ICU at this point.

509
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,100
 He's totally messed up.

510
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,540
 The doctors are trying to figure out how to save him.

511
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,420
 How to reverse all this stuff.

512
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,940
 And they start to notice clots in his blood.

513
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,340
 And they're like, "Right, who knows what is going on now?

514
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,020
 Like he's done all this damage, knows what's going on."

515
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,540
 So they start taking blood samples

516
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,140
 and they start looking at it through the microscope.

517
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,960
 They notice, this is so insane.

518
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,960
 In his blood, he is growing mushrooms.

519
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,160
 When he was making the T,

520
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,220
 when he was putting the boiling water over the mushroom,

521
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,460
 it was releasing spores into the T.

522
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,020
 And he injected the spores into his veins

523
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,820
 and they could tell that the fungus was growing

524
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,300
 in his bloodstream.

525
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,900
 And they think that is why he was still high.

526
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,420
 He turned himself into a magic mushroom.

527
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,660
 It is unclear, 'cause they don't know for sure,

528
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,860
 but they wrote in this report, it is unclear

529
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,060
 whether active, intravascular infection

530
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,020
 with a psychoactive fungus

531
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,920
 may prompt persistent psychoactive effects

532
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,260
 as seen with ingestion of the same species.

533
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,460
 Unquote.

534
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,260
 So it's in him and it's not going away.

535
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,540
 The fungus is growing in his bloodstream

536
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,740
 and keeping him high.

537
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,100
 Until you're able to kill the fungus in there,

538
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,740
 you're gonna be tripping balls.

539
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,740
 He turned himself into a magic mushroom, full of spores.

540
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,420
 He was in the ICU for eight days.

541
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,100
 They released him from the ICU.

542
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,260
 He was in the hospital for another 22 days

543
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,960
 and now he's still being treated.

544
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,660
 He's out of the hospital, he's doing fine,

545
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,100
 he didn't pass away, but now he's still being treated.

546
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,820
 He basically took the ultimate trip and became a drug.

547
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,720
 Now, the first question you asked yourself,

548
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,420
 this is a question I wrote in my notes.

549
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,900
 Could you get high off this guy?

550
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,700
 Basically, right?

551
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,420
 If he was still in a vegetative state and doctor's like,

552
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,540
 "Oh dude, I have a party, I have a party going up

553
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,740
 and I didn't bring any snacks.

554
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,800
 I know what I'll do.

555
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,100
 I'll bring the drugs."

556
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,680
 And he's pulling blood out of this dude.

557
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,540
 Could you smoke his blood?

558
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,380
 Could you dry it?

559
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,220
 Could you drink it?

560
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,040
 Could you inject?

561
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,080
 Don't inject it yourself, this is just more spores.

562
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,840
 But could you get high off this dude's blood?

563
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,620
 If you gave him a kiss,

564
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,640
 if you gave him a big old wet, slavvy kiss,

565
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,560
 would you get high off this saliva?

566
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,780
 Could you, 'cause he basically is full of

567
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,080
 magic mushroom spores.

568
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,120
 Now, he would eventually die if he didn't cure him,

569
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,700
 but before he died or like right,

570
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,100
 you're like, "No, no, don't do the cure yet.

571
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,020
 Don't do the cure yet."

572
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,300
 Ah, yes, get high of your own supply.

573
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,120
 But then as I was getting ready to record this episode,

574
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,460
 I remembered something.

575
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,800
 Maybe about 100 episodes.

576
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,640
 I'll put it in the show notes.

577
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,060
 100 to 150 episodes ago.

578
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,760
 You guys will know where I'm headed with this now.

579
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,060
 I'm sure Mason's like, "Oh yeah."

580
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,820
 I covered a story called "Skin."

581
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,580
 It was on the Arrowid database.

582
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,140
 It was this woman who was writing it.

583
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,080
 It's great, I love that episode.

584
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,560
 Check it out, it'll be in the show notes.

585
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,820
 It's a story of a young couple who decides to start

586
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,580
 to experiment with meth.

587
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,000
 And she believes that their drug dealer's trying

588
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,280
 to turn them into drugs.

589
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,860
 Because the effects are so bad,

590
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,620
 she could squeeze her stomach and Crisco,

591
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,900
 like oily clumps of Crisco would pour out of her skin.

592
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,620
 Half the stories are just her sitting,

593
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,060
 half the stories are just her sitting in the sauna

594
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,380
 and black ooze is coming out of every part of her body.

595
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,320
 And she believed that if you scraped off the Crisco,

596
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,560
 the darkened Crisco grease,

597
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,200
 sorry if you're baking right now,

598
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,380
 you're like, "Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

599
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,180
 can't wait for these cookies to get done."

600
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,880
 As you're scraping off the grease,

601
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,960
 her psychotic belief was that you could smoke it,

602
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,300
 you could get high off that.

603
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,480
 She was thinking that this drug dealer was actually

604
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,720
 trying to turn her into this drug.

605
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,500
 She was gonna get trapped in a basement or something

606
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,600
 like that and just be used to get other people high.

607
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,440
 And it's funny 'cause I reported that story

608
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,200
 and everyone was just kinda creeped and grossed out by it.

609
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,980
 But it seems so fantastical.

610
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,360
 A woman in the midst of a meth psychosis.

611
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,600
 And then we have this.

612
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 It's possible to turn a human being into drugs.

613
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,240
 I wonder if she was right.

614
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,680
 I wonder if there are people out there

615
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,660
 that are doing this on purpose to other people.

616
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,460
 Because you can talk about Adrenochrome all day long.

617
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,740
 This is 100 times worse.

618
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,180
 A hallucinogen that is cultured in a human body.

619
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,780
 That would have to be incredibly potent.

620
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,920
 And even if it wasn't more potent than normal

621
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,060
 magic mushrooms, just the idea that it came

622
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:28,060
 from a human body in your mind would make it more valuable.

623
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,680
 If you were a drug dude, you're like, "Hey, dude,

624
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,360
 "you're like chasing a smoke weed all the time.

625
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,320
 "I don't want my weed to come out of some dude,

626
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,160
 "but you know what I mean?

627
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,860
 "Let's say you're some high level, rich celebrity person."

628
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,080
 And someone's like, "Hey man, have you ever tried Jerry?"

629
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,740
 People are like, "No, what's Jerry?"

630
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,740
 And they're like, "Jerry, it's this new drug

631
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,960
 "that we actually make in human bodies."

632
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,560
 You hold up a little red vial and be like,

633
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,380
 "Dude, it's gonna get you lit.

634
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,220
 "Don't inject it, don't inject it,

635
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,780
 "or you might become the next Jerry."

636
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,900
 But you smoke this, you snort this, you drink this,

637
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,780
 you're gonna get high.

638
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,200
 It's the best trip you've ever had.

639
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,800
 Let's try a little bit of Jerry.

640
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,380
 This story is real.

641
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,820
 This story has scientific proof behind it.

642
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,100
 This story actually happened.

643
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,460
 And the story of skin just seemed,

644
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,820
 it seemed like it could have been a fake story,

645
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,940
 or it could have seemed like it was

646
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,540
 a woman's psychotic delusion.

647
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,780
 But it may turn out that her story

648
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,220
 may have actually been real.

649
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,740
 She may have dodged a bullet.

650
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,380
 She may have honestly been experimented on

651
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,780
 to be turned into a drug.

652
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,880
 This guy's attempt to leave his own depression

653
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,720
 may have opened the window to a world of drugs

654
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,280
 that most people don't even know exist.

655
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,440
 Drugs cultured and manufactured inside the human body.

656
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,680
 Everyone thinks it's a new crazy chemical

657
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,600
 from some lab in Germany,

658
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,680
 but it's actually the blood of a young woman

659
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,800
 who went missing, a young man whose family

660
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,040
 never stopped searching for him,

661
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,120
 a child who got lost, and nobody knows

662
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,280
 what happened to them.

663
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,780
 The designer drugs of the future may be made

664
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,040
 from the men and women who have gone missing in the past.

665
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,220
 So warning to all you psychonauts out there

666
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,020
 looking for the next designer drug.

667
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,900
 You spent years trying to find the next big high.

668
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,300
 It turns out the next big high was in you all along.
