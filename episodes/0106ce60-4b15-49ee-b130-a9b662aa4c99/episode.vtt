 Hey everyone just a quick heads up so last Friday I said I was gonna do another

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.640
 week of episodes I guess you can figure out what's going on with

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.080
 our recording this. Last Friday I said we got one more week of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.880
 episodes till the end of season 15 well we're calling it early.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.920
 Last Friday's episode I thought was really good

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.720
 it had a funny story it had a creepy story I considered ending it that day

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.200
 the season not the podcast and I thought no I don't like to just do with no

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.160
 warning I'll tell him there's another week but

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 behind the scenes I didn't know if I had another week in me

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.840
 apparently I don't now the truth of the matter is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 I've been pretty sick since July and it's been nothing major

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.440
 it's just been a lot of little things a lot of little things

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.040
 popping up here and there and for some reason they've all been

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.720
 head related I couldn't have had like a sore foot

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 or or back problem I'm not I don't want those things right

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.000
 but everything has been head related throat related and so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.480
 really as I was recording that all last week I was sick

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.840
 and you could kind of hear you could kind of hear it in the episodes

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.080
 and I just needed some recovery time the break was coming up I spent all Saturday

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.840
 at the doctor's office so I didn't have time to do research

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.880
 all of this is saying that that wasn't it that Friday's episode was the end of

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.160
 season 15 and I wanted to let you guys know why

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.880
 everything's totally fine so that's it that is it that is that was the end of

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.480

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.760
