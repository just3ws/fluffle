8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,140
 idea that his clothes are about to be evidence of a paranormal encounter. And

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:48,340
 then we travel to Georgia to visit a house that is currently under assault by

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:54,140
 a creature from another reality. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:04,580
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,500
 Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,300
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so let's go ahead and get started. First off,

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,300
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command. I don't even know if this person still listens to

15
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,460
 the show. Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, give it up for Maxi

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,460
 Millian. Woo, come on in Maxi Millian. The tour is just opening. No one's there. Maxi? Maxi?

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,180
 I actually just found a list. I'm always doing like live stream shoutouts and

18
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,860
 Patreon shoutouts. I found a list from people who donated, people who donated to

19
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,580
 the show from like 2020. So Maxi Millian donated during the Thanksgiving

20
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,460
 live stream of 2020. Hope you're still alive. Maybe you still listen to the

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,780
 podcast? I don't know, but Maxi Millian, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this

22
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,180
 episode. If you guys can't support the show financially, that's fine too. Just

23
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,380
 help spread the word about the show. That really, really helps out a lot. Maxi

24
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,100
 here on the top. She the keys. No one catches them. I'm tossing the keys to

25
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,080
 Maxi Millian. We are hopping in the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Dead

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,260
 Rabbit Command. Maxi drive us all the way out to Canada.

27
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,900
 This is a really cool story because we actually have not just the city. This

28
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,220
 story takes place in Vancouver, Canada. We have a street. We basically have a

29
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,060
 street address. I found this really cool website recently. It's called UFOBC.ca.

30
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,900
 It's a UFO website specifically for Canada. We have a lot of good stuff

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,220
 coming up from them. This might be the first time we've talked about them. And I

32
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,660
 want to give a shout out to Bill Oliver. He's the guy who wrote this article

33
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,140
 about what we're gonna be talking about. So Bill, thank you so much for putting

34
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,220
 this together. This story takes place February 1998. Somewhere around there.

35
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,260
 And if you're familiar with the Vancouver area, you're like living on this

36
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,620
 street right now. You're like, "Ugh!" In the South Grandville Marple area on 70th

37
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,100
 and Hudson, there's an apartment complex. And in this apartment complex, there's a

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,100
 young man. His name is Rod. He's 26 years old back in 1998. So that would make him

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,700
 head of the years together and we'll guess how old he is now. But back then,

40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,620
 he was 26 and he was sharing an apartment with his brother. Rod gets off work and

41
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,380
 he gets home and his brother's there and his brother's girlfriend is there and

42
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,100
 they're just chilling and Rod's like, "You know, I had such a long day at work.

43
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,780
 Let's do this." So, "Chh!" Drinking. Kicking back their drink and the three of them.

44
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,260
 But Rod actually had such a long day and probably a pretty low alcohol tolerance

45
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,620
 like myself. He only has four drinks and he passed us out in the living room

46
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,380
 around 2 a.m. And according to his brother, his brother had to get Rod into

47
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:51,500
 Rod's bed, put him down, and he was fully clothed. It was one of those days where

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,300
 you're just so tired and you've had a couple drinks, you don't even have the

49
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,500
 wherewithal to take off your clothes. He's in his boots. He's in his work boots

50
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,980
 when Rod is put to bed. The next thing Rod remembers though, he doesn't really

51
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:10,420
 remember getting into bed. The next thing Rod remembers, he is standing in a room

52
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:17,380
 being blinded by a light. "Ugh! My eyes! Why did Thomas Edison even want to invent

53
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,700
 these things? And as his eyes are adjusting to the light, he realizes that

54
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,860
 he is only wearing basketball shorts." He's trying to go, "Wait a second. I remember

55
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,140
 I was in the living room and I had a couple beers and the next thing I know,

56
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,980
 I'm here. Blinded light. Where are all my clothes? Where am I? And as he's trying to

57
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,620
 piece all of this together, he hears a voice say, "What are you doing in my

58
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:54,900
 apartment?" And Rod fully opens his eyes. The light, his eyes have adjusted to the

59
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:02,420
 inventions of Thomas Edison. He realizes he's not in his apartment. He's in his

60
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,740
 neighbor's apartment. Now I'm thinking that there, when I say neighbors like

61
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,260
 they're physical neighbors, but they don't seem to know each other that well.

62
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,140
 Because the student is super irate. He wasn't like, "Hey Rod, you okay? This guy's

63
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,700
 yelling at him. What are you doing in my apartment?" And Rod starts to apologize

64
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,500
 and he walks out the door and when he leaves the neighbor's apartment, sure

65
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,700
 enough it is his neighbor. Like he goes into this apartment hallway and he's

66
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:34,980
 looking at his door now. He's like, "What in the world?" And so he goes to get into

67
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:42,540
 his apartment and he realizes it's locked and he doesn't have his keys. His keys

68
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,300
 were in his pants when he came home from work. So he's locked out of his apartment.

69
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,220
 He's knocking on the door. He hears his brother get up. It's like three in the

70
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,780
 morning at this point. His brother gets up and the door is double locked. So not

71
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,740
 only is it locked but the deadbolt's on and the brother opens the door and he

72
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,980
 sees Rod standing there just wearing his basketball shirt. "What in the world are

73
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,500
 you doing?" He's like, "I have no idea what's going on. Just let me in the

74
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,020
 apartment." The neighbor here, he's super mad at me and Rod walks in and he goes,

75
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,980
 "Dude, I have no idea what happened. What is going on?" And the brother goes, "I have

76
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,420
 no idea either. I put you to bed. Like you passed out in the living room. I carried

77
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,540
 you into the bed but you were wearing all of your clothes." There's so much

78
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,740
 weird stuff going on here. First off, Rod is half naked. Secondly, he ended up in

79
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,880
 the neighbor's house but he's thinking logically. He goes, "Let's say that I

80
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,620
 slept to walk out of the house. How would I have locked the door behind me? Both

81
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,420
 the door and the deadbolt without my keys. Like you can imagine you could lock

82
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,860
 your door and then from the inside and then walk out and shut it really hard

83
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,100
 and then your doorknob's locked but there's no way to lock the deadbolt

84
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,140
 without the key." And that's when he's like, "Well my keys are in my pants and

85
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,340
 then what in the world are my pants?" So him and his brother go into Rod's

86
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,620
 bedroom and there they find his clothes. Now at this point you could just be

87
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,300
 thinking, "This is just a drunk Canadian story. The whole country has a drinking

88
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,180
 problem." According to that documentary Strange Brew, he's just drunk. He walked

89
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,860
 out in the middle of the night. He somehow did the key thing. This is not alien

90
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,060
 related. This is just someone with a serious alcohol problem. Well what happens

91
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,540
 is when they go into the bedroom they see that Rod's clothes are perfectly laid

92
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,980
 out on the bed and not laid out as in, "These are the clothes I'm gonna wear

93
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,460
 tomorrow because they're my work clothes." No. It was laid out as if someone was in

94
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:44,500
 their clothes, fully clothed like he went to bed and then disappeared and the

95
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:53,060
 clothes just collapsed in place like someone was still wearing them. You had

96
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,840
 the shirt where the shirt should be at the top, right? Do I have to describe how

97
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,340
 clothes are worn? You had the jeans that were still tucked into his boots and his

98
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,620
 socks were also still inside his boots. Again, not rolled up, not rolled up in a

99
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,700
 ball all nicely. It looked like someone had sucked him out of his clothes and

100
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,380
 they just fell in place. Rod and his brother, when they were being interviewed

101
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,940
 by Bill Oliver, Rod and his brother said, "We're both really light sleepers." So

102
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,900
 even if Rod was sleepwalking, took all of his clothes off and then you

103
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,340
 could recreate this, right? Like you could actually make your clothes do this.

104
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,180
 But Rod goes, "Even if I did do that I was running some sort of scam or scam for

105
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,900
 whatever reason." My brother would have woken up and I've never slept walk before

106
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,740
 and even if I did sleepwalk, this is a weird way to sleepwalk to put all your

107
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,100
 clothes back and to be able to lock a door even though they were able to

108
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:03,100
 verify his house keys were in the jeans in the bed just laying there. They also

109
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,140
 said that just going to the bathroom wakes the other person up. It's super

110
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,700
 squeaky floor in the house. It's very unlikely that Rod's brother slept through

111
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,060
 this. However, Rod's brother was also drinking so you could figure maybe it is

112
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,940
 just Canada's natural alcohol problem that caused this. But the point, but the

113
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,180
 fact that... So this is what's interesting. So you have physical evidence of the

114
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,500
 clothes laying there, but how do you explain him locking the deadbolt from

115
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,460
 the other side of the door? And apparently after this encounter both

116
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,100
 Rod's brother and Rod's mom were able to verify he had some moles, two new moles

117
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,580
 on the back of his neck. So the kind of the implication, this is on a website

118
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,460
 called UFOBC, so it is for UFO stuff. The implication is that he was abducted by

119
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:57,100
 aliens and dropped into the neighbor's house. And you go, "Jason, if aliens have

120
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,300
 the ability to fly across time and space or come from other dimensions or

121
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,100
 whatever they're doing, surely they could put him back exactly where they got him.

122
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,020
 What's interesting is this is super common in UFO lore. Like I don't know if

123
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,460
 we've ever explicitly covered it. I thought this story was interesting just

124
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,020
 because we have all of this evidence and these other witnesses. It is very, very

125
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,780
 common for aliens. We have covered this before. Aliens drop people off in the

126
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,900
 wrong location all the time. It happens so often that I don't know if I could

127
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,180
 actually mention the key episodes or certain episodes we've talked about it,

128
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,740
 but in UFO lore it happens a lot. And there have been stories of people

129
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,740
 dropped in with their clothes on backwards. There have been stories where

130
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,460
 people have been dropped in in clothes that they weren't wearing at the time.

131
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,700
 They get abducted wearing one outfit and they come back. Well, they lose time,

132
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,340
 right? They wake up or they end up in another location. They're wearing

133
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,620
 different clothes. That's not uncommon for UFOs. And the question is why are they

134
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,820
 doing this? How could you have the technology to suck someone out of their

135
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,140
 clothes, but then when you go to put them back, you just grab a pair of basketball

136
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,820
 shorts and throw it on them. If memory serves me right, and again I don't

137
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,100
 think I could point to a particular episode, I think there have been people

138
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,420
 dropped off in clothes that weren't their own as well. I may have not have

139
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,300
 covered that on the show. I may have just come across that because a lot of

140
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,340
 times these stories, they just kind of, you read so many of them, they start to

141
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,100
 blur together sometimes. But this isn't uncommon for aliens to drop people off

142
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,260
 in odd locations. I mentioned this story on a recent episode. There was a

143
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,500
 woman who was abducted from Argentina and she was dropped off like 40 miles away

144
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,580
 and people couldn't figure out what that was. And there's an interesting thing

145
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,900
 going on right now, is she had her cell phone on her the whole time. So they're

146
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,140
 actually trying to look at the cell phone data. There's still no been no

147
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,940
 answers for that, but they say that with the cell phone data they should be able

148
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,380
 to see how that journey was made. And I'll put that link in the show notes. We've

149
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,340
 never covered it officially. I guess we should at this point. I've talked about it

150
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,140
 two or three times on the show, but this isn't uncommon for aliens who have

151
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,260
 ducked you and put you in the wrong location and put you in clothes you

152
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,340
 weren't wearing. It's such an interesting quirk of alien behavior. Why are they

153
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:10,340
 doing it? Is it because they don't care? Is it because their technology isn't as

154
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,460
 effective as we think it is? I'm sure they can walk through walls and they can

155
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,420
 travel across the cosmos, but it could be that it is prone to error. Like are they

156
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,420
 doing it on purpose or is it just accidental? I know the United States, we

157
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,740
 hype up all of our technology all the time. It's just a cold war. It's just

158
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,220
 a habit left over from the cold war. Oh, we have a satellite that can read a

159
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,300
 quarter. If you're reading a newspaper, we can look over your shoulder with a

160
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,260
 satin -- no, they can't. That technology has never existed. That was 100% cold war

161
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,980
 propaganda. I remember during when we all had to wear masks during COVID, there

162
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,620
 were still people going, "Oh no, they can still detect you. You wear that mask and

163
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,020
 the CIA still can use it." No, they can't. The mask-wearing stuff

164
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,660
 must have been a nightmare for Intel operations inside and outside the United

165
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,460
 States. And people have -- I've read articles where they're like, "No, no, no, no,

166
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,140
 the technology is still there. Even if you wear a mask, you can be tracked by

167
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,180
 all of these." No, they can't. No, they can't. They can't do that. 100% they can't do that.

168
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,700
 It's so interesting when the government, using the media, right, they go hand in

169
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,300
 hand, they're telling you something that is 100% not true. Because I remember

170
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,380
 reading articles all as a child being told about how good our spy satellites

171
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,460
 were. And they can read a license plate from space and it was 100% -- it was

172
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,620
 not true. Don't worry. Don't worry. The CIA will still be able to spy on the bad

173
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,380
 guys, even though we're all wearing masks. No, they can't. Fascinating. I mentioned it.

174
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,340
 I know I totally segued into something else, but I mentioned a Sabine the other

175
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:53,060
 day. I said, "This is 100% true. It is not illegal for the media to lie to you."

176
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,820
 And when I'm saying media, I'm specifically talking about newspapers and

177
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,420
 news channels. It is not illegal for news channels to lie to you. Isn't that crazy?

178
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:09,940
 Like, think about it. It's not. There is no law they cannot defame or commit libel.

179
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,140
 That's it. You could have a news channel that tells you something that the

180
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,180
 reporters and the editors and the executives and all of them know is a

181
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,580
 flat-out lie. It's totally legal. As long as it is not defamatory or libelous, they

182
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,420
 can lie to you. You can't say, "Oh, that's not true." It's so weird. Isn't that weird

183
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,220
 to think about it? And when I told Sabine that she -- it kind of took her back and

184
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,820
 she was trying to think of an example and I said, "There is no law on the books

185
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:47,220
 that says that a news channel has to tell you the truth." None. So fascinating.

186
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,500
 So I don't know where -- oh, because I'm sorry, maybe alien technology is also

187
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,020
 prone to error and maybe a lot of it is propaganda as well. It's not as good as

188
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,460
 we think it would be. If you're able to fly from Alpha Centauri to here, you

189
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,460
 would think you would be able to pick someone out of one room and put them back

190
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,300
 into that same room and it just might not exist. They may not -- it may be prone to

191
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,580
 error. They may not be able to do that. It may not be that exact. Fascinating

192
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,300
 story. Again, how did he lock himself out? How did he get out of the clothes? And

193
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,780
 it's one of those stories that you have multiple witnesses, especially the

194
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,100
 angry neighbor. There's a dude just standing in his house and have no idea

195
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,260
 how he gets there. I wonder if that ever happens. Like, some dude gets blasted by a

196
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,380
 homeowner because they're like someone was breaking into my house and it was

197
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,780
 just -- he just rubbed you off at really the wrong house and some dude came in and

198
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,340
 saw some stranger standing there and just blasted him with a shotgun. And then in

199
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,700
 town they're like, "That's weird. I wonder why that guy is a pretty

200
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,580
 upstanding citizen. Why was he breaking into this dude's house? Well, who knows?"

201
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:57,980
 But he was in the house and this dude killed him. It probably doesn't happen super often.

202
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,260
 I'm sure the cops would investigate that if like some executive from Exxon was

203
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,140
 standing in a house and he gets shot to death. I don't think the cops would

204
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,060
 be like, "Well, we're not gonna investigate that." Obviously the CEO of this major

205
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,780
 gas company wanted some crack money. Case closed. Maximilian, let's go ahead and

206
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,140
 touch the keys of the carbon helicopter. We're leaving behind Canada. We are headed

207
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:27,060
 all the way out to the state of Georgia.

208
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,140
 I found this post online the other day. It was written by a man who goes by the

209
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:38,580
 handle of such sloth. We're gonna call him Michael. That's your real name is just

210
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,140
 a guess. And this was posted. It's interesting because I was able to look

211
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,780
 through other things that such sloth has written. This story takes place over a

212
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:52,820
 period of years. So he posted something in 2021 and now he's posted an update to

213
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,220
 it. And this is interesting because in between the two stories he's asking

214
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,580
 people about how to work on an aquarium or what type of spider is this. He's

215
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,860
 posting on all these other different things and that does lend a lot of

216
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,620
 credence to it. Whenever I find someone and they go, "I've had the most insane

217
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,260
 encounter." Then I looked through their post history and they've had 20 insane

218
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,100
 encounters. It does make me a little more cautious. There was one story I wanted to

219
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,820
 cover about a guy who had the Mandela effect basically happen only in his

220
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,260
 house. He woke up one morning and his house was rearranged. His entire closet

221
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,700
 was flip-flops. Everything on the left side was on the right side. And I was

222
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,740
 like, "Oh dude, this sounds super dope." And as I was typing up, I read it and I was

223
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,180
 like, "Oh, that's awesome." And as I was typing up the notes, I took a look at his

224
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:45,900
 username. It was called, "I gave your mom AIDS." I was like, "Damn, it's okay. I don't

225
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,700
 know how serious this account was." The very first thing they posted was this

226
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,700
 paranormal story. I was like, "Damn it." So sometimes you've got to like feel it

227
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,460
 out, right? Because we're talking about this stuff that's fantastical. I'll put

228
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,140
 that in the show notes. I'll put that link in the show notes. Maybe it's true, but

229
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,700
 again, if it is, that might not want to be your name that you want to be taken

230
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,980
 seriously. Not saying such sloth is the Socrates of our time, but it's nice to

231
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,380
 see a post-history that shows that this person's living a normal life in

232
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,540
 between these two terrifying events. We're in the town of Georgia and he says,

233
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,660
 he lives in a rural town that's not far from a major city. He says the way it's

234
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,980
 set up is there's two neighborhoods and they're separated by this marsh. He

235
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,580
 goes, "It's this really dense forested area, but it's not like a place where you

236
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,580
 can go camping." He goes, "There's a lot of mud. It's really gross and it's about a

237
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,820
 m-..." He said it's probably less than a mile wide. You have this other

238
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,740
 neighborhood that you could walk to if you wanted to walk through the mud and

239
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,540
 scramble over bushes and bramble and all of that stuff. This man, Michael, he

240
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,820
 gets this house in this neighborhood and his fence line is

241
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,660
 right on the edge of this marsh. It's his fence. He can look out on the other

242
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,740
 side and just see a bunch of trees and you probably hear frogs and stuff at

243
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,900
 night and like, I don't know, woodpeckers. Maybe those live down there? I don't know.

244
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,260
 But anyway, so his house backs up to this natural area. He lives next door to

245
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,340
 this guy named Dave who's lived in the area for a while and currently the

246
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,060
 story starts off in 2021. His girlfriend's living with him. He has a couple dogs, a

247
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:35,060
 couple chickens, a couple cats just living the Georgia lifestyle, right?

248
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,700
 Well, what happens is every so often he starts to realize first one of his dogs

249
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,980
 won't go into the backyard. Hates going to the backyard once it gets dark,

250
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,820
 but the dog has to pee, right? And he's trying to force his dog to go out and pee

251
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,540
 and it doesn't want to. And he thinks that's really weird that his dog doesn't

252
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,940
 want to go out there, but he's forcing his dog to go. And one time he is out

253
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,540
 there, is with his dog, basically is about to pee its pants, but he needs to go

254
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:09,820
 outside and as he's out there every so often, he'll see something run by the

255
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,740
 fence line. He'll be on the other side of the fence and it's fast. So fast it's like

256
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,500
 a blur. Runs past the fence line. Freaks his dog out every single time. He

257
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,940
 understands why his dog doesn't want to be out there now, but he doesn't know

258
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,860
 what it is, right? He has no idea what this thing could be. It runs by so quickly.

259
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,120
 Maybe the trick to the light. He can't prove that anything's out there, but it

260
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,900
 does start to give him the creeps as well. But after a certain point, human

261
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,020
 curiosity gets the better of him. He goes to his neighbor Dave and he says, "Hey, have

262
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,220
 you ever seen anything running along the tree line? I have this dog that doesn't

263
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,580
 want to pee and I've seen like this blur. It's big. It's like eight feet tall

264
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,060
 running by the fence." And Dave's like, "No, I haven't really seen anything like that,

265
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,180
 but you know, let's check it out." Again, human curiosity. What could this be?

266
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,820
 And Dave grabs his gun and they go to the fence line and they don't see

267
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:10,220
 anything. They're out there for a bit. Dogs. His dog's inside, locking the door,

268
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,940
 hiding underneath the bed. Dave and Michael are out there and they're kind

269
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,940
 of looking around. They don't see anything. They're shining flashlights into the

270
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:24,980
 woods. They don't see anything. And then maybe a hundred yards into the marsh. They

271
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:30,540
 begin to hear something rustling through the bushes. Shining the flashlights over

272
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:43,380
 there. Can't really get a good look at it. And then bam! Something hits the fence.

273
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:51,940
 Something actually slams in to the fence. They can't see it, but they could feel it.

274
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,060
 They could feel that impact as it hit the fence. Michael said the way it seemed

275
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,260
 was that it was a hundred yards out in the marsh and then the next thing he knew

276
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,380
 it was five feet in front of him. He goes, "We didn't hear any noise at all." And

277
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,860
 then it's five feet in front of him and they hear the bushes moving. They hear

278
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,260
 the rustling of the foliage around them and it smashes into the fence. He goes,

279
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,840
 "I have no idea how it moved so quickly, so quietly." It was almost like it

280
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,780
 teleported. Within five feet of us, we're right against the fence, but on our side,

281
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,420
 on the outside of the fence, smashed it into the fence. And Dave is so terrified

282
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:35,420
 by this thing, he fires a shot off into the darkness. And nothing is screaming

283
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,300
 and pain. I mean, luckily, right it wasn't that there was a really fast bum out

284
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,660
 there. And that was one thing he said. He goes, "This place is not a place that you

285
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,660
 would camp. There were no homeless people running around out there. Definitely

286
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,540
 no eight feet tall homeless people who could teleport." He goes, "It's not a

287
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,180
 place where you would even want to stay during the day, let alone run around at

288
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,800
 night." They're about to run. Dave and Michael, the shots been fired. Dave and

289
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,540
 Michael are totally freaking out. They have no idea how something could creep up

290
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:09,740
 on them so quickly. They're about to run, but then they're stopped by a voice.

291
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,820
 Right in front of them in this darkness of this marsh, of this forest-filled muddy

292
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:22,260
 marsh, he said the voice sounded human. His exact quote was human in nature. The

293
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,940
 voice sounded human, but he didn't recognize the language. However, even

294
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:35,820
 though the voice sounded human, the language sounded alien. It was so off

295
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:43,020
 putting and so upsetting to hear this voice that Dave and Michael, this was

296
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,860
 what broke them, Dave and Michael took off running. They ran into the house.

297
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,820
 They're in the house. They're trying to calm down. The girlfriend had been out

298
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,700
 earlier that evening also kind of looking around with a flashlight, but they

299
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,260
 didn't see anything and that's why he went and got Dave. So she was already in

300
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,580
 the house with the scared dog. And while they're in the house, he said we were

301
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:11,140
 there for maybe about 10 minutes and then a massive explosion rocked the house.

302
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:19,900
 He said the windows rattled, the lights flickered, and something huge blew up in

303
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:27,620
 the woods. It was so loud that neighbors were coming around. They could see

304
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,760
 people were driving around the neighborhood trying to figure out where

305
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,820
 that explosion came from. And it was so loud they actually called 911. Right? The

306
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,420
 gunshot in Georgia didn't set anyone off, but Michael called 911 and said hey,

307
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,020
 there was just an explosion in the woods behind my house and the police came out

308
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,760
 and they took a report and Michael and Dave and the girlfriend are standing

309
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,940
 there and Michael saying yeah yeah I don't know what he said. I saw a monster in

310
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,580
 the back or I didn't see a monster. It sounded like an alien. It's a giant thing.

311
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,860
 It's been running around my yard, but Michael definitely said there was an

312
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,080
 explosion somewhere in the woods. It actually shook the house and the windows

313
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,580
 rattled and the power flickered and the police took the report and then they go

314
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,500
 to leave. Michael's like well aren't you gonna go out and check out and see what

315
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,540
 that explosion could have been and the cops were like nope.

316
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:27,800
 And they left. They refused to go into the woods. And this story ends with Dave,

317
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:33,480
 the outdoorsman, refusing to leave his house after dark because of this event.

318
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:41,440
 Like after this when the sun set, Dave stayed inside. His neighbor Dave did not

319
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:49,100
 want to go outside anymore. Now that story was posted back in 2021. If I remember

320
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,180
 correctly he didn't give a time for it. I think he just said this story has

321
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,060
 happened. He titled it The Woods and he posted the story back in 2021 and then

322
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,780
 for the next year was posting things like how do I get my aquarium to work, what

323
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,620
 type of spider is this. He's looking for stuff for like some card game. It's just

324
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:14,120
 all of these basic posts. Nothing really super interesting but it does give us an

325
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,720
 insight on who this person is. A normal person. Could be a long-term ARG right?

326
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,960
 Those things have happened but this guy then posts, Michael then just posts about

327
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:33,000
 all of these random things until a couple days ago. Michael recently posted that

328
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,100
 whatever happened back in 2021 is happening again and it has escalated.

329
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,420
 He said in February earlier this year, in February 2022, Michael came out of his

330
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,220
 house one morning in his backyard. He has all these little chickens.

331
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,220
 [Makes chicken sounds]

332
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,020
 He sees this chicken sitting there rubbing his leg.

333
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,320
 Michael came out and was making sad,

334
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,240
 balking noises. Michael came out. One of his chickens had a broken leg.

335
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,260
 Couldn't figure it out right? But you know sometimes chickens are like doing

336
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,960
 chicken stuff breaking their legs. I don't know. I don't know. But he takes the

337
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,780
 chicken to the vet. He loves this little guy. Takes the chicken to the vet and the

338
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,980
 vet's like well you know chickens do chicken things. Chickens break their legs.

339
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,100
 We're gonna have to put her down though. That would be the humane thing to do and

340
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,400
 Michael didn't want to do that. He actually steals the chicken back. He

341
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,140
 goes no I won't let you do it. The veterinarian is bordered by a

342
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,580
 KFC. He's like oh man that's totally gonna sell that chicken. Michael actually

343
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,060
 takes the chicken back and nurses it back to health. He goes to this day that

344
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,500
 little chicken has a bit of a limp but he's doing okay. But Michael's not.

345
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,900
 I'm not even talking about the story if that was the end of it. The chicken was

346
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,740
 nursed back to health. I'm glad the chicken's okay but that's not the end of the story.

347
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:55,620
 After the chicken attack Michael starts having these vivid nightmares. He keeps

348
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,800
 dreaming that he's being chased through the woods. He keeps dreaming that he'll

349
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,600
 just appear in the middle of the woods and be lost. He's completely on edge.

350
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,280
 These dreams are not letting him rest and even during his waking hours he feels

351
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:16,080
 like he's constantly on edge. A week after the first chicken had its leg broken

352
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,920
 and while that one is being nursed back to health Michael comes out of his house

353
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,200
 one day and he finds another one of his chickens. Both legs snapped in half.

354
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,940
 Michael's looking at the scene here. There's no blood anywhere. There's no

355
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,380
 sign of an attack. It's just this chicken's legs are broken in half and this is

356
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:41,900
 when he thinks what if it's back? So he had no based on this statement that he's

357
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:48,380
 putting he had no other experiences between the explosion back before 2021

358
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,900
 when he wrote that initial post and then this the chicken's legs getting broken.

359
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:59,160
 And he probably had hoped that whatever it was was gone maybe blew up right? He

360
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,280
 goes out and he drops about $700 on trail cams. He goes and does research and

361
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,960
 gets the best quality SD cards for them and he sets them up. He actually hides

362
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,200
 them all over the backyard and he starts checking them twice a day. Nothing.

363
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,760
 Every day he goes out checks them, comes back later in the day, checks them. They're

364
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:26,140
 not catching anything odd. He does this from February to March 15th of 2022 and

365
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:32,860
 that morning when he gets up to go check the trail cams they're gone.

366
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:41,300
 He's pissed at this point. Like whatever this thing is it's attacking his chickens.

367
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,720
 He's wasting a lot of money on trail cams right? It's interfering with his life and

368
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,740
 it's hurting the little chickens that he loves. He doesn't say that if he put down

369
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,440
 the second chicken or if he had a delicious chicken dinner. I don't know

370
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,400
 how you would nurse a chicken back to health with two broken legs but not the

371
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,280
 point of the story. It's messing with his life. It's interfering with his sleep.

372
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,760
 It's interfering with his pets. It's interfering with his $700 so he's

373
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,980
 pissed. He's done right? And it's daytime. He figures I'm getting my cameras back. I

374
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,620
 don't know what in the world is out there but I'm getting my cameras back so

375
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,380
 he throws on his boots, puts on his hiking through the marsh clothes. He goes

376
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:28,660
 over the fence and begins to march through the marsh. He's pushing through

377
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,620
 vines. He's climbing over tree stumps. There's bushes. There's brambles. There's

378
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,280
 mud everywhere and he's tromping through it. He's furious. Whatever this thing is,

379
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:54,960
 it ends now. And then he's standing in a clearing and he realizes a lot of things

380
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,080
 at once. First off, this shouldn't be here. There's no clearing in this marsh.

381
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,700
 There's no nice little patch of dry land encircled by trees. This geographical

382
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:15,580
 feature should not be here. One, two, how long have I been walking? Remember, this

383
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,820
 is only a mile, less than a mile wide. As he began walking through the swampy

384
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,340
 forest, he should have reached the other neighborhood by now. He has no idea how

385
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:31,580
 long he's been walking. He has no idea how he got here or where he is.

386
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,540
 He starts to think, did I make a turn somewhere? Did I start walking the

387
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:45,560
 length of the forest instead of the width? Where am I? How did I get here? How did

388
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:52,400
 this get here? How did this feature, this dry clearing, get here? And then in the

389
00:31:52,400 --> 00:32:02,300
 middle of the clearing is one of his trail cams. He knows he needs to get home. He

390
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:11,180
 knows he needs to get home now. And he turns and he heads off through the marsh.

391
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:16,220
 He climbs over a tree stump. He moves through the bramble. He pushes aside a

392
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:27,600
 vine. He's standing at his fence. He said, I walked maybe 100 paces from that

393
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:36,280
 clearing. I turned and I walked 100 steps and I was at my fence. For all that time

394
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,720
 stomping through the marsh and climbing over the stumps, stepping around the

395
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,160
 bushes and walking through the muck, all of that time I walked so long I don't

396
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,620
 even know where I was or how long I was out there. When I turned around it took

397
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:59,420
 me less than two minutes to reach my fence. He said he was so terrified by

398
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:06,980
 this anomaly, by this series of events. He called in sick to work, locked himself

399
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:14,740
 in his bedroom and stayed there for the rest of the day. In fact he ends his

400
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,120
 post pretty much in that same situation. He wrote quote, I called out of work and

401
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,120
 it's been about 18 hours and all I can think about is going back in. And I think

402
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,200
 he's implying, I don't think he's thinking about going back into work. He's like, oh

403
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,320
 Mr. Johnson wants those reports. I think he's I think he's thinking about going

404
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,560
 back into the marsh like something's calling him back in. I called out of

405
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,960
 work and it's been about 18 hours and all I can think about is going back in.

406
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:52,500
 I'm scared. I can't sleep. I know it's watching me through my bedroom window. A

407
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,180
 terrifying story, if true, right? This obviously could be fake. It sounds almost

408
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,380
 too good to be true, but in the world when we're doing paranormal research,

409
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,460
 right, you're constantly grabbing delicious food and you're eating it,

410
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,140
 um-num-num-num, and every so often you accidentally grab a wax apple and you

411
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,720
 realize it's fake and it sucks. But you know, again, too good to be true may be,

412
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,680
 but still we cover a lot of stuff that's too good to be true. A man whose house

413
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:25,120
 borders the unknown. He has that fence line that at one point some zoning

414
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,480
 inspector drew a line and says this is the end of the neighborhood and this

415
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,840
 will be the marshland. This will be the environmentally protected area and then

416
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:41,860
 we'll have another neighborhood here and all of these lines are man-made. We

417
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,580
 never even question, well why is this neighborhood end here? Well that's where

418
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,540
 the zoning was, but the fact the police wouldn't go out there makes you think

419
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,460
 maybe this wasn't some artificially drawn zone. Maybe when this neighborhood was

420
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,700
 built, both neighborhoods, right? Because remember there's two neighborhoods, one

421
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,460
 on each side of this marsh course. Maybe there was a reason why they didn't

422
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:09,560
 chop down those woods. Maybe there was a reason why they didn't try cramming more

423
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,640
 houses into this area. Environmental concerns, certainly, right? That could be

424
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:23,720
 it. But there could be something dark and old in this forest that nobody wanted to

425
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,760
 try chopping it down, or it could have been an artificially drawn line. Zoneed

426
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,740
 this way, green area, green belt, zone over here, it's southern neighborhood, and

427
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:44,500
 something came there. Something came from another world or another dimension,

428
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:50,460
 another reality, and made its home in the wilderness and began to shift it and

429
00:35:50,460 --> 00:36:00,640
 warp it and twist it until it became what it is today. But imagine living in an

430
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,560
 area where you have a fence and on the other side of it is the unknown. Your

431
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:15,160
 house borders the world of the supernatural. That would be bad enough.

432
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,360
 But remember this started because whatever is out there was affecting my

433
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:26,340
 home. The dog didn't want to go outside. It was too terrified to go outside after

434
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,940
 dark. And then the creature was running along the fence line, and then the creature

435
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:38,340
 was crawling over the fence line, attacking the chickens, stealing the

436
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:46,940
 cameras. It was coming into our world. Even though that artificial line was

437
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,020
 divided and you could have easily had this as the world of the paranormal,

438
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:55,800
 we will not cross this fence. We will respect your space. This, whatever it is,

439
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:04,280
 is crawling into our neighborhoods and doing whatever it pleases. Is this story

440
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:12,000
 real? We don't know. I'll always be the question with all of our stories. But if

441
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:22,220
 it is real, there's proof. There is a trail cam sitting in the middle of a

442
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:31,380
 clearing in the middle of a marsh. And on that trail cam is an SD card that has

443
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:39,560
 video footage of whatever took it. Michael is being called a faker and a fool

444
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:48,100
 and an insane person online. But if he wants to prove them all wrong, he just

445
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:56,640
 needs to go back into the woods, back to the clearing, and grab that camera, bring

446
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:04,160
 the SD card back, and he would have proof. If he did that, he would no longer be

447
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:15,800
 called a faker, but only a fool, only an insane man would even think about going

448
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,960
 back to the clearing.
