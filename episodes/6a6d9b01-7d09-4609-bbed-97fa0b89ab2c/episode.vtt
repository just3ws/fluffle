00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 The heart wants what it wants. The old saying goes, "But is it really our heart

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:17.520
 that holds our love or is it the cat poop in our lungs?" You didn't know you

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.440
 currently had cat poop in your lungs? And then we travel to Los Angeles, California

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.200
 to take a look at the story of a young mother who's alone with her infant

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.600
 daughter. When she put her baby to bed for the night and crawled into bed

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.000
 herself, she thought she was just gonna have another restful sleep. Instead, she

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.120
 found herself going toe-to-toe against an alien kidnapper today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:56.960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.800
 host Jason Carvener. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.120
 day too. Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing. Let's go

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.280
 ahead and get the episode started. Walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:16.080
 Christmas livestream contributors. His name means Lion and he's probably as furry

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.280
 as one. Give it up for Leo. Woo yeah! Come on in. You gotta walk on all fours and do

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.240
 lion noises as you walk. And Leo, Leo, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.360
 episode if you guys can't support the Patreon if you're not a furry. I just

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.960
 outed this guy. That's okay too. Just help spread the word about the show. That

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.280
 really, really helps out a lot. Now Leo, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.840
 Jason Jalopy. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. Let's drive all the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.000
 way out to a research facility. Driving on out there. And I'm telling you, like,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.480
 this is where we're supposed to go to this research facility. Now you're

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.560
 expecting to see like a white building, probably like two or three stories with

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.160
 a sign in the front that says something like Cyberdyne or Biosyn or something

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.560
 like that. But we passed those two places. You're like, "Oh, shouldn't we stop the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 future from being all terminators?" Nah! Let's someone else deal with that. We're

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.800
 driving down and we pass all these research facilities and then we see

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.160
 this old house. The paint's all chipping off and it doesn't look like the porch

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.280
 has been repaired in 20, 30 years and the grass is heavily growing over. And I go,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.600
 "Here, here's where we're going. Here's the research laboratory." And we're walking

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.880
 inside. Actually, I didn't even plan this. Leo, you're the perfect person to be part

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:42.200
 of this episode. We're gonna visit your buddies. This house is full of cats. And

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.520
 then we're about to meet the head research scientist. This lady comes out.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.160
 Her hair's all disheveled. She's wearing a shirt that has a picture of a cat on it.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.720
 And the picture of a cat is wearing a shirt that has a picture of another cat on it.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.360
 And it just goes on and on. And this is Matilda Buford. Matilda Buford, the local

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.640
 crazy cat lady. And you're allergic to cats. You're super confident and itchy. Well,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.200
 this is just the first part of the show. You won't be itchy the second part. We're

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.400
 in this cat house. We're in this crazy cat lady's house. And these cats are rubbing

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.640
 up against us and putting their scent everywhere. And we're just breathing in the stale air

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.400
 of urine and cat feces. I really hope none of you guys listen to this while you're eating.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.160
 Every so often someone emails me and says, "Dude, seriously? That's not my fault. That's

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.280
 not my fault." No, you know what you're getting into at this point. The smell of uncleaned cat

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.120
 litter. Breathing them cat feces. Recently, I was talking to Cabot Cove Balloon Friends,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.200
 longtime supporter of the show. We were talking about parasites. We were talking about parasites

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.320
 rescinding each other photos of our bowels. What are you infected with right now, Cabot?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.880
 We were talking about parasites. We were talking about some of the conspiracy theories involving

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.740
 parasites and the way they affect people. And I did an episode not too long ago about

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.320
 parasitic castration. And there's parasites that actually make it so you don't want to

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.120
 have sex or you don't engage in sex. And I said, "Are humans getting infected with that?"

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.400
 Because we're seeing people just disengaging from the dating world and not having sex and

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.520
 just playing video games all the time and things like that. Which, you know, whatever.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.800
 I don't have a problem with it. I don't have a problem with people playing video games all

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.120
 the time because I wish I could do it, right? I'm listfully looking at them as their gonads

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.340
 are being devoured by a parasite. I was like, "Oh, why not me? Why do I have to do all

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.240
 this work? I don't get to play Minecraft all day long." So I did that episode recently

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.700
 about parasitic castration. I'll put it in the show notes, but I'm sure you don't want

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.200
 to listen to it. And then I found this article, though. I found this article really around

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.340
 the time we were talking about, we were sending photos of our own parasitic infestations. In

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.220
 Finland, the country that famously doesn't exist, there is the University of Turku. And

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.360
 a new study has come out of the University of Turku into toxoplasma gondii. This is

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.520
 the parasite that has taken over the world. And I don't think that I'm being an alarmist

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.440
 by saying that. Toxoplasma gondii has taken over the planet. What's weird is it can only

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.780
 sexually reproduce in the stomach of a cat. That's the only place where it can actually

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.260
 reproduce or the intestines of a cat. I don't think it's like, "Okay, we're in the bowels.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.540
 We can't see each other anymore." But it can only reproduce in a cat. But what happens

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.140
 is when the cat poops, the parasites come out of the poop and they're like, "Oh, no,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:52.300
 I want to have more babies." So when you breathe in cat poop, the toxoplasma gondii goes inside

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:00.200
 of you. Now right out of a horror movie, this is so insane. They found out that it can only

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.360
 reproduce in a cat. Toxoplasma gondii can only reproduce in a cat. But cats poop everywhere

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.040
 and this parasite is highly contagious. Now it has to get back into the cat to reproduce,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.560
 but it's already come out of the cat's butthole. What's it going to do? Well, if a mouse comes

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.940
 in contact with this, you know, an uncleaned cat lady's house, right? This poop's lying

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.460
 around, it's dusting off, these little parasites are sailing through the air and a mouse inhales

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.580
 it. The mouse loses it. They've tested this over and over and over again. The mouse loses

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:42.940
 its fear of cats and will actually get into situations that will get it eaten by a cat.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.700
 And then the toxoplasma gondii is back in the cat's stomach and it's just having a little

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:54.040
 horge in there. It's like, "We made it boys! We're back!" That's straight, that is invasion

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.580
 of the body snatchers. It actually shuts off the mouse's fear. They've tested it, they've

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.880
 put mice in rooms that are infected with this and they'll spray cat urine around and the

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.960
 mouse just walks around it. But a non-infected mouse will smell cat urine and be like, "Oh

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.140
 dude, I saw a bunch of documentaries called Tom and Jerry back in the day. This dude wants

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.620
 to eat me and he's gone." Now the reason why that would be fine, right? Who cares what

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.380
 happens to mice? They're kind of cute, right? They're little cool guys. But they wouldn't

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.540
 say it's taken over the world if it's just infected mice. The thing is, is that this

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:36.180
 also infects humans and we know this and this is the reason why you have the idea of the

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:43.960
 crazy cat lady stereotype because in some people, toxoplasma gondi can cause schizophrenia

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:50.640
 or trigger existing schizophrenia. There'd probably be another way to put that. Because

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.840
 studies estimate right now, this was really taken over the world, studies estimate that

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:04.080
 between 30 to 50% of all humans on the planet right now have either been exposed to it or

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.780
 are chronically infected with it. Because when it goes in humans, it's eventually going

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.620
 to die out. If you're walking by and a cat farts in your face, you're not going to have

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.900
 to run to the mental hospital. You're like, "Oh no, I'm afraid I'm schizophrenic." But

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.260
 if you're constantly around it and you're constantly breathing it in, you constantly

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.860
 have this parasite inside of you. It can't replicate in you. But it's going to do crazy

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:33.100
 things while it's inside of you. When it is in a man, when a man gets this toxoplasma

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:41.040
 gondi, it's been linked to being a worse driver. This has effects on how people think, the

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.440
 decisions they make. This little guy sliding around in your tummy makes you, for men, it

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.260
 makes you a worse driver, makes you more rebellious. You're always talking back to authority.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:09:01.120
 But in a weird thing, it makes women more warm-hearted, more open to relationships and things like

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:08.100
 that. We do those things other than the schizophrenic cat ladies. It also increases a woman's chance

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:14.500
 of suicide after the age of 60. These are some weird side effects. It would be one thing

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.080
 if everyone got more rebellious or everyone got more warm-hearted, but we see a distinction

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.860
 between the two groups. It's actually more dangerous for, I mean, obviously being a rebellious

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:29.260
 man can lead to dangerous situations. Being a worse driver can lead to dangerous situations,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.000
 but a higher likelihood of killing yourself over the age of 60, we see that. The very

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:43.040
 first time this was detected in a human was in 1938. A baby was born with it. It was actually

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.120
 in its brains. When the baby died, they didn't know what killed it. They did an autopsy. It

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.840
 was starting to have seizures, right? And then it died. And then when they did the autopsy,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.280
 the brain was infested with this, and so were the eyeballs. And that was the first time science

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.300
 goes, "Well, this can actually infect a human." The very first time we discovered it in a

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:08.500
 human, it killed the baby. So, I mean, it obviously had been in people before. Like, sometimes

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.180
 these are connected to like crazy rulers throughout time. I remember reading an article, there

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.460
 was some queen who was super nuts, and they go, "It could have been all of the inbreeding,

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.500
 but it could have also been she was known to constantly be around cats." So we know

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.980
 all that. That's all established science. But this new study comes out, and it shows

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:34.720
 that this is having an effect on who we find attractive. Like, I've always loved bad drivers.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.400
 They've done this study in Finland recently. The disease can spread from human to human

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:46.880
 in various ways. But one of them is sexual. It's technically a sexually transmitted disease.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.640
 You usually basically, it's really disgusting to think that it comes from a cat's anus into

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.500
 you, and then you're having sex and you're spreading it to somebody else. But when a

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:06.060
 man or a woman is infected with tozmoplasma gondi, they are rated more attractive. Even

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.860
 healthier looking. They did the study and they took people who tested for it, right?

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.180
 And then they took people who didn't have it, and they're doing these photos. Apparently

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.700
 when you have this in you, it makes your face more symmetrical, which is one of the things

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.760
 across cultures that people look for as a measure of attractiveness. They would show

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.360
 pictures of people and they'd go, "Who do you think's hotter?" One of them is a cat.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.400
 One of them is a cat with its tail up and some guys like, "Woo!" Can I see that one?

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.880
 They're like, "No, that actually got into that. That should have been in the file."

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.640
 That's in my personal collection. The scientist puts it in his pocket. With women, if they

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:48.360
 have this parasite in them, it actually makes them thinner. It actually could be a weight

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.660
 loss drug. It could be a weight loss drug. People start popping poop. Popping poop pills. It

00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:00.460
 can make them thinner. And they've seen, this is again because it can be spread sexually.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:05.540
 It can't reproduce in humans, but the parasite can continue to thrive and it can be spread

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.500
 sexually. Women who are infested with this parasite have more sexual partners. Now they

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.740
 may have more sexual partners because people find them more attractive, but people are

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.920
 finding them more attractive because this parasite is reshaping their body to be more

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.600
 attractive so more people are sleeping with this woman and it is spreading.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.320
 Now I think eventually it wants to get back into the cat. So I'm wondering if we could

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.360
 trace people who are infested with this with people who one day they're sitting at home

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:41.160
 and they're like, "I really want to buy a cat. I want to go and adopt a cat." Because

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.160
 that I wonder if it can change who you are attracted to. If it can physically reshape

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.940
 a human body. So other people find it attractive. Change the jawline, change the cheeks. I'm

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.740
 not talking it's not reforming your bones so much, but it can kind of give you a good

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:05.460
 look. I don't see why it can't also be like, "Buy a cat." You're like, "Okay, Jason, now

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.100
 you've turned this real life science into science fiction. It's not like the parasites

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.240
 in there were the little megaphone. It's not that... What was that? Osmosis Jones. It's

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:19.880
 not like a whole thriving city or is there?" Like this is fascinating because at what point

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.560
 are our decisions our decisions and at what point is it a parasite saying, "You know what?

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.040
 I don't think I'm going to eat today." I feel like getting more physical fitness. I wonder

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.280
 if you went to a yoga studio and started taking to the life of swabs from people. How many

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:40.460
 of them would be infected with this? Fascinating story. I do think that a big part of our...

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:47.140
 I think our soul is our soul and our soul is removed from all of this stuff, but we're

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:55.580
 also base animals, right? How much of our day to day decisions is based on gut biome

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.420
 and bacteria and parasites and all that stuff. I find it absolutely fascinating to hear.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:05.600
 We have one of the most infectious parasites that we know of, right? Who knows what else

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.480
 is going on out there? Leo, our cat man. Let's go ahead and tashie the keys to the

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.440
 carbonicopter. Catch them in your big old paws. We're leaving behind this crazy cat

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:23.360
 lady's house. We're headed all the way out to Los Angeles, California. And of course,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.840
 I brought a box of kittens with me. They're so cute. We're flying around in the carbonicopter.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:36.860
 It's December 1984, and we're in Los Angeles, California. It's nighttime. It's time to

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.140
 go to bed. We don't have a name for this mother and this daughter duo, so we're going to name

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:47.660
 the mother Sally, and she has an infant daughter, little Betty, little baby Betty. Sally walks

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:55.100
 up and puts Betty down in the bedroom. They share a bedroom, puts her in a little crib,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.960
 and then Sally's walking through the house, kind of finalizing everything before she finally

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.840
 goes to sleep herself. Now, as she's walking around the house, she's not laying in bed

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:09.860
 at this point. It is late. She is tired, but she is awake. However, she starts to feel

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:18.320
 like she's in a dream-like state. The event is already beginning. She has no idea what

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:28.820
 she's about to face. She sees out of her window a strange figure standing at her front door.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:35.300
 She describes it as an alien that we would describe nowadays as a gray alien. Large head,

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:41.140
 short and stature, big black eyes, kind of a frail looking frame. And this gray alien

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:50.680
 is wearing a gold outfit, like a gold tight-fitting suit. And this creature is trying to get into

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.320
 the apartment. She's actually seeing it turn the doorknob. Instantly panicked, right? You

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.040
 would be scared enough if you saw a stranger trying to get into your house, but this creature

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.560
 from beyond reality is outside trying to get into her house. So, Sally does what I think

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.380
 any parent would do. Her first concern is for her child. She runs into the baby's room

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:19.940
 and the baby is still sleeping. The baby is fast asleep in its little crib. And at that

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:27.780
 point, Sally turns around and there in the doorway of the bedroom stands the gray alien.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:38.520
 The gray walks over to the crib and scoops up baby Betty and spanks her super hard. Whack!

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:44.360
 Sally lunges for the child and now her and this gray alien are fighting over this baby

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:51.600
 who I'm assuming is awake at this point. She is fighting with this gray alien over her baby.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.760
 And gray aliens are physically very weak creatures. They do seem to have some sort of sonic.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.380
 Or telepathic blast which can freeze people. But you could grab a football, you could grab

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.620
 a baby, you could grab anything from a gray alien if you get close enough. And that mom

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:12.340
 has that mama bear energy and she closes that distance and she grabs that baby and her and

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:18.300
 the alien are tugging the baby back and forth until of course the mother overpowers him and

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:24.860
 safely grabs the baby away. Now she's holding her infant daughter on the roof of the apartment

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:33.320
 complex. She is looking around. She has no idea what just happened. She was just standing

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:39.640
 in her bedroom and now she's on the roof of the apartment complex. The endless night sky

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:46.800
 above her head. The cold December wind wrapping around her body. And as she's standing on

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:54.040
 the roof of this apartment complex, she looks and sees that the gray alien is there as well

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:59.720
 as two other humans. And she starts asking what is going on? Come on guy, what's going

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:07.060
 on? I need some help. And the two humans just stare straight ahead. Like they're in some

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:15.260
 sort of trance. They don't speak. They don't move. They're just standing there. Her attention

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:22.900
 turns back to the gray alien who pulls out a wand. Like a magician's wand. Small metal

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:30.400
 silo. And dips it into gold liquid. Which I guess is also up there like a little pot

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:38.640
 of gold liquid. Sticks it in the gold liquid and begins to swirl the wand. You're about

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.760
 to taste this. This is clearly a dream. Hold on. Hold on. The gray alien dips it into the

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:53.740
 The gold liquid begins to swirl the wand around and it starts to make a "Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.240
 sheen sound.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:05.200
 As the grey alien is doing this overhead, a large saucer-shaped UFO begins to materialize.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:13.840
 Since the UFO is completely solid, once it is now totally entered our reality, a blue

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:24.040
 light shoots out of this UFO at an angle and a blue staircase materializes, leading up

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.440
 into the UFO.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:35.360
 Sally has no memories of what happened next.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.960
 I got this story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com, they got it from Duane Bettle who wrote about

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.440
 this in Heartland UFO Journal #3 which was published back in December 1994.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:56.040
 What I love about this story is that, one, it shows- listen, I'm totally anti-alien,

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.040
 right?

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.880
 I love the stories, but I am pro-earth.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.000
 Earth first, baby.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.880
 I will go toe to toe with a grey or a reptilian or a pleiadian any day.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.440
 I'm a human superiority advocate.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.280
 But I also understand- I love humans more than I love whales, but I also know that a whale

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.760
 could kill a human if it wanted to, or a shark could kill a human or anything like that.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.400
 So I also respect the amount of power that these aliens have.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.720
 This is completely reality warping power.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:37.080
 Hearing in the house, teleporting multiple people at once, materializing the UFO out of

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.200
 nothingness was at some sort of cloak, was at entering our dimension.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.440
 She could physically overpower this grey alien and she did, but it did not matter.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:53.280
 The raw power of aliens is always very, very interesting to me.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:59.920
 Because I'd love to do an Independence Day scenario or a V scenario or a Battle Los

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.920
 Angeles scenario where humans are overpowering our alien oppressors.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.240
 But that's all dogfights with UFOs.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.320
 That's not what it would be like.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.020
 That's how we can think it would be like, because that's how we battle each other.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:18.000
 But imagine trying to shoot a heat-seeking missile at a vehicle that can just dematerialize

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.240
 and then rematerialize behind you and then all of a sudden you're sitting in a library.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:29.000
 You were in an F-22 fighter jet and now you're sitting in an undening library with rows and

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.840
 rows and rows of people just frozen in time.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.600
 What library is this?

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.600
 Where am I?

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.160
 Do I have an overdue book?

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.600
 That's the raw power of these aliens.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.960
 How do you fight something like that?

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.640
 How do you fight something that can just warp reality?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.840
 And what I also find super intriguing about this story is this is the stuff as crazy as

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.620
 it is.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.240
 This is the stuff she remembers.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.960
 This is the stuff that her brain allowed her to process.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:09.960
 Because when we talk about aliens missing time, people not remembering events, you can

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:15.720
 say the aliens have some sort of technology or some sort of ability to wipe your memories.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.840
 But remember a lot of times when these people undergo hypnosis they can re-remember them.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.760
 So whatever this technology is or disability is, it's not foolproof.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.740
 That's one possibility that the aliens are a wipe in our mind.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:34.240
 As a paranormal investigator myself, I deal far more in ghosts and demons than I do in

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.040
 UFOs and Bigfoot.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.200
 On the ground research on that stuff.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.120
 I used to be an on the ground ghost hunter.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.000
 I know for a fact.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.140
 I've seen it happen to myself and I've seen it happen to friends of mine on these ghost

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.140
 hunts.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.720
 Your brain can only process so much crazy.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.760
 Your brain will actually, it has fail safes in it.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.360
 It's like, nope, I didn't see that.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.760
 That's impossible.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.480
 It's happened to me.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.640
 And I believe in all sorts of stuff.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:11.400
 Like I said on Monday's episode, I believe people can get turned into trees.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.560
 And there have been times where I've encountered things, my brain goes no.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.480
 Like leave, get out of here, run.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.080
 And then weeks, months later, I'll just be sitting there hanging out and all of a sudden

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.560
 this vision will come over me.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.640
 And I was like, oh, that's what I saw.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.720
 Did I ever tell you guys that story when I was in my apartment and it was full of all

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720
 this negative energy?

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.520
 It's a long story.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.240
 I had like this insane roommate.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.280
 He was like just nuts.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:47.120
 And this was back when I was really, really like playing around with like magic, not magic

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.840
 the gathering, which is a fun game, but like trying to do like rituals and stuff like that.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.840
 I was in my apartment.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.200
 I was there with my buddy Liz.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.080
 I actually wasn't staying there at this point.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.040
 I just was like full of stuff that I needed to move out, but I was still paying rent on

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.120
 the place and I was living somewhere else.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.320
 And I have two apartments at one point.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.080
 And we went back to this place, went back to my place and I walked in and I immediately

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.720
 felt uneasy.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.000
 I hadn't been there for a while.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 My roommate was nuts.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 I kicked him out.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 I changed the locks.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.400
 He crawled in through the window.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.760
 And I remember I went in there and I felt uneasy.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.320
 I go, I don't feel good here.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.440
 And Liz is like, oh, whatever.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:33.600
 She's never like, she's easily spooked, but she didn't believe in ghosts as much as I

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.240
 did.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.360
 And so we went into the apartment and I was getting some stuff to take to my other apartment.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.880
 And I remember I was like, I have to go to the bathroom.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880
 Now that's always a trend.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.200
 This episode might run a little long.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.560
 I didn't plan on telling the story.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.400
 That's always a trigger though.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:54.120
 A lot of times when you're in an area of paranormal activity, when you're ghost hunting, and I

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.120
 never tell people this.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.120
 I don't tell people this.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.640
 I shouldn't warn them because one of the things when you're doing a ghost hunt is you

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.120
 don't want to feed them information.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:09.200
 If you say we're going to go to this place where a witch was brutally murdered 200 years

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.840
 ago.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.920
 Sometimes they say when you look into the Bubbling Creek underneath Dead Witch Bridge,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.920
 you'll see her face.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.480
 Obviously, when you feed someone a scary story, they'll be looking for that.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.640
 And you can actually implant that in your head.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:28.120
 My technique was if I saw something, I would turn to someone else and go, do you see that?

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.520
 And they'll go, yeah dude, it looks like a shadow.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.480
 Looks like an 8 foot tall shadow standing over there.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480
 What is?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.680
 Is there someone over there?

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.360
 That's exactly what I saw too.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.320
 See, I know what I see.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.000
 I have someone else describe it to me.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.200
 Now I know it's a real phenomenon.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.320
 I know that it's not a trick of the like as we're standing at different angles.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.280
 I know that I'm not going insane.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.320
 And so, oh, oh, so one of the things that I've learned is that when you're with a group

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:03.080
 of people, if one or more people suddenly have to urinate, it's weird.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.760
 I know people are like Jason, you've said a lot of crazy stuff on this show.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.600
 I think I might have mentioned this before.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.880
 If you or multiple people have to urinate, it can be either you just drink a bunch of

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:21.280
 water or that there's a paranormal event of hearing manifesting.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.120
 I don't know what the mechanism is behind it.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.640
 I always thought it could be why people say they piss their pants when they're so scared,

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.560
 but then also people get so scared they actually piss their pants.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.560
 It's a weird thing.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.840
 And I remember being over here and all of a sudden I have to urinate.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.880
 It's not every time, just to be clear, it's not every time I have to go to the bathroom

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.720
 and I'm like, oh, there's a good ghost.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.800
 It's a certain set of circumstances.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.800
 But over here, all of a sudden I had to go to the bathroom.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:55.320
 I went to the bathroom and I came out and I was just overwhelmed with fear.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.000
 I came out of the bathroom and I was completely overwhelmed with fear and I was like, go,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.560
 go, go, go, we're out of here.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.560
 Liz was like, ah, she was still picking stuff up to take, right?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.680
 Go, go, go, go, go.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.680
 And we left.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.920
 And I remember it was probably like a couple weeks later, if not like a month or two later,

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.920
 I was hanging out.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.840
 I was sitting on the couch at my other apartment.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.600
 I wasn't in that old apartment anymore.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:24.200
 And all of a sudden I remembered opening the bathroom door of my old apartment.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:29.040
 So I had a memory now of what scared me so badly.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.360
 I remember opening the bathroom door after I went to the bathroom and standing in the

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:42.320
 hallway was maybe, I'm really bad with ages, but maybe like a 10 year old boy with no face.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.460
 Not like no features.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.280
 Not like it was just a smooth face.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.240
 He was skinned.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.880
 I could see the muscle tissue.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.600
 I could see where the teeth went into the gums.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.800
 It was like someone had flayed him.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.320
 Somebody completely removed his face.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.120
 I remember opening that bathroom door and looking down and seeing this boy, maybe a little older

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.120
 than 10.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.400
 I didn't ask him his age.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.640
 I left.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:12.920
 But I didn't remember why I was so scared for a long period of time because my brain was

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.400
 like, no, dude, that's it.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.540
 Like, we're not going to let you see this.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.940
 And the thing is, is when I was sitting on the couch when I remembered that, I wasn't

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.060
 even thinking about it.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.100
 I wasn't thinking, oh, I wonder what I saw.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.660
 I had completely, because I've been in areas before and said, oh, this is creepy.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.660
 And then I leave.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:34.380
 And this was just a fear that crawled into me.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.060
 This terror that would just seem to radiate from right in front of me.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.020
 And I was like, we're out.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.080
 I wasn't thinking about it.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.640
 Just chalked it up to, it was a weird apartment.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.320
 But weeks or months later, again, I don't remember.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.960
 It wasn't two, it wasn't like years later, but I remember sitting there and I was completely

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.960
 relaxed just hanging out.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:04.000
 And then all of a sudden I remembered myself opening the bathroom door and looking down

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.560
 and seeing this.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.160
 You know what's funny now that I say, when I'm looking down, I didn't, because it was

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:16.020
 a 10 year old boy, but I remember almost looking at it face to face.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:22.620
 I mean, I guess if you're a phantasm from beyond the grave, maybe he was floating?

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.620
 I don't know.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.100
 I remember opening, I don't remember opening the door and looking down.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:31.900
 I remember opening the door and seeing him, whether he was floating or whatever caused

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.900
 that.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.220
 We're looking face to face and he had no face.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.220
 He'd been skinned.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.160
 He had hair, which must have been super uncomfortable.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.680
 You have this giant open wound and you have bangs and it's constantly getting in there.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.340
 I can laugh about it now.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.800
 I ran out of there.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.900
 Go, go, go, go, go.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.400
 My brain finally goes, "Oh, we'll let you remember that."

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.280
 Like, again, I wasn't thinking about it.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.080
 I just chalked it up to creepy apartment.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.980
 That was the same apartment I talked about this on the show a long time ago, where that

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:09.580
 one day I came home and I opened the door and I was sitting on the couch.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:15.060
 I remember opening the door and seeing myself sitting on the couch and me on the couch gets

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:20.220
 up and we start both walking towards each other and then I don't remember what happened

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:25.580
 next.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:30.420
 What's funny is I remember that happening and I still have a fear of that happening

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.420
 again.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:39.700
 I won't say it happens every time I come home, but it's not super rare when I'm coming home

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:44.980
 and I open the door and I'm thinking, "What if I'm sitting on the couch again?"

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.940
 It pops into my head at a pretty regular event.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.540
 What if I come home and I'm sitting there working on my computer and I turn and look?

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.540
 It's super weird.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.540
 It's a weird apartment.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.100
 It was on Sunrise Avenue.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.100
 It was on Sunrise Avenue.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.260
 Over where Tom Thumb used to be.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.260
 Sunrise and what is that?

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.260
 Is it on the middle of the road?

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:06.700
 Anyways, if you guys want to go get an apartment out there, be careful because one of them might

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.700
 be haunted.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:14.700
 Sorry, that ran a little bit longer, but this is what she remembered.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.340
 As insane as this is, this is what she remembered.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.880
 So what happened on the ship?

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:31.580
 What was so insane, so mind-bending, so soul-crushing that her brain said, "Nope, you can remember

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.580
 the staircase.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.820
 You can remember the alien.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.300
 You can remember the wand.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:42.860
 You can remember the two humans, but you cannot remember what happened on the ship.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.860
 You can't.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.420
 It will break you."

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:53.920
 What insane things did she see aboard that ship?

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.360
 What did they do to her and her daughter?

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:04.480
 We'll never know because she doesn't know.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:14.480
 And she doesn't know because if she knew, it may drive her insane.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:22.740
 The raw power of the aliens that seem to visit Earth on a fairly regular basis should never

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.760
 be underestimated.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.180
 We can make all the movies we want of aerial combat dogfights with UFOs and some of the

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:36.660
 aliens deciding to fight against their own to join the humans.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:42.100
 We can make whole series about the giant, zentrally alien invaders being defeated by

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:48.160
 the power of love and the technology of Robotech.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:56.040
 But the reality of it is, is that these aliens are so powerful.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:04.020
 It's possible the war will be won without either side ever firing a shot.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:11.320
 There may come a day where you just wake up, trapped in a pitch black room.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:17.800
 You scream out for help and your screams are answered by the echoes of thousands of other

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.020
 screams, hundreds of thousands of other screams.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.180
 You are now a prisoner of the alien invaders.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:32.100
 And you didn't even have a chance to fight back.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:42.200
 They just warped reality so much that they took us over in a heartbeat.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:47.560
 The only thing you can hope for now, the only thing you can hope for now is that when the

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:54.200
 aliens come to your cargo container to pull you out for whatever insidious experiment they

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.880
 have planned for you.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:06.380
 The only thing you can hope for, whatever they do to you, you pray that you don't remember

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:13.220
 it.
