00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,880
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,680
 - The mystery of Jeffrey Epstein deepens,

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,240
 as a bizarre photo surfaces online.

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,440
 And then finally, we discuss a conspiracy so obscure,

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,160
 it's not even on the iceberg.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,320
 What happened in Paris on December 29th, 1902?

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,520
 What caused the Paris time gap today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,040
 - You don't wanna sleep down?

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
 Actually, I'm a walkie-talkie.

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,620
 (upbeat music)

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,600
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,680
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,720
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,840
 I'm having a great day.

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,680
 We got some more patrons.

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,080
 Is it Patreon's?

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,480
 We have Jeremy Davis,

32
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,160
 Kaden S.,

33
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,400
 William Herman,

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,520
 and Reese's Pieces, Delicious Candy.

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,040
 They've done a lot of stuff with Reese's.

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,760
 I don't think the candy itself

37
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,640
 is now one of my patrons,

38
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,240
 but they've done some delicious,

39
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,880
 he might be, he might be a,

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,800
 no, that's the M&Ms, the big talking M&M,

41
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 but he may be made of Reese's Pieces.

42
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,720
 What I'm trying to get at is

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,960
 they've done a lot of interesting thing

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
 with Reese's Pieces over the years.

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,680
 They've stuffed them in other candy.

46
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,560
 I had a Hershey's Bar with Reese's Pieces in it

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,080
 the other day, it was quite yummy.

48
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,480
 So thanks again, and again, not the candy.

49
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,440
 The candy itself is not supporting the show,

50
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,520
 but again, if it is, it's a delicious treat.

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,480
 So thank you for supporting the show.

52
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,680
 Thank you, thank you very much.

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,280
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today,

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,760
 so we're gonna just jump right into it.

55
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,080
 Now, the first story we're gonna talk about,

56
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,280
 was sent to me by my buddy Carson,

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
 and he said, "Have you heard about

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,880
 "the newest wrinkle in the Jeffrey Epstein case?"

59
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,000
 I don't know if he put it like that.

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,480
 I don't know if he's like, "Oh, good chap, have you heard?"

61
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
 Like he just, he just sent me a link, actually.

62
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,200
 I don't even know if he commented on it.

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
 But thanks, Carson, for the link.

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,280
 What it is, is that, so Jeffrey Epstein is dead.

65
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,120
 And the official story is he killed himself.

66
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,440
 They said that his neck,

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,760
 part of his neck bone was broken,

68
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,440
 which often happens in strangulations,

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,760
 but it can happen when you commit suicide.

70
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,600
 Who knows?

71
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,000
 Like, there's no videotape that they've released

72
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,600
 of anyone walking into the cell, if it exists.

73
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,440
 Da-da-da-da-da.

74
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,840
 That is still a mystery going on.

75
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,680
 But another mystery is that Jeffrey Epstein had,

76
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,320
 and let me say, if you're not familiar

77
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,440
 with who Jeffrey Epstein is,

78
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
 I did an episode on him a while back,

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,680
 but Jeffrey Epstein was a millionaire financier in America,

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,400
 who had a side gig of trafficking young girls

81
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,080
 to very, very powerful people.

82
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,680
 And he got arrested, and he was sitting in jail,

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
 waiting to be tried, and then he dies.

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,600
 People have thought that a powerful person had him killed.

85
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,640
 People think that he killed himself.

86
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,040
 And there's always the option that he did kill himself

87
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,320
 because he was being threatened.

88
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,600
 Like, if you don't kill yourself,

89
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,720
 your loved ones will be killed.

90
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,320
 So there's a couple different variations

91
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,200
 of what could have went on there.

92
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,400
 But that's the backstory.

93
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,900
 So anyways, he had an accomplice named Guy Laine.

94
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,680
 Guy Laine?

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,800
 Maxwell.

96
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
 And she is currently being sought after by the authorities.

97
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,900
 They wanna talk to her because you, here's the thing,

98
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,240
 someone has to pay for those crimes.

99
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,920
 Justice Department doesn't want the case to just go away.

100
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,080
 The victims who are trying to sue her,

101
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,200
 and one of them successfully did sue her,

102
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
 got a settlement out of court.

103
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,320
 They want to see justice done.

104
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,760
 Since Jeffrey Epstein's out of the picture,

105
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,800
 she's the next target.

106
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,760
 People are looking for her.

107
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,160
 And it will, last week, a photo of her appeared online.

108
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,440
 And it's her sitting at what appears to be some sort of,

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,420
 like, burger restaurant, some sort of restaurant in LA.

110
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,400
 And she's sitting there, she's facing the camera.

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,940
 The way she looks, it's really weird.

112
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,200
 You know, there's people who look at the camera

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,360
 when their photo's being taken.

114
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,320
 And then there are people who, like, stare into your soul

115
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,520
 as the photo's being taken.

116
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,720
 That's this picture.

117
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,880
 It's really hard to talk about a photo on a podcast,

118
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,720
 but she's really, you look at it and it looks,

119
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
 she looks alive in the photo.

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,720
 It's quite odd.

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,560
 Quite odd.

122
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,440
 So she's sitting at this burger restaurant.

123
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,560
 And the story behind the photo is someone was sitting

124
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,360
 at this burger restaurant as well.

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,440
 And they recognized her and they pulled out their iPhone

126
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,300
 and snapped a quick picture of her.

127
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,200
 But a lot of details have come to light

128
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,000
 that make that story very, very, very suspect.

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,800
 So there's a photo before that photo was taken.

130
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
 There's a photo of her kind of like,

131
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,120
 rustling, like, looking through her purse or something

132
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,600
 like that, kind of looking down.

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
 But that's not the first photo that surfaced.

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
 The first photo that surfaced was the one

135
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,760
 where she's staring at the camera.

136
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,280
 But in between the photo, when she's not really

137
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,480
 paying attention and the one that she's gazing

138
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,680
 into your soul, she changes her hairstyle, which is,

139
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,200
 I mean, it's not like it doesn't go into like a beehive.

140
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,260
 It's not super drastic, but you can tell she did her hair.

141
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,100
 Excusable.

142
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,800
 If you know someone's taking your picture,

143
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,320
 you might kind of, you know, not gonna take time

144
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,460
 to put on your makeup, but you may kind of fix your hair.

145
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,400
 But in the first photo, there is two people eating.

146
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
 There's, she's surrounded by about three tables.

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,880
 We see three different groups of people eating

148
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,440
 in this outside restaurant.

149
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,080
 In between the time the first photo was taken

150
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
 and the second photo was taken,

151
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,440
 the people directly behind her have changed.

152
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,560
 So a couple of minutes would have had to pass

153
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,640
 between the two photos.

154
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,560
 Again, not entirely suspicious, but odd nonetheless.

155
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
 How much time was there between these two photos?

156
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,120
 At the table she's sitting at, there's two trays

157
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,760
 with two soft drinks.

158
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,840
 So people are wondering, who was she there with?

159
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,200
 Does she buy, would they have like a buy one, get one free?

160
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,760
 And she just loves a good bargain.

161
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,280
 So she got both of them.

162
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,240
 People know where this location's at

163
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,440
 'cause they can see all the landmarks behind her.

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,640
 And the authorities are looking for her

165
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,680
 and then internet sleuths are looking for her,

166
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
 people who represent the victims are looking for her.

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
 So they start digging into this

168
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,560
 and they wanna know when the photo was taken.

169
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
 At the bus stop behind her, there is a movie poster

170
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
 for a movie called "The Good Boys,"

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
 which I guess is some new movie coming out

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
 or came out last weekend or something like that.

173
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,920
 And someone goes, you know what?

174
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,200
 Let's find out when that movie poster was put up.

175
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,560
 So then we have a earliest date

176
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,640
 that this photo could have possibly been taken.

177
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,720
 Taken a month ago, it's not too much of a lead.

178
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,720
 But if it's been taken after Jeffrey Epstein died,

179
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,200
 now we have something.

180
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,960
 Somebody calls up the advertising company and says,

181
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,360
 "Hey, we wanna know when the poster for "The Good Boys"

182
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,880
 went up at this bus stop."

183
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,960
 And they save the location and the advertising company goes,

184
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,160
 "The Good Boys," why?

185
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,040
 That poster died 100 years ago today.

186
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,640
 No, what they said was actually a little weirder.

187
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,920
 Advertising company says that poster has never been there.

188
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,000
 About six weeks ago,

189
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,800
 there was a contract for a hospital ad

190
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,480
 to be on the side of that bus stop.

191
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,000
 And it's been up ever since.

192
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,160
 It's still up today.

193
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,280
 And before that,

194
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,720
 we didn't have a contract for "The Good Boys" poster.

195
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,720
 So somebody photoshopped that poster into the picture.

196
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,560
 See, now it's getting weird.

197
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,800
 First you're like, "Dude, she's doing her hair, no big deal."

198
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,160
 Somebody took an image of "The Good Boys" poster

199
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
 and digitally inserted it into the picture.

200
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,120
 Now, there's two reasons why somebody could have done that.

201
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,240
 The logical reason is this.

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
 The photo was taken quite a while ago.

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,640
 And the bus stop may have had an ad for an older movie,

204
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,160
 like "Endgame" or "Child's Play" or something like that.

205
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,920
 And the photographer said,

206
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,840
 "I need to make it look like this was taken more recently

207
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,680
 "to get more attention."

208
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,000
 So they digitally inserted in the "Good Boys" poster.

209
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Just assume no one would ever check on it.

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,880
 The second one is a little less likely,

211
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,600
 but considering the type of people we're dealing with

212
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,720
 might be true.

213
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,640
 We've talked a lot.

214
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,560
 I did an episode on Kevin Spacey's "Weirdo Christmas" video

215
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
 or Thanksgiving.

216
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,240
 It was Christmas, it was Christmas.

217
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,200
 His "Weirdo Christmas" video where he was talking about

218
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,920
 like, "I'm gonna get, holy y'all," in that "Weirdo" voice.

219
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,040
 And I got a lot of flack on that video

220
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,680
 'cause I said he's just a big weirdo

221
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
 and people were like, "No, no, it's Illuminati.

222
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
 "See, Tanik, he's sending all these coded messages.

223
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
 "See how he washes his hands three and a half times?

224
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,760
 "That's a Masonic number."

225
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,320
 But this one, you have this photo

226
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,600
 that you know is going to be very popular.

227
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,680
 It's gonna be shared all over the media.

228
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,920
 You could include hidden messages in that photo

229
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,440
 that only select people

230
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
 what to understand what that message was.

231
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,760
 So you have this image that's shot very, very well.

232
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,840
 That's another thing he said.

233
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,440
 This photo was not taken on an iPhone

234
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,400
 because of the depth of field.

235
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,160
 The way that, I don't know anything about photography,

236
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,520
 but they were saying the way everything is picked up

237
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,720
 by the camera, you would need a professional camera

238
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,560
 to do this.

239
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
 It's not something you could pull out your iPhone 6

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
 and take a picture.

241
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,640
 It's just, it doesn't have the lens capability for this.

242
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,320
 I don't know if that's necessarily true,

243
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,020
 but that's a statement that's going around.

244
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,480
 But you could have someone, you could have Maxwell saying,

245
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,560
 "Listen, I gotta get a message out to somebody."

246
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
 And the code word is good boys or boys.

247
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,960
 So I have to have that phrase somewhere in there.

248
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,040
 She could be starting, I mean,

249
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,280
 you're talking about someone who allegedly,

250
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,240
 she was involved in child trafficking

251
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,080
 and now she's sitting behind a poster

252
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,720
 that never existed that says the good boys.

253
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,600
 So she could be starting a side business.

254
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,760
 She could be sent, that could be a code word

255
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,520
 for somebody else that she needs help or good boys.

256
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
 You take GB, that means she's in Great Britain.

257
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,700
 You could have all sorts of stuff.

258
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,080
 You have all these little clues in this picture

259
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
 that will slide over most people.

260
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,240
 And if someone hadn't tried doing due diligence

261
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,520
 and finding out that poster never existed,

262
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,240
 people would just think it was the correct movie poster.

263
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
 But the fact that we know that that movie poster

264
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,200
 wasn't there when that picture was taken

265
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,040
 means they're either trying to make it look like

266
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,440
 she was there more recently,

267
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,640
 or it is a coded message that somebody in the know

268
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,200
 would know how to decipher.

269
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,080
 Weird stuff.

270
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,400
 The story of Jeffrey Epstein,

271
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,200
 I think is going to be going on for quite a long time.

272
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,680
 Lots of weird stuff going on.

273
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,260
 There are lots of powerful people involved.

274
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,560
 So we'll see how that shakes out.

275
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,280
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

276
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,440
 Now our next story, we are in France

277
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,480
 and we are in the year 1902.

278
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,720
 It is December 29th and it's 105 AM.

279
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,480
 And there's some dude across town named Pierre.

280
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,600
 And at 105 in the morning, he wakes up with a start

281
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,840
 and he goes, "Oh, my stomach.

282
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,600
 "Man, must have eaten some bad cheese and bread last night.

283
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,760
 "Oh, or earlier in the night, whatever.

284
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
 "Whatever will make the narrative make sense."

285
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,640
 And so he's like, "I better drink some wine.

286
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,760
 "I better drink some wine.

287
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,640
 "I'll feel better then 'cause I'm French."

288
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,040
 He starts walking through his house,

289
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,480
 going to his wine room.

290
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,880
 So he's walking by this big grandfather clock

291
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,680
 in his living room and he notices that it's stopped.

292
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,520
 Like what?

293
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,360
 That's weird.

294
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,760
 He's looking at it and the pendulum is no longer swinging.

295
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,720
 He's like, "Hmm, to get to the bottom of this mystery,

296
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,160
 "I'll need to drink some wine."

297
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,320
 So he starts drinking some wine.

298
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,360
 And he's like, "Oh, man, I love you, pendulum."

299
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,600
 But the next day he's telling his friend that he goes,

300
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,440
 "Yeah, it was really weird.

301
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,280
 "I woke up in the middle of the night and I got super sick."

302
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,400
 And the guy's like, "You drink wine, right?"

303
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,560
 He's like, "Oh, yeah, I drink a ton of wine,

304
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,600
 "but I still didn't feel good and to top it off."

305
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
 My clock stopped working.

306
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,760
 At that point, his French buddy spits out the wine.

307
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,280
 He was drinking and he's like, "Ooh, la la."

308
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,520
 That's shocking because I should be doing a French accent

309
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,360
 this whole time, but I didn't.

310
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,960
 And that's shocking because my clock has stopped.

311
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,280
 (laughing)

312
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,480
 That sounds more like Count Dracula.

313
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,080
 It sounds like the Count from Sesame Street.

314
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,120
 My clock stopped at the same time.

315
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,520
 One, ho, ho, ho, one.

316
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,360
 It stopped at one.

317
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,840
 And the guy's like, "Dude, just knock it off.

318
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,960
 "So quit doing that crazy accent."

319
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
 He's like, "Sorry."

320
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,240
 His clock also stopped at 105

321
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,680
 and he also woke up in the middle of the night

322
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,120
 not feeling good.

323
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,880
 So the story started to spread through the city of Paris

324
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,040
 that a good amount of people in the city

325
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,720
 woke up around 105, sick to their stomach.

326
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,520
 People who were awake at that time got sick to their stomach.

327
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,440
 And across the entire city,

328
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,280
 all the pendulums stopped swinging at 105 AM.

329
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,160
 In Paris, there's this thing called the Foucault's Pendulum

330
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,720
 or Foucault's Pendulum.

331
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,440
 It's in a place called the Paris Pantheon.

332
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,080
 And it is a pendulum that moves, it's a pendulum,

333
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,240
 so it swings back and forth,

334
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,840
 but it's based on the rotation of the earth.

335
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,280
 The energy of the earth rotating is what makes it move

336
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,920
 ever so slightly back and forth.

337
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,800
 Now that one, you wouldn't actually be able to tell

338
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,640
 when it stopped, but all the clocks,

339
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,680
 all the pendulum clocks stopped at 105.

340
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,620
 If you had a clockwork clock, if that makes sense,

341
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,360
 that kept going.

342
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,760
 So you had this mystery in the city of Paris

343
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
 of a good amount of the population becoming nauseous

344
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,760
 and the pendulum stopping at 105 AM.

345
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,440
 That is the story of the Paris time gap.

346
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,280
 Now I had read that story online

347
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,880
 and I thought that's interesting.

348
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
 So of course, I started digging into it more.

349
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,920
 And what I find almost immediately is that people say,

350
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,200
 this story is made up, it never happened.

351
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,360
 This story appeared on a Netflix show called

352
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,560
 Top 10 Secrets and Mysteries.

353
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,480
 And people are like, that show makes stuff up.

354
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,720
 It tells some stories that are true

355
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
 and some stories that are false.

356
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,800
 Some stories that are exaggerated

357
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,760
 because it's basically a clickbait type show on Netflix.

358
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,920
 Top 10 secrets and mysteries.

359
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,020
 And this was on the episode Big City Mysteries.

360
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,480
 So I was like, okay, I will have an episode

361
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,400
 about once again, a story that is made up,

362
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,720
 infiltrating the real life paranormal

363
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
 and conspiracy world and how people get confused

364
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,220
 about these things, myself included,

365
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,400
 like lone pine devils and things like that.

366
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,680
 Stories we come across that are 100% fake

367
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,440
 and were made up very, very recently

368
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,040
 that are starting to filter into the lore

369
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,560
 of the conspiracy realm.

370
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,940
 And I went to bed.

371
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,080
 And last night, the book of Giants episode

372
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,520
 was running late 'cause it was much longer

373
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,360
 than what you guys heard.

374
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,180
 I took out a bunch of stuff and I went to bed late

375
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,300
 and I laid there on the couch and I couldn't sleep.

376
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,420
 And I go, you know what?

377
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,220
 Since I can't sleep anyways,

378
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,340
 I'm gonna find out what the earliest reference

379
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,900
 is to the Paris Time Gap.

380
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,780
 Because if there is no reference to the Paris Time Gap

381
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,400
 before the airing of that show or nearby it,

382
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,340
 then Netflix did make it up.

383
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,740
 But if I can find something predating the show,

384
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,040
 there's another mystery going on here.

385
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,720
 I started looking more into the Paris Time Gap.

386
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,020
 And again, people are saying this is a Netflix show.

387
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,220
 You go to Quora and they're like, is this true?

388
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,760
 No, it's because you'll find a lot of articles

389
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,900
 that talk about the story I just told you.

390
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,680
 And then when people ask more about it,

391
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,040
 it dead ends at Netflix.

392
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,640
 Some people have said, well, there was an H.U. Wells story

393
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,920
 back in like 1898 or something like that

394
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,420
 called The Man Who Stopped the World.

395
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,040
 And it could have been based on that as well.

396
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,960
 But there was no reference to pendulums in it

397
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,540
 or Paris or anything like that.

398
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,760
 That I could see that no one else pointed out.

399
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,720
 Everyone just said this was a Netflix show.

400
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,080
 So I looked up how to start off with this.

401
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,760
 The Netflix show aired on March 15th, 2019.

402
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
 That's the first time you could download it.

403
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,400
 It was season two of that show.

404
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,600
 So I figured maybe there was a reference to it

405
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,920
 a little bit before that time as Netflix

406
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,040
 did make up the story and they're trying

407
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,960
 to create a little coverage for them.

408
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,720
 They could throw up a couple blogs

409
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,000
 and then they release the episode.

410
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
 What I found is a bunch of the stories

411
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,980
 that talk about this took place

412
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,740
 after the airing of that episode with two exceptions.

413
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,900
 Because even if one of the stories had appeared

414
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,220
 a couple months before that episode,

415
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,060
 I would figure it was just them creating the mythology.

416
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,060
 But December 23rd, 2016, so well before the show came out.

417
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,780
 I think that's even before the first season

418
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,980
 of the show came out.

419
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,180
 There was a poster called Moonschild on the Amino website

420
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,100
 which is kind of like a blogging type website.

421
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,260
 You put up whatever you want.

422
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,560
 Moonschild specifically does short articles

423
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,120
 about paranormal and conspiracy events.

424
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,620
 Ghosts, Bigfoot, Spectre, stuff like that.

425
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,680
 There's an extra detail in her version of the story.

426
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,160
 She says that this whole story was documented.

427
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,240
 The reason why people know about it today,

428
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,720
 and I would argue nobody knows about it.

429
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,920
 This is one of the most obscure conspiracy theories

430
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,360
 that I've come across that was aired on television.

431
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,840
 'Cause well, you know, monkeys don't exist

432
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,300
 as an incredibly obscure conspiracy theory.

433
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,320
 Forests aren't real.

434
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,740
 Those are both obscure conspiracy theories.

435
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
 They have no mainstream appeal.

436
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,340
 They do, but the mainstream doesn't know about them.

437
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,920
 This one was aired on Netflix.

438
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,580
 A lot of people are talking about it now.

439
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,480
 She says this, she goes,

440
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,360
 "This first came to light in a journal

441
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,940
 called The Bulletin of Knowledge.

442
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,900
 It was a French journal and it was published in 1903.

443
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,780
 I began looking for the Bulletin of Knowledge.

444
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,220
 I couldn't find anything like that."

445
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,020
 Now a part of it could be that the fact

446
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,380
 that it's over 100 years old at this point.

447
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,840
 Part of the fact is there's gonna be translation issues.

448
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,800
 Because if I'm typing, I was Googling now

449
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,880
 at this point, it's two in the morning,

450
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,240
 I'm typing Googling Bulletin of Knowledge 1903,

451
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,520
 nothing's coming up.

452
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,480
 Bulletin of Knowledge 1903, France,

453
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,440
 trying to all this stuff, can't find anything.

454
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,920
 So we have that and everything else

455
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,640
 was the version of the story I just told you.

456
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,820
 And then she goes, "Oh yeah, and it came to light

457
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,600
 because of this Bulletin of Knowledge.

458
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,080
 I ended up messaging Moonschild on Amino

459
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,320
 asking for more information,

460
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,500
 but the last post that she made on that site was in 2017.

461
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,940
 So I doubt she even uses that site anymore.

462
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,340
 If she ever responds to me, I'll let you guys know.

463
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,780
 But that is not even the earliest mention of this story.

464
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,580
 So this popped up on March 30th, 2016.

465
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,020
 So same year, but a couple months earlier.

466
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,740
 There's a site called Prezi, which I believe is Russian

467
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,220
 because the author was writing in Russian,

468
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,180
 I had to run translate on this step.

469
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,060
 Prezi does sound like a Russian word as well,

470
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,580
 but there's a Prezi website.

471
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,100
 And what it is, is that you create

472
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,600
 PowerPoint-esque presentations on the website.

473
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,860
 So then when you tell someone,

474
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,380
 hey, check out this presentation,

475
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,840
 they just go to your web address.

476
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,560
 It's actually kind of a cool idea.

477
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,120
 I don't know if they have that in English

478
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,960
 or other countries.

479
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,120
 That way you don't have to send over a PowerPoint file.

480
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,880
 You can just say, "Hey, watch this presentation,

481
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,400
 click this mouse and I'll go through the slides

482
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
 on this website."

483
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,140
 And there's different graphics going on.

484
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,080
 This person's name is Tarasenko Evgesha.

485
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,480
 This is the oldest reference.

486
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,280
 I was looking all the way back to 2001.

487
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,700
 This is the oldest reference I could find on it.

488
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,580
 And usually before 2001 is really

489
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,180
 when the search engines were kicking off.

490
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,140
 That's usually, unless I'm looking for something really old,

491
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,660
 that's usually, well, I'll stop

492
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,860
 'cause you won't get much results.

493
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,420
 And going all the way back to 2001,

494
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,140
 and I put a limit that I couldn't find any mentions of it

495
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,100
 before 2019, is where I found these two guys.

496
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,380
 It was where I found these two sites.

497
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,020
 It was just these two that I could find

498
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,220
 before the Netflix show aired.

499
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,860
 This is what it says on this website.

500
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,680
 There's a little tiny PowerPoint display,

501
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,240
 and then there's the text of the PowerPoint display

502
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,880
 listed underneath the graphics.

503
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,320
 And this is what it says.

504
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,680
 There's gonna be some translation errors,

505
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,560
 some grammatical issues, but it just makes it even weirder.

506
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,680
 Paris fail.

507
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,200
 That's the title of the presentation.

508
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,320
 Mysterious and unexplained phenomenon.

509
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,320
 Observed in Paris on the night of 29 to 30 December 1902.

510
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,520
 History.

511
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,460
 That night, in many places in the city,

512
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,360
 in five minutes one o'clock,

513
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,100
 which is five minutes after one,

514
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,300
 so again, there's some translation errors here.

515
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,420
 That night in many places in the city,

516
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,600
 in five minutes one o'clock,

517
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,340
 simultaneously stopped wall pendulum clock.

518
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,420
 At the same time as written,

519
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,740
 Herald of Knowledge,

520
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,740
 many people feel nausea, dizziness, and fainting proximity.

521
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,060
 To this day, no one can unravel the mystery

522
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,000
 of this mystical event.

523
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,100
 Paris fail.

524
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,940
 Why?

525
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,240
 Bizarre.

526
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,520
 And I'm reading this as I'm starting to get tired.

527
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,260
 It's almost like a fever dream, reading that thing.

528
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,520
 Because it has the elements of the other story.

529
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,920
 The Herald of Knowledge,

530
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,880
 in the version that comes out months later,

531
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,040
 is known as the Bulletin of Knowledge.

532
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,200
 So I don't know if the French Bulletin was called the Herald.

533
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,400
 I don't know if that is a Russian to English trend,

534
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,140
 or like a French to Russian to English translation,

535
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,900
 Herald versus Bulletin.

536
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,060
 But we see the of knowledge.

537
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,940
 This is the earliest recording of this supposed event.

538
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,380
 And nowadays people are going,

539
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,820
 since the Netflix show came out,

540
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,540
 people have said what could have caused it?

541
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,700
 And these are the theories that popped out.

542
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,940
 There was a gravitational flub.

543
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,940
 There was a glitch in the gravitational area around Paris.

544
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,620
 And what was making people nauseous

545
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,040
 would be the equivalent of a drop on a roller coaster

546
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,840
 and your stomach goes into your throat.

547
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,040
 That's what was making people feel sick all of a sudden.

548
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,600
 And because of that gravitational sudden push or pull,

549
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,840
 all the pendulum clocks,

550
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,560
 which require gravity to help assist that little thing

551
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,220
 go back and forth, they stopped.

552
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,640
 People have said maybe there was a small earthquake.

553
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,720
 That's the most likely, if this thing existed,

554
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,520
 people would say that's the most likely scenario.

555
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,480
 There was a small earthquake

556
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,680
 that kind of rumbled everyone's tummy,

557
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
 and stopped the clocks.

558
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,900
 But there have been other earthquakes around the world

559
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,580
 and we haven't seen these two things happen back and forth.

560
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,960
 Then we get into the weird thing.

561
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,820
 Some people say that we were hit by a miniature neutron star

562
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,620
 and I don't know how you wouldn't have seen that,

563
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,140
 but the density of this new object coming into the earth

564
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,600
 again, affected the gravity of everything around it.

565
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,740
 Some people say it was some sort of alien experimentation

566
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,040
 gone wrong or right, maybe.

567
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,660
 But we're left with two questions.

568
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,500
 We're left actually,

569
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,980
 we're left with a lot of questions with this story.

570
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,300
 The first one is, did it happen?

571
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,080
 And that one is something

572
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,900
 that we'll probably never be able to figure out.

573
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,160
 But I think the story behind the story

574
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,660
 is equally interesting.

575
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,020
 So this person who put up this Prezi website,

576
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,940
 does this person, is this person the only one

577
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,900
 who ever knew this story before posting it?

578
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,380
 This person did do an other Prezi presentation

579
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,100
 and it was about the Russian language

580
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,700
 and synchronous city.

581
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,460
 I couldn't make heads or tails of it.

582
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,220
 It was about the circular logic of Russian language.

583
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,460
 'Cause then, I mean, this was a very, very long essay

584
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,020
 and there was a bunch of translation issues.

585
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,420
 I couldn't make heads or tails of it.

586
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,920
 So they put up two presentations.

587
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,860
 The other one wasn't about like ghosts or spookiness

588
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,900
 or aliens or anything like that.

589
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,380
 So you have that and you have this.

590
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,060
 Now it's possible that this was a joke they came up with,

591
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,420
 that this was some sort of short form science fiction story

592
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,780
 they wanted to tell.

593
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,780
 Who knows?

594
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,260
 I have no way of contacting this person.

595
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,300
 I tried searching for them and I couldn't find anything.

596
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,900
 Try, I was like, "Is there, do you have a Facebook?"

597
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,860
 Whatever, couldn't find anything on this person.

598
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,980
 Obviously, when you're in the conspiracy realm,

599
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,740
 there's one thing that I immediately went to

600
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,020
 when I heard the story.

601
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,300
 Actually, when I first heard the story,

602
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,420
 I was like, "That's an interesting thing.

603
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,820
 I wonder what caused it."

604
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,180
 But as I started digging into it

605
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,980
 and I realized there was a huge disconnect

606
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,860
 between the people who heard the story

607
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,580
 and the people who said the story was fake

608
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,860
 and it appeared in the Netflix special.

609
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,500
 And then you wonder where the Netflix people

610
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,020
 got ahold of it at?

611
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,500
 I would find it odd that Netflix,

612
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,380
 who's running two seasons of a show

613
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,500
 with all these mysteries,

614
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,740
 and they could have done anything about big city mysteries.

615
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,340
 They happened to find this one article

616
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,540
 written by Moonschild on Amino and said,

617
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,420
 "Let's do a segment on our show about that."

618
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,620
 And I find it hard to believe that Moonschild was on Amino

619
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,180
 and then one day she stumbled across the website on Prezi

620
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,220
 and said, "Oh, I'm gonna flesh that out.

621
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,760
 Herald of knowledge, I'll change that to Bolton of knowledge."

622
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,180
 Obviously, those are the most likely logical answers.

623
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,500
 As a skeptic, it is not impossible

624
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,700
 for that chain of knowledge to have taken place at all.

625
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,460
 It's unlikely, but not impossible.

626
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,460
 It's far more possible than the theories

627
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,220
 that I'm about to throw out.

628
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,340
 As I started to delve in the story, I started to think,

629
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,460
 "You know what this kind of seems like?

630
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,300
 It almost seems like a Mandela Effect type event.

631
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,740
 Mandela Effect is basically when people shift

632
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,100
 or entire groups, millions of people shift

633
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,740
 from one reality to another

634
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,780
 and everything is pretty much the same

635
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,900
 except for small details.

636
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,940
 And stick with me for a second.

637
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,380
 This is putting on my tinfoil hat here.

638
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,700
 What if those two glorious words for all of us

639
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,500
 who enjoy this type of stuff, what if

640
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:23,020
 Terasenko was doing a short history project on Prezi.

641
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,380
 Terasenko had been taught about the Paris time gap

642
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,880
 since they were a kid.

643
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,860
 They always knew what it was.

644
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,980
 It was this weird event.

645
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,660
 It was a Tunguska level event

646
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
 that everyone kind of knew about

647
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,460
 and people had questions about and so on and so forth.

648
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,780
 No one could explain it.

649
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,180
 But that event is unknown in this reality.

650
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,500
 Never ever heard of it.

651
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,140
 But Terasenko remembers it.

652
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,340
 And when they have to put together

653
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,420
 a little history presentation,

654
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,220
 this is what they talk about.

655
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,580
 Is it possible that Moonschild 2 is from a reality

656
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,620
 where this happened and it was detailed

657
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,620
 and you'd be able to Google it

658
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,780
 and you'd find mysteries of Paris.

659
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,980
 And they talk about the catacombs

660
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,580
 and they talk about these ghosts and they go,

661
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,340
 remember that time, but in our reality,

662
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,860
 those web pages don't exist

663
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,440
 because in our reality, that never happened.

664
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,380
 And you have enough people

665
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,580
 who shifted from that reality into ours

666
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,180
 who remember it as a weird event.

667
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,380
 In their reality, they may be like,

668
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,580
 they may come from reality

669
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,440
 where there was no Tunguska event,

670
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,980
 where there was no Diotlov pass.

671
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,980
 Some of our crazy experiences we've had,

672
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,820
 they have no idea.

673
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,640
 And when they hear about them, they go,

674
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,480
 what?

675
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,320
 I've never heard of that story before

676
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,100
 and you're like, really, it's kind of famous.

677
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,940
 Bunch of hikers wound up in mountains,

678
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,740
 a known compelling force squished them all.

679
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,780
 And you're like, oh, that's really, really interesting.

680
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,100
 Have you ever heard of the Paris time gap?

681
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,520
 And you'd be like, what are you talking about?

682
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,700
 But because we talk about such obscure topics,

683
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,380
 it is common for us to come across stuff

684
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,580
 we've never heard about before.

685
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,580
 But this might be the oddest thing I've stumbled across.

686
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,960
 Because I thought it had an easy answer

687
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,720
 and it turns out that there's more questions now,

688
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,120
 not just about the event,

689
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,840
 but how we know about the event in the first place.

690
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,400
 It would only take a handful of people

691
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,360
 to shift from one reality to another

692
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,560
 to start posting stuff, to spread these stories.

693
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,440
 And then eventually, they get told around enough forums

694
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,480
 that Netflix decides, oh, that's a weird story.

695
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,140
 And throws it into their special.

696
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,820
 But because everyone without a doubt today

697
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,780
 could say that never happened,

698
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,100
 one person was saying, listen,

699
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,940
 I'm a European history major.

700
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,940
 I've studied France.

701
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,500
 I've never heard of the story before.

702
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,060
 It has to be made up.

703
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,820
 People who have smitten their entire life in this reality

704
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,820
 would to the death say that story never happened.

705
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,620
 But to the refugees from that reality,

706
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,540
 it was a very, very well-known event.

707
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,980
 Sometimes it's not a question of did the event happen?

708
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,820
 Was it faked?

709
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,800
 Is this some sort of clickbait thing?

710
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,200
 Sometimes the question is, why did it happen?

711
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,520
 Was it a neutron star?

712
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,360
 Was it an earthquake?

713
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,840
 Was it some sort of gravitational mishap?

714
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,840
 But this one, this one almost defies these questions.

715
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,180
 From a PowerPoint website to a Netflix show,

716
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,880
 to being a growing, mysterious story

717
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,200
 that's being easily debunked

718
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,440
 'cause everyone just goes back to Netflix.

719
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,000
 The story of the Paris time gap has a lot of mysteries.

720
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,860
 Whether it happened or why it happened

721
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,760
 is almost irrelevant at this point.

722
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,100
 I think the question is, why do we know about it?

723
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,680
 Is this just a fictional tale?

724
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,800
 Is it clickbait?

725
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,540
 Or is it a sign that people from another reality are here?

726
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,760
 And they're wondering why no one else remembers.

727
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,060
 One of the biggest mysteries of their lifetime.

728
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,140
