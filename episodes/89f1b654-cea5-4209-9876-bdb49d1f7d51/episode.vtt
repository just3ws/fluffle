00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Duncan iced radio take one Duncan iced coffee is

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960
 Sorry one more time

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.080
 Duncan iced

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.240
 Kelly we're trying to record a timely summer focused radio spot for Duncan iced can you stop with the shaking?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.520
 But like this is the sound a Duncan ice makes maybe you should keep it in well

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.040
 Yeah, that's actually a pretty good idea

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.820
 Try all the Duncan refreshers iced coffees cold brews and lattes Duncan iced America runs on Duncan

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 Today we return to the city of Malta to take a trip underneath its tunnels to explore more of the mysteries that lie beneath that city

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.800
 I think and then we learn about one of the most disgusting urban legends

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.260
 That I've come across

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.660
 Does the country of Spain really have a problem with people eating other people's fat?

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.260
 To down dead rubber radio

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
 I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:11.580
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of dead rabbit radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.100
 I'm having a great day. Hope you're having a great day, too

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.300
 Yes, I did say eating other people's fat in the intro and doing other stuff with human fat

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 It's just gonna be a fat

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.540
 Stuck episode pretty gross stuff. We're gonna be getting to that in a moment, but first off

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.700
 Let us go to Malta now

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.180
 I'm gonna put a big asterisk next to the story because I'm pretty sure I covered this before

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.340
 This is one of the perils of doing a daily show

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.800
 I don't remember and I've tried all of my tricks to see if I've recorded this episode before you're like Jason

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 What tricks just simple memorization?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.860
 No, generally if you go to the website if you go to dead rabbit calm and go to the podcast page

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.620
 You'll see every episode I've ever recorded you can listen to online and you can even use the cert

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.740
 This isn't like a built-in pitch. This is what I do

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.620
 You can use the search tab and this is why it's so important for me to put show notes because I'll type in Malta or all

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.700
 Type in tunnels or I'll type in Russian or whatever it is and it'll pull up every episode that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.100
 Those words are in the show notes. So it's a really good resource for me

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.620
 And you can actually use it too if you're like what was that episode where he was talking about Larry David type in Larry David

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.020
 It'll pop up in the show notes. So all of that being said, I'm pretty sure I covered this before

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.340
 But I think I might have just read about it and never covered it. I don't know. It's totally messing with my head a conspiracy

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.740
 Maybe don't don't don't I should actually get a sound effect now. I like doing the noise instead

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.860
 Don't don't don't a conspiracy. Let's go ahead and though. Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.380
 We're driving to Malta now

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.260
 I'm gonna be honest with you guys and I don't think this will shock a single one of you. I'm not for sure where Malta is

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.540
 But oh, I know it's somewhere

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.460
 So you have the Middle East and then you have Europe and then there's that stuff in the middle

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:11.740
 I eat Italy Italy is technically part of Europe, but not really and so you have Italy and then I think Malta's somewhere around there

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.140
 I don't think it's in Italy

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.820
 Most likely an island if the Middle East is the Middle East and Europe is Europe. What's Greece and Italy?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.060
 Mediterranean oh

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.060
 There we go Mediterranean

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.960
 Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy. We're going to the Mediterranean country

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.460
 known as Malta in

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.580
 Malta there is a place called the how

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.580
 South Fellini

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:46.460
 Hypogium hypogium is a fancy word for tunnel or underground structure. So just call it tunnel

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.700
 Everyone knows what a tunnel is not everyone knows what a hypogium is

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.660
 There's three levels of caves underneath the city of Malta. Some people say there's more

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.420
 Some people say there's a lot more some people say that you go through some people say that the moon is made of cheese

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.860
 So some people say it's kind of useless

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.140
 But anyways, some people say you can go down to the third chamber and then there's this little like walkway

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.740
 That's like super tiny and you crawl through there and it opens to even lower portions of the city

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.980
 There's this old Freudian thing that people who like to be underground really want to crawl back into their mom's womb

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.060
 So like people who fantasize about building bunkers underground and stuff like that

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.120
 You really just want to crawl back inside of their mom

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.800
 So I don't know what I personally don't believe that but there are psychiatrists who if you said I'd really want to go to Malta

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.260
 Really want to walk around underneath the city of Malta for nine months. The psychiatrist is like hmm. Tell me more

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.300
 Apparently your psychiatrist is curming the frog the rainbow connection. So

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.300
 Anyways, also that says people who want to build like doomsday bunkers

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.140
 Does that mean like the entire US military living in that mountain where we keep the Stargate?

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.180
 They all want to crawl back into their mom's. I don't know. I think a lot of times psychiatrists just make stuff up

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.380
 And then other psychiatrists go. Oh, yeah, it's a great idea

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.460
 Let's let's also say that ridiculous thing

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.780
 But anyway, so apparently back in time everyone wanted to be back inside mom and

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:17.460
 They built this giant city underneath Malta or it was a survival mechanism because the city kept getting raided or they wanted to move old-timey drugs

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.660
 I wonder what old old I wonder what like Romans did for cocaine

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.660
 That all that stuff from South America, but I don't believe I don't think that Europe was like totally sober

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.080
 Like sure they drink like ale and mead, but you know there was like what was the old-timey equivalent of meth?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.300
 Because it was this is hear me out here for a second. You're like Jason don't go on these rants

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.540
 Tell me about the the ghost of Malta. I will in a second. So if

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:52.620
 Humanity never did methamphetamines or cocaine for 10,000 years or 100,000 years. We are cavemen

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.500
 We were bashing in the enderthal skulls. We take over the planet. We start building societies

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.500
 We're drinking a little ale on the side a little mead and then all of a sudden

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.340
 I just answered my own question, but I'm gonna go ahead and go on with this narrative all of a sudden in the year 1927

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:16.020
 People start doing methamphetamines. It should completely destroy it could should have completely destroyed people is this new thing

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.940
 It was totally different than what had happened before

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.380
 And I as I was explaining that to myself as I was thinking out loud

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.620
 I realized that actually did happen. I thought about doing an episode on this

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.580
 That's what happened with gin. That's what happened with gin. You had society drinking alcohol

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.060
 But it was I mean it was strong

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.060
 but it was like cider or

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:44.380
 Ale or mead stuff like that Conan's like kicking back casks of it and then going out and just smash and serpent dudes in half

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:52.300
 But then when gin when this super strong cheap liquor infiltrated Europe it completely destroyed

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.100
 economies and towns and stuff like that. I read this big article on

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.820
 Gin recently and though I guess this has become a gin episode, but it's just gone off memory

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:09.620
 I don't remember what the article was you basically the gin became such a problem that it was considered like the woman's disease or the

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.380
 The drink of wasting mothers because women would get so drunk on gin

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.700
 They would pass out and their babies would roll off their boobs like they're trying to breastfeed their baby and the baby would roll away

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:26.780
 Kids would just be wandering the street the parents were just completely lousy the whole time and the government wasn't doing anything about it

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:35.100
 You had these huge gin companies that weren't letting the government like regulate them and eventually got to the point where it became so it

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.580
 Reversed it became so like black market gin did

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.860
 That you had to go down a street corner

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:49.620
 You had to like go down a dark alley and there would be a hole in the wall and you would give someone like a copper coin

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.260
 Or whatever their pincis over there and then a ladle would come out with gin

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:59.780
 And you would put it in a cup and then walk down the street because originally was just something you go to the bar and

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.460
 Just just drink and it was super disgusting. I hate gin

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:09.020
 But they didn't think it was super disgusting that was me editorializing but you could go to the bar you could drink it

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.820
 It was called mother's ruin. That was this nickname for gin

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.640
 completely devastating England society and then

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:23.540
 It became this huge thing where you started regulating it and gin producing companies were getting shut down and

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.240
 Bars were getting shut down if they sold gin you couldn't sell gin anymore

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.700
 But that's what people were addicted to so you're having to drink it out of a dirty ladle in a street alley

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.900
 And now you can go to the you know

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:41.520
 Gas station or not gas station now you can go to a corner liquor store and get leaders of it and it's disgusting

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.080
 It's gross. It's made out of juniper berries, but actually that answers the question if you have a

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:53.140
 Society and then all of a sudden you introduce a new cheap drug and it's not reigned in right in the beginning

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.180
 It will destroy the society either. I don't want to keep going off on rants

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.440
 But I just saw a documentary about how meth fueled Nazi Germany

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.580
 There's crosstops are being given out to men and women here take these

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.980
 They'll keep your pep going and then Hitler was all junked up all the whole time

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.520
 Anyways, there's nothing to do with where we're going

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.860
 but I do wonder if there was an equivalent of old-timey like hardcore drugs in

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.980
 Roman era and Greek era that were not just like the oracles were doing it and tripping out and seeing you know

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:27.020
 Leonidas killing a bunch of Persians like something that was more easily accessible for the common person

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.580
 But it's just lost the history nothing to do with what we're talking about. We're in the city of Malta now, okay?

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.980
 And I just went on that huge rant as we're walking around a dark cave

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:43.780
 So apparently in these caves in Malta. I tell you this part of the story after I already tricked you to coming down here

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.780
 I got you drunk on gin. You're like

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.620
 Baby babies are falling off of you. You're like I didn't even know I was a mother

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.600
 There's a bunch of babies are rolling around in the dirt in front of you. I'm like pick those babies up

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.620
 Let's keep going apparently the story is this back in

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.380
 1940

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.380
 1940

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:08.220
 Malta there was 30 kids and their teachers. They went on a field trip now. They weren't from Iowa

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.940
 They're like, okay kids field trip. We're going to Malta

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.700
 They were already in Malta and the field trip was to go into the tunnels underneath the city

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.460
 Tell me this doesn't sound like an urban legend

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.500
 30 kids and their teachers go under a sea or a set of four jokes 30 kids and their teachers

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.380
 Go into underground vault and Malta and they're never found

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.380
 They go missing like a couple hours later when they're supposed to come back

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.920
 No one could find them they start sending search parties for them

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.380
 Can't find them and for days afterwards mothers throughout the city could hear their kids crying

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.740
 Apparently they're falling down they're falling down huge gaps

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.940
 But mothers were saying I can hear Bobby I can hear Bobby

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.980
 In this tunnel down here in the cops are like we're looking for a man. We're looking for him, but there's no Bobby

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.780
 There's no 29 other kids in there either and he's falling down a cliff apparently as well either

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.420
 So the idea is that this happened now

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.980
 Obviously that sounds incredibly stupid and that's why I get making jokes about kids falling down cliffs

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.020
 because

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.260
 The idea of 30 kids and two teachers going it's not like they were in the tunnels in

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.580
 What was that dude like in the Philippines?

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.380
 Remember recently those kids got trapped that tunnel is though they were filling up with water

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:34.380
 We found them and they were we didn't have any idea where these guys were they even they had an idea that they entered in

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.020
 To a cave, but even that was kind of spotty. I guess they knew that otherwise they wouldn't have checked caves

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.900
 They weren't looking up trees the whole time, but this place wasn't filling full of water is just a

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.540
 Not super well explored thing

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:52.580
 But the idea of 30 kids and their teachers just wandering into the tunnels and getting lost and then not being found no bones

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:59.580
 Nothing yet. You could hear the kids crying late at night. I mean you would just go hey stay there and I'm gonna dig down

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.380
 Problem solved so it sounds ridiculous

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.940
 however, this story was

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.740
 supposedly

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:13.580
 Published in the 1940 issue in a 1940 issue of National Geographic magazine

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.460
 and

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.460
 What's weird is that the people?

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.020
 Who dispute this story who goes there's nothing wrong?

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:25.860
 There's nothing spooky about the tunnels of Malta don't dispute the fact that it was published in National Geographic

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.900
 They say yes

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.460
 The story was published there what they dispute is

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:36.180
 The fact that it's true they go yes National Geographic did publish this article

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:42.660
 However, we believe they publish it as a cautionary tale to make it so kids don't get lost in these tunnels

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.540
 Since when is National Geographic posted fake news?

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:52.220
 They've never run a story watch out kids boogeyman on the loose in the cover is this holographic

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.660
 Holographic boogeyman coming at you boogeyman spotted in your hometown

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:03.300
 Ask your parents for more details come home before the street lights come on kids boogeyman, you know like they don't do that

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:09.840
 They don't post fake stuff to scare kids so they don't dispute that the article is real

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.480
 They just think that it can't be real just like how I assume they can't be real

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.700
 So if the National Geographic published it then there must have been another reason

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:23.500
 But here's the thing as much as I was joking about kids falling off cliffs and poking holes in the story

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.220
 The fact that National Geographic did cover it makes it sound more legit

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.340
 It doesn't make sense as logically as a story, but a major magazine

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.380
 It's been around for over a hundred years that focuses on

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.900
 Stuff around the world publish the story about it. So that's all in the show notes

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.740
 You can see the article yourself

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:51.660
 There's another component of the story before the kids went missing apparently there now this one is far more

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:57.260
 The lineage of this story is far more ridiculous. There's a woman a journalist named Laurie Jessup

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.740
 Oppositely, I mean, I don't know if this is a legit person or a pseudonym or whatever

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.540
 But anyways, so we have the first story was told by National Geographic magazine

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:13.500
 This one is told by Riley Krabs Riley Krabs borderland science magazine. So I mean like that is not a legitimate

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.620
 Invite any measure right? I'm sure it's a lovely magazine

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:23.140
 I'm sure it has a lot of great articles in it, but it's not where I'm going to get my historical information

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:32.260
 Laurie Jessup apparently writes for Riley Krabs borderland science magazine. She goes underground. She this story is absolutely ridiculous

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.700
 She goes underground

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.180
 She's pestering a tour guide. She has her little press cap on she's like come on guide

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.820
 Why don't you give me one of your private tours wink wink and he thinks she's coming on and she's like no

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:48.040
 I'm not that kind of broad not that kind of broad. I want to know the real scoop. I want to know the straight dope

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.220
 I want to know what's really in these tunnels and he's like dude, please you're the most irritating

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:58.180
 Journalist stereotype ever and she's like what do you say? What do you say? So he finally says yes, please go away

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.740
 I will allow you to go through this passage that I don't normally let people go through

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.380
 so she goes through this passage and

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:10.500
 Apparently a couple other people come with her now. This is 1940 so don't have flashlights. This is like old-timey stuff

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.260
 Apparently she's carrying a candle. I don't believe that. I don't believe that at all

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.460
 I've never seen a human carry a candle

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.940
 You know why because you get hot wax over you and you're like Jason now you're just splitting hairs

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:28.660
 Maybe she had some sort of candle holder fine. She's walking with now. She all of a sudden has a candle abra

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.500
 Underground she's walking through fan with the opera style

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:36.740
 She goes into the secret passage which people aren't supposed to be in and she comes to the edge of a cliff

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:44.660
 The cliff supposedly is bottomless that's detail number two that's utterly ridiculous

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.240
 But it could just be ten feet deep and it's super dark candle. A lover doesn't reach down there

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:55.780
 She stands up and she sees this huge gap and on the other side of the gap is this doorway and

00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.060
 Then these giant white haired creatures

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.140
 Walk out of the darkness, but they're on the other side of the doorway

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:10.820
 Oh and just then her candle goes out. She's in pitch darkness and she feels something wet

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.540
 Walk by her

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.660
 Just imagine getting covered in slime and gack

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.740
 Just slide by you and that panics her obviously and she runs

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.300
 And she goes to run back into her tour group and at that point other people are trying to follow out

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.180
 She's like get out of the way losers get out of the way white haired monsters right behind me

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.860
 She gets back there

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.180
 And she goes she gets with the tour group and everyone else comes back

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.340
 She doesn't warn them there's a bottomless cliff there

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.900
 But none of them fall off and she's catching her breath and the tour guide

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.020
 Apparently looks at her and in her words gives her a knowing look

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.480
 Like I told you so you stupid idiot, but you are annoying me

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.420
 So I let you go all those words were conveyed with just a simple nod and

00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:01.300
 Then eventually she leaves the tunnels and then she said she wanted to go back again next week

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.600
 She was scared the first time but she wanted to know more about the bottomless pit

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:10.820
 She wanted to know more about the white haired creatures the wet monster that slid past her and the mysterious force

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.660
 No one as wind that blew her candle out. She needed to know all of these things

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.460
 She goes back into the tunnel the door. She went through is

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.740
 Blocked up now and when she started asking other tour guides

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:29.180
 Hey, we're so-and-so he was working here last week and we were doing on this tour and everyone goes

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.580
 Why that tour guide has never worked here before?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.340
 Ever

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.740
 Now people believe that story by the way that story is completely stupid

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:47.940
 But I think it's funny because here we have two contrasting stories one story is reported in National Geographic

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:53.300
 It's very very it's maybe two paragraphs long basic information kids go missing

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.380
 No one can find them parents here the kids crying at night. It's spooky

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.540
 It may be true, but it just seems very unlikely

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.380
 You think if it was true there would be more new sources covering it

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.780
 Unless it was something the city was trying to cover up this now you can no longer walk freely

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.820
 We know that as a fact used to be you could kind of walk freely under the city of Malta

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.500
 You can't do that anymore and I think that changed around the late 1940s

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.740
 So that is not you can't go down there walk around so something probably did happen

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.500
 But it could just miss a 30 kids sprained their ankle one day or over the course of 30 days

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.340
 Who knows but anyways so you have that incident happen and then you have this

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:42.220
 Story that involves yeti underground societies bottomless pits wet slime monsters a tour guide who never existed

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.420
 all this ridiculous details and

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.960
 Both every time you look at the story of the Malta tunnels both of these stories are connected

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.700
 Well, you know like you'll read the first one and you'll be like oh that is kind of interesting

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.960
 Why would National Geographic report that and then they go wink wink nudge nudge if you think that one was a good

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.740
 Look at this one. It stars the story of Laurie Jessup. It's Laurie Jessup's great granddaughter

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.860
 Literally nudging you with her press cap on read all about it read all about my great grandma story like knock it off, dude

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.460
 so

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:16.780
 One is super like is totally dialed into what people all the conspiracy paranormal dudes believe in

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.180
 with the hidden societies and

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:26.100
 Magic controlling the wind and all sorts of Pocahontas nonsense and then you have a story that's actually realistic

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.100
 But there's so few details on it

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:36.920
 Who knows it could be true. It could be not true. It's the battle of National Geographic versus Riley crabs borderland science magazine

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:43.300
 And in true conspiracy theory paranormal fashion Riley crab the Riley crab crowd

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:51.780
 Usually wins out the story of a ghost like last episode. I'll talk about this last episode was about Haditha damn the story about ghosts a ghost in

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.460
 Haditha damn that's fine

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.380
 That's a scary ghost story that US soldiers tell each other so they can you know poop their pants

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.100
 But then someone added in the four horsemen of the apocalypse are trapped underneath it

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:11.180
 And it's this huge demonic conspiracy monster man stuff going on underneath his damn one is at least a slightly realistic ghost in a dam

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.300
 And then the other one is just

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.880
 Fantasy nonsense. I mean whether or not the four horsemen exist. I

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:24.100
 Don't know but I don't think that they're trapped underneath the hydroelectric dam in Iraq if they do exist

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.900
 Which I'm sure they exist in some form

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.780
 But again, I'm not gonna get in all that so well, I guess I could because it is a paranormal podcast

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.780
 But really I want to talk about

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.060
 fat extractors and I'm running out of time so guys

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.140
 suck your tummies in

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:44.780
 But it won't help it won't help you'll still look nice and juicy to those fat extractors

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:53.340
 So when I use the term fat extractor, that's a term. Those are two English words that are put together fat extractor

00:20:53.700 --> 00:21:00.300
 It's not its own thing, right? If I said, oh, I'm a fat seller. I sell human fat you'd be disgusted and

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.340
 You would make sure you weren't eating twinkies around me

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:09.140
 But you'd go oh now if I'm saying those words in other languages if I said candle maker in French

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.580
 It would be like handle maker, right? It would be another word for candle maker

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.420
 You could travel around the world

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.540
 I've learned this this week and you could travel around the world and you'll find all sorts of combinations for words

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:26.820
 You can go to other countries and English the word automobile may take two or three words to say in another language

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.900
 Spain has such a problem with people sucking the fat out of other people

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:38.940
 They have their own terminology for it. They're called saca miss. It's close enough to my own old hometown

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.940
 Which is kind of creepy sac

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.420
 saca mentecas

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.820
 which means fat extractor or

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:53.940
 Mantequero which is a fat sellers because you have to distinguish those two some people just love to pull the greasy fat out of you

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:59.260
 Other people are capitalists about it. They want to take that fat and turn it into stuff

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.180
 You can actually get jars like apocrythary apocrythary jars

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.820
 Now you can get apocrythary jars here

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.700
 You can get them with the same mints on them or or homeopathic

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:18.780
 Consens or stuff that doesn't work. Just put it on your put it on your mantle with along with all of your homeopathic garbage

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.060
 These ones say

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.660
 oxungia honinis which means human fat

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:33.260
 So you could go to apocrythary in Spain in the 1700s and you'd be like I need some mint and I need some

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:42.920
 That that Jason can't think of a word for and then it's just a jar that says Jason can't think of a word for and then I'll take two scoops of human fat

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:48.340
 Spain has such a problem with human fat that there are multiple stories

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:54.060
 Regarding people killing people just to take the fat out so many stories

00:22:54.060 --> 00:23:00.620
 We're gonna have to cover them over three episodes. This is the first collection. This is gonna wet your appetite for

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.180
 Some sweet sweet human fat. It's the late

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.900
 1900s

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.340
 We're falling back we're falling back through a time portal

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.860
 Luckily, we're going to Spain. So half the landscape is human fat. We hit the ground

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:22.140
 Fight in our way out of the fat the gooey human greasy yellow fat

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:28.700
 Sorry if you happen to be eating chicken during this segment eating it you're just got your rotisserie chicken

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.580
 You're all are taking a huge bite. I know a guy

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:38.140
 So I used to work at Best Buy in Sacramento and right across the way there was a burger king restaurant

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.180
 And I've always loved working at I love working retail

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:48.500
 But I've always specifically loved working retail where there was restaurants nearby because then you never really had to leave anywhere for eight hours

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.060
 Like the restaurant. So I was like, oh sweet Burger King

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.960
 I'm gonna walk from Best Buy Go Burger King and I remember when I started there

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.460
 Because I was one of the first to like this story just opened up like a month before I got certain

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.420
 At that time too. I was actually the fastest promoted

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.380
 member like fastest promoted employee in Best Buy history

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.780
 I went from cashier to manager like in a month or maybe like a month and a half

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.340
 I remember there like no one's ever been promoted this quickly. But anyways, there's another new story

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:18.980
 Bragging about working at Best Buy. I ended up I'd go to Burger King all the time

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.660
 And I remember asking my boss I go, hey, do you ever go to Burger King? He goes never again

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:29.340
 Never again. What why he goes he went this very first day working at that Best Buy

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.660
 He walked over to the Burger King. He got a grilled chicken

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:37.300
 He got a grilled chicken sandwich and he takes a bite out of it and he goes, ah

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.980
 This teeth bite, you know how human mouths work his teeth bite into the sandwich

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:48.220
 And then what you normally do is you move the sandwich away from your mouth and go on

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.060
 And you eat it you bring it to your mouth

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.380
 Take a bite then then you pull the sandwich away from your mouth and then you chew the peas

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.340
 It's a weird human thing. You don't keep the burger right next to your mouth and go

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:06.220
 You take a bite and then you drop your hands he said I take a bite of the sandwich

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:11.480
 And then he goes as I pulled the sandwich away from mouth there was a

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.140
 There was a vein

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:22.500
 Coming from his mouth from the bite he had taken and the vein was this gooey stretchy thing and he as he moved the sandwich away

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.780
 The vein kept stretching longer and longer and he's just looking at this thick red

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:33.620
 vein coming from his mouth disappearing into the meat of the chicken of the sandwich and he

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:40.660
 He said he would never he threw it away and he said he would never eat a Burger King ever again

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.740
 I thought that was a funny story, but anyways, so this dude work work

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:50.860
 We're in fat land aka Spain. There's this guy named Juan Diaz de Guerreo

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:56.700
 He was killing prostitutes. He's actually considered one of Spain's earliest serial killers

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.500
 If not their first one of the first recorded serial killers in Spain now

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.100
 He started off he would walk down the street and he would see like an old woman not an old woman

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.660
 Sorry, he would see a poor woman difference

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.260
 You can be poor and young or poor and old but you can't be old and young

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.980
 He'd see a young woman who was poor and being like hey you want to make some money

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:19.340
 And she'd be like yes, I would so they would go down an alley and they would bang and then he would go

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.620
 Here's three reals, which is their currency over there

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:27.660
 And she goes that's not enough and he'd go fine and he goes here's four and she goes

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.820
 That's not enough and then he would choke her to death

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:34.100
 He'd kill it and then that went on for a couple years

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.580
 He kept finding these young women and he would go hey you look kind of down in your luck

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.140
 She's like yeah, it's been a real kind of crappy crappy year of luckily

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.860
 I still have all this sweet sweet human fat in my body and he's like that's an odd comment to make

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.820
 She's like it is he goes hey you want to have some sex for money

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.820
 And she goes yeah sure and then he would offer her three bucks or three reels and she would say no

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.860
 Then he'd offer her four and she'd say no and then he strangle her

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.860
 It was this weird thing that he did and

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:05.020
 He's he was fairly successful at this for a long time people kept finding these bodies around town and they weren't

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:11.020
 Clueing on they weren't like figuring out who this dude was then he just started attacking random people

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.100
 This young girl walks by and he's like hey

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.660
 Knock knocks her on the head no lead up no sex for money nothing

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:24.340
 Drowns that he's drowning women. He's choking him out. I thought one of the saddest ones was

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.780
 This was actually one of his last ones

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.020
 He was out in the middle of the country because people were starting to get suspicious

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:35.100
 He's out in the middle of a country sleeping on her bridge. His young woman's coming back from like a fair and

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.100
 He's like oh where you been he's like she's like oh

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.460
 I was just from the town fair and look at about this bread and this wine and yeah, you know just kind of having fun

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.940
 He's like oh, that's cool, and then he

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:51.180
 Beat beat the crap out of her and ripped her intestines out and then sat and drank her wine and ate her bread

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:56.340
 I've always thought you know and I've covered that type of thing before not the girl again her intestines ripped out

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.860
 but that

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.420
 normalcy thing where

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.900
 There was the one of the zodiac killers victims with some guy coming home

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.340
 He worked at a Coca-Cola factory for like 30 years

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:12.420
 His favorite thing was he every day he got like a bottle of coke and his favorite thing was grabbing his you know

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.180
 Hey by Harold. I don't remember his name, but yeah

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:15.780
 See you guys later

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:20.860
 He grabbed his bottle of coke and he'd walk home and he'd sit and he'd watch TV and drink his coke like that was his thing and

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.140
 zodiac killer blues brains out and

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.900
 That's such a normal thing. It's the same thing with her you have this woman who goes out

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.940
 She's looking the whole week to go to this fair. She goes to the fair. She buys her bread and she her wine

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.820
 And she's so happy she's coming back through the countryside

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:41.180
 It's a beautiful Spanish day and some dude rips her intestines out and then eats her food like that is such a bizarre

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.780
 It's the normalcy of it is what is striking

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:51.740
 To me though those stories are always more chilling. Yes, obviously killing prostitutes is just as wrong

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.620
 I'm not saying that I'm not saying this woman may have been a prostitute. I don't know

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.500
 I'm not saying but I'm saying like the idea of

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:04.140
 There's there's just routine things we do that you go to the store you get you're like, you know

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.460
 I can't wait I can't wait to go to the store get my chili beans and rice

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.260
 I'm gonna come home. I'm gonna watch a new episode of the Mandalorian and I'm gonna go to bed

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.900
 Or maybe I'll stay up late and play video games

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:19.940
 And while you're thinking about that some dude comes out of the darkness and puts a box cutter through your neck that to me is is

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.540
 terrifying

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.420
 That the normalcy being interrupted by violence is terrifying now

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:32.300
 This guide meant and I get to get back to the actual narrative of the story not try to ruin your day and to scare you the

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.660
 Narrow the reason why the his modus operandi changed now

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:45.180
 He'd been drowning women that he he killed dozens of women and he was they don't really even know the full amount of women

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:50.820
 He killed but it first he was just drowning them and choking them because that was his most effect

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.980
 His first murder was drowning this woman

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.820
 He took her to the river to have sex with her and then drowned her the

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:02.780
 reason why he ripped this woman's guts out because at this point when the police place are starting to figure out there's a serial killer in the area

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:09.580
 People are super panicked at this point because there's been tons of bodies found nobody seems to know this person is people believed

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.300
 He was a sacramentucka. He was a fat extractor. This was a boogeyman that existed in

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:20.700
 Spain the story of somebody that a monster really who prays on the populace

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:26.540
 to eat their fat or to turn their fat into medicine or

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.580
 To turn their fat into soap

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.980
 But Spain had a weird

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:38.340
 Fascination with human fat to the to the point that they had a boogeyman that specifically worked on

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:45.820
 Eating consuming murdering just for fat. So the rumor was that whoever is killing these women is

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:54.260
 A sacramentucka even though that this serial killer had not been taking their fat out people were people did not know

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.260
 Why someone would be murdering so many women?

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.540
 so one had not disemboweled anybody but

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:04.900
 This time he did he ripped her guts out specifically to make the people think

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:12.420
 That there was a mythical creature on the loose now while these crimes are going on these murders last that I think it was about two or three years

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:20.180
 Other people begin because this guy wasn't getting caught you had three other people begin murdering women in the same area

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.060
 Because if this guy's not getting caught I'm gonna do it too

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:28.420
 They all got caught one eventually got caught as well and he got sentenced to death and he was executed

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:35.100
 But you had three other people inspired by these crimes who killed like one person and got caught and one of those guys

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.100
 Ripped the woman's guts out as well

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:42.420
 So you the society was in a panic now again if you had a town where people if in

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:48.800
 Detroit you had four people murdered and they were disemboweled people in Detroit aren't gonna be like they're eating their fat

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:56.820
 Don't use soap because the soap might be human fat, but Spain has such a weird issue with human fat extractors and

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:05.020
 Drinking human fat and turning into medicine. They have crime after crime after crime where this is a thing and

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.620
 That's going to be a teaser

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:14.380
 For our next two episodes because I could not there's so much fat for this story. I couldn't fit it all in one episode

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:21.780
 Tomorrow's episode. We are going to tell the story of a man who was also considered a sacramentekka and

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.660
 a werewolf and

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.780
 Then the episode after that for a three-part fat eater episode

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.560
 We are going to explain how the idea of fat extractors

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:40.420
 Left Spain and move to the new world to the point that even today

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:46.800
 People in South America believe that the Spaniards continue to kill the indigenous people

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.420
 simply to eat their fat

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.060
 What is Spain's bizarre connection with human fat?

00:32:54.060 --> 00:33:01.940
