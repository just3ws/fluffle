00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.680
 Mental health parity is the law requiring health insurance coverage for mental health

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.480
 or substance use disorders that is no more restrictive than your physical health coverage.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.600
 That means if you're dealing with depression or anxiety, your access to mental health coverage

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.560
 is comparable to your access to physical health coverage for a broken arm or leg.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.900
 It's important to learn and understand the laws that protect you when you use your health

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.480
 insurance for treatment.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480
 Know your rights.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.400
 Go to GetCoveredIllinois.gov for more information on mental health parity.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.160
 The world of conspiracy theorists lose another one of their heroes.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.600
 And then we meet a man who believes that not only was Kobe Bryant's death not an accident,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.480
 but that Kobe Bryant is right now being uploaded into a massive computer taken from Saturn

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 to become the Antichrist today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.840
 I'm a little angry, a little angry, but we'll get to that in a second.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.520
 First off, check out this new art.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.760
 Pretty awesome, isn't it?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.880
 This art is from Smashers_25.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.380
 That's her Instagram handle.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 And if you're looking for any sort of vector artwork, any sort of graphic design stuff,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680
 hit her up.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.600
 I love that Ash Black's logo he just made over, of course, a one night listening to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 the show has been dissected by other artists and reinterpreted.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.280
 We had John from the Scar group, his version now Smashers_25 has hers.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.440
 It's just amazing how this show's really grown.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.240
 I really, really love you guys so much.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.720
 Until I found out that a group, I don't know why I didn't know this before.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240
 And I'm kind of disappointed in you guys.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.320
 You guys didn't know this either.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.000
 A group of rabbits is known as a fluffle.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.960
 Well, what's up fluffle gang?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.800
 What's up little fluffles?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.360
 We'll see how long that sticks.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.920
 Secondly, in other news before we get started with the episode, this week is the end of

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 season eight.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.400
 By the end of the week, we're going to hit episode 400, guys.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400
 400.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400
 That's a myth.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 We got the fluffles.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.320
 Kind of do a little tummy little fluffle gang.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.160
 Couldn't have done it without you guys.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 That's amazing.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.480
 What that means is that every 50 episodes, I take a week off.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.080
 So next week, just going to do some reruns.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.480
 My friend Sabine, she listens to the show and she goes, "I always listen to your current

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480
 episode."

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.600
 Then I'll listen to one or two episodes back because she just got into it about a month

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 ago.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.760
 This is a good way to catch up.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.000
 If you haven't heard some past episodes, the best of week is a good way to do that.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.800
 But thank you so much Smashers_25.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.200
 Thank you Fluffle Gang for one more.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.480
 We'll see how long that lasts.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.320
 Thanks for your support and we're going to be taking a break soon.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.600
 But now we're not.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.360
 Now I'm putting back on my angry eyebrows.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360
 Angry.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.440
 Angry Jason.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.160
 And I get angry every once in a while.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.080
 Normally it's a Friday episode, but I woke up this morning to this news.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.680
 Mad Mike Hughes.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.480
 Flat Earth conspiratorist.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.480
 Is that a word?

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.680
 Flat Earth believer.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.320
 And also the man who's very well known for building a rocket.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.840
 That he was going to climb inside.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.800
 I think you know where this is going.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.120
 Climbs inside of his rocket and shoot himself up so he could see that the world was really

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.080
 a disk and he was going to take all these pictures.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.000
 Because you know airplanes have concave windows on them.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.480
 So that's why the Earth looks like a circle because the windows design that way.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.560
 Anyway, so.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.280
 He shoots himself out of a rocket.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
 Not a rocket.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.080
 Earth styled or self-taught rocket scientist.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.080
 I will say this, that's smarter than anything I could have ever done.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.840
 So I applaud the fact that he taught himself rocket technology because I couldn't do that.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.480
 What I'm upset about is he's dead now.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.760
 Sorry, I probably could have doled that news a little bit more.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.600
 You're like, you were just holding your little pinot that said "Mad Mike."

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.320
 You're like, "Oh, is this going to be awesome?"

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.320
 "No."

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.320
 Sorry, if you like the guy.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.720
 I'm sure he was a great person, but last time he did one of these he launched himself

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.960
 up about 1700 feet and then the parachutes come out of the rocket and he slowly glides

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.960
 to Earth.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.360
 Well, this weekend when his rocket took off, what they believe is that the packages like

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.560
 holding the parachutes got ripped on the launch pad on like the...

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560
 I can see that's something.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.480
 At least this guy, I can't even describe the stuff this guy built.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.080
 So he's definitely smarter than me in that regard.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.400
 But the parachute thingies got ripped and then that means the parachutes themselves

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400
 got ripped.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.880
 So the rocket took off successfully, but it had nothing to stop the landing and the rocket

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.880
 fell to Earth.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.880
 And there were people there watching it.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.240
 There were some journalists and supporters of his and things like that.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.920
 So that's horrible.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.920
 That's absolutely horrible.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.120
 And I feel really bad for him.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.840
 I feel bad for his fluffle.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.440
 I feel bad for his family.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.720
 I feel bad just all around.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.120
 And so why are you angry, Jason?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.160
 Why'd you put on your angry eyebrows for this story?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.680
 Shouldn't this be a celebration of life?

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 Yeah.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.080
 Yeah, I do think that he was a smart dude and he was doing something that he loved.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:26.280
 The problem is he died over a conspiracy theory that we all know is not true.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.280
 Right?

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.520
 Like shouldn't we be in agreement that this is not true?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.720
 But he's dead now.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.720
 Because he believed that the Earth was flat.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720
 I don't know.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.960
 There's just kind of, it's...

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.400
 You know, one of the things that I like about the show is that it brings like the fun back

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.720
 to conspiracy theories.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.960
 It brings the fun back to the world of the paranormal.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.040
 So when do people take this stuff so seriously?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.360
 And that's fine too, but then there's a limit.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.440
 There's a difference between me joking about aliens, me beating up...

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.440
 That's not a joke actually.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.640
 I'm just just lay out aliens.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.040
 But there's a difference between me joking about beating up aliens.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.240
 Again, not a joke.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.080
 There's a difference between people who are like, "No, aliens are actually 100% real."

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.680
 And then the people who believe that reptilians are taking over the planet.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.680
 And then even then a group of people is, "The reptilians are taking over the planet, therefore

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.400
 I have to shoot my minister eight times in the head."

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.840
 Which actually happened.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.320
 And oddly enough, the minister survived.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.720
 Which is weird.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 Which is weird.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720
 Kyle Odom was that guy.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.200
 He was the shooter.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 Maybe we'll do an episode on him.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200
 It's really well known.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.200
 That's why I haven't covered it yet.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.360
 There's that gradation there.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.880
 So you can believe in Flat Earth all you want.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.800
 And I'm allowed to laugh at you all I want.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.240
 Because I think it's a stupid conspiracy theory.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.720
 And you can laugh at me and we can have that enjoyment.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.080
 But then when you die over it, it's just...

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.960
 It makes me mad.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960
 Makes me mad.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.840
 So, mad my cues.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.080
 That's awesome you were doing your thing.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.160
 It sucks that it ended so tragically.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.080
 I wish that you had had many more launches and you had been able to observe the splendor

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.800
 of the curved earth and come down and said, "Hey, you know, I was wrong."

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.120
 That would have been the happiest ending of the story.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.240
 But instead, a man's dead.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.240
 You know what?

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240
 I just thought about this.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.160
 I almost can guarantee now that I don't live a lot in the Flat Earth world.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.280
 Because again, that's a real popular conspiracy theory.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.560
 I just flirt in and out of it.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.040
 I studied it a long time ago.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.040
 I bet you...

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.040
 I should check this out.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.400
 I bet you there's a conspiracy theory.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:35.640
 I bet you anything that people are saying that he went so high that NASA took him out.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.640
 It was...

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.360
 I bet you anything they're already claiming it's a murder.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.120
 I'll check that out and we'll see if we find anything out.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.120
 Let me write that down here because I'll figure it out otherwise.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.640
 Because I'm a busy man.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.080
 Where's my pen?

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.800
 And speaking of being busy, I'm going to take this woman out real quick.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.840
 You know, since I'm going to be gone for a week, definitely listen to my episodes, my

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.680
 classic episodes, I think you'll have a lot of fun with those.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.400
 This week and I've been watching, and last week and I watched a lot of movies.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.680
 If you guys want to keep up on the movies and watching, you can sign up for my Twitter

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.680
 account.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.120
 A lot of times I'm tweeting about movies I've seen.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.080
 But I saw a movie the other day called There Are Monsters.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.160
 Highly recommended.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.320
 It's a great conspiracy horror movie.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.520
 It's a great sci-fi horror movie.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.720
 It's just a great horror movie.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.000
 And it's interesting because it's a...

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.480
 It's one long narrative, but it took the filmmaker five years to shoot it.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.880
 And it came in like 2013.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.520
 It took him like five years to shoot it.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.600
 And so it seems like a lot of little short stories connected together.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.120
 So like, we'll have our heroes go into a supermarket.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.640
 We'll have our heroes go to a dentist's office.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.920
 We'll have our heroes on a bus.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.480
 You can tell like all of these were shot as almost like short movies.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.880
 It was really, really good horror movie.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.240
 There Are Monsters.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.240
 Check it out.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240
 Dead Rabbit recommends There Are Monsters.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.120
 I don't say anything else because I just recommend watching it.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.440
 But let's go ahead though and move on to our next topic, our next story for the day.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.600
 Now our next story, our next story coming up, we're going not to a place, but to a mind.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.800
 We're traveling into the mind of a man.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.440
 Actually, no, I guess we'll go to a place.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.320
 We're at a diner because this is easier narrative setup.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.320
 We're now sitting at a diner across from a man.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.000
 He's probably in his, I'm going to guess, late 20s, early 30s.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.640
 And he's sitting there and he's drinking coffee.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.640
 His eyes are shifting from side to side.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.320
 We're making us a little nervous, but it's in the middle of the day.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.200
 We're sitting in the little diner in, let's say, Sedona, Arizona.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.520
 I don't know.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.280
 Somewhere where there is a road because we need to make a quick getaway if these things

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.280
 turned bad.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.920
 And he's sitting there and he's drinking his coffee and we're drinking our beverages

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.080
 of choice.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.760
 And we go, "So sir, we've heard that you have some information for us."

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.520
 And he's like, "I do.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.520
 I do."

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.400
 And can you reveal your name to us, sir?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.400
 And he goes, "Yes, yes.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.720
 Well, I can give you my Reddit handle."

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.040
 He says with a grin, "This is a good, this is a real dude, okay?

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.240
 I'm not making this guy up.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.640
 This guy is not a narrative device.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.360
 He's a real man.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:06.080
 He's only known to the general public as blueberries for life.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.120
 Blueberries for life."

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.040
 So blueberries, can I call you blueberries or should I call you Mr. For Life?

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.720
 Oh no, blueberries is fine.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720
 So blueberries.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.320
 No, what am I finding so other than that name?

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.320
 Being weird.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.520
 And actually it's the most normal thing that we're about to discuss.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.600
 I find it odd that someone who believes what we're about to talk to, the main thing in

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.200
 his existence is blueberries.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.640
 Just the fact that they exist.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.680
 Not blueberry pie for life, not blueberry soda, blueberry, just blueberries, right?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.680
 Blueberries for life.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.240
 He's sitting there across from us from the diner and he goes, "I have important information

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.480
 for you guys.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.000
 You guys are true believers, right?"

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.200
 And now our eyes are shifting from side to side.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.200
 We're like, "Yeah, we believe everything."

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.440
 And he's like, "Good, good, good."

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.920
 Pulls out his notebook.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.360
 January 17th, Eminem drops music to be murdered by.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.360
 I haven't heard that album.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.360
 I haven't heard that album.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.520
 I looked up some of the lyrics because I'm a boomer now.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.440
 I didn't have time to actually listen to the album.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.680
 I was like, "Yeah, that seems okay."

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.440
 He raps too fast for me now.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440
 I liked old Eminem.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.760
 I like his first three albums, but then he just got faster and faster.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.760
 I'm not into that.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.760
 I know a lot of people are though.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.760
 He has his fans.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:22.640
 January 26th, Kobe Bryant dies while the Grammys are rehearsing at the Staples Center.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.240
 Kind of like looking at each other.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.520
 We're like, "Yeah, we know that he passed away.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.120
 Is it important that they were practicing at the Staples Center at the Grammys?"

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.120
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.960
 You see, the Staples Center is where he used to play basketball.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.800
 So, but now they're doing like musical stuff there in the music industry.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.800
 And we're like, "Oh, great.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.800
 It's one of these."

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.800
 Sorry.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.960
 Don't go into the music industry stuff yet.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.960
 Save that.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.960
 He's like, "Okay, okay."

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.440
 January 17th, Eminem drops music to be murdered by his new album.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.440
 January 26th, Kobe Bryant dies.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.440
 Helicopter crash.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:59.600
 January 31st, Lil Wayne drops the album Funeral, which I have listened to.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.120
 And it's okay.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.080
 Like I haven't listened to a Lil Wayne album since the Carter III.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.640
 And again, I think I just am a fan.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.160
 Rap music evolves incredibly fast.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.440
 Rock music, it goes pretty slow in the same rock band unless they're Maroon 5, which I

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.000
 think they're more of a pop band now.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.920
 They kind of slowly grow over time.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.000
 Rappers, like you can go, you can miss an album and it's a completely different artist.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.800
 Rap music goes super, super fast.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.880
 Anyway, so I wasn't a huge fan of Lil Wayne's Funeral album.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.240
 It is interesting though, Hidden Code, you take the album Funeral or the album Art for

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240
 Funeral.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240
 And you flip it upside down.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.240
 It says Lil Wayne.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.400
 It was interesting.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.200
 And now at this point you're looking at me in the diner and you're like, dude, just let

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.160
 him finish his dumb conspiracy theory.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.840
 This isn't XXL Magazine.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840
 You're not spin.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.840
 Okay, okay.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.680
 January 31st, Lil Wayne drops Funeral.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.960
 February 2nd, Super Bowl 54 happens.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.800
 And February 2nd famously was 02, 02, 2020.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.320
 And it was the only date within 1100 years that was a paladrome.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.880
 And then he starts going off on all this stupid date stuff, which I'm sure you guys have run

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.880
 into.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.920
 If you're into any of this conspiracy theory stuff, that day, and I think we did an episode

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920
 on it too.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920
 That date was doomed.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.320
 Like something was supposed to big was happen.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.320
 Nothing happened.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.600
 But that's not changing Blueberry's mind about this.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.560
 Because here's his take on Super Bowl 54.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.800
 And he gets real close to us.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.960
 We can smell the coffee on his breath.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.720
 And then he says, quote, he actually says that word as well.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:36.080
 The halftime show was a sex magic ritual to the Black Cube of Saturn.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.400
 Now he leans back in his chair, all smug.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.400
 So he's dropped the bomb.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.080
 That Kobe Bryant's death is linked to the Black Cube of Saturn.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.440
 You're perplexed because you have no idea what the Black Cube of Saturn is.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.400
 Hopefully not.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400
 If you do.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.160
 I think there's better uses of your time because I think the Black Cube of Saturn is

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.040
 one of the dumbest conspir- this is the other thing that makes me mad about this episode.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.800
 Black Cube of Saturn is one of the dumbest conspiracy theories I've come across.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.120
 And I'm going to go over it as briefly as I can.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.600
 This is what it is.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.040
 On Saturn, there is a hexagonal storm.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.760
 And basically a hexagon, if you draw lines over it, it becomes a 3D cube.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.920
 You can draw lines over anything and make anything.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.880
 So right there, the logic behind it is dumb.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.440
 There's hexagonal storm on Saturn and that if you draw a little line over it, that's

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.760
 a cube.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.920
 On Earth, you have a bunch of Black Cubes everywhere.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.200
 You'll find these images everywhere.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.440
 They're like, "Here's a Black Cube in Dresden.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.120
 Here's a Black Cube in Brooklyn.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.080
 Here's a Black Cube in Vermont.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.800
 Here's a Black Cube in Berkeley."

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.040
 See anything similar?

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.240
 Yeah, there's four photos of Black Cubes.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.480
 Apparently there's some Jewish ritual where they wear little Black Cubes on their head.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.760
 Now let me say this for a second because they're saying that they're worshiping the Black

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.760
 Cube.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.760
 Let me say this for a second.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.920
 When you think of something that Orthodox Jews wear on their heads, what do you think

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.360
 of?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.400
 Do you think of the Black Cube or do you think of the Yamaka?

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.480
 So again, this is why this gets me worked up.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.720
 I'm not like super, I'm like, "No, they don't like the Yamaka?"

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:19.440
 This is the problem with this conspiracy theory, is that if you point out that eight times,

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.920
 or someone will be like, "There's 20 times."

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.920
 It doesn't matter.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.400
 You can point to me the 20 different Black Cubes in society, but you have to disregard

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:35.280
 every other thing in society that doesn't involve a Black Cube.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.920
 That's the problem with these conspiracy theories.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.400
 This one's fairly recent.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.480
 They really tried making this to be like, "Thousands of years ago, they discovered the..."

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.480
 Here's the thing.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.320
 We didn't know there was a hexagonal storm on Saturn until fairly recently.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:57.520
 So how cavemen were worshiping the Black Cube on Saturn is beyond me.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:03.600
 Also, apparently a wedding ring, putting the ring on the finger, is because of Jupiter.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.560
 Damn it, because of Saturn's rings?

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560
 So that's...

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:14.680
 But they didn't know there were rings around Saturn when we were putting rings on fingers.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.320
 It's all backwards.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.080
 It's all been created backwards, right?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.440
 They didn't know there was a hexagon.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.040
 They didn't know there was a cube, sorry, on Saturn.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.920
 They didn't know there were rings, but apparently people knew this way back when.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.480
 And now I can point to the fact that in Spider-Man 2, apparently there's a list of movies.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.400
 There's a list of movies that the Black Cube has been in.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.200
 There's maybe like 20 of them, and it's like Spider-Man 2, Matrix Revolutions.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.400
 Oh, and then they go, "Oh, and Avengers.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400
 Avengers the Cube."

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.560
 Because it's not Black!

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.000
 So now it's just any cube possible.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.160
 Also one of the movies they listed that has a cube in it.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.080
 The Movie Cube.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.400
 But oddly enough, not the three sequels.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.040
 So why is going on?

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040
 Basically...

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.080
 Basically, this makes me so mad, and this is why.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.360
 It is...

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.280
 And we've seen a lot of conspiracy theories like this.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.760
 It's a conspiracy theory out of omission.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.320
 So I can point to the few times the cube is there, but I have to ignore the fact that...

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.320
 It's the major...

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:25.040
 And they point obviously to Mecca, where the people walk around the giant Black Cube in

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.840
 the middle of Mecca, and they're like, "No joke.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.480
 They walk around it the way the rings rotate around Saturn.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.440
 They didn't know rings were around Saturn when they built Mecca."

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.640
 So just really...

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.080
 There are multiple religions that don't have Black Cube things in it.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.200
 Just famously, I don't think Jesus had a Black Cube dropped on him.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.640
 I'm pretty sure there's not a Black Cube in Buddhism, or Zoroastheism, I know I can't

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.760
 pronounce that one, or really anything else, right?

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.720
 You can point to the few times there are Black Cubes and go, "Oh, it's proof."

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.040
 That works secretly being run by people who worship the Black Cube, because I can show

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.640
 you a room from the United Nations that's a prayer and meditation room that has a Black

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.640
 Cube in it.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.360
 First off, I don't know where that photo was taken.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.440
 I don't know if it's called a prayer or meditation room, and if both of those are true, I don't

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:23.040
 care that there's modern art in a room where you're supposed to go and contemplate things.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.600
 If there was a Black Cube in every place of worship on the planet, and not just Spider-Man

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.760
 2 or the Matrix Revelations or whatever, revolutions, it doesn't matter, if every single

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.320
 movie had a Black Cube in it, and if there was a Black Cube in every single location

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.880
 of worship, in every financial district, in every capital, you might be onto something.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.880
 If it was onto 50% of those locations, you might be onto something.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.880
 20?

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.480
 20.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.920
 And the lunatic I'm about to talk to you about, let's get back to blueberries for life.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:01.400
 I think I've vented long enough, and this extra long Jason vented, I hate that, I really

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.120
 dislike that conspiracy theory, because I think I dislike it for one or two reasons,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.400
 for one, it's incredibly uncreative.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.520
 It's really, really lame.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.960
 Let's look at, and again, they're not even restricting it to Black Cubes anymore, just

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.440
 any cube, ice cubes, part of this, actual ice cubes are part of it.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.960
 Anyways, it's not just Black Cubes anymore, it's any sort of cube.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.200
 Cubics, Rubik's Cube, be careful with those guys.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.040
 It makes me mad because it's completely uncreative, it's basically anything that's a basic geometric

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.560
 shape is proof of this conspiracy, and too, I think it irritates me how fast it's growing.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.520
 It's not as big as Flat Earth, it may not ever get as big as Flat Earth, but it's definitely

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.400
 bigger than stuff like mountains, there used to be trees and things like that, it's growing.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.200
 If you type in Black Cube of Saturn into Google, it's funny, you'll get a lot of results,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.280
 it'll be the same photos, over and over and over and over again.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.440
 Let's get back to this lunatic at the coffee shop though, that was my rant for the day.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.520
 Oh, I don't know, I may go off on one again because of this guy.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.560
 So he says this, "The halftime show was a sex magic ritual to the Black Cube of Saturn.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:29.200
 On February 3rd, a photo surfaced from an airplane that had an article written about

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:36.200
 it.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:21:02.680
 He's just posting on something, oh wait till we get into this dude's backstory, and then

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.240
 you'll see why I'm a little concerned about this guy.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.760
 So he believes that Eminem releases an album about being murdered, Kobe Bryant dies while

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:16.440
 the Grammys are being practiced at his place of work, Lil Wayne does an album called Funeral,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.600
 and then on February 3rd, some photo gets taken out of an airplane.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.960
 That is all part of the conspiracy theory.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.120
 Here's this quote, we're going back to his words here.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:33.720
 This entire series of events I'm explaining is a ritual to the Black Cube of Saturn in

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:42.680
 order to bring Kobe back to life through AI and present him to the world and tell us AI

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.480
 is the new way of life.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.080
 This will be the Antichrist.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:56.240
 Kobe died on January 26th, 2020 and as of this writing it is 2/21/2020 and there are no funeral

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240
 plans for him.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.760
 That's not true, his funeral was held on February 7th.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.280
 So right there you didn't do the basic research to prove your point.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.160
 And Jason, at this point you're kind of like putting your animal arm, you're like Jason

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.000
 we are at a diner, we are, I've never seen you this worked up bro.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.560
 Well listen dude, okay first off, okay I'll move your hand off my arm, I'll put it on

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.800
 my knee.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:26.200
 And then secondly, let's say that you're trying to convince me that the world government

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.320
 has taken a dead basketball player and is going to, of all people, of all people who

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.240
 died, no offense against Kobe Bryant.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.440
 But if Kobe Bryant's ghost walked in my apartment right now and told me that he was the way,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.680
 the truth and the light, I'm not going to start worshiping him.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.960
 No offense again Kobe, but I think you understand.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.080
 It would take more than a basketball, or really anyway, if Britney Spears ghost walked in

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.200
 my apartment right now and told me to start worshiping her, I wouldn't.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.960
 And I love Britney Spears.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.080
 I'd worship her while she was alive.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.240
 But which I actually might be even more creepy, but my point is is that it's going to take

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.720
 more than a, one of the most amazing basketball players of all time to convince me that AI

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.200
 is the way.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200
 Right?

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.440
 Anyways, get your basic facts right as well.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.560
 He already had a funeral, he had a funeral two weeks before you wrote this stuff.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.520
 After, and I'm going to spare you a ton of this, but after this to prove himself, to

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.400
 prove his facts, and he ends it with the normal conspiracy theorist thing, I don't care if

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.800
 you believe me, you do care if we believe you, that's why you spent eight hours writing

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.960
 this.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.000
 You know people aren't going to believe you, so you kind of put up that deflection thing,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.960
 fine, it's a psychological trick, whatever.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.200
 He goes into a ton.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.040
 The next, you can go through the show notes, the link will be there, but the next, I don't

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:48.320
 know, five, six paragraphs are just new neurology stuff, number games, and I'll read this one.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.520
 This is proof, this is proof.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.360
 Get your calculators ready guys.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.120
 This will prove to you this madman's onto something.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.120
 Quote.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:00.760
 The score, okay, the score of the game, so the Super Bowl score was predetermined by

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.960
 the fact that the Black Cube Society, or let's say whatever they are, the order of the Black

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.120
 Cube, the Black Cubians, they had preordained the actual score of the football game, which

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.000
 I'm sure a lot of 49er fans would agree with, at least that part of it, but the score has

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.400
 something to do with all of this.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.320
 So, the score of the game when it finished, that would have been hilarious if you took

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:26.120
 the score like during like eight minutes before half time, just an arbitrary number.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:33.040
 The score of the game when it finished read, San Francisco 20, Kansas City 31, 2 plus 0

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:42.800
 equals 2, thank you, 3 plus 1 equals 4, 24, wait, what, okay, so 2 plus 0 is 2 and 3 plus

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.160
 1 is 4, so now we have the number 24.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:55.760
 2 times 4 is 8, Super Bowl 54, 5 plus 4 is 9, Kobe died nine days after the ritual began,

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.760
 which is a famous, oh and this is, I can't believe I haven't gotten to this yet, so he

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.800
 does not, he believes that the Black Cube Society of Saturn and the Illuminati are

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.800
 one and the same or the Illuminati work for him or Illuminati are their goons or the goons

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.680
 control them, who knows, but he never uses the term Illuminati.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:22.560
 He never uses the name Illuminati, he calls them throughout this post the Illuma Donkey,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:29.520
 the Illuma Donkey, which I love actually, I love that, it doesn't rhyme, it doesn't make

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:37.040
 really any sense, Donkey, it's funny, Donkey worshipers are actually a slang term for Christians

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:43.880
 way back in the day, like 38 AD, people refer to Christians as donkey worshipers because

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.880
 he rode into town on a donkey.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.360
 I actually have a story coming up on that, there's an interesting little thing about

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:55.080
 that, but so it's weird, I know that when I keep seeing him calling him Illuma Donkey,

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.240
 I do, because I read that story so recently, I keep associating that as a knock against

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.080
 Christians, so and I know this guy's not smart enough to know that, but it throws me

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.360
 off, so I'm thinking is he also like mocking Christians, I don't think so, I think he's

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.560
 just trying to find a funny way to refer to the Illuminati, he could have called him the

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:20.640
 Illuminati, like not boo, thumbs down, but anyways, Illuma Donkey, it's funny, it's my

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.160
 one life preserver in the sea of madness that when I was reading this thing, anyways he

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.200
 refers to him as Illuminati, so he says that if you add up the scores and do all this math

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.920
 stuff, 5+4 is 9 and Kobe died 9 days after the ritual began, and you go what about the

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.600
 8, you said the score added up to 8, he, again he goes on for 6 paragraphs or 5 paragraphs,

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:48.920
 it doesn't matter, wait 5+6 is 11, uh oh, 9, 11, so anyways, I mean that's basically

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.720
 the nonsense that he goes through, he begins going through Kobe Bryant's jersey number and

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.640
 finding Bible verses that correlate with it, and out of some of them they talk about two

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:04.960
 mountains, and Kobe Bryant's helicopter crashed in the mountains, yes, the spiritual history

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.040
 of the Jewish people predicted the fact that Kobe Bryant's helicopter wasn't going to

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.120
 fly right in 2020.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:18.680
 Who knew guys, who knew, I'm convinced now, you know what's funny, there's probably a

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.560
 pretty good chance that this show could have just become this, if this had been the first

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:29.600
 episode I ever did, that it would have just been 400 episodes of me basically being just

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:36.640
 grumpy old man Jason, reviewing some conspiracy theories, but it takes a lot out of him, I'm

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.040
 sweating over here honestly.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.200
 Anyways, let's start wrapping this up, this is definitely going to be a long episode,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.400
 I don't want to edit out a lot because I think a lot of this stuff is gold and it's the end

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.200
 of the season, we haven't had a lot of long episodes this season, so here we go, this

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:55.520
 ends with this quote, right, his article ends with this quote, it could all be coincidence,

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.760
 so at least he's open to that, it could all be coincidence, though he continues, though

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:09.880
 I know coincidences don't exist as I was showing this on my very first shroom trip.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.600
 Let's go back up and talk a little bit about blueberries for life, we've left a diner and

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.720
 we're walking and we're like, "Dick has a lunatic" and I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.480
 he's a lunatic, but we're just getting to the tip of the shroom," because this guy's

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:28.580
 not only an avid drug user, right, when I went to look to see if he had any more rantines

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:33.280
 about this on Reddit, any other conspiracy theories, none that I could find, every other

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.200
 post on Reddit was about him tripping on some sort of hallucinogen, okay?

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:45.080
 Hey man, it just took eight ounces of doozock, bloke, and you know, I'm tripping out, I'm

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.520
 seeing blueberries everywhere, man, blueberries connect us all?

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.640
 No, I mean, you're like, "Jason, you're not going to start bagging on this guy for doing

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.640
 hallucinogens."

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:59.660
 No, not necessarily, but let's keep- I will say it kind of makes your arguments a little

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:06.940
 less valid when you didn't discover them because you overheard a police officer and a governor

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:12.260
 talking about rigging an election, you overheard them because a clockwork elf appeared out

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.820
 of your left eyeball and whispered it into your nostril.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.380
 I- I'm just- that's just me.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.460
 But what he does, the type of drugs he does, I really don't care about.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.200
 Unless- let's find out a little bit about this guy, here's some quotes.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.880
 Okay, so I've been awakening rapidly for the last seven months.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.960
 I meditate several times a day and I've seen a lot of unexplained shit.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.360
 I've also done my fair share of psychedelics, and then it goes on.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.640
 And that's actually how he starts off.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.000
 So he lets us know right up the front that this dude's tripping 24/7.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.040
 Now when someone says they've been awakening rapidly for the last seven months, I had a

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.680
 feeling for what was going on, and you made two.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.580
 But let's continue, move on down this reddit post.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.860
 I have abilities, he says.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.100
 I always had them.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.180
 But I've ignored them since I was a teenager about 16 years ago.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.100
 Yeah, remember when you had mutant powers, remember when you had quote-unquote abilities

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.940
 and you're just like, "Nah, I'm not gonna deal with those."

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.700
 But anyways, apparently he's too good for his mutant powers.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.660
 "Muty, go home!"

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.300
 Continue this quote here, but back to his quote, referring to his gifts.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.380
 But they are rapidly increasing.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:24.040
 These last few days with these planet alignments, it's been crazy.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.160
 The tugging and pulling of my spirit by the sun has been so strong, I felt like I was

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.160
 going to...

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.240
 Now, this is where I thought, I think this guy might have developed schizophrenia.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:40.560
 And I was like, he's talking about, he's had these abilities since he was a teenager, and

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.960
 in the last seven months they've been rapidly awakening, and he's feeling like he's just

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.960
 so ecstatic and he's taking all these drugs.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.380
 And that's what I was saying, I think I know what's going on in you, might too.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:57.820
 It almost feels like he has some sort of mental disorder that's rapidly overtaking him.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.940
 Delusional thinking to say the least.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.940
 Because if you...

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.980
 I encourage you to go to the show notes and look...

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.460
 Okay, and I want to say this, don't harass this guy.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.860
 Not telling you guys to harass this dude or nothing like that, but if you want to see,

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.460
 like, how someone can just spin what...

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:17.260
 I mean, I'm sure all that math took him hours to do.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:23.320
 And I'm sure not only was he happy to do it the whole time, but his mind was just blowing

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.920
 every time a math thing.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.440
 And again, with the math, it's the Black Cube, it's all a conspiracy of omission.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.840
 Any math formulas that don't match the conspiracy you're looking for, you simply disregard.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.440
 What was the daily attendance of the...

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.760
 You know what, I'm not even going to get into that because I could go off on a whole

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.960
 other rant about numbers stuff.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:46.680
 But anyways, the point is, is that this guy might have some sort of mental issue.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.700
 Let's go back to this quote here, because this is really the main reason why I'm so

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.740
 fired up about this, other than the fact that it's a stupid conspiracy theory and it's

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.620
 a waste of time for anyone to believe in it.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.860
 Other than those things, back to this quote.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.820
 These last few days with these planet alignments, it's been crazy.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.500
 The tugging and pulling of my spirit by the sun has been so strong, I felt like I was

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:14.140
 going to fly a few times while driving.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.140
 Next line.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:20.640
 Now, I'm a truck driver by trade.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.640
 So this guy we've been talking about this whole time, who spends all this time on Reddit

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:31.000
 talking about doing hallucinogens, who so high that he believes that the order of album

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.120
 releases tell him that Kobe Bryant is going to appear in a computer, his little face is

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.720
 going to appear on everyone's smartphones and he's going to be like, "Hello everyone."

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.840
 He believes, and he's driving an 18 wheeler.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.840
 Down your street.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.820
 Doing math equations while he's trying to steer.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.620
 Tripping balls all the time.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.980
 Now he does say he usually only micro doses.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:05.580
 Dude, I remember when I was in a driver's class way back in the day, it was like, it

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.580
 would have been like 1990.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.300
 It's a sophomore in high school.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:15.760
 I remember I was always the combination of the jerk slash quote unquote cool kid.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.760
 I thought I was cool.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.240
 It wasn't that cool, but I was a jerk.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.800
 I remember I was sitting in the back of class because I never sat in the front and we were

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.240
 going over driver's ed stuff.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.000
 There's all these rules of the road and I remember just kind of sitting there leaning

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 back and the teacher's going over all this stuff and I raise my hand and I'm like, dude,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.680
 all these rules, when are we supposed to have fun?

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.840
 And the kids and laugh class and that teacher turned beat ready goes, "Do you want a driver

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.940
 of an 18 wheeler having fun on the road?"

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.540
 And I just sat there and I'm like, yeah, kind of.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.300
 Because I was a jerk, right?

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.460
 I was a jerk.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:52.060
 I didn't say, yeah, kind of super loud just enough for the kids next to me, but the initial

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.980
 question I asked in front of the whole class.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.740
 And as an adult, I think, I still laugh.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:59.700
 Sorry, but as an adult, I think, yeah, you don't want someone to have an 18 wheeler

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.620
 be having fun popping wheelies.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.540
 You definitely don't want them tripping on hallucinogenics thinking about the black

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.540
 cube.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.920
 Let's go on with this quote.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:14.120
 "Now, I am a truck driver by trade and I meditate in my truck every morning.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.360
 Please let it be parked, bro."

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.360
 Back to the quote.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.080
 I am su- I love this part.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.040
 This part, remember those headmasters from Transformers, the old school Transformers?

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.280
 The head was actually a separate little tiny guy action figure.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.400
 If you'd transform in the head, you'd put it on top of the robot.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.240
 So it was like man and machine teamed up.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.480
 That's real life now.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.040
 So at least I got this because I love Transformers.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.880
 At least this guy might be an actual headmaster.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.880
 Back to this quote.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.780
 "I am super connected to my truck in a strange way.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.980
 I feel other vehicles when they are around me."

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.260
 That's again, dude.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.540
 Use your eyes and the brake pedal.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:55.860
 Don't feel out the universe to whether or not you're scraping a family of four off the

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:56.860
 freeway.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.860
 I feel other vehicles when they are around me.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:34:59.860
 I feel this.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.860
 I love this.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.560
 Pressure washer on the truck.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.240
 Spraying down with the pressure washer.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.940
 I feel the pressure washer on the truck in my forehead in the corresponding part as my

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:17.040
 face is the front of the truck and the back is the back.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040
 I know.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.200
 Super weird, right?

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.200
 Unquote.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200
 Yes.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:28.420
 That is something that you should- if I started feeling the intense pressure of a pressure

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:34.140
 washer anywhere in my head, I'm going to see a medical professional.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:39.320
 I'm definitely going to be a little concerned if I'm spraying it on the front of my truck

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:45.520
 and it feels like my face is being caved in by 50 pounds per square inch of water.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.400
 Now maybe he just feels a tickle.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.840
 Maybe he feels the mist on his face from the water splashing off and he's like, "Oh my

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.940
 god, what is going on?"

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:59.320
 I'm a little concerned about him if he ever gets in a car accident or loses his job.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.320
 Then what does he do?

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.320
 He's like, "No, my face!"

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.820
 Is someone else's driving off?

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.820
 "No, no, no!

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.020
 Wash it in the gentle cycle!"

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.260
 Wakes up, his face is all got a bunch of little dents in it from rocks and stuff.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.300
 I mean like this guy's nuts, right?

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.680
 This isn't just me.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.540
 This guy's totally nuts.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.380
 And it's scary.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:21.300
 Because again, this is really how I have to wrap this up because I can go on for another

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.380
 hour about how my feelings on this whole thing, but episode can't go that long.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.500
 Here's my feelings about the whole thing.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.500
 You can believe in the Black Cube of Saturn, okay?

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:34.980
 I have no problem with that and you shouldn't care what I think about that either, right?

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.740
 I have weirdo conspiracy beliefs.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.820
 I just have weirdo beliefs in general.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.100
 Everyone has weirdo beliefs in general.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.660
 It's not a big deal.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.980
 When you are driving an 18-wheeler, don't do hallucinogenics.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.540
 I think that's a fair thing.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.260
 I think we can all agree on that, right?

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.260
 That's pretty simple.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.700
 That's a rule of the road.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.100
 It's a literal law.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.420
 It's not even something we have to agree on.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.220
 It's something that state legislatures have passed into law.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.460
 But I think this guy is so ingrained in this conspiracy that I'm not even really worried

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.100
 about arguing the conspiracy with him.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:14.620
 If I met this guy in real life, I'd be more worried about his well, his health.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.620
 And my health.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.620
 He's driving an 18-wheeler, but his health too, right?

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.180
 And he's so deep.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:28.020
 He's so deep that unless there's some sort of true breakthrough, any help rendered to

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:32.380
 him, I believe will just seem like it's part of the conspiracy theory.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.940
 If a bunch of you guys go to his Reddit page and you're like, "Hey, you're on this podcast,"

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.260
 he's going to take it as the conspiracy's true.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.860
 I'm being ridiculed for revealing the secret of the Black Cube of Saturn.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:46.860
 If someone approaches them and says, "Hey, I saw this Reddit post and you seem to be

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.220
 going through some issues, would you like some counseling?"

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.220
 They're onto him.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.820
 The Black Cube of Saturn people are onto him.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:56.420
 It's an interesting way we're going to wrap this story up like this because Mad Mike,

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:01.460
 Mad Mike, the guy we talked to first, the man who built the rocket to prove that the

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.180
 earth wasn't really flat, he had an interesting quote at the end of this article that I read

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.460
 about him.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.620
 He says, "My story really is incredible.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.820
 It's got a bunch of storylines.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.740
 The garage built thing in reference to the rocket.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.420
 I'm an older guy.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.580
 It's out in the middle of nowhere plus the flat earth."

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.580
 So he's just kind of talking about how his life seems to be quite unique.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.660
 Seems to be having fun in this moment.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:30.860
 The quote continues, "The problem is it brings out all the nuts also.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.260
 People questioning everything.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.860
 It's the downside of all of this."

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:40.220
 So here's a guy who believes that the earth is flat, that NASA is lying to him, world

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.540
 government is lying to him.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.460
 I don't know if he believed that they were covering it up to cover it proof of God, which

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.940
 is kind of the standard flat earth thing.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.500
 Some people believe they're just covering it up as a method of control.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.180
 But he believed that.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:58.660
 But he would get people, he would be approached by people who believed in things even more

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.140
 insane than flat earth.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.100
 Monkeys don't exist.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.860
 The color orange is satanic.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.380
 Things like that.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:15.740
 Album releases, Grammy shows, football scores, Bible verses, all pointing the path that the

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:21.660
 black cube of Saturn, which is an artificial intelligence on Saturn, is going to turn

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:27.460
 Kobe Bryant into an artificial intelligence that's going to convince all of us to worship

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:33.540
 the black cube is 100% more insane than flat earth.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:39.580
 There's no rocket test to prove that that conspiracy theory is true or false.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.700
 And that's what makes it dangerous.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.860
 People who believe in this theory have no other way to prove whether or not it's true

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:55.020
 or false than by taking action against this group of black cube worshipers.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.780
 Hopefully nothing happens.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:03.580
 Hopefully Blueberry's for life wakes up out of his awakening and just levels out or if

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.300
 needed get some professional help.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.820
 Hopefully his story does not end as tragically as Mad Mike Hughes.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:32.260
