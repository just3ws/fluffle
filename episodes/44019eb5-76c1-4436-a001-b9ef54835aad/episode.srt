1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,680
 Mental health parity is the law requiring health insurance coverage for mental health

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,480
 or substance use disorders that is no more restrictive than your physical health coverage.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,600
 That means if you're dealing with depression or anxiety, your access to mental health coverage

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,560
 is comparable to your access to physical health coverage for a broken arm or leg.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,900
 It's important to learn and understand the laws that protect you when you use your health

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,480
 insurance for treatment.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
 Know your rights.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,400
 Go to GetCoveredIllinois.gov for more information on mental health parity.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,160
 The world of conspiracy theorists lose another one of their heroes.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,600
 And then we meet a man who believes that not only was Kobe Bryant's death not an accident,

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,480
 but that Kobe Bryant is right now being uploaded into a massive computer taken from Saturn

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,480
 to become the Antichrist today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
 I'm having a great day.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,840
 I'm a little angry, a little angry, but we'll get to that in a second.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,520
 First off, check out this new art.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,760
 Pretty awesome, isn't it?

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,880
 This art is from Smashers_25.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,380
 That's her Instagram handle.

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,680
 And if you're looking for any sort of vector artwork, any sort of graphic design stuff,

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
 hit her up.

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,600
 I love that Ash Black's logo he just made over, of course, a one night listening to

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 the show has been dissected by other artists and reinterpreted.

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,280
 We had John from the Scar group, his version now Smashers_25 has hers.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,440
 It's just amazing how this show's really grown.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,240
 I really, really love you guys so much.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,720
 Until I found out that a group, I don't know why I didn't know this before.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,240
 And I'm kind of disappointed in you guys.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,320
 You guys didn't know this either.

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,000
 A group of rabbits is known as a fluffle.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,960
 Well, what's up fluffle gang?

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,800
 What's up little fluffles?

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,360
 We'll see how long that sticks.

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,920
 Secondly, in other news before we get started with the episode, this week is the end of

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
 season eight.

39
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,400
 By the end of the week, we're going to hit episode 400, guys.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 400.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
 That's a myth.

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
 We got the fluffles.

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,320
 Kind of do a little tummy little fluffle gang.

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,160
 Couldn't have done it without you guys.

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
 That's amazing.

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,480
 What that means is that every 50 episodes, I take a week off.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,080
 So next week, just going to do some reruns.

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,480
 My friend Sabine, she listens to the show and she goes, "I always listen to your current

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 episode."

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,600
 Then I'll listen to one or two episodes back because she just got into it about a month

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
 ago.

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,760
 This is a good way to catch up.

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,000
 If you haven't heard some past episodes, the best of week is a good way to do that.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
 But thank you so much Smashers_25.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,200
 Thank you Fluffle Gang for one more.

56
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,480
 We'll see how long that lasts.

57
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,320
 Thanks for your support and we're going to be taking a break soon.

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,600
 But now we're not.

59
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,360
 Now I'm putting back on my angry eyebrows.

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 Angry.

61
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,440
 Angry Jason.

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,160
 And I get angry every once in a while.

63
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,080
 Normally it's a Friday episode, but I woke up this morning to this news.

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,680
 Mad Mike Hughes.

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,480
 Flat Earth conspiratorist.

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
 Is that a word?

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,680
 Flat Earth believer.

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,320
 And also the man who's very well known for building a rocket.

69
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,840
 That he was going to climb inside.

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,800
 I think you know where this is going.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,120
 Climbs inside of his rocket and shoot himself up so he could see that the world was really

72
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,080
 a disk and he was going to take all these pictures.

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,000
 Because you know airplanes have concave windows on them.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,480
 So that's why the Earth looks like a circle because the windows design that way.

75
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,560
 Anyway, so.

76
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
 He shoots himself out of a rocket.

77
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
 Not a rocket.

78
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,080
 Earth styled or self-taught rocket scientist.

79
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,080
 I will say this, that's smarter than anything I could have ever done.

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,840
 So I applaud the fact that he taught himself rocket technology because I couldn't do that.

81
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,480
 What I'm upset about is he's dead now.

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,760
 Sorry, I probably could have doled that news a little bit more.

83
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,600
 You're like, you were just holding your little pinot that said "Mad Mike."

84
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,320
 You're like, "Oh, is this going to be awesome?"

85
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
 "No."

86
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
 Sorry, if you like the guy.

87
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,720
 I'm sure he was a great person, but last time he did one of these he launched himself

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,960
 up about 1700 feet and then the parachutes come out of the rocket and he slowly glides

89
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
 to Earth.

90
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,360
 Well, this weekend when his rocket took off, what they believe is that the packages like

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,560
 holding the parachutes got ripped on the launch pad on like the...

92
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
 I can see that's something.

93
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,480
 At least this guy, I can't even describe the stuff this guy built.

94
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,080
 So he's definitely smarter than me in that regard.

95
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,400
 But the parachute thingies got ripped and then that means the parachutes themselves

96
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
 got ripped.

97
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,880
 So the rocket took off successfully, but it had nothing to stop the landing and the rocket

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
 fell to Earth.

99
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 And there were people there watching it.

100
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,240
 There were some journalists and supporters of his and things like that.

101
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,920
 So that's horrible.

102
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
 That's absolutely horrible.

103
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,120
 And I feel really bad for him.

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,840
 I feel bad for his fluffle.

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,440
 I feel bad for his family.

106
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,720
 I feel bad just all around.

107
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,120
 And so why are you angry, Jason?

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,160
 Why'd you put on your angry eyebrows for this story?

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,680
 Shouldn't this be a celebration of life?

110
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
 Yeah.

111
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,080
 Yeah, I do think that he was a smart dude and he was doing something that he loved.

112
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:26,280
 The problem is he died over a conspiracy theory that we all know is not true.

113
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
 Right?

114
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,520
 Like shouldn't we be in agreement that this is not true?

115
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,720
 But he's dead now.

116
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
 Because he believed that the Earth was flat.

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
 I don't know.

118
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,960
 There's just kind of, it's...

119
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
 You know, one of the things that I like about the show is that it brings like the fun back

120
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,720
 to conspiracy theories.

121
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,960
 It brings the fun back to the world of the paranormal.

122
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,040
 So when do people take this stuff so seriously?

123
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,360
 And that's fine too, but then there's a limit.

124
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,440
 There's a difference between me joking about aliens, me beating up...

125
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
 That's not a joke actually.

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,640
 I'm just just lay out aliens.

127
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,040
 But there's a difference between me joking about beating up aliens.

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
 Again, not a joke.

129
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
 There's a difference between people who are like, "No, aliens are actually 100% real."

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,680
 And then the people who believe that reptilians are taking over the planet.

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,680
 And then even then a group of people is, "The reptilians are taking over the planet, therefore

132
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,400
 I have to shoot my minister eight times in the head."

133
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,840
 Which actually happened.

134
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,320
 And oddly enough, the minister survived.

135
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,720
 Which is weird.

136
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 Which is weird.

137
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
 Kyle Odom was that guy.

138
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,200
 He was the shooter.

139
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 Maybe we'll do an episode on him.

140
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
 It's really well known.

141
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 That's why I haven't covered it yet.

142
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,360
 There's that gradation there.

143
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,880
 So you can believe in Flat Earth all you want.

144
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,800
 And I'm allowed to laugh at you all I want.

145
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,240
 Because I think it's a stupid conspiracy theory.

146
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,720
 And you can laugh at me and we can have that enjoyment.

147
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
 But then when you die over it, it's just...

148
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,960
 It makes me mad.

149
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
 Makes me mad.

150
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,840
 So, mad my cues.

151
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,080
 That's awesome you were doing your thing.

152
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,160
 It sucks that it ended so tragically.

153
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,080
 I wish that you had had many more launches and you had been able to observe the splendor

154
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,800
 of the curved earth and come down and said, "Hey, you know, I was wrong."

155
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,120
 That would have been the happiest ending of the story.

156
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,240
 But instead, a man's dead.

157
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
 You know what?

158
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
 I just thought about this.

159
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,160
 I almost can guarantee now that I don't live a lot in the Flat Earth world.

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,280
 Because again, that's a real popular conspiracy theory.

161
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,560
 I just flirt in and out of it.

162
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,040
 I studied it a long time ago.

163
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
 I bet you...

164
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
 I should check this out.

165
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,400
 I bet you there's a conspiracy theory.

166
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:35,640
 I bet you anything that people are saying that he went so high that NASA took him out.

167
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
 It was...

168
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,360
 I bet you anything they're already claiming it's a murder.

169
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,120
 I'll check that out and we'll see if we find anything out.

170
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
 Let me write that down here because I'll figure it out otherwise.

171
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,640
 Because I'm a busy man.

172
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,080
 Where's my pen?

173
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,800
 And speaking of being busy, I'm going to take this woman out real quick.

174
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,840
 You know, since I'm going to be gone for a week, definitely listen to my episodes, my

175
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,680
 classic episodes, I think you'll have a lot of fun with those.

176
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,400
 This week and I've been watching, and last week and I watched a lot of movies.

177
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,680
 If you guys want to keep up on the movies and watching, you can sign up for my Twitter

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
 account.

179
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,120
 A lot of times I'm tweeting about movies I've seen.

180
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,080
 But I saw a movie the other day called There Are Monsters.

181
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,160
 Highly recommended.

182
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,320
 It's a great conspiracy horror movie.

183
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,520
 It's a great sci-fi horror movie.

184
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,720
 It's just a great horror movie.

185
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,000
 And it's interesting because it's a...

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,480
 It's one long narrative, but it took the filmmaker five years to shoot it.

187
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,880
 And it came in like 2013.

188
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,520
 It took him like five years to shoot it.

189
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,600
 And so it seems like a lot of little short stories connected together.

190
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,120
 So like, we'll have our heroes go into a supermarket.

191
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,640
 We'll have our heroes go to a dentist's office.

192
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,920
 We'll have our heroes on a bus.

193
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,480
 You can tell like all of these were shot as almost like short movies.

194
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,880
 It was really, really good horror movie.

195
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,240
 There Are Monsters.

196
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
 Check it out.

197
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
 Dead Rabbit recommends There Are Monsters.

198
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,120
 I don't say anything else because I just recommend watching it.

199
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,440
 But let's go ahead though and move on to our next topic, our next story for the day.

200
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,600
 Now our next story, our next story coming up, we're going not to a place, but to a mind.

201
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,800
 We're traveling into the mind of a man.

202
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,440
 Actually, no, I guess we'll go to a place.

203
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,320
 We're at a diner because this is easier narrative setup.

204
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,320
 We're now sitting at a diner across from a man.

205
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,000
 He's probably in his, I'm going to guess, late 20s, early 30s.

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
 And he's sitting there and he's drinking coffee.

207
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
 His eyes are shifting from side to side.

208
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,320
 We're making us a little nervous, but it's in the middle of the day.

209
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,200
 We're sitting in the little diner in, let's say, Sedona, Arizona.

210
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,520
 I don't know.

211
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,280
 Somewhere where there is a road because we need to make a quick getaway if these things

212
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
 turned bad.

213
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,920
 And he's sitting there and he's drinking his coffee and we're drinking our beverages

214
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,080
 of choice.

215
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,760
 And we go, "So sir, we've heard that you have some information for us."

216
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,520
 And he's like, "I do.

217
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
 I do."

218
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,400
 And can you reveal your name to us, sir?

219
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
 And he goes, "Yes, yes.

220
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,720
 Well, I can give you my Reddit handle."

221
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,040
 He says with a grin, "This is a good, this is a real dude, okay?

222
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
 I'm not making this guy up.

223
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,640
 This guy is not a narrative device.

224
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,360
 He's a real man.

225
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,080
 He's only known to the general public as blueberries for life.

226
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,120
 Blueberries for life."

227
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,040
 So blueberries, can I call you blueberries or should I call you Mr. For Life?

228
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,720
 Oh no, blueberries is fine.

229
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 So blueberries.

230
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,320
 No, what am I finding so other than that name?

231
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
 Being weird.

232
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,520
 And actually it's the most normal thing that we're about to discuss.

233
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,600
 I find it odd that someone who believes what we're about to talk to, the main thing in

234
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,200
 his existence is blueberries.

235
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
 Just the fact that they exist.

236
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,680
 Not blueberry pie for life, not blueberry soda, blueberry, just blueberries, right?

237
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
 Blueberries for life.

238
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,240
 He's sitting there across from us from the diner and he goes, "I have important information

239
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,480
 for you guys.

240
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,000
 You guys are true believers, right?"

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,200
 And now our eyes are shifting from side to side.

242
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 We're like, "Yeah, we believe everything."

243
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,440
 And he's like, "Good, good, good."

244
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,920
 Pulls out his notebook.

245
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,360
 January 17th, Eminem drops music to be murdered by.

246
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
 I haven't heard that album.

247
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
 I haven't heard that album.

248
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,520
 I looked up some of the lyrics because I'm a boomer now.

249
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,440
 I didn't have time to actually listen to the album.

250
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,680
 I was like, "Yeah, that seems okay."

251
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
 He raps too fast for me now.

252
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
 I liked old Eminem.

253
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,760
 I like his first three albums, but then he just got faster and faster.

254
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
 I'm not into that.

255
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
 I know a lot of people are though.

256
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
 He has his fans.

257
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:22,640
 January 26th, Kobe Bryant dies while the Grammys are rehearsing at the Staples Center.

258
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,240
 Kind of like looking at each other.

259
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,520
 We're like, "Yeah, we know that he passed away.

260
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,120
 Is it important that they were practicing at the Staples Center at the Grammys?"

261
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

262
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,960
 You see, the Staples Center is where he used to play basketball.

263
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,800
 So, but now they're doing like musical stuff there in the music industry.

264
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
 And we're like, "Oh, great.

265
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 It's one of these."

266
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 Sorry.

267
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,960
 Don't go into the music industry stuff yet.

268
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
 Save that.

269
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
 He's like, "Okay, okay."

270
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,440
 January 17th, Eminem drops music to be murdered by his new album.

271
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
 January 26th, Kobe Bryant dies.

272
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
 Helicopter crash.

273
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,600
 January 31st, Lil Wayne drops the album Funeral, which I have listened to.

274
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,120
 And it's okay.

275
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,080
 Like I haven't listened to a Lil Wayne album since the Carter III.

276
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,640
 And again, I think I just am a fan.

277
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,160
 Rap music evolves incredibly fast.

278
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,440
 Rock music, it goes pretty slow in the same rock band unless they're Maroon 5, which I

279
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,000
 think they're more of a pop band now.

280
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,920
 They kind of slowly grow over time.

281
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,000
 Rappers, like you can go, you can miss an album and it's a completely different artist.

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
 Rap music goes super, super fast.

283
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,880
 Anyway, so I wasn't a huge fan of Lil Wayne's Funeral album.

284
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,240
 It is interesting though, Hidden Code, you take the album Funeral or the album Art for

285
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
 Funeral.

286
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
 And you flip it upside down.

287
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
 It says Lil Wayne.

288
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,400
 It was interesting.

289
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
 And now at this point you're looking at me in the diner and you're like, dude, just let

290
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,160
 him finish his dumb conspiracy theory.

291
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,840
 This isn't XXL Magazine.

292
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
 You're not spin.

293
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
 Okay, okay.

294
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,680
 January 31st, Lil Wayne drops Funeral.

295
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,960
 February 2nd, Super Bowl 54 happens.

296
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,800
 And February 2nd famously was 02, 02, 2020.

297
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,320
 And it was the only date within 1100 years that was a paladrome.

298
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,880
 And then he starts going off on all this stupid date stuff, which I'm sure you guys have run

299
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
 into.

300
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,920
 If you're into any of this conspiracy theory stuff, that day, and I think we did an episode

301
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
 on it too.

302
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
 That date was doomed.

303
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,320
 Like something was supposed to big was happen.

304
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
 Nothing happened.

305
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,600
 But that's not changing Blueberry's mind about this.

306
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,560
 Because here's his take on Super Bowl 54.

307
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,800
 And he gets real close to us.

308
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,960
 We can smell the coffee on his breath.

309
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,720
 And then he says, quote, he actually says that word as well.

310
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,080
 The halftime show was a sex magic ritual to the Black Cube of Saturn.

311
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,400
 Now he leans back in his chair, all smug.

312
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 So he's dropped the bomb.

313
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,080
 That Kobe Bryant's death is linked to the Black Cube of Saturn.

314
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,440
 You're perplexed because you have no idea what the Black Cube of Saturn is.

315
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,400
 Hopefully not.

316
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
 If you do.

317
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,160
 I think there's better uses of your time because I think the Black Cube of Saturn is

318
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,040
 one of the dumbest conspir- this is the other thing that makes me mad about this episode.

319
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,800
 Black Cube of Saturn is one of the dumbest conspiracy theories I've come across.

320
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,120
 And I'm going to go over it as briefly as I can.

321
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,600
 This is what it is.

322
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,040
 On Saturn, there is a hexagonal storm.

323
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,760
 And basically a hexagon, if you draw lines over it, it becomes a 3D cube.

324
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,920
 You can draw lines over anything and make anything.

325
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,880
 So right there, the logic behind it is dumb.

326
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,440
 There's hexagonal storm on Saturn and that if you draw a little line over it, that's

327
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,760
 a cube.

328
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,920
 On Earth, you have a bunch of Black Cubes everywhere.

329
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,200
 You'll find these images everywhere.

330
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,440
 They're like, "Here's a Black Cube in Dresden.

331
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,120
 Here's a Black Cube in Brooklyn.

332
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,080
 Here's a Black Cube in Vermont.

333
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,800
 Here's a Black Cube in Berkeley."

334
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,040
 See anything similar?

335
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,240
 Yeah, there's four photos of Black Cubes.

336
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,480
 Apparently there's some Jewish ritual where they wear little Black Cubes on their head.

337
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,760
 Now let me say this for a second because they're saying that they're worshiping the Black

338
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
 Cube.

339
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
 Let me say this for a second.

340
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,920
 When you think of something that Orthodox Jews wear on their heads, what do you think

341
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,360
 of?

342
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,400
 Do you think of the Black Cube or do you think of the Yamaka?

343
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,480
 So again, this is why this gets me worked up.

344
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,720
 I'm not like super, I'm like, "No, they don't like the Yamaka?"

345
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,440
 This is the problem with this conspiracy theory, is that if you point out that eight times,

346
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,920
 or someone will be like, "There's 20 times."

347
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
 It doesn't matter.

348
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,400
 You can point to me the 20 different Black Cubes in society, but you have to disregard

349
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:35,280
 every other thing in society that doesn't involve a Black Cube.

350
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,920
 That's the problem with these conspiracy theories.

351
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,400
 This one's fairly recent.

352
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,480
 They really tried making this to be like, "Thousands of years ago, they discovered the..."

353
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
 Here's the thing.

354
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,320
 We didn't know there was a hexagonal storm on Saturn until fairly recently.

355
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,520
 So how cavemen were worshiping the Black Cube on Saturn is beyond me.

356
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,600
 Also, apparently a wedding ring, putting the ring on the finger, is because of Jupiter.

357
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,560
 Damn it, because of Saturn's rings?

358
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
 So that's...

359
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:14,680
 But they didn't know there were rings around Saturn when we were putting rings on fingers.

360
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,320
 It's all backwards.

361
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,080
 It's all been created backwards, right?

362
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,440
 They didn't know there was a hexagon.

363
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,040
 They didn't know there was a cube, sorry, on Saturn.

364
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,920
 They didn't know there were rings, but apparently people knew this way back when.

365
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,480
 And now I can point to the fact that in Spider-Man 2, apparently there's a list of movies.

366
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,400
 There's a list of movies that the Black Cube has been in.

367
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,200
 There's maybe like 20 of them, and it's like Spider-Man 2, Matrix Revolutions.

368
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,400
 Oh, and then they go, "Oh, and Avengers.

369
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
 Avengers the Cube."

370
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,560
 Because it's not Black!

371
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,000
 So now it's just any cube possible.

372
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,160
 Also one of the movies they listed that has a cube in it.

373
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,080
 The Movie Cube.

374
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,400
 But oddly enough, not the three sequels.

375
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,040
 So why is going on?

376
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
 Basically...

377
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,080
 Basically, this makes me so mad, and this is why.

378
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,360
 It is...

379
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,280
 And we've seen a lot of conspiracy theories like this.

380
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,760
 It's a conspiracy theory out of omission.

381
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,320
 So I can point to the few times the cube is there, but I have to ignore the fact that...

382
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
 It's the major...

383
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:25,040
 And they point obviously to Mecca, where the people walk around the giant Black Cube in

384
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,840
 the middle of Mecca, and they're like, "No joke.

385
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,480
 They walk around it the way the rings rotate around Saturn.

386
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,440
 They didn't know rings were around Saturn when they built Mecca."

387
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,640
 So just really...

388
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,080
 There are multiple religions that don't have Black Cube things in it.

389
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,200
 Just famously, I don't think Jesus had a Black Cube dropped on him.

390
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,640
 I'm pretty sure there's not a Black Cube in Buddhism, or Zoroastheism, I know I can't

391
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,760
 pronounce that one, or really anything else, right?

392
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,720
 You can point to the few times there are Black Cubes and go, "Oh, it's proof."

393
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,040
 That works secretly being run by people who worship the Black Cube, because I can show

394
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,640
 you a room from the United Nations that's a prayer and meditation room that has a Black

395
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
 Cube in it.

396
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,360
 First off, I don't know where that photo was taken.

397
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,440
 I don't know if it's called a prayer or meditation room, and if both of those are true, I don't

398
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,040
 care that there's modern art in a room where you're supposed to go and contemplate things.

399
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,600
 If there was a Black Cube in every place of worship on the planet, and not just Spider-Man

400
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,760
 2 or the Matrix Revelations or whatever, revolutions, it doesn't matter, if every single

401
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,320
 movie had a Black Cube in it, and if there was a Black Cube in every single location

402
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,880
 of worship, in every financial district, in every capital, you might be onto something.

403
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,880
 If it was onto 50% of those locations, you might be onto something.

404
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
 20?

405
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,480
 20.

406
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,920
 And the lunatic I'm about to talk to you about, let's get back to blueberries for life.

407
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,400
 I think I've vented long enough, and this extra long Jason vented, I hate that, I really

408
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,120
 dislike that conspiracy theory, because I think I dislike it for one or two reasons,

409
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,400
 for one, it's incredibly uncreative.

410
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,520
 It's really, really lame.

411
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,960
 Let's look at, and again, they're not even restricting it to Black Cubes anymore, just

412
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,440
 any cube, ice cubes, part of this, actual ice cubes are part of it.

413
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,960
 Anyways, it's not just Black Cubes anymore, it's any sort of cube.

414
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,200
 Cubics, Rubik's Cube, be careful with those guys.

415
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,040
 It makes me mad because it's completely uncreative, it's basically anything that's a basic geometric

416
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,560
 shape is proof of this conspiracy, and too, I think it irritates me how fast it's growing.

417
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,520
 It's not as big as Flat Earth, it may not ever get as big as Flat Earth, but it's definitely

418
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,400
 bigger than stuff like mountains, there used to be trees and things like that, it's growing.

419
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,200
 If you type in Black Cube of Saturn into Google, it's funny, you'll get a lot of results,

420
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,280
 it'll be the same photos, over and over and over and over again.

421
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,440
 Let's get back to this lunatic at the coffee shop though, that was my rant for the day.

422
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,520
 Oh, I don't know, I may go off on one again because of this guy.

423
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,560
 So he says this, "The halftime show was a sex magic ritual to the Black Cube of Saturn.

424
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:29,200
 On February 3rd, a photo surfaced from an airplane that had an article written about

425
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,200
 it.

426
00:20:36,200 --> 00:21:02,680
 He's just posting on something, oh wait till we get into this dude's backstory, and then

427
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,240
 you'll see why I'm a little concerned about this guy.

428
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,760
 So he believes that Eminem releases an album about being murdered, Kobe Bryant dies while

429
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,440
 the Grammys are being practiced at his place of work, Lil Wayne does an album called Funeral,

430
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,600
 and then on February 3rd, some photo gets taken out of an airplane.

431
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,960
 That is all part of the conspiracy theory.

432
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,120
 Here's this quote, we're going back to his words here.

433
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,720
 This entire series of events I'm explaining is a ritual to the Black Cube of Saturn in

434
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:42,680
 order to bring Kobe back to life through AI and present him to the world and tell us AI

435
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,480
 is the new way of life.

436
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,080
 This will be the Antichrist.

437
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:56,240
 Kobe died on January 26th, 2020 and as of this writing it is 2/21/2020 and there are no funeral

438
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
 plans for him.

439
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,760
 That's not true, his funeral was held on February 7th.

440
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,280
 So right there you didn't do the basic research to prove your point.

441
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,160
 And Jason, at this point you're kind of like putting your animal arm, you're like Jason

442
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,000
 we are at a diner, we are, I've never seen you this worked up bro.

443
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,560
 Well listen dude, okay first off, okay I'll move your hand off my arm, I'll put it on

444
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,800
 my knee.

445
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:26,200
 And then secondly, let's say that you're trying to convince me that the world government

446
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,320
 has taken a dead basketball player and is going to, of all people, of all people who

447
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,240
 died, no offense against Kobe Bryant.

448
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,440
 But if Kobe Bryant's ghost walked in my apartment right now and told me that he was the way,

449
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,680
 the truth and the light, I'm not going to start worshiping him.

450
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,960
 No offense again Kobe, but I think you understand.

451
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,080
 It would take more than a basketball, or really anyway, if Britney Spears ghost walked in

452
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,200
 my apartment right now and told me to start worshiping her, I wouldn't.

453
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,960
 And I love Britney Spears.

454
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,080
 I'd worship her while she was alive.

455
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,240
 But which I actually might be even more creepy, but my point is is that it's going to take

456
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,720
 more than a, one of the most amazing basketball players of all time to convince me that AI

457
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,200
 is the way.

458
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
 Right?

459
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,440
 Anyways, get your basic facts right as well.

460
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,560
 He already had a funeral, he had a funeral two weeks before you wrote this stuff.

461
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,520
 After, and I'm going to spare you a ton of this, but after this to prove himself, to

462
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,400
 prove his facts, and he ends it with the normal conspiracy theorist thing, I don't care if

463
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,800
 you believe me, you do care if we believe you, that's why you spent eight hours writing

464
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,960
 this.

465
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,000
 You know people aren't going to believe you, so you kind of put up that deflection thing,

466
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,960
 fine, it's a psychological trick, whatever.

467
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,200
 He goes into a ton.

468
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,040
 The next, you can go through the show notes, the link will be there, but the next, I don't

469
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,320
 know, five, six paragraphs are just new neurology stuff, number games, and I'll read this one.

470
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
 This is proof, this is proof.

471
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,360
 Get your calculators ready guys.

472
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,120
 This will prove to you this madman's onto something.

473
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
 Quote.

474
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,760
 The score, okay, the score of the game, so the Super Bowl score was predetermined by

475
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,960
 the fact that the Black Cube Society, or let's say whatever they are, the order of the Black

476
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,120
 Cube, the Black Cubians, they had preordained the actual score of the football game, which

477
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,000
 I'm sure a lot of 49er fans would agree with, at least that part of it, but the score has

478
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,400
 something to do with all of this.

479
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,320
 So, the score of the game when it finished, that would have been hilarious if you took

480
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,120
 the score like during like eight minutes before half time, just an arbitrary number.

481
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:33,040
 The score of the game when it finished read, San Francisco 20, Kansas City 31, 2 plus 0

482
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:42,800
 equals 2, thank you, 3 plus 1 equals 4, 24, wait, what, okay, so 2 plus 0 is 2 and 3 plus

483
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,160
 1 is 4, so now we have the number 24.

484
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:55,760
 2 times 4 is 8, Super Bowl 54, 5 plus 4 is 9, Kobe died nine days after the ritual began,

485
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,760
 which is a famous, oh and this is, I can't believe I haven't gotten to this yet, so he

486
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,800
 does not, he believes that the Black Cube Society of Saturn and the Illuminati are

487
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,800
 one and the same or the Illuminati work for him or Illuminati are their goons or the goons

488
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,680
 control them, who knows, but he never uses the term Illuminati.

489
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:22,560
 He never uses the name Illuminati, he calls them throughout this post the Illuma Donkey,

490
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:29,520
 the Illuma Donkey, which I love actually, I love that, it doesn't rhyme, it doesn't make

491
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:37,040
 really any sense, Donkey, it's funny, Donkey worshipers are actually a slang term for Christians

492
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,880
 way back in the day, like 38 AD, people refer to Christians as donkey worshipers because

493
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
 he rode into town on a donkey.

494
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,360
 I actually have a story coming up on that, there's an interesting little thing about

495
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,080
 that, but so it's weird, I know that when I keep seeing him calling him Illuma Donkey,

496
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,240
 I do, because I read that story so recently, I keep associating that as a knock against

497
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,080
 Christians, so and I know this guy's not smart enough to know that, but it throws me

498
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,360
 off, so I'm thinking is he also like mocking Christians, I don't think so, I think he's

499
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,560
 just trying to find a funny way to refer to the Illuminati, he could have called him the

500
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:20,640
 Illuminati, like not boo, thumbs down, but anyways, Illuma Donkey, it's funny, it's my

501
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,160
 one life preserver in the sea of madness that when I was reading this thing, anyways he

502
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,200
 refers to him as Illuminati, so he says that if you add up the scores and do all this math

503
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,920
 stuff, 5+4 is 9 and Kobe died 9 days after the ritual began, and you go what about the

504
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,600
 8, you said the score added up to 8, he, again he goes on for 6 paragraphs or 5 paragraphs,

505
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:48,920
 it doesn't matter, wait 5+6 is 11, uh oh, 9, 11, so anyways, I mean that's basically

506
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,720
 the nonsense that he goes through, he begins going through Kobe Bryant's jersey number and

507
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,640
 finding Bible verses that correlate with it, and out of some of them they talk about two

508
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,960
 mountains, and Kobe Bryant's helicopter crashed in the mountains, yes, the spiritual history

509
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,040
 of the Jewish people predicted the fact that Kobe Bryant's helicopter wasn't going to

510
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,120
 fly right in 2020.

511
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,680
 Who knew guys, who knew, I'm convinced now, you know what's funny, there's probably a

512
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,560
 pretty good chance that this show could have just become this, if this had been the first

513
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:29,600
 episode I ever did, that it would have just been 400 episodes of me basically being just

514
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,640
 grumpy old man Jason, reviewing some conspiracy theories, but it takes a lot out of him, I'm

515
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,040
 sweating over here honestly.

516
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,200
 Anyways, let's start wrapping this up, this is definitely going to be a long episode,

517
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,400
 I don't want to edit out a lot because I think a lot of this stuff is gold and it's the end

518
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,200
 of the season, we haven't had a lot of long episodes this season, so here we go, this

519
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,520
 ends with this quote, right, his article ends with this quote, it could all be coincidence,

520
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,760
 so at least he's open to that, it could all be coincidence, though he continues, though

521
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:09,880
 I know coincidences don't exist as I was showing this on my very first shroom trip.

522
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,600
 Let's go back up and talk a little bit about blueberries for life, we've left a diner and

523
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,720
 we're walking and we're like, "Dick has a lunatic" and I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

524
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,480
 he's a lunatic, but we're just getting to the tip of the shroom," because this guy's

525
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,580
 not only an avid drug user, right, when I went to look to see if he had any more rantines

526
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,280
 about this on Reddit, any other conspiracy theories, none that I could find, every other

527
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,200
 post on Reddit was about him tripping on some sort of hallucinogen, okay?

528
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:45,080
 Hey man, it just took eight ounces of doozock, bloke, and you know, I'm tripping out, I'm

529
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,520
 seeing blueberries everywhere, man, blueberries connect us all?

530
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,640
 No, I mean, you're like, "Jason, you're not going to start bagging on this guy for doing

531
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
 hallucinogens."

532
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,660
 No, not necessarily, but let's keep- I will say it kind of makes your arguments a little

533
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:06,940
 less valid when you didn't discover them because you overheard a police officer and a governor

534
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:12,260
 talking about rigging an election, you overheard them because a clockwork elf appeared out

535
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,820
 of your left eyeball and whispered it into your nostril.

536
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,380
 I- I'm just- that's just me.

537
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,460
 But what he does, the type of drugs he does, I really don't care about.

538
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,200
 Unless- let's find out a little bit about this guy, here's some quotes.

539
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,880
 Okay, so I've been awakening rapidly for the last seven months.

540
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,960
 I meditate several times a day and I've seen a lot of unexplained shit.

541
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,360
 I've also done my fair share of psychedelics, and then it goes on.

542
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,640
 And that's actually how he starts off.

543
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,000
 So he lets us know right up the front that this dude's tripping 24/7.

544
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,040
 Now when someone says they've been awakening rapidly for the last seven months, I had a

545
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,680
 feeling for what was going on, and you made two.

546
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,580
 But let's continue, move on down this reddit post.

547
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,860
 I have abilities, he says.

548
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,100
 I always had them.

549
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,180
 But I've ignored them since I was a teenager about 16 years ago.

550
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,100
 Yeah, remember when you had mutant powers, remember when you had quote-unquote abilities

551
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,940
 and you're just like, "Nah, I'm not gonna deal with those."

552
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,700
 But anyways, apparently he's too good for his mutant powers.

553
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,660
 "Muty, go home!"

554
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,300
 Continue this quote here, but back to his quote, referring to his gifts.

555
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,380
 But they are rapidly increasing.

556
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,040
 These last few days with these planet alignments, it's been crazy.

557
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,160
 The tugging and pulling of my spirit by the sun has been so strong, I felt like I was

558
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
 going to...

559
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,240
 Now, this is where I thought, I think this guy might have developed schizophrenia.

560
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,560
 And I was like, he's talking about, he's had these abilities since he was a teenager, and

561
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,960
 in the last seven months they've been rapidly awakening, and he's feeling like he's just

562
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,960
 so ecstatic and he's taking all these drugs.

563
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,380
 And that's what I was saying, I think I know what's going on in you, might too.

564
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:57,820
 It almost feels like he has some sort of mental disorder that's rapidly overtaking him.

565
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,940
 Delusional thinking to say the least.

566
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
 Because if you...

567
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,980
 I encourage you to go to the show notes and look...

568
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,460
 Okay, and I want to say this, don't harass this guy.

569
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,860
 Not telling you guys to harass this dude or nothing like that, but if you want to see,

570
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,460
 like, how someone can just spin what...

571
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,260
 I mean, I'm sure all that math took him hours to do.

572
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:23,320
 And I'm sure not only was he happy to do it the whole time, but his mind was just blowing

573
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,920
 every time a math thing.

574
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,440
 And again, with the math, it's the Black Cube, it's all a conspiracy of omission.

575
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,840
 Any math formulas that don't match the conspiracy you're looking for, you simply disregard.

576
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,440
 What was the daily attendance of the...

577
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,760
 You know what, I'm not even going to get into that because I could go off on a whole

578
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,960
 other rant about numbers stuff.

579
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,680
 But anyways, the point is, is that this guy might have some sort of mental issue.

580
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,700
 Let's go back to this quote here, because this is really the main reason why I'm so

581
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,740
 fired up about this, other than the fact that it's a stupid conspiracy theory and it's

582
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,620
 a waste of time for anyone to believe in it.

583
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,860
 Other than those things, back to this quote.

584
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,820
 These last few days with these planet alignments, it's been crazy.

585
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,500
 The tugging and pulling of my spirit by the sun has been so strong, I felt like I was

586
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:14,140
 going to fly a few times while driving.

587
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
 Next line.

588
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,640
 Now, I'm a truck driver by trade.

589
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,640
 So this guy we've been talking about this whole time, who spends all this time on Reddit

590
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,000
 talking about doing hallucinogens, who so high that he believes that the order of album

591
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,120
 releases tell him that Kobe Bryant is going to appear in a computer, his little face is

592
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,720
 going to appear on everyone's smartphones and he's going to be like, "Hello everyone."

593
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,840
 He believes, and he's driving an 18 wheeler.

594
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,840
 Down your street.

595
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,820
 Doing math equations while he's trying to steer.

596
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,620
 Tripping balls all the time.

597
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,980
 Now he does say he usually only micro doses.

598
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:05,580
 Dude, I remember when I was in a driver's class way back in the day, it was like, it

599
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
 would have been like 1990.

600
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,300
 It's a sophomore in high school.

601
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,760
 I remember I was always the combination of the jerk slash quote unquote cool kid.

602
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
 I thought I was cool.

603
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,240
 It wasn't that cool, but I was a jerk.

604
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,800
 I remember I was sitting in the back of class because I never sat in the front and we were

605
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,240
 going over driver's ed stuff.

606
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,000
 There's all these rules of the road and I remember just kind of sitting there leaning

607
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 back and the teacher's going over all this stuff and I raise my hand and I'm like, dude,

608
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,680
 all these rules, when are we supposed to have fun?

609
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,840
 And the kids and laugh class and that teacher turned beat ready goes, "Do you want a driver

610
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,940
 of an 18 wheeler having fun on the road?"

611
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,540
 And I just sat there and I'm like, yeah, kind of.

612
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,300
 Because I was a jerk, right?

613
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,460
 I was a jerk.

614
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,060
 I didn't say, yeah, kind of super loud just enough for the kids next to me, but the initial

615
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,980
 question I asked in front of the whole class.

616
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,740
 And as an adult, I think, I still laugh.

617
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,700
 Sorry, but as an adult, I think, yeah, you don't want someone to have an 18 wheeler

618
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,620
 be having fun popping wheelies.

619
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,540
 You definitely don't want them tripping on hallucinogenics thinking about the black

620
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,540
 cube.

621
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,920
 Let's go on with this quote.

622
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,120
 "Now, I am a truck driver by trade and I meditate in my truck every morning.

623
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,360
 Please let it be parked, bro."

624
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
 Back to the quote.

625
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,080
 I am su- I love this part.

626
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,040
 This part, remember those headmasters from Transformers, the old school Transformers?

627
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,280
 The head was actually a separate little tiny guy action figure.

628
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,400
 If you'd transform in the head, you'd put it on top of the robot.

629
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,240
 So it was like man and machine teamed up.

630
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,480
 That's real life now.

631
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,040
 So at least I got this because I love Transformers.

632
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,880
 At least this guy might be an actual headmaster.

633
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
 Back to this quote.

634
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,780
 "I am super connected to my truck in a strange way.

635
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,980
 I feel other vehicles when they are around me."

636
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,260
 That's again, dude.

637
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,540
 Use your eyes and the brake pedal.

638
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,860
 Don't feel out the universe to whether or not you're scraping a family of four off the

639
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,860
 freeway.

640
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,860
 I feel other vehicles when they are around me.

641
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,860
 I feel this.

642
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
 I love this.

643
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,560
 Pressure washer on the truck.

644
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,240
 Spraying down with the pressure washer.

645
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,940
 I feel the pressure washer on the truck in my forehead in the corresponding part as my

646
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,040
 face is the front of the truck and the back is the back.

647
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
 I know.

648
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,200
 Super weird, right?

649
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
 Unquote.

650
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
 Yes.

651
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,420
 That is something that you should- if I started feeling the intense pressure of a pressure

652
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:34,140
 washer anywhere in my head, I'm going to see a medical professional.

653
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,320
 I'm definitely going to be a little concerned if I'm spraying it on the front of my truck

654
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:45,520
 and it feels like my face is being caved in by 50 pounds per square inch of water.

655
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,400
 Now maybe he just feels a tickle.

656
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,840
 Maybe he feels the mist on his face from the water splashing off and he's like, "Oh my

657
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,940
 god, what is going on?"

658
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,320
 I'm a little concerned about him if he ever gets in a car accident or loses his job.

659
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
 Then what does he do?

660
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
 He's like, "No, my face!"

661
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,820
 Is someone else's driving off?

662
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,820
 "No, no, no!

663
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,020
 Wash it in the gentle cycle!"

664
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,260
 Wakes up, his face is all got a bunch of little dents in it from rocks and stuff.

665
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,300
 I mean like this guy's nuts, right?

666
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,680
 This isn't just me.

667
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,540
 This guy's totally nuts.

668
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,380
 And it's scary.

669
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,300
 Because again, this is really how I have to wrap this up because I can go on for another

670
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,380
 hour about how my feelings on this whole thing, but episode can't go that long.

671
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,500
 Here's my feelings about the whole thing.

672
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
 You can believe in the Black Cube of Saturn, okay?

673
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,980
 I have no problem with that and you shouldn't care what I think about that either, right?

674
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,740
 I have weirdo conspiracy beliefs.

675
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,820
 I just have weirdo beliefs in general.

676
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,100
 Everyone has weirdo beliefs in general.

677
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,660
 It's not a big deal.

678
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,980
 When you are driving an 18-wheeler, don't do hallucinogenics.

679
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,540
 I think that's a fair thing.

680
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,260
 I think we can all agree on that, right?

681
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,260
 That's pretty simple.

682
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,700
 That's a rule of the road.

683
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,100
 It's a literal law.

684
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,420
 It's not even something we have to agree on.

685
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,220
 It's something that state legislatures have passed into law.

686
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,460
 But I think this guy is so ingrained in this conspiracy that I'm not even really worried

687
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,100
 about arguing the conspiracy with him.

688
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,620
 If I met this guy in real life, I'd be more worried about his well, his health.

689
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,620
 And my health.

690
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,620
 He's driving an 18-wheeler, but his health too, right?

691
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,180
 And he's so deep.

692
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:28,020
 He's so deep that unless there's some sort of true breakthrough, any help rendered to

693
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,380
 him, I believe will just seem like it's part of the conspiracy theory.

694
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,940
 If a bunch of you guys go to his Reddit page and you're like, "Hey, you're on this podcast,"

695
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,260
 he's going to take it as the conspiracy's true.

696
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,860
 I'm being ridiculed for revealing the secret of the Black Cube of Saturn.

697
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:46,860
 If someone approaches them and says, "Hey, I saw this Reddit post and you seem to be

698
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,220
 going through some issues, would you like some counseling?"

699
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,220
 They're onto him.

700
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,820
 The Black Cube of Saturn people are onto him.

701
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,420
 It's an interesting way we're going to wrap this story up like this because Mad Mike,

702
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,460
 Mad Mike, the guy we talked to first, the man who built the rocket to prove that the

703
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:06,180
 earth wasn't really flat, he had an interesting quote at the end of this article that I read

704
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,460
 about him.

705
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,620
 He says, "My story really is incredible.

706
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,820
 It's got a bunch of storylines.

707
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,740
 The garage built thing in reference to the rocket.

708
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,420
 I'm an older guy.

709
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,580
 It's out in the middle of nowhere plus the flat earth."

710
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,580
 So he's just kind of talking about how his life seems to be quite unique.

711
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,660
 Seems to be having fun in this moment.

712
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,860
 The quote continues, "The problem is it brings out all the nuts also.

713
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,260
 People questioning everything.

714
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,860
 It's the downside of all of this."

715
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,220
 So here's a guy who believes that the earth is flat, that NASA is lying to him, world

716
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,540
 government is lying to him.

717
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,460
 I don't know if he believed that they were covering it up to cover it proof of God, which

718
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,940
 is kind of the standard flat earth thing.

719
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,500
 Some people believe they're just covering it up as a method of control.

720
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,180
 But he believed that.

721
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,660
 But he would get people, he would be approached by people who believed in things even more

722
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,140
 insane than flat earth.

723
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,100
 Monkeys don't exist.

724
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,860
 The color orange is satanic.

725
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,380
 Things like that.

726
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:15,740
 Album releases, Grammy shows, football scores, Bible verses, all pointing the path that the

727
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:21,660
 black cube of Saturn, which is an artificial intelligence on Saturn, is going to turn

728
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,460
 Kobe Bryant into an artificial intelligence that's going to convince all of us to worship

729
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:33,540
 the black cube is 100% more insane than flat earth.

730
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:39,580
 There's no rocket test to prove that that conspiracy theory is true or false.

731
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,700
 And that's what makes it dangerous.

732
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,860
 People who believe in this theory have no other way to prove whether or not it's true

733
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:55,020
 or false than by taking action against this group of black cube worshipers.

734
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,780
 Hopefully nothing happens.

735
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:03,580
 Hopefully Blueberry's for life wakes up out of his awakening and just levels out or if

736
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,300
 needed get some professional help.

737
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,820
 Hopefully his story does not end as tragically as Mad Mike Hughes.

738
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:32,260
 Your only time will tell.

739
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,840
 (upbeat music)

740
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,420
 (upbeat music)

741
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,000
 (upbeat music)

742
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,580
 (upbeat music)

743
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,160
 (upbeat music)

744
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,740
 (upbeat music)

745
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,320
 (upbeat music)
