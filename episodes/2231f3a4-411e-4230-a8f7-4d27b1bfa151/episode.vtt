 British Swim School. Make a splash.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 When a group of construction workers attempt to knock down a haunted school, they have a choice to make.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Leave the job site or become one of the ghosts themselves.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 And if we travel to Paris to take a look at a bizarre string of disappearances,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 is it possible that a maniac is living in the catacombs underneath the city or is the answer far more monstrous today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 I'm a wild big gal.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 I am not having a great day, but I hope you're having a great day. I'm actually sick. I'm a little bit under the weather.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 But I'll get to it. It's probably COVID. It's probably a little more than under the weather.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 But before we get into that, let's introduce today's speech on support. He's like, "No, no, I don't want to come in. You're totally contagious."

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Come on in. Everyone give a round of applause for John Shelton. John walking in in full quarantine gear.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 John, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Now I'm going to run over and give John a big old hug. Oh, I'm so glad it's your support in this show.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 He's like, "Stop it. Stop it. I'm sick. I don't know if it's COVID because I can't get a test to like, they're like $100 or the government will send me a free one in like seven days."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 That's ridiculous. It's going to take forever. So I assume that I have it. I have a couple of the symptoms. I have the runny nose.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 I have general just sort like my body hurts. It feels like the flu, but it's like in my joints that hurts.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Brain fog. I've been having that. I can't say that my taste buds are completely gone, but food tastes bland.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 However, I've been eating really bland food. I've been eating chicken noodle soup and freezer bread.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Bread that I threw in the freezer about a month ago so it didn't go bad. So I don't know how that's supposed to taste.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Anyways, and then there's this other weird symptom I have. Every, I don't know, hour or so I get this searing pain in my head.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Like right in my forehead. I just feel like this burning pain. It's almost like I like almost collapsed to my knees.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And then I'm on Jupiter and there's this huge black cube in the sky and a figure steps out of it.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 It's wrists are slit open and these veins go for miles right into my mouth and I'm just sucking on them and I can feel pure COVID entering into my bloodstream.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 And I look up at this entity, this new God.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood. Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 And I continue to just suck on these veins and I just feel so powerful.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 And then Dr. Fauci shows up and he starts shaking when he goes, "Resisted, son! Resisted! Wake up! We need you!"

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 And then I'm just sitting back in my living room so I don't know what's up with that. I don't know. I checked the CDC.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 That wasn't listed as one of their symptoms. You know, it's funny.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 As I've been dealing with my brain melting due to COVID obviously, a couple of times that has not happened.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 But a couple of times I've found myself just walking in circles in my living room trying to remember what I'm trying to do.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 I was thinking that would be a great conspiracy theory, right?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 That the COVID is some sort of alien... We talked about it's COVID from space, but what if COVID was an alien invasion type scenario?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 That would be a really cool conspiracy theory. Or you could say like, "COVID is the next stage of human life and the vaccine is supposed to stop."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 But you could go either way. Depending on how you felt about COVID or vaccines and stuff like that.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 You could make up whatever story you wanted to. But I thought, "Where's the pizazz? Where is the razzmatazz?"

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 And our conspiracy theories. COVID as this alien organism invading Earth.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 That's a good conspiracy theory. It's not true.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 My eyes might shift from side to side and they glow.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Little COVID, little cartoon COVID things in my peoples.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 But yeah, that would be cool if conspiracy theories were more, like, more action packed.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 But they're not. I'm just sick.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And this is what happens when you have COVID apparently. You're like, "Oh, I wish reality was different."

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 I do feel. My memory is fading. But I haven't forgotten our Patreon supporter. He snuck out. He snuck out during that spooky diet drive.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 John, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 We're driving all the way out to Austin, Texas.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 [imitates car engine]

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 The year is 1990. And we're pulling up in the Soul of Jason Jalopy. Eee!

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 And we're outside the Metz Elementary School. Now this school has stood in place for 75 years.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Now, the Metz Elementary School for the past 75 years has been a place of joy and wonderment for these little kiddos to run in with their backpacks

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 and learn about the world and to learn about, like, reading and stuff like that.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 But it's time to tear it down. They're like, "No more education. We're no longer gonna teach kids in Austin, Texas.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 You have to go to another state to learn." They're gonna destroy Metz Elementary School.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 So the school is shut down and the Torres Construction Company is brought in.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 But right when they start doing this demolition work, strange things begin to happen.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 You'd have people climbing up ladders and they're up there, they're like pulling down rain gutters.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 [imitates car engine]

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Throwing stuff. This really unsafe construction company, they're like, "Catch! They're throwing nails at people below them!"

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 When these workers are up on these ladders, they would feel someone shaking them at the bottom.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Whoa, whoa, and they'd look down and there'd be nobody there.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 That was those were the lucky ones. Sometimes who would be up on ladders, you know, pulling out light bulbs and electrical fixtures and stuff like that.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 And some unknown force would actually sweep the ladder away from underneath them. They'd fall to the ground.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Ah, they're holding light bulbs in each hand. Ah!

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 So you had workers start to be really, really superstitious about what's going on.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Why are these ladders keep falling down now? Maybe they're buying cheap ladders. Who knows?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 But people start to go, "Eh, maybe I don't want to be on ladder duty today."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 But that wasn't the only problem. Bulldozers... [imitates bulldozer]

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 ...as they're coming towards the school, smoke belching into the air, [imitates bulldozer]

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 ...guy working the gears, as it would get closer and closer to the school. [imitates bulldozer]

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 The bulldozer would break down. Bulldozers were falling apart, not like comically,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 but they just stopped working as they approached the school.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Now, you're trying to run a job site, and you have a bunch of people who are spooked out.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 This is not a good mixture. Elementary schools, they can be a place of magic,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 because these little kids, they don't know anything about the world. They're learning new stuff every day.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 But at the same time, they're super spooky. Libraries are spooky. Schools are spooky.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 These liminal spaces are always spooky when they're empty. You have these construction workers

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 going down these hallways and empty classrooms and things like that,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 and they're getting creeped out, and you start to think, "Listen, the bulldozers are breaking down,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 the ladders are falling apart, but guys, there's no ghosts here.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 That's what you're thinking is not happening. They're like, "Ghosts, I didn't think about that!"

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Well, anyways, ghosts aren't happening here.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 These are just coincidences. These are just various malfunctions.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 But then the sightings begin. As these workers were to walk into empty classrooms,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 they would see weird writings scrawled across the chalkboards.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 "Oh, that's just Benny. The guy we just hired. I suspiciously fired before any one of you met him, fellow workers.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 I hired this guy named Benny, and he wrote those weird scribbles. I think he was Egyptian or something.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Forget the weird scribbles," the foreman said, and they're like, "Oh, okay, maybe."

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 And then there was a worker who was working in one of the restrooms.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 [laughs]

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 The worker turns around and he sees a little kid looking out through one of the bathroom stalls.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 [laughs]

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 So now, they're like, "Foreman, did you hire a little child as well from Egypt?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 I saw a little kid in the bathroom and there have not been any kids here.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 It's been weeks since we've been working on this school, and I saw a little kid hiding in the bathroom.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 What is up with that?" So at that point, the foreman had no excuse,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 because otherwise his excuse would be violating child labor laws.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 So half the crew quit.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Half the crew was like, "You know what? I'll go get a job tearing down some other building. I quit."

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 The rest two stayed to work, made a compromise. We'll stay to work, but we will not work inside the building.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 And the foreman's like, "You have to be inside to destroy the building, right? It's not a comic book.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 You just can't drive a bulldozer and the entire building just becomes a pancake."

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 "You have to go in there." They refused.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 So the tourist construction company called in an exorcist to perform an exorcism on the school.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And finally, the foreman, who's actually Joe Torres himself, the foreman goes,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 "Okay, are you happy now? We have this guy come through and he exercised the place.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 And will you go inside to work now?"

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And the workers are like, "Yeah, I guess." So they start going back into the school,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 shortly after that one of the co-owners of Torres Construction Company was working in the school himself,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 and a wall collapsed on him, killed him on the spot.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Even with that death on the scene, the workers continued to do it,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 and the school was finally torn down completely, six months behind schedule.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 It took them that much longer to get rid of the 75-year-old elementary school.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Probably I'm surprising it didn't take longer if they only had half their workforce.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 Now, a falling wall to you and me is supernatural in and of itself, right?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Like, if you were at your work, you're a mailman, you're driving your car, and a wall fell on you,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 that would be the most bizarre way to go, I think, for most people's profession.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 But as a construction worker, as a demolition expert, it's a hazard of the job.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 So people, although they were suspicious and they did see all these ghosts and things like that,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 the exorcism had happened, and people go, "Well, maybe the wall just fell accidentally."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 I mean, they did knock out the other three walls, and this one was all dusty and barely leaning.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 He shouldn't have been there, but maybe it was just an unfortunate accident.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 It's part of the industry.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 After the elementary school was completely torn down, Joe Torres,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 now probably the sole owner of Torres Construction, takes a tree from the school site.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 He goes, "I really like this tree. It's all soaked in the blood of all of his coworkers."

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 He's like, "Oh, it's so pretty in spring."

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 He takes this tree and he plants it in the front yard of his daughter's home.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 It's just such a pretty tree, apparently, and a reminder who's really in charge,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 who really owns Torres Construction.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 To this day, people say when you drive past his daughter's house,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 you'll see this tree in her front yard,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 and sometimes you'll hear the sound of children playing, "Peek-a-boo! Hehehehe!"

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 "Can you train me those Pokemon cards? Here's a Charizard for two Mewtoos!"

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Um, yeah, if you go by her house you'll hear little kids outside.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 It's not her kids. Her kids are playing next to the tree. They're getting possessed.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 The tree, like, you can hear the sounds of laughter and little kids playing jump rope and stuff like that.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Very, very interesting ghost story.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 I got it from my favorite book, the book "Hunted Places," the National Directory.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 You can buy it on Amazon. I got a link in the show notes. It's not an affiliate link. Just buy it.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 It's a great book.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 And then I did some additional research online.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Great ghost story. The question that I have about this stuff,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 because this one has--this is a really good ghost story and it's very recent,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 and it has a lot of specific names.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So I started thinking, "Is it real?" I always think that, obviously.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 But this was one that we might be able to dig into.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Is this an urban legend? Is it an actual ghost story?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Well, I was able to find a news article in a newspaper called "The Austin American Statesman."

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 It was published on August 27, 1992 by John Bryant.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And, let me read you this quote. This is really fascinating, again,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 because even though it's recent and this story takes place in the 1990s,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 memories fade and not everyone keeps a complete archive.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 I'm actually really lucky I was able to find that.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 So the story I just told you is repeated in "Ghost Lore."

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 National Directory, Hohner Placient, we'll find other ghost sites that tell you the story.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 This is from an actual newspaper. This is from a legitimate news source. Quote,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 "In spite of nationally publicized rumors--" So this was a big story at the time.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 "In spite of nationally publicized rumors that the Mets site is haunted by ghosts of children

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 who had died in the school, the new campus opened smoothly Tuesday

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 with no need for ghostbusters."

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Unquote. Really, really interesting. So these reports were real.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 At the time, this was an event that was actually going on.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 Now, it doesn't say anyone died at the site.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 That was one thing that I was curious about as well.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 On the one hand, if someone died on the site of a haunted school, you think that would be written.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And they're like, "And kids, as you're going into this new school,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 remember a man died where the cafeteria now is."

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 On the one hand, you think they would go after the tragic death of one of the owners.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 The school was still open. But so that's part of the story may be made up. We don't know.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 But this was national news when it was going on.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 In spite of nationally publicized rumors. So this was good.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Really, really interesting, isn't it? That's what I love.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 That's one of the things I really love about this job is just taking the ghost stories and then digging into it.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 So yeah, parts of this story were true.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 The one question I have is whether or not the owner, the co-owner died.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 But there were workers walking off the job site because they thought this place was haunted.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 So the stories were there. This is not just an urban legend.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 It was being reported on as it was happening.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Why? See, for me, I don't mind collecting haunted items.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 I don't mind collecting haunted items. So if I found the tree at a haunted house, I would take it.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 They're like, "Jason, that's my dream. Running away, running away."

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Then I'm like, "Your house is full of ghosts. I want this tree."

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 But I don't think I would give it to my daughter.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 I want to be like, "Here you go, honey."

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 To show that I love you so much, I'm going to give you this thing that's going to take root in your front yard

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 and be possessed with the souls of the damned.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 I wouldn't do that to somebody else.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 I find that interesting. One end of Joe Torres probably was one of the guys who just didn't believe there were ghosts.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Got the exorcist because he had to.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 And he's like, "Whatever. I don't believe in ghosts."

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 And then even though he's ignorant of that, there were ghosts there.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 He's giving his daughter a haunted tree.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 So if you're in Austin, Texas, just drive around the area.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Drive around the area with your windows rolled down really late at night.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And slow down whenever you see a tree in someone's front yard.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 And listen really carefully.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Either you'll hear the whispers of dead children tickle your eardrums,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 or you will hear the sirens of police as they're wondering why someone's driving around at 3 in the morning

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 super slow in front of people's houses.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Either way, it'll be an interesting night.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 A night you'll never forget.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 John, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 We are leaving behind Austin, Texas before any of these ghost kids can hitch a ride.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 We're headed all the way out to Paris.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 [imitates car engine]

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Now I gotta be honest with you guys.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 I actually told this story before.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 I told it as a footnote.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 I told it as a five minute story at the end of episode 49.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 And I love this story.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 I actually thought that I had covered it again later in the run of the show

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 and I realized that I hadn't.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 So I wanted to go ahead and let the story breathe a bit.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 And if you haven't, if you haven't listened to episode 49, this will all be new to you.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 I remember reading this story in the 40s and times and I was absolutely transfixed.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 We're in Paris, France.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Specifically, we're in the 14th arrondissement of Paris in the neighborhood of Esor.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And what happens? It's 1894 and this is just a little town.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 It's like a neighborhood in Paris and people are just walking around drinking coffee, eating baguettes, doing French stuff.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 But every so often, somebody goes missing.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 It doesn't happen all the time, but the police are supposed to investigate it, right?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And they're not just like, "Oh, we wait for three people to go missing before we start to work."

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 What happens is about once a year, for the past four years, someone has gone missing in Esor.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 There's no correlation between their sex or their age, but it always happens between March 20th and March 31st.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 And it's never a child.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 Those are the only things that they know.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 It's happened four times. It doesn't matter boy or girl.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 But it's actually not a boy or girl, it's a man or a woman.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 And it happens in that time period.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Now remember, Jack the Ripper was operating in 1888.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 So just six years earlier was kind of the birth of the modern serial killer.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Nowadays, if this happened, you would immediately start to suspect a serial killer just because of the weird date range.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Is this the time that the guy has free time?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 He's like, "Oh, honey, I'm going to go down to Esor and start murdering people just for a week, then I've got to get back to work."

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 But serial killers weren't really a phenomenon back then.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 But the police still have to figure this out because people go missing in this area.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 And since March was coming up, it's 1894 and it's coming up to March 20th, the French police are just swamping this area.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 And at 3am, there's an officer, we're going to call him Officer Tyler.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 So Tyler, this French police officer is walking down the street, it's 3am.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 He's twirling around his billy club and his feet are on the cobblestones.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Clip-a-de-clop. Clip-a-de-clop. Clip-a-de-clop.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 And off in the distance, he hears...

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 [imitates music]

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 It doesn't actually have the sheet music for what the melody was, but he hears a strange melody coming from somewhere in Esor.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 [imitates music]

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 He's walking through the streets. It's 3am, all the Apple stands are shut for the night, people are sleeping, smoke stacks in the distance.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 [imitates music]

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Belching up black smoke, chimney sweep, dancing around.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 All the stuff that you would assume back in 1894.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 [imitates music]

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Following the sound, he comes to the Tomb of Esor.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 So the neighborhood of Esor is named after this tomb of a guy named Esor.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 What this is? I know this is super complicated, you're like getting at your notes, you're like, "Oh, Jason, first off, I don't think you're pronouncing any of this right? I'm surprised you got Paris, right?"

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Anyways, so here's what happens. I could almost do a separate story on this, so I'm going to have to try to get this packed in here. This is fascinating in and of itself.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 In this location, there is a place called the Tomb of Esor, aka the Giant's Cave.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 And this tomb is directly connected to the Paris Catacombs, so underneath the city of Paris, there's this massive series of tunnels that have a bunch of bodies in them.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 They've been using it to store bodies for hundreds of years, really. You can go down there, you can get lost down there, there's tours, it's super spooky.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 There's been a ton of movies, horror movies based on that place, and just historical accounts underneath the city of Paris. You have all of these bones.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 I don't even think the Catacombs have been fully explored, honestly.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 So you have the Tomb of Esor, aka the Giant's Cave, and the story is, there's a giant buried there.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 The story goes that before the Christian era, there was a race of giants in the area, and one of these giants was named Isor, and he actually was a brigand.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 He would rob people as they were moving through this area of France. This wasn't like a place with bakeries and delis at the time.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 It was just like a road, because this was before Jesus was born, right? This was before France was even a thing.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 There was this giant who would waylay travelers and smash their heads open and take all their stuff.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 And eventually the people in the area were like, "We gotta do something about this. He's gonna kill us all."

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 So they actually assaulted him, and they killed him, and he was so huge, he was so giant, they couldn't move his body.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Now, I would have probably just chopped him up and walked him, and put his legs on, and he's like, "Stilts, I'm looking at me. I'm a giant now."

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 But they didn't do that. They're not super disgusting in Macabre. They buried him where he laid, and that is the giant's tomb.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And what's really interesting is France is...

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 So the Basque people were there before there were French people there, and the Basque people have legends that, before the birth of Christ, the whole area was run by giants.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 And when the Star of Bethlehem shown in the sky, saying that it was time for the Messiah to be born, the giants said, "Time to leave. New dude in town. We're not allowed here anymore."

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 And they left. That's an old Basque legend. We talked about that on another episode. I'm Basque, so I did a whole episode about Basque Christmas traditions.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 But yeah, that's a really cool parallel, because it does match the same thing. Now in the Basque legend, the giants just left.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 This dude got attacked by a bunch of people, stabbing him, but it is an area that is known for giants.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And nowadays, you can go to this area in France, the Isor neighborhood, and they have a statue of Isor on the side of a building.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 It's three stories tall. It's about 30 feet tall, and the statue's him sitting down.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 So this dude was massive. It would have taken an entire village, or maybe a couple of them, if he was way-lain travelers, to take this dude down.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 But the giants cave, and there actually is provenance of giants active in this area pre-Christian era.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Just a really interesting side note. Almost deserving of its own story, but...

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 What was this officer doing? I told you, he went off on a whole giant thing. What was the cop's name?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Tyler is walking through the street, and he hears this...

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 [imitates the cop's name]

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 He hears this melody, and he sees the tomb of Isor.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Now, there was this giant boulder that was placed on his tomb to mark this as where he was buried.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 And it's also this boulder that leads down into the catacombs.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 When the officer who's familiar with this area, when he gets there, he realizes the boulder is slightly moved away.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 And the song is coming from within the darkness of this tomb.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Clip-a-dee-clop-clop. Clip-a-dee-clop-clop.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 That's when he hears the sound of somebody else walking down these streets.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 These previously deserted city streets, and he turns and he sees this man walking in tune to the music.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 [imitates the cop's name]

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 He's a little dance move. Now, he's breakdancing. He's moving in tune to this music, and the cop is watching this.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 He watches this man, and he's walking towards the opening in the tomb.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 And as the man is getting closer, the music gets a little faster, and the man picks up his pace.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 Before Tyler can even react to what's going on, the man is now broken out into a full sprint.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 The song's become dubstep, and he broke out into a full sprint, and he ran into the darkness of the cave.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Tyler grabs his revolver, click, gets his whistle, because long before radio's were invented, they didn't even know about two tin cans in a string.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 He gets his whistle. [imitates whistle]

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 That whistle carried for miles, and all the other cops who were on their own little streets trying to prevent another missing person hear that whistle.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 And police from all over begin to head towards the tomb of Isor.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Tyler, though, is unsure if they'll get there in time.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 So with his revolver ready, he also runs into the darkness of the tomb.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 By the time the other officers show up, the singing is done. There's no more melody coming from the tomb.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 But, I mean, they're police officers. They can figure it out.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 They've got an alert of a whistle of a fellow officer in the area. They see the boulder moved aside.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 They see the darkness of this cave.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Get some ropes! Get some ladders, guys! Bring the torches! Let's go!

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 And these guys, these guys are a bit smarter than Tyler. They begin to very carefully go into the tomb.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 They realize quickly that when you walk in, it's not like a cave. It's a pit.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 So they realize that getting the ladders and the ropes were necessary.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 They see it's a real steep drop-off. So they start climbing down on the ropes.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 They have their torches.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 And in the darkness, they see a man on his back, squirming.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 One of the officers is holding the torch up, hoping to get a better look.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 They see their fellow officer. Do they recognize the uniform? And then...

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 They see it.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 A massive spider, barely illuminated by the torchlight, is standing over the man on the ground.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 They said it was the size of a terrier. This was a 50-pound spider.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 In the darkness, with its legs flicking upwards.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 And on the end of each of these legs, unlike a normal spider, it had claws.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Its abdomen was covered in thick, bristly hair.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 And giant, wart-like growths seemed to protrude out of its body at random places.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 This creature is so focused on its task, it doesn't even realize that its layers have been invaded by all these police officers.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 In the darkness, there's only two sounds that could be heard.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 The flickering flames of the torches.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 And the sound of blood being drained out of a living human.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Shock is replaced with anger.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 The officers already their revolvers and just light this toot up.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Greenish fluid begins shooting out of its wounded abdomen.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 The spider turns and raises its arms, trying to snap and bite at these guys.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 But it's no match for lead penetrating its body.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 [Makes a sound of a spider]

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 And the spider dies.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Some of the police officers run towards the man who is dead now.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 He had enough blood drained from his body that he's not going to make it.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 And then in the darkness, they see Tyler, who in his good hearted nature, trying to save this guy, ran and fell.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Remember, he was a pit. He didn't know it was a pit. He ran and he fell about 30 feet.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 And he was unconscious. He was not there for the final shootout.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Well, he was there, but he was just laying on the ground.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And he was able to be rescued. He actually made it.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 They finally bring him back to the surface.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 And as Tyler regains consciousness, he looks up at the beautiful Paris night sky.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 He realizes that he was just moments away from dying in a pitch black hole, devoured by a monster.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 A beast devoured by the singing spider of the Paris catacombs.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 I love it. I love this type of stuff. I remember reading this long time ago, in the 40s and times, I was transfixed.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 It was as if the article was singing to myself. Is it true, though?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 That's always the question I like to ask. It's not always a question we can have an answer to.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 This one, this was published in the newspaper.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 This was published in the newspaper back on September 14th, 1894, in the Ann Arbor Argus, which is a real newspaper.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 What's really interesting about old-timey newspapers?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 This is something we see a lot about old giant stories, old newspapers that have photos of giants.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Back then, and even today, honestly, back then, newspapers made stuff up.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Back in the early 1900s, late 1800s, you had people just completely making stuff up to sell newspapers.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 This article, this story is published in one newspaper that anyone can find, and it's the Ann Arbor Argus, which is an American newspaper in Ann Arbor.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 So, is the story true?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 It does give us some interesting clues at the end of the article. Let's take a look at this.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 It goes on to explain that this spider is known as the arachne giganus.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 It's a giant spider that was believed to be extinct. Spiders used to be able to get this big, apparently, when oxygen levels were different,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 like prehistoric spiders were bigger than the spiders are today.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 So, they said that these things used to be able to exist, they don't now,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 and that apparently, after this event, scientists started to believe that these spiders may exist in the Paris catacombs.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 They say that this body was preserved.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 It was actually pulled out of the catacombs, because obviously you're not just going to leave it down there, this is a scientific marvel,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 and it was exhibited at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, France.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 This article, you know, a lot of people really, really like this article, it's cool.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 A lot of people looked into it, apparently there is not, in France, a place called the Museum of Natural History, nor has there ever been.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 That's what other researchers have said, they go, "Maybe they meant this museum or this museum."

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 But when you have a detail that's verifiably false, it really puts a suspect on the rest of the story.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 So, from a scientific perspective, this story didn't happen, right?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 But from a par-- in the world of the paranormal, this could happen.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 And just like the story from 1990 that I covered, where they said, "Nationally rumored ghost story,"

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 this was going all over the news, the only article I could find that talked about the Met's Elementary School and Ghost was one article.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 So, just because it's only in one newspaper doesn't mean it's fake.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Now, there's other stuff that can make it be fake, a 50-pound spider existing today, but in the world of the paranormal, we accept these type of things.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 I don't throw that out as the end-all be-all, but I do want to cover that as well.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 It's only in one newspaper, newspaper has some factual issues.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 I love this story, though, because this is one of the stories that I believe could be real.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Because I love monsters, like why wouldn't I want a world filled with mysterious monsters coming out of the catacombs?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 This creature long-thought-dead existing down there and it's only-- it needs to feed once a year.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 And this is where it lives, and a giant spider in a place known for giant activity, like old myths.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 The Basque mythology is very, very giant heavy, and that's in this region.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 Giant men, giant spiders. Right? That's how it works, right?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 The new bull has giant guinea pigs hanging out with them.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 You have this location known for its gigantism and you have this giant spider. I love it. I think it's super creepy.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 I really, really do. I love everything about it. I love giant spiders. I love people fighting back against monsters.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 And it's a-- I love this story, and we'll end it up like this.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Because humans like to think that we're the masters of the planet, because we can reshape it.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 We can harness the power of the sun and the wind. We can split the atom.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 But the surface of the world is the tip of the iceberg, right?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Like, what is inside the world? What is in the oceans? Endless catacombs. Tunnels. Caves.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 What is in there? Beasts. Monsters. Creatures of darkness.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Things that we can never even imagine because they're so removed from our environment.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 We are unknown to each other. But every show often one of these monsters gets loose.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Every show often one of these creatures crawls closer and closer to the surface.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 Now, within the planet, resources are fairly scarce. It's brutal. It's dark.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Every day is a fight for survival. I don't even know what the day is. I've never seen the sun.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 But every moment is a fight for survival. But one of these creatures eventually makes it to a closer and closer to the surface.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 And realizes, on the surface, everything is food.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 It's lush and vibrant. And everything's squishy. Everything's frail.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Your body has evolved to combat monsters from the abyss. But on the surface, the creatures have simply evolved to think and walk upright and use thumbs to write letters.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 Delicious morsels everywhere. Unarmed, unarmored, and unaware of your existence.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 The creatures that inhabit our planet but live in the darkness underneath us. Are they the true masters of the world?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 The only reason why civilization exists is because they haven't come up en masse. They haven't discovered us as a species yet.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Every show often one of them may. We call it a cryptid. We call it a monster. We call it impossible.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 And go on with our lives. But if one day more of these creatures from the pitch blackness beneath our feet rise up, will we be able to stop them?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 It took a legion of French police to take down one spider that was unaware that they were even in there.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 What would happen if thousands, if millions of these creatures crawled out of the crevices in a single night?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Would man remain the top of the food chain? Or would we simply be prey, be food, to the creatures beneath us?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 You may not believe in the existence of giant spiders. But as you find yourself webbed up with your family in your house, staring at your loved ones with pleading eyes,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 "Help me, help me!" But nobody can help anyone. These spiders have conquered the planet. They're laying eggs inside of your body.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 You can feel your flesh unbulate. It takes days for them to eat through your organs.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Somehow you're still alive. New York Times is like more spiders invading. You're like, "Oh man, what's the sports page? It's the spiders eating a bunch of football players."

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 And the spiders are keeping you alive. They're eating your organs and you're like, "Uh, they're eating the organs you don't really need at first."

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 They're like, "Oh, if Panky, um, um, um, and then your appendix, um, um, um."

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 Eventually, like right before you die, you start to see your skin kind of split open and you're watching all these little spiders crawl out of the opening in your rotting flesh.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 [Groan]

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 You've now given birth to a whole new generation of these monstrous spiders.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 The only reason why we think we run the world is because we have not encountered our true competitors. Yet.
