1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 Today's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio contains disturbing content.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,360
 Listener discretion is advised.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,760
 Hey, I'm actually adding this in a couple days after the original episode came out to

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,280
 issue a second warning.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,440
 I've actually gotten quite a few complaints about how dark and disturbing this episode

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,440
 is.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,080
 The first story is totally fine if you just want a standard Dead Rabbit Radio episode,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,720
 but the second story people are saying it's the most disturbing story on the podcast.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
 I disagree.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,720
 I mean, it is disturbing.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,800
 It's a terrible story.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,520
 I think we've covered stuff that was...

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,520
 I don't know.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,440
 They might have a point.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
 They might have a point.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,440
 But anyways, the second story is really, really dark.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,840
 So I'm just adding this in.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,280
 A lot of people were not prepared for where it went.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,440
 So.

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,360
 Listener beware, but the first story is just standard Dead Rabbit Radio fare and I hope

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,400
 you enjoy at least the first half of this episode.

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,680
 A family sees a bizarre and terrifying sight standing in their front yard.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,120
 And then we travel to Nebraska to take a look at a cult known as the True Israelites, a

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,040
 white supremacist group that was founded to prepare for the Battle of Armageddon.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,080
 But while they are getting ready to wage war on the forces of darkness, the darkest parts

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
 of humanity come out.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,560
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:45,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
 I'm your host Jason Garminer.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
 I'm having a great day.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,000
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Are any of you?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 2023?

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,760
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover so first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is a

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,360
 longtime supporter of the show and now a Patreon of the show.

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
 Everyone give it up for Hezzer.

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
 Woohoo!

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
 Yeah!

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
 Walk on in Hezzer.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,760
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
 Awesome, awesome.

43
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,760
 Hezzer, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
 I do.

46
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,840
 Just helps spread the word about the show.

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
 That helps out so much.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
 It really, really does.

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,640
 Now I said in the intro that this is a disturbing episode but the first story isn't so if you

50
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,720
 want to listen to the first story, it's totally safe unless you're easily scared and then

51
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,760
 I don't know why you're listening to this podcast.

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
 Everything would be disturbing.

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,960
 Hezzer, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Jason Jalopy we are leaving behind

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
 Dead Rabbit Command.

55
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,480
 It drives us all the way out to a suburban neighborhood.

56
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,720
 I found this story on phantomsandmonsters.com.

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,720
 It's an amazing website if you're into the bizarre.

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,640
 Phantomsandmonsters is run by a paranormal researcher named Lon Strickler.

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,520
 I highly recommend going to that website.

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
 It's great.

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
 I check it out every day.

62
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,480
 That's where I got this story from and he says we don't know exactly where the story

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,960
 took place but he said somewhere in the United States because what happens is a lot of people

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:12,960
 send user reports directly to Lon Strickler or he, like me, like most paranormal researchers

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,840
 are just scouring the web looking for these amazing stories.

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
 They were in the United States.

67
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,520
 It's September 12th, 2015.

68
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
 And there's this father.

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,960
 We're going to go ahead and call him Sam.

70
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
 He doesn't give his name.

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,280
 But Sam, he's standing in the front yard of his house and his family is just pulling

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
 up.

73
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,800
 I don't know how he lucked out and didn't have to go home.

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,840
 This excursion, he's just got to stay at home, watch television but now his peace and

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,080
 quiet is being destroyed because his family's back home.

76
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,560
 He's standing there in the driveway and the family van pulls up and he sees his family

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
 inside.

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,440
 And then something catches his eye and it looks a little bit over to his right and he

79
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,400
 sees standing there.

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
 And it's not right next to him.

81
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,880
 We'll say it's maybe like 50, 60 yards.

82
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,840
 I think that's fair.

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:07,000
 Standing there is, have you guys ever seen a nightmare before Christmas?

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 It was Jack Skellington.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,560
 Now don't get your autograph books out.

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,760
 Move to this place in the United States with your autograph book.

87
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,800
 It looks like Jack Skellington.

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
 That's who he directly compared it to.

89
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:32,800
 He goes, "I look over and I see this tall gangly-limbed humanoid that reminded me of Jack Skellington

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,360
 from a nightmare before Christmas."

91
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,080
 Not directed by Tim Burton, by the way.

92
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,560
 The movies often, surprise there's not a lot of Mandela effect stuff about that.

93
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,040
 It's not directed by Tim Burton.

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,080
 He looks over and he, I know you're positive you're positive to Google that.

95
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,200
 He looks over and he sees this giant Jack Skellington and giant, it's seven feet tall.

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:04,560
 It's the seven feet tall long-limbed gangly creature but it's completely jet black.

97
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
 No nice little suit.

98
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,560
 Okay, we get it.

99
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
 It kind of looks like Jack Skellington.

100
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
 You don't have to go.

101
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
 It's like, but his voice sounds different.

102
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,160
 Well, he does have one more difference.

103
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,440
 He's completely jet black and his head is jet black as well but it's in the shape of like

104
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,240
 a classic gray alien head.

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,000
 Not this weird pumpkin, like, you know, perfectly round head like Jack Skellington.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,680
 Anyways, he looks over, he sees his autograph on credit, he's like, "Huh."

107
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,000
 It's the seven foot tall jet black gangly-limbed creature with a head that looks like a gray

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,240
 alien but everything else is like Jack Skellington.

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,640
 And it begins walking down a cement path on his property.

110
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,360
 It'd be one thing to just turn and look and see something standing there like that.

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
 Just standing.

112
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,040
 And as time passed, you'd go, maybe it was a tree, it's still out there decorating it

113
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
 for Christmas.

114
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
 It's like, "Ahh."

115
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
 But you know what I mean?

116
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,200
 If you saw something like that and then you looked away and it was gone, you could be

117
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,400
 like, "Oh, maybe it was just a figment of my imagination."

118
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
 But it starts walking.

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
 It's kind of hard.

120
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,240
 It's kind of hard once it's moving within our world.

121
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,640
 It's really kind of hard to blow that off.

122
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,480
 It begins walking and despite its size, it's moving pretty fast.

123
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,920
 He said it was walking about twice the speed of the human.

124
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,440
 Even factoring in the large steps, he was saying it was moving faster than it looked

125
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
 like it could move.

126
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,720
 And even though he saw no proof of that, looking at this entity, he knew, he just got this impression

127
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,240
 on him that it was incredibly strong.

128
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,400
 Despite the thin limbs, he just got this sense that this thing's much faster than it looks

129
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,840
 and it's also far stronger than it looks.

130
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:05,880
 He sees it walk down this cement path on his property, walks by the street, walks underneath

131
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:15,520
 the streetlight, walks onto a gravel pathway, and then past the side of Sam's house to where

132
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,080
 he lost the view of it.

133
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,280
 That's quite a little journey, right?

134
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,000
 You're watching it the whole time it's moving.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,840
 And once it moves past the side of the house and Sam's lost view of it, the doors of the

136
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,240
 van open up.

137
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,800
 The family van that's been sitting there in the driveway, the van door opens up and Sam

138
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,640
 yells to his family, "Did you see that?"

139
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,960
 It's all he said.

140
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,480
 Did you see that?

141
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:57,200
 And his sister who was in the car responded, "It was all black."

142
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,120
 It was her exact quote.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
 That's the way to do it actually.

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,760
 That's like a pro paranormal researcher move.

145
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,720
 When I did on the ground paranormal research, I'm out there with a group and I see something.

146
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,280
 I see some sort of phenomenon or entity or whatever it is.

147
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,720
 I would always say, "Do you see that over there?"

148
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,320
 And then I'm like, "With Steve or Josh or Jackie, whoever I'm with, they'll look over

149
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,040
 there and I'll wait for them to describe what I've already seen."

150
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,680
 If I go, "Hey, look over there.

151
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,280
 You see that clown crying by the edge of the creek?"

152
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,720
 If they say, "Yeah, I see the clown by the edge of the creek."

153
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,680
 They could be trolling me.

154
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,760
 They could be...

155
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,560
 I could be leading them on.

156
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,960
 They could be having another experience.

157
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,200
 But if I go, "Hey, look over there."

158
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,960
 And someone's like, "Oh my God, is that a clown down there crying?"

159
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,000
 You see there's a big difference because you have two different people observing a phenomenon

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 from different angles.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,880
 Now you can go, "Okay, that most likely was a real phenomenon."

162
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,680
 So that's very interesting.

163
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,840
 That's the way that played out.

164
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
 He knew exactly what it was.

165
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
 Well, he didn't know what it was he was looking at.

166
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,040
 It's some sort of creature, but he goes, "Did you see that?"

167
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
 And she responds, "It was all black."

168
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,240
 That means this was not just a trick of the light.

169
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,680
 This was not just an issue of one person having too much to drink or having a mental breakdown

170
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,880
 or something like that.

171
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,440
 And he goes, "I haven't seen anything since."

172
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
 Came out in the yard.

173
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,000
 That was back in 2015.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,560
 Came out in the yard and saw this giant creature walk by.

175
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,040
 I mean, what was it doing?

176
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
 I don't know.

177
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
 What was it?

178
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
 I don't know.

179
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:40,400
 And he hasn't seen anything since, but it's not the first time he's seen something odd.

180
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,480
 He said, "When I was a kid, we would go to visit my grandpa all the time.

181
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,720
 We'd always drive down the same road to get to grandpa's house."

182
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,160
 And he goes, "When I was a kid one day, I was sitting in the car.

183
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,600
 Family was driving out to go see grandpa.

184
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,640
 And on this road, there's a road sign where you're driven past this road sign a hundred

185
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,200
 times, but this particular day we're driving and we're approaching the road sign and I

186
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:27,760
 see from behind the road sign a long insect-like/robot-like arm.

187
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,240
 This huge robot-esque insect-like arm would come out from behind the sign."

188
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,720
 And this is, you know, road signs, it doesn't specifically say if it was a yield sign or

189
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,480
 a stop sign or something like that, but road signs in America, they're fairly small.

190
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,160
 You can't really hide something that can have a giant arm come out.

191
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,840
 And it's interesting because he says insect-like/robot-like.

192
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,120
 I'm also wondering how slender it is.

193
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,760
 But he'll watch this arm, this long arm, come out from behind the sign and it would try

194
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:13,000
 to grab onto their car as it drove past.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,120
 Now, he'd crane his neck and look back and the sign was totally normal.

196
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,000
 The car continued on its journey.

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,280
 No one else in the car noticed it.

198
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,000
 Or if they did, they didn't say anything.

199
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,400
 And it's honestly doubtful if Sam said anything either.

200
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,320
 Because when we see stuff that's unexplainable, people are going to make fun of you.

201
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,280
 That's just the way it is.

202
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,880
 He goes, "We were driving by when I was a kid and I saw this long robotic insect arm

203
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,760
 come out from behind the sign to try to grab the car as we drove past.

204
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:58,760
 And then years later, as a teenager, I was driving the car.

205
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 I was headed out to Grandpa's house.

206
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,640
 I was coming up to that road sign that we had passed a hundred times before I saw the

207
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
 arm and a hundred times afterwards.

208
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,520
 And I'm driving this car to Grandpa's house and I'm approaching that sign and all of a

209
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:26,640
 sudden a long insect-like, robot-like arm reached out and tried to grab the car."

210
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,600
 Weird super bizarre phenomenon.

211
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,480
 This is what I talk about when we have a lot of these stories.

212
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,840
 If you see a ghost, you know who to report it to.

213
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,240
 If you see a UFO or an alien, you know who to report it to.

214
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,400
 And those were his words, quote, "Insect-like, robot-like arm."

215
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,560
 Because he was just having a hard time trying to describe it.

216
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,520
 If you see that, who do you report that to?

217
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,120
 What classification of phenomenon is that?

218
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,440
 There's so many stories like this where you're like even the tall Jack Skeleton creature.

219
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,280
 Sure it had a gray alien head, but does he report it as UFOed, is reported as a cryptid?

220
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,400
 That's a great thing about websites like Phantoms and Monsters.

221
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:13,440
 They're just a repository for these bizarre stories.

222
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,680
 But these little paranormal stories that don't fit the mold, they just a lot of times go

223
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,480
 unreported.

224
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,200
 What's interesting is the robot-insect arm, we've encountered that before on this show.

225
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,720
 When I read that story, it reminded me of one of my favorite episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio,

226
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,080
 the alien invasion of Casablanca, California.

227
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,720
 I read it on the show notes.

228
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,040
 And these kids are out playing in their yard.

229
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,720
 And a series of arms, all of these arms begin to materialize straight out of the air around

230
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,600
 them and they're trying to grab these kids.

231
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,760
 And a bunch of kids witness this.

232
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,480
 I don't remember the exact number, eight or ten or something like that.

233
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,960
 A bunch of kids were having to knock off these arms like they're swatting away at these

234
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,000
 arms reaching out of nothingness to grab them.

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,880
 So I mean, when we covered that story, it was so bizarre as like a one-off event.

236
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,160
 Definitely felt alien.

237
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,240
 But here, we don't know where this story took place.

238
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,840
 It took place in the United States.

239
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:21,040
 This story may have taken place in or around the area of Casablanca, California.

240
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
 Who knows.

241
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,320
 But a fascinating story.

242
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,800
 We have the giant, cryptid alien, what have you in the front yard that more than one witness

243
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 saw?

244
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,160
 And we have the robot arm reaching out from behind the sign.

245
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,480
 And you wonder, right, what if it had grabbed the car?

246
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,720
 What was that?

247
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,520
 You know, you think, is it an omen?

248
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
 Was it warning?

249
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
 Who knows?

250
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,080
 I mean, it's just a really cool story, I think.

251
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,360
 I think it's a really cool story because we can extravally, like what if this happened,

252
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,640
 what if that happened?

253
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
 Fascinating stuff.

254
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,520
 I'd also put in the show notes because I know some of you guys may not have been reminded

255
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,000
 of the Casablanca story.

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,600
 You might have been reminded of that time I went to that haunted Wendy's.

257
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,680
 And I saw that huge arm-like thing.

258
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,280
 Like again, it's hard to describe sometimes.

259
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:15,640
 It was a huge arm or a huge appendage came out of the drive-thru window.

260
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,400
 Like it was impossible for this thing to be this big and come out the angle that it did,

261
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 but it did.

262
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,440
 Although that episode in the show notes, it's crazy.

263
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,880
 And I just love little stories like this.

264
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,960
 Hezzer, let's go ahead and fuel up the carbon orcopter.

265
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,800
 We're going to leave behind this suburban neighborhood.

266
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,520
 We've got all of our signs at Jack Skellington merchandise.

267
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,920
 Throw it in back and take us out of here.

268
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:46,080
 We're headed all the way out to Nebraska.

269
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,400
 Final warning before we get started.

270
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,960
 The story that I'm about to cover is super disturbing.

271
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:03,280
 I actually had this story ready to go for maybe two years.

272
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,560
 It's been in my maybe folder.

273
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,640
 Not because I don't think it's a good story, but because it's so disturbing.

274
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,720
 I've just kept it there.

275
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,480
 The reason why we're pulling it out now is Hezzer, longtime supporter of the show, recent

276
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,360
 Patreon supporter.

277
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,720
 He sent us two of the most disturbing stories we've covered on the show.

278
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:34,400
 He sent us End of the Wicked, which was a true story about a movie in Africa that I think

279
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,000
 was Nigeria specifically, but off the top of my head, I'm not for sure.

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,320
 A movie that was made that has influenced hundreds of murders of children.

281
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,040
 The crazy true crime story/paranormal/conspiracy story.

282
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,440
 Hezzer sent us that.

283
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,640
 Hezzer also sent us the story of the Ant Hill kids.

284
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,160
 This crazy cult.

285
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,440
 Off the top of my head, I think it was in Canada where they were committing these despicable

286
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,960
 acts in service of this cult.

287
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,000
 So I figured, Hezzer, you sent us some disturbing stuff.

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,640
 We're going to get you on the carbonic out there.

289
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,000
 I'm going to dust off this story that I've had sitting around for two years.

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Strap in.

291
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 If you're still here, it's just me.

292
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Hezzer and the carbonic copter.

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Everyone else pairs you up.

294
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,600
 They're like, see you tomorrow.

295
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,680
 If you do happen to still be in the carbonic copter, strap in.

296
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,040
 It's the early 1980s.

297
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,000
 And in Richardson County, Nebraska, there's a group of people starting to form.

298
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,800
 It's a fairly informal group to begin with.

299
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,520
 But they're starting to follow the teachings of a man named Michael Wayne Ryan.

300
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,480
 Michael is a truck driver by trade, but he begins to see visions in the sky.

301
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,160
 He begins to see a prophecy unfold in front of him.

302
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,080
 The Battle of Armageddon is coming.

303
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
 He's talking around town.

304
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,480
 He's telling people that the end of the world is here.

305
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
 And we all know it.

306
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,640
 Look what's going on in the world.

307
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,960
 We got international terrorism.

308
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,640
 Press prices are sky high.

309
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,920
 The economy is barely hanging on.

310
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,400
 You can't board a plane without worrying that someone's going to blow it out of the

311
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,640
 sky.

312
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,240
 Can't go into a big city without thinking someone's going to put a knife to your throat

313
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,880
 and mug you.

314
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,640
 Society's falling apart.

315
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,880
 Look around.

316
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,320
 This is the end days.

317
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,120
 And God is giving me a message.

318
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:47,280
 God is showing me the way to save ourselves.

319
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,560
 Are you ready to be saved?

320
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:58,240
 He starts to build this group of people.

321
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,920
 Now other people in Richardson County are like, "That guy's a lunatic.

322
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
 He's just a weirdo.

323
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,320
 He's just talking all of his death and destruction and whatever.

324
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,600
 It's Nebraska.

325
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,640
 People are living their own lives."

326
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,480
 And really nowadays too, sometimes you'll see stuff pop up on Facebook and you're just

327
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 like, "Whatever.

328
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 That guy's weird.

329
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,520
 That guy kind of has a weird political view or he's a little too extreme."

330
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,800
 But you just let it go.

331
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,280
 It's just kind of the way things are.

332
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,520
 You never imagine it's going to get as bad as it can get.

333
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,120
 And most of the time it doesn't.

334
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:39,080
 Michael begins to form this philosophy and begins to recruit members to realize that

335
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,400
 they are the true Israelites.

336
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,360
 You see the Bible wants to talk about the Jews.

337
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,440
 By the way, this guy's super racist.

338
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,840
 This guy's super racist.

339
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,040
 This is a white supremacy group.

340
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,960
 He goes, "The Bible wants to talk about the Jews being the chosen people."

341
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,440
 But they're not.

342
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,440
 They're wrong.

343
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,320
 The true Israelites is who God was referring to.

344
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,800
 The true Israelites is who Jesus and the disciples were referring to.

345
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,320
 And we are the true Israelites.

346
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,600
 And I know that because I've seen the visions.

347
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,720
 I've been told this by Yahweh himself.

348
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,800
 The true name of God.

349
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,760
 I bet you your minister doesn't always talk about Yahweh.

350
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
 Yahweh talks to me.

351
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,400
 Your minister reads out of a book.

352
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
 Is he talking?

353
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
 Is he talking to Yahweh himself?

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 No.

355
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,400
 He's not.

356
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,120
 He's reading a book full of lies.

357
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,840
 It's been completely corrupted by worldly forces.

358
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,640
 Now I'm going to tell you that the battle of Armageddon is coming.

359
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,960
 But it's not going to happen in some far off place that we've never been to.

360
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,280
 It's going to happen here in Nebraska.

361
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,880
 It's going to happen soon.

362
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,160
 And our own people are going to be in the front lines of this battle.

363
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,000
 The UN is going to send in their global troops.

364
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,560
 The godless forces of the United States government are going to come down here.

365
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,760
 They're going to kill the true Israelites.

366
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,160
 So what we need to do is we need to get weapons.

367
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
 More weapons than we already know.

368
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,400
 I know everyone here owns at least two guns.

369
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,880
 We need more than that.

370
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,640
 And we've got to fight this war for God.

371
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,840
 We've got to get ready for war.

372
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,680
 This group begins to fund its activities through burglaries.

373
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
 They're stealing stuff.

374
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
 They're selling it.

375
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,920
 They're just not like, "Ooh, I have this new boom box."

376
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,240
 And he's like, "Uh, yeah, we need guns."

377
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,280
 Unless that boom box is sound wave, go sell it and buy yourself a gun.

378
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
 Another gun.

379
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,920
 And they begin to amass this huge collection of weapons.

380
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,800
 That's totally illegal in the United States, though.

381
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,520
 You can have a bunch of guns.

382
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,320
 You can also believe dumb things.

383
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,100
 You can believe that battle of Armageddon is going to happen in Nebraska.

384
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,480
 You can believe that you're the true Israelites.

385
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,520
 None of that stuff is illegal.

386
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,440
 This cult grows to around 21 people.

387
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,520
 10 of them are children.

388
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,360
 Which you would think, "Well, that's not really good for the battle of Armageddon.

389
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,880
 I'd want to have more adults."

390
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,360
 But children are the future.

391
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,880
 Wendy Houston told us that children are the future.

392
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,800
 A cult needs kids.

393
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,120
 And they can a lot of times be better soldiers because you can brainwash them far easier

394
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,840
 than an adult.

395
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,280
 And he has this test that he does.

396
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,840
 It's called the Arm Test.

397
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,920
 For example, let's start robbing people's houses to raise money to fund our activities.

398
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,720
 You may think, "Well, if we're the true Israelites, if God is on our side, then why should we

399
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,120
 have to burgle any houses?"

400
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,960
 So what happens is, let's get you up here and you're going to put your arms straight

401
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
 out to its side.

402
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,680
 You're going to hold it up as hard as you can.

403
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,520
 Now, I'm going to stand up next to you.

404
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
 We'll get behind you.

405
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,080
 I'm going to put one hand on your shoulder and one hand on your wrist.

406
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,360
 And I say, "Yahweh, do you want us to burgle these houses?"

407
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:33,260
 If the answer is yes, no matter how hard I push down on your arm, like I'm holding left

408
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,080
 hands on your shoulder, right hand is on your wrist.

409
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,720
 No matter how hard I push down on your wrist, your arm will not budge.

410
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,320
 You have Yahweh inside you for that moment.

411
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,200
 No matter how hard I push, it will not go down.

412
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,640
 And that means yes.

413
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,440
 Yahweh is answering yes to whatever question you have.

414
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,680
 So Yahweh is saying, "Yes, I want you to become robbers."

415
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,640
 But if I put my arm on your shoulder and I push down on your wrist and it goes down,

416
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
 the answer is no.

417
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,000
 It's the perfect way to communicate with an omnipotent being.

418
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,320
 What's interesting is that's super easy to fake, right?

419
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,480
 It's super easy to fake.

420
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,840
 If I grab you, the second person is the one asking the question, "Maybe I don't put a

421
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
 ton of force.

422
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,400
 If a bunch of people are watching this, right, I can pretend I'm putting on a lot of force.

423
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,040
 You may feel like I'm putting on a lot of force, but I'm not and your arm stays up.

424
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,760
 But if I want the answer to be no, I can probably really hurt you to get that arm down.

425
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,840
 Because Yahweh would never let your arm go down, no matter how much force I put on it.

426
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,840
 It's a pretty good trick for a group of people who are already brainwashed and they're believing

427
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,240
 everything you're saying.

428
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:54,080
 There's a farmer, a local farmer named Rick Stice, who really, really gets into this philosophy

429
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,600
 of the true Israelites.

430
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,760
 So Rick Stice, his wife passed away.

431
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,840
 It's just him and his three kids.

432
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,440
 They have this huge farm and the colt's been around for about a year or two at this point.

433
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,800
 Rick says, "Hey, why don't you bring your colt and live at my farm with me?"

434
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,520
 I would love to do that for Yahweh and you, Michael.

435
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,200
 Because at this point, Michael has declared himself an archangel.

436
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,400
 He's not just a man of flesh and blood.

437
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
 He is more than that.

438
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:33,600
 So come live on my farm, bring everybody, all the members, everyone come out to this

439
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
 farm.

440
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
 So they do.

441
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,960
 Twenty-one people, well you already have the four people living there, Rick Stice and his

442
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:49,920
 three kids, but then the rest of them come to this farm and something happens where Michael

443
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,600
 becomes jealous of Rick.

444
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,000
 Could have been something super petty.

445
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,920
 He could have been people just really liking the farm and being like, "Wow, that really

446
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,840
 is cool that Rick's letting us use this farm.

447
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
 Wow, this is awesome.

448
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,000
 Look at all this stuff."

449
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,160
 And it's something that Michael couldn't have provided for them.

450
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,360
 They were basically just a group of burglars.

451
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,320
 Or maybe Michael just woke up on the wrong side of the bed one day.

452
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,120
 He hates Rick and he demotes Rick to the level of slave status in the group.

453
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,200
 You got to do everything we say.

454
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,000
 And Rick is already totally bought into this philosophy.

455
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,320
 Always being made a slave for some reason.

456
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,840
 Why would an archangel lie?

457
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:38,600
 I'll be slave status.

458
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,640
 It's March 1984.

459
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,760
 Michael's control over the group is absolute at this point.

460
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,400
 No one even questions anything he does.

461
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,120
 Well, if you do question it, well let's just do an arm test.

462
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,000
 Let's see what Yahweh has to say about that.

463
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,240
 I guess Yahweh really wants us to do this weird thing that Michael just mentioned.

464
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,920
 Okay, well you know, can't argue with Yahweh.

465
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,920
 I saw him pushing down on that arm as hard as he could.

466
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,560
 Oh, and here's another thing.

467
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,200
 I mean, the arm test is a complete joke.

468
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
 We know the trick behind it.

469
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,080
 But Michael said, "You can't do the arm test.

470
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
 You have to pet."

471
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,720
 But Michael said, "You can't do the arm test by yourself.

472
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,240
 You have to ask me for permission."

473
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,760
 So two members couldn't go in a bedroom and say, "Is Michael really the archangel and

474
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
 then do this?"

475
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,000
 You weren't allowed to do that.

476
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,040
 You had to ask him for permission.

477
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:42,560
 It's March 1984 and at this point Michael has begun to have visions that Luke Stice,

478
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:51,800
 the five-year-old son of Rick, is a child of Satan.

479
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:57,320
 And so they take Luke and they write 666 on his forehead and go, "Look, he is the mark

480
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,720
 of the beast.

481
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,200
 I put it on him myself, but he's a child of Satan."

482
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,320
 Rick will spend a portion of his day just chained up on the front porch, just sitting

483
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
 there.

484
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,040
 When he's of no use to be a slave and to run and do all this work, they'll chain him up

485
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,320
 on the porch and sometimes there's another man named James Thim who will also be chained

486
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
 up on the porch with him.

487
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,440
 He was another one who, for whatever reason, pissed Michael off somehow.

488
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,560
 But now Michael's saying, "Your five-year-old son Luke is the child of the devil."

489
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,320
 And everyone's like, "Oh, we knew there had to be at least one of those in this group."

490
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,080
 An interloper, a spy.

491
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,840
 So Michael says, "Rick, do you believe me when I say that your five-year-old son is

492
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,280
 a servant of the devil, a child of the devil, not just a servant like he was devil DNA in

493
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,780
 him?"

494
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,520
 Rick goes, "I do.

495
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,040
 Like if you're telling me that and I trust you absolutely, I do believe that my son has

496
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,640
 devil DNA in him."

497
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:11,040
 Michael says, "Beat your child."

498
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,120
 Punch you to beat him up right in front of me.

499
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,640
 Let's do it.

500
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,160
 Rick looks at his five-year-old son, punches him right in the face.

501
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:36,400
 Blow, after blow, after blow, he's raining down, punches and kicks on his own child.

502
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,880
 Who has to not even be able to comprehend anything that's going on?

503
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,200
 Like at five, you obviously know what's going on in the world.

504
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,840
 What five-year kind of like in kindergarten, first grade, you're not a dummy.

505
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,320
 He's not a mulling baby.

506
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,760
 He knows something's been different since his mom died, but he's young enough to go,

507
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,840
 "Maybe this is what all five-year-olds go through."

508
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,240
 I don't know.

509
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,840
 Maybe all kids just have 20 people walking around on their property one day and people

510
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,160
 are constantly talking about God.

511
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:16,040
 I have no context for any of this, but I do know that my dad shouldn't be punching me

512
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,800
 right now.

513
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,160
 Rick beat Luke in front of Michael.

514
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,240
 There are other people there as well.

515
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,280
 It's a test of loyalty, not just to Michael, but to Yahweh.

516
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,760
 He beat his son.

517
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:38,000
 Even Rick does, on one hand, a sensible thing, but on the other hand, an incomprehensible

518
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,280
 thing to any rational human.

519
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,360
 He leaves the cult.

520
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,120
 He just leaves the compound.

521
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
 His house, right?

522
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
 It was his house, his farm.

523
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,000
 He's out of there.

524
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,080
 That's a good idea.

525
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,080
 But he left his kids there.

526
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:59,280
 That's not a good idea.

527
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
 That's a terrible idea.

528
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,120
 That's the worst idea you could think of.

529
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:15,640
 We don't know what Rick's reasoning was there, but he leaves the group, leaves his kids,

530
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:22,720
 but then, like it's like seven days later, he comes back.

531
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,040
 Not to get his kids.

532
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,360
 He comes back to rejoin the cult.

533
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:38,280
 The cult that made him beat up his own child and guy strapping, because that was nothing

534
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,400
 compared to what's going to happen.

535
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,560
 Rick comes back to the cult.

536
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,040
 Michael goes, you know, he left.

537
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,560
 He weren't supposed to leave.

538
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,120
 Bring Luke into the room.

539
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,760
 So they go get this five-year-old boy.

540
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,200
 They bring him in.

541
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
 Michael's there.

542
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
 Rick's there.

543
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
 Other people are there.

544
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,920
 They had like this inner circle in the cult.

545
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:14,560
 Michael goes, Rick, I want you to have sex with Luke.

546
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:22,120
 I want you to have sex with your five-year-old son right now.

547
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,960
 Rick follows Michael's order.

548
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:37,640
 He rapes his five-year-old son in front of all these cult members.

549
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:51,960
 After he was done, Michael says, Rick, I want you to hit Luke as hard as you can.

550
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,640
 Don't give some weak little punch, because, oh, no, Y'all way will know, and Y'all way

551
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,880
 will tell me.

552
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:06,400
 I want you to hit him as hard as you can.

553
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:14,960
 So Rick pulls back and aim and straight for Luke's head.

554
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,920
 A powerhouse punch.

555
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,000
 Really knocks Luke unconscious.

556
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,560
 Luke never woke back up.

557
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,000
 He died a few hours later.

558
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Rick, I want you to go dig a grave for Luke.

559
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,080
 This child's Satan.

560
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,560
 Go dig a grave.

561
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,640
 We'll put him in there.

562
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,840
 Maybe God will have mercy on him, even though the devil had him in this life.

563
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,720
 Go take care of that.

564
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:02,120
 As Rick was digging this grave, he ran away.

565
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
 He ran away.

566
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,760
 He left the cult again.

567
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:13,400
 But he left his two other children there.

568
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:21,080
 He didn't tell anybody what happened.

569
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,920
 Didn't go to the cops.

570
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,800
 Didn't talk to anyone in the neighborhood.

571
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,760
 He just left.

572
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,160
 He doesn't come back.

573
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,840
 And at that point, Michael's full wrath is focused on James Thim.

574
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,560
 This was another guy.

575
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,920
 This was another guy who willingly joined the cult and 100% followed everything that Michael

576
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,160
 said.

577
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,360
 He really believed that Michael was an archangel that he was preparing for the end of the world.

578
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,640
 At this point, they had amassed quite a collection of weapons as well.

579
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,200
 And James was totally down with all of this stuff.

580
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,400
 He, in a way, couldn't figure out why he was chained up onto the porch, why people treated

581
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,240
 him poorly, but he figured that this is all part of God's plan.

582
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,960
 April 28th, 1985, James Thim, who does his best to tow the line and to be a good follower,

583
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:23,120
 he gets accused of all of these various acts of vandalism and blasphemy.

584
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,680
 All sorts of weird things just kind of come out of the woodwork.

585
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,280
 Real or imagined, all of these things get pointed at James Thim, including the worst

586
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,680
 of all was the turkey that everyone was going to eat.

587
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,680
 They had this turkey was poisoned with household chemicals.

588
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,200
 James was like, "I didn't do that.

589
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
 I didn't do that.

590
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,360
 I would never do that to you, Michael.

591
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
 I didn't do that.

592
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,400
 Like, why would I do all this stuff?"

593
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,040
 Totally I didn't do this.

594
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,840
 Trust me, please, please, please, trust me.

595
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
 I didn't try to poison you.

596
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,280
 I didn't do all this other stuff I'm being accused of."

597
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
 And he didn't.

598
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,120
 James was innocent of these charges.

599
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,400
 He was just being accused of all this stuff.

600
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:12,120
 But how can you pass up the truth of the arm test?

601
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,920
 Like sure, James, your alibi being chained up on the porch is a pretty good alibi.

602
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,520
 I'm not going to lie.

603
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,400
 But let's do this arm test over here.

604
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,920
 Hey, Bruce, put your arm out straight.

605
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,120
 And I'm going to put my hand on your shoulder.

606
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,520
 I'll put my other hand on your wrist.

607
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,760
 And I'm going to push down as hard as I can.

608
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,080
 Yaw-way.

609
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,480
 Did James Thim do all the stuff we said?

610
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,640
 And probably more we haven't found out yet.

611
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,160
 Michael pushes down on that wrist.

612
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,440
 Man, it looks like he's pushing hard, doesn't it?

613
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,960
 It looks like he's pushing real hard.

614
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,320
 But there's Bruce with his arm out.

615
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,760
 It's not even moving.

616
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,120
 No matter how hard Michael pushes, Yaw-way gives Bruce the strength to hold back.

617
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,880
 He's strong enough to hold back the push of an archangel himself.

618
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:06,000
 James, you're clearly guilty of all these crimes.

619
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,080
 So they take James out to the barn.

620
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:19,440
 And it's him, Michael, a couple of his-- it can only be described as goons at this point.

621
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,880
 I don't care if they give him the title of deacons or bishops or whatever.

622
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:32,400
 These goons, they take James out to the barn.

623
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,520
 And the first thing they do-- one of them pulls out a pistol and shoots James right in the

624
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,560
 face.

625
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,440
 It's a pretty bad wound.

626
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,520
 It goes through cheek and bone.

627
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,880
 Muscle tissue is seared.

628
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,880
 There's this hot, round drills through him.

629
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,800
 But he's still alive.

630
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,080
 It's just a face shot.

631
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,480
 It was a head shot.

632
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
 Couldn't shoot him in the brain.

633
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,240
 Just shot him in the face.

634
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,960
 James falls down into the hay and he's holding the wound.

635
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,240
 Feels his own warm blood smear all over his hand.

636
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,440
 He's writhing in agony.

637
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,160
 Scroops just standing around.

638
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
 I didn't do it.

639
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
 I didn't do it, guys.

640
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
 I didn't do it.

641
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,360
 I didn't do any of that stuff.

642
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,160
 Holding clothes, the wound, trying to stop the bleeding.

643
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,800
 Michael turns to one of his goons and goes, "Hey, hey.

644
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,080
 Go grab a goat."

645
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,600
 Goon comes back with one of the goats on the farm.

646
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,960
 Takes it into the makeshift cell.

647
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,080
 Really, it's just like a little corral in the barn.

648
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:57,000
 Takes the goat and Michael says to James, "James, I want you to have sex with that goat."

649
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 What?

650
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 What are you talking about?

651
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 You just shot me in the face.

652
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,360
 Now you want me to have sex with a goat?

653
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,080
 I wouldn't do it whether or not you shot me in the face, but just so we're clear.

654
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
 I can't.

655
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,120
 I'm in a lot of pain.

656
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
 It's a goat.

657
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,840
 I don't want to have sex with a goat.

658
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,640
 Secondly, I'm in a lot of pain.

659
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,720
 It's going to be kind of hard to concentrate.

660
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,440
 You know, I'm a guy.

661
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,640
 Sometimes it's easy to get a boner.

662
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,000
 Generally not, though.

663
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,240
 You've been shot in the face and there's a goat here.

664
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,920
 And Michael goes, "Listen, I'm not telling you to do this.

665
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:42,360
 Your way is you need to have sex with that goat."

666
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,360
 And it's possible that James did believe that your way was given this order and would

667
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,880
 give him the strength to have sex with this goat.

668
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,840
 It's also possible that James at this point thought he would get out of this.

669
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,280
 If he did what they said, even though he'd already been shot in the face, they didn't

670
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,520
 kill him.

671
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,160
 He knows about Luke.

672
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,240
 That was child of the saint.

673
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
 He needed to die.

674
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,440
 So James doesn't want that kid needed to die.

675
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,480
 But maybe if I do this, they'll let me go.

676
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:24,640
 So James, with an open wound, a fresh bullet hole in his face, has sex with this goat.

677
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:34,080
 At that point, two or three of the goons come into this little holding area where James is.

678
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:41,320
 And Michael goes, "Hey guys, you see that shovel over there?

679
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,680
 Shove it up his butt hole."

680
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,520
 And they violated him and they did massive internal damage into him.

681
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,200
 They tear his bowels.

682
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,760
 And then as they're done with that, Michael goes, "Oh, you know what guys?

683
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,960
 Break his arm."

684
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,520
 So James is laying there on the ground, fresh bullet wound to his face.

685
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,640
 He's been horribly violated.

686
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,320
 One of the goons gets down.

687
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,720
 James's arm snaps his bone.

688
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:20,440
 Okay, boys, we're done here.

689
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,520
 You can imagine James is laying there on the ground, relieved.

690
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,040
 Relieved the pain that he's going through.

691
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,760
 He knows he needs medical attention.

692
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,840
 Maybe Yaway though.

693
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,240
 Maybe this was a test and Yaway can heal him.

694
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,400
 But it's over with.

695
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,920
 They're done.

696
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
 Broke my arm.

697
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,560
 They did some unspeakable things.

698
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,680
 They shot me in the face.

699
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,680
 But they're done.

700
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,440
 I made it.

701
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,120
 Made it.

702
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:59,920
 But he realizes as these men are leaving, they're locking the barn up.

703
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,600
 They're done.

704
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,080
 But he's not.

705
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,280
 That was just day one.

706
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,520
 Next morning, Michael and his goons come back into the barn.

707
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:24,160
 They break one of his legs, then break the other.

708
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,200
 Michael brings in this tool.

709
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
 He holds it up.

710
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,280
 He goes, "Guys, you know what this is here?

711
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,360
 This here is used to take the skin off of a pig."

712
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,200
 You can take skin off of any animal, but this one specifically for taking skin off a pig.

713
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,040
 You guys want to see how it works?

714
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
 Yeah.

715
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
 Yeah.

716
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,160
 Let's check it out.

717
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:58,320
 And Michael begins removing strips of skin off of James's broken legs.

718
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:06,520
 Michael then orders someone to grab Luke's left hand, hold his left hand out, while another

719
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:17,560
 person shot off his fingertips.

720
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,400
 You have to imagine at this point, I mean, James is fully conscious.

721
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,840
 James is fully aware of what's going on, and at a certain point he has to realize this

722
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,920
 is never going to end.

723
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,440
 They've removed pieces of my skin, they've broken three of my limbs, they've shot me,

724
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,760
 they've done internal damages, they're blowing my fingertips off one by one.

725
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,000
 How much longer can this go on for?

726
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,240
 Please just let them kill me at this point.

727
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,040
 I would rather just die.

728
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,520
 Please just get it over with.

729
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:58,080
 We don't know if he had the strength to say any of that, but that is what happened.

730
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,080
 There was at this point mercy shown, well, almost.

731
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:12,840
 They began stomping on him, kicking him and stomping on him until finally they killed him.

732
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:20,480
 They stomped him to death, and then after he had died, one of the goons pulls out a gun,

733
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,200
 and shoots him in the head.

734
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,520
 Two days of brutal torture for a man who never questioned the teachings of Michael, who willingly

735
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:41,400
 joined the cult, who devoted his life to the teachings of the true Israelites, and still

736
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,600
 was just not good enough.

737
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,840
 Or, I mean, again, or Michael just hated him, or Michael believed that he did do all of that

738
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,440
 destruction and did try to poison them.

739
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,040
 It's June 25th, 1985, so it's just a couple months later.

740
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,800
 Two cult members are arrested for stealing a piece of equipment, something known as a

741
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,720
 spraying rig.

742
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,040
 This burglary spree had still been going on.

743
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,280
 You're still selling the stuff to buy guns.

744
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,880
 They get arrested, and they're brought into the local police station, they're locked up

745
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,440
 in the cell, and these two cult members are sitting in the cell.

746
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,560
 And it had to have dawned on them, because at this point all the cult members knew about

747
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,280
 James.

748
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,920
 Luke was a child of the devil.

749
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
 He wasn't one of us.

750
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,040
 He didn't willingly join the cult.

751
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,840
 He just happened to be there when the cult showed up at the farm.

752
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:38,760
 But James, I mean, yeah, sure, he might have poisoned that turkey, but these two guys were

753
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,080
 sitting there, and they had to be like, actually feel safer in the cell.

754
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,360
 And the other guy looks over and goes, you know, I didn't want to be the first one to

755
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,080
 say it, but I actually feel pretty safe here as well.

756
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:57,000
 Like this is probably the calmest place I've been in in two years.

757
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,080
 Sitting in this cell.

758
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,240
 No one's going to be doing harm tests.

759
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,480
 I'm not going to get accused of anything weird, and no one's going to get brutally tortured

760
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
 and murdered for days.

761
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,520
 I actually feel a little bit of peace here.

762
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,440
 These two cult members sitting in this jail cell go, you know what?

763
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,200
 Let's tell the police what is going on at that farm.

764
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,320
 Now the police just think, the police know about the true Israelites.

765
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,400
 They know about this group out at the old Stice Place.

766
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,800
 They do know about them, but again, it is not illegal to practice a religion or even

767
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,320
 a weird religion in the United States.

768
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,160
 It's not illegal to amass weapons.

769
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,920
 Nowadays it's a little more, I can raise more red flags, but back in the 1980s they're

770
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,520
 like, whatever.

771
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:50,720
 So these two cult members tell the police, hey listen, it's not just about religion and

772
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,200
 getting weapons and getting ready for the Battle of Armageddon.

773
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,080
 There's a couple people who've been murdered up there.

774
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,600
 There's a little boy.

775
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,480
 Then James.

776
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:09,720
 James was murdered, and I wasn't there, but from what I heard, it took a while.

777
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:16,320
 Eventually, the FBI, the local police, and the ATF, Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, they

778
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:22,920
 end up raiding the compound, and they find all the guns, and they dig up the bodies.

779
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,840
 They find the body of Luke, the body of James.

780
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,160
 So those were the only two people who died in this experience.

781
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,120
 Now the two people who got arrested, remember, they turned almost immediately, and they sold

782
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
 everyone out.

783
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,920
 Rick didn't.

784
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,000
 Rick just left and didn't tell anybody what happened up there.

785
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,160
 Nothing.

786
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,920
 There was obviously a ton of arrests that were made due to the murders.

787
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,880
 That was really the big charge was the murders.

788
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:56,800
 You had nine different people who were charged with first degree murder.

789
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,720
 Michael Ryan ended up being sentenced to death back on September 12th, 1985.

790
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,120
 Couple of the other members got the death penalty.

791
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,280
 Other ones got life in prison without parole, with parole.

792
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,320
 You had all these different things going on, all these different sentences.

793
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:19,360
 What's interesting is I cannot find, I'm not saying there was a conspiracy for it, it's

794
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:28,920
 just I cannot find what, if any, sentence Rick Steis got.

795
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,880
 And it's also interesting because there's tons of different variations on what, on the

796
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,080
 story that I just told you, little facts.

797
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:44,040
 I mean, some versions of it say that Rick punched his son so hard his head hit a cabinet.

798
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,960
 Some say that he hit him or smashed him with a piece of wood.

799
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,800
 We're getting these different variations.

800
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:55,920
 I mean, at the end of the day, that he did kill his child with a single blow.

801
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,080
 There's versions of the story where Rick and James were both raising questions about the

802
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,080
 cult.

803
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,120
 I don't know if this is the right thing to do.

804
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,120
 What if this is actually all a big scam?

805
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:15,280
 There are other versions of the story where they were bootlicking members from day one.

806
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,480
 They 100% believed in the cause of the cult, of the true Israelites.

807
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,000
 So they're showing you different variations and these are important variations.

808
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 So how the kid, how Luke was punched to death, that's not, well, here's a variation that

809
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 I came across in my research.

810
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,200
 One of the versions is Rick originally was like, "I'm not going to have sex with my son."

811
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,040
 And Michael said, "If you don't, I'm going to cut off your dick."

812
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,480
 Which I think most fathers would be like, "Cut it off, dude.

813
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,280
 Like seriously cut it off if that's the choice."

814
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,680
 But there's versions of the story where Rick was a stalwart defender in his son's honor.

815
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,760
 But he threatened to cut my dick off, so I had sex with my son.

816
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,240
 It's really interesting because obviously there are certain people who are telling the

817
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
 story.

818
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:08,480
 When the two people turned this in, when the two people turned in the cult, then the police

819
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,560
 went to go find Rick's dice.

820
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,280
 Because they figured he left the group, whatever was going on up there, some weirdo, bunch

821
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,480
 of religious nuts.

822
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,120
 They didn't know anything about the bodies and Rick didn't say a word.

823
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,280
 He left and just went back to town.

824
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,720
 Well eventually the feds at a certain point when the FBI got involved, they found him

825
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,760
 and they go, "What happened up there?

826
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,960
 We're hearing all this stuff about you and your son and he died."

827
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,000
 It's interesting because we see these articles where Rick was fighting against the cult.

828
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,040
 His direct quote to authorities when they asked, "Why did you do it?"

829
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,160
 He said, "I thought that was what was to be done."

830
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,280
 Unquote.

831
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:52,160
 He believed in the orders he was being given no matter how horrific they were.

832
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,320
 Anyways, you had all these arrests.

833
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,360
 A bunch of members of Michael's family was involved in this as well.

834
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,360
 They were all arrested.

835
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,360
 His goons were arrested.

836
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:07,080
 The true Israelite compound was shut down.

837
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,800
 I have no...

838
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:16,400
 I can't find if Rick's dice got charged or what his sentence was.

839
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,720
 I just can't find it.

840
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,240
 I'm assuming he got charged with something because he didn't immediately turn state's

841
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
 evidence.

842
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,640
 It's not like the two guys could say, "We were just there.

843
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,640
 We just know it was gone out.

844
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,760
 We didn't murder anybody."

845
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,880
 They can walk.

846
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,080
 Rick's dice murdered this kid.

847
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:39,680
 His kid tortured and raped and murdered his own child and I can't find what his sentence

848
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,680
 was.

849
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:46,640
 Now I'm going to say if I do find it, I'm going to put it in right there.

850
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,760
 I'm going to edit it in because I'm going to still...

851
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,200
 But I can never find it.

852
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,200
 Maybe one of you guys can.

853
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,320
 We'll do a little intro there.

854
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,240
 Michael Ryan spent the rest of his life in prison.

855
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,560
 He was arrested in June of 1985.

856
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,960
 He was sentenced to death in September 1985.

857
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:13,560
 He died in 2015 of natural causes.

858
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,360
 So that's the story of the true Israelites.

859
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,080
 And it's a story that doesn't have a moral.

860
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:23,520
 It's not a story that we can dissect because it happens all the time.

861
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,600
 These groups are pretty normal, unfortunately.

862
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,360
 Nowadays, they seem to take the form of a sex cult.

863
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:38,040
 Every show you read the newspaper, some guy had 50 women at some high-rise apartment.

864
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,840
 What was that one group that Alison Mack was part of from Superman?

865
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,840
 From that Superman show?

866
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,840
 Smallville?

867
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,840
 Just stuff like that.

868
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,000
 There's literally sex cults popping up from time to time again.

869
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,320
 We don't get a lot of these murder cults anymore.

870
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,400
 And that's a compliment to humanity.

871
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:01,360
 I'd much rather have some guy pretending to be a yogi and he's banging college coeds.

872
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,440
 I'd much rather have that.

873
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,360
 I understand why people join cults because they're looking for purpose.

874
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:14,000
 Everybody in the world feels like they're special, but they don't feel special.

875
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,480
 They're easy to prey on people like that.

876
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,640
 And that's everybody.

877
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:24,480
 But for Michael to form the cult in the first place, was he just some perverted sicko who

878
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:30,640
 wanted to watch people have sex with kids and goats and Pornhub wasn't around yet?

879
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,520
 Or did he experience some sort of vision?

880
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,280
 Not from Yahweh.

881
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,920
 Yahweh was something far darker, demonic in fact, that showed him the end of the world

882
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,840
 was coming and he needed to prepare himself and the people around him to fight off the

883
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,920
 forces of evil.

884
00:53:52,920 --> 00:54:06,480
 But little did he know that he was the force of evil.

885
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,800
