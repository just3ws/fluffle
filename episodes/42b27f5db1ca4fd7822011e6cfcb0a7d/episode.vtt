 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.960
 - A fourth of July party turns into a terrifying ordeal

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.880
 for all involved.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.920
 And then we take a look at the curious case

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.560
 of Thomas Mayhan, a businessman who left work

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.400
 and was headed home.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.320
 But he never reached home.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.600
 He was spotted in three locations around town,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.160
 and in one of those locations,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 he was already dead today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.900
 (upbeat music)

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.960
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.760
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.880
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.720
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.600
 Season six starts now.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.360
 Now you may go, "Hmm, Jason,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.920
 "the audio quality's a bit different.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.620
 "I'm on vacation, man.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.680
 "I'm in sunny, sunny California in sunny, sunny Sacramento.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.920
 "Sac a potatoes, sac a tomato.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.760
 "This city that always sleeps."

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.320
 So I'm kicking it down here.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.480
 It's like 97 degrees.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.240
 I'm in an un-air conditioned apartment

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.920
 like I normally am because I can't have air conditioners

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.640
 or fans running while I record this show.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.880
 So if you hear the occasional drip drop

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.800
 that is sweat leaving my body.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.400
 But we got a lot of good stuff for you today.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.520
 We got two really interesting stories.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.240
 The first story just happened.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.280
 It actually happened as I basically,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.920
 while I was recording,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.000
 the end of season five was on July 4th.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.080
 So this episode basically,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.240
 all of this stuff was transpiring

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.320
 while I was messing around.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.040
 And actually it was all transpiring

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.720
 while all of us were watching fireworks

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.320
 or sleeping because we're 80 years old.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.520
 But remember what you were doing fourth of July.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.880
 Think about what you were doing fourth of July.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.720
 And now forget that.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.660
 Forget that happened because we are going on an adventure.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.680
 We are going to Bodega Bay.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.480
 Bodega Bay, little town in California.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.960
 The sunny sunny state.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.800
 I'm just joking.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.080
 Okay, so anyways, sun's always in California.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.360
 Anyway, so I'm surprised there's no conspiracy

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.520
 yet about the earthquakes.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.760
 I'm surprised there's no one saying

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.680
 that it's the lizard people or,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.660
 I saw someone trying to say that the LA earthquakes

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.920
 was a sign that the Yellowstone geyser

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.040
 was going to blow up the planet.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.520
 Not a geyser, it's actually like a super volcano

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.120
 under there and it is quite dangerous.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.200
 But I'm surprised we don't get more.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.600
 I wonder how flat earthers,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.760
 how they explain earthquakes.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.560
 Anyways, anyways, I should note to self,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.960
 look up what maniacs think about natural events.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.600
 Back to Bodega Bay.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.440
 Let's go ahead and get started with the saga of Batai Coffee.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.300
 Batai Coffee is a 32 year old man.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.520
 Stanford graduate, upper crust, upper crust old chum.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.440
 Actually he's born raised in LA.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.560
 But anyways, Batai Coffee is like,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.440
 he's a software engineer at YouTube right now.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.880
 Well, was.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.200
 He wakes up from a coma earlier this week.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.800
 He wakes up from a coma.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.200
 He can't move the left side of his body.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.160
 He's like, what happened?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.840
 Sexy nurses are all walking around taking his temperature,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.880
 like filling out charts, a little short nurse skirts.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.560
 And they're like, oh, the patient's awake.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.840
 This is my dream hospital.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.080
 Not this guy, this guy doesn't need to be there.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.560
 But bunch of sexy nurses are like,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.440
 oh, let's go get a doctor.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.760
 Doctor comes in, sexy female doctor.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.560
 Even shorter skirt, I didn't even know it was possible.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 She comes in, she goes, Mr. Coffee, you're awake.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.120
 And he's like, what happened?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.640
 What happened to me?

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.560
 She goes, well, first off, everything we're about to talk

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.280
 about is alleged.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.880
 And secondly, everything we're about to talk about is true.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.160
 And it's alleged in the sense that everything that happened,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.760
 like the first part, is true.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.560
 But it's alleged whether or not coffee did it.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.480
 And coffee's like, what does any of that

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.160
 have to do with my medical condition?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.200
 I want to know why I can't move the left side of my body.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.960
 And sexy doctor turns back away from the camera and goes,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.200
 well, Mr. Coffee, I think the police should explain to you

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.880
 what happened.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.680
 Maybe you can answer a few questions.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.720
 She gives a sexy wink at us as she walks out

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.480
 of the hospital room.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.400
 So here's what happened.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.080
 That was our little intro for the day.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.480
 Here's what happened.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.920
 Coffee, 32-year-old Petite Coffee, software engineer

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.840
 for YouTube, Stanford educated, good old chum, cream

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.000
 of the crop of American society, is hanging out with five

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.160
 of his buddies in Bodega Bay.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
 They rented a place so they could spend

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.400
 Fourth of July all the weekend partying at this house.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.040
 Now, I don't know.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.920
 I party.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.040
 I'll kick it with a couple friends, drink a couple beers.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.720
 If that.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.640
 Usually I just hang out and talk about magic the gathering.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.960
 But these guys said, nah, nah, we're not none of those plebs.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.120
 We're not any of those working class that drinks Budweiser.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.840
 Let's drop acid.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.520
 Taking it up a level, I guess.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.480
 But anyways, they decide to drop acid.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.880
 Now, I know a lot of my listeners do acid.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.880
 Not a sizable amount.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.760
 But I know a lot of people have experimented with it.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.680
 I don't mess with hallucinogens.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.160
 I already see ghosts flying around me.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.880
 Not all the time.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.720
 I'm not a lunatic.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.680
 But the line is so thin where if I saw a goblin just appear,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.360
 I'd be like, oh my god, that goblin's real.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.440
 So I don't want to take a drug that's

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.080
 going to increase the likelihood of goblins appearing in front of me.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.200
 So they decide to drop acid.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.080
 Now, I'm assuming it wasn't their first time.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.360
 Maybe it was.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.520
 But I'm assuming it wasn't.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.480
 Now, they all decide to take half a tab of acid.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.480
 Except for coffee, because coffee is an overachiever.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.080
 Stanford graduate, software engineer at YouTube.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.120
 He takes two hits of acid.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.960
 He's like, oh, good old chums, you don't understand.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.760
 Acid is what you Americans-- he's American too.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.280
 I don't know.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.680
 I just imagine him very posh, because Stanford graduate, right?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.320
 I graduated from community college.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.240
 So anyone who graduated from college is posh.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.360
 Anyways, he goes, I'm going to take two hits of acid.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.000
 I'm going to do better than all you guys, just

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.840
 like I did better than you guys on the SATs.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.560
 And they're like, dude, we all have the same job.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.000
 You don't have to be injured.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.400
 So they're partying.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.080
 Now, at 3 PM-- so they started pre-gaming really, really early.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.960
 At 3 PM, coffee starts freaking out.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.840
 He's like, oh, man, I don't know what happened, old chum.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.640
 Oh, I don't know.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.440
 It could be the four times amount of acid I took over you guys.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.520
 And they're like, yeah, probably.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.320
 About an hour later, he goes, oh, old bean.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.040
 I don't know what's going on.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.760
 He looks at his friend.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.520
 He's actually an old bean.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.520
 He's like, oh, I don't know what's going on.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.040
 I need to study myself.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.600
 I need to study myself.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.760
 And he takes two more hits of acid.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.120
 He's already having a bad trip.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.920
 Takes two more hits of acid.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.640
 His friends are like, don't do that, dude.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.760
 Like, that was the wrong move.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.240
 And he's like, oh, don't tell me what to do talking watermelon.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.680
 I'll take all the acid I want.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.160
 Now, that happened at around 4, between 4 and 5 PM.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.240
 He takes the two additional hits of acid.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.640
 At 8 PM, fireworks are going off.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.520
 Kids are poking each other with sparklers.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.160
 Dogs are terrified.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.000
 It's a great quarter of July.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 He wants to leave the house.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.760
 He wants to leave.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.520
 And they're like, dude, you are in no condition to leave the house.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.920
 Friends won't let him.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:44.560
 And then, like, that, our fake British pal, our Stanford graduate,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.960
 turns into Jason Bourne.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.360
 Now, this is where, first off, you're thinking, oh, Jason,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.000
 a guy who's getting taken a bunch of acid.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.880
 He's going to end up running around street naked.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.760
 This guy turns into an action hero, or more likely an action

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.080
 villain because of what happens.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.560
 This is why Kofi ended up in the hospital,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.640
 paralyzed on the left side of his body,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.920
 surrounded by sexy medical staff.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.920
 First off, so he's surrounded by his friends,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.520
 and they're like, come on, Kofi, settle down.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.520
 You can't go anywhere.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.200
 He punches the woman in the chest, picks up a pencil,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.800
 stabs another one of his friends,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.320
 and another dude climbs on top of him.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.320
 He starts choking him while punching

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.640
 another man in the face.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.400
 So within a second, he's taken out four people.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.440
 He takes off outside the house.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.240
 Action music playing in his head because he's

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.160
 tripping hard on acid.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.560
 Allegedly, allegedly.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.600
 This is where all the crimes begin.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.120
 He jumps out.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.680
 He gets in his rental car.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.920
 Starts to drive away.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.680
 One of his friends jumps in front of the car

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.920
 to be like, no, no, no, don't do it, don't do it.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.760
 And he ends up trying to hit his friend in the car,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.280
 allegedly.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.000
 And that's the last time I'm going to say allegedly.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.440
 It's all allegedly.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.560
 Tries to hit his friend with the car, misses,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.840
 crashes into the house.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.360
 Can't get the car out.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.520
 Jumps out of the car.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.120
 [HUMMING]

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.960
 He looks.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.320
 And at this point, a local security guard

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.800
 for the subdivision they're staying in is approaching.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.600
 He jumps out of his van, pulls out his little flashlight,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.120
 frees, evildoer.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.000
 Coffee looks at him and goes, evildoer.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.800
 More like-- can't think of anything.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.160
 You think of a catchphrase.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.360
 He starts running towards the security guard.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.000
 Security guard starts running towards them.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.240
 Split screen, two different faces looking at each other.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.800
 This is 100% real.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.720
 Not the split screen.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.720
 That didn't happen.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.840
 But all of these events did.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.960
 Security guard has pepper spray, billy club.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.480
 It doesn't have a gun.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.440
 But coffee doesn't have any weapon at all.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.280
 But he's running.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.800
 And this is insane.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.440
 He sees those little lights that are stuck into the ground,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.160
 like the little solar panel lights

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.640
 that people put around their yards.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.800
 It kind of makes it look nice, I guess.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.920
 But it's these little lanterns that are all over the lawn

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.640
 or along the line of the lawn.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.600
 Does that make sense?

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.720
 But underneath the way they stick into the ground,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.240
 they have a long metal spike.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.640
 They stick them into the ground.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.440
 You don't have to worry about them falling over

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.040
 during rainstorm.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.480
 Now, as beautiful as it may look as a lawn ornament,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.280
 coffee goes, uh-huh.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.600
 It's time to make my point.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.680
 Didn't really say that, but we'll just assume that he did.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.080
 Because he picks one of those things up

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.720
 and stabs the security guard right in the chest so hard,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.960
 the security guard then falls to the ground,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.840
 like a straight up--

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.960
 [GROANING]

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.560
 And the guy's like, whoa, falling back in slow motion.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.640
 Hits the ground.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.560
 Coffee looks over and goes, you light up my life.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560
 And then it lights up.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.060
 No, it's OK.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.040
 So anyway, coffee goes running off.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.200
 And he's happy that he came over that catchphrase.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.720
 He gets into the security guard's car.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.720
 He left it running.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.360
 He's in the ignition.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.280
 Peels off, starts driving through the subdivision.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.000
 It's 8 PM.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.720
 It's 4th of July.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.880
 People are outside of their houses.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.080
 Just hanging out, eating hamburgers,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.280
 throwing sparklers in each other's eyes,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.320
 causing harmless mayhem.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.320
 Coffee had other plans.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.360
 He sees a young couple walking out the street.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.680
 [GROANING]

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.600
 Hits him with the vehicle.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.000
 And then, at that point, you're kind of like, Jason,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.280
 this stopped being a funny action story.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.440
 Now he's just running over bystanders.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.080
 And you would think at that point, he'd be like,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.320
 wait a second, I'm not Jason Bourne anymore.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.400
 I'm actually some sort of horrible terrorist.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.920
 He then sees another young couple walking across the street.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.080
 [GROANING]

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.880
 Hits them too.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.400
 So at this point, it's pandemonium in this neighborhood.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.800
 The police show up.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.840
 Sheriff and CHP--

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.040
 [GROANING]

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.120
 They're like, we need to get these sirens fixed.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.600
 That sounded terrible.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.080
 Cop cars pull up.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.600
 [GROANING]

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.320
 Coffee is driving down the street in his van towards the cops.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.080
 Cop jumps out of his car.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.600
 Stop, stop.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.120
 The car is coming closer and closer and closer.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.080
 Cop's like, stop.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.480
 Stop the car.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.920
 Coffee goes.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.400
 Things are about to get complicated.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.760
 [GROANING]

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.600
 He's gunning it right towards the cop.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.360
 The cop waits until coffee's van actually

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.960
 strikes his vehicle before opening fire,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.080
 hitting him three times, one time in the head,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.120
 putting him in a coma, and paralyzing him from the left

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.040
 side, not left side down.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.280
 It's the left side over, paralyzed.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.680
 Everyone survived.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.600
 So I don't want you to feel bad about--

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.440
 the one of the women who got hit by the car was airlifted out.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.640
 But everyone was survived.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.320
 Probably got a couple broken bones, probably pretty scratched up.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.240
 Dude who got stabbed with the light, survived and everything.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.520
 I'll tell you one thing that didn't survive.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.520
 Coffee's freedom.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.160
 He's facing five counts of assault with a deadly weapon,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.240
 two counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.960
 on an officer, and one count of carjacking

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.640
 because he took the dude's car.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.280
 You'd think it would kind of just be theft.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.680
 But anyways, 32-year-old Stanford graduate,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.240
 software engineer at YouTube, $2.35 million bail

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.920
 for taking four hits of acid.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.720
 But I find that stories like that fascinating.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.960
 We've talked about it before about people just snapping.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.600
 To me, that's the scariest of crimes.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.360
 Like organized crime, stuff like that.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.560
 Like they always have an end result.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.240
 Serial killers, they can't get it up.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.520
 Women intimidate them.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.200
 They're a bunch of just weak, spineless individuals.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.800
 So that's why they kill.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.240
 Their mama was mean to them.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.440
 That's why they kill.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.320
 They can't get it up.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.040
 Their dick doesn't work.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.880
 Organized crime, they're saying, we need money.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.720
 Like this is one of the things we do to keep order

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.880
 is commit these crimes to do these murders.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.560
 But when people just snap,

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.840
 I think that's the scariest thing

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.920
 because it really is unpredictable.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.640
 This dude was probably never on anyone's trouble charts

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.000
 for years and years and years and years.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.720
 And then this happens.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.160
 Now, yes, the four hits of acid did help that,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.820
 but still though, and his life will radically change.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.400
 He'll probably do eight to 10 years,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.160
 plead down 'cause he doesn't have trouble life,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.200
 stuff like that.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.360
 He might do eight to 10 years.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.360
 He's gonna be sued and to oblivion by these people.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.800
 But because of one afternoon, his life has changed forever.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.720
 I find that fascinating.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.320
 And, and he almost murdered multiple people.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.880
 He tried to, allegedly.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.260
 I find that stuff fascinating.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.440
 But anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our next story,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.040
 which actually is a story that I came across,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.720
 both of these stories I came across

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.240
 right after the end of season five.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.880
 There's a couple that popped up and I was like,

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.600
 oh man, but I had to take that break off.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.800
 It really is refreshing for me to take that break off.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.240
 So I'm glad you guys are coming back to the show.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.040
 And yeah, it'll probably be about two weeks.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.240
 I'll be in Sacramento,

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.600
 but we'll be on a regular schedule and all of that.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.940
 So let's go ahead and move on to the story of,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.160
 where'd you go, bro?

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.960
 I saw a movie last night.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.720
 I've been watching a ton of movies on my vacation,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.480
 like I've been doing nothing.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.440
 It was Jersey Shore Shark Attack.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.600
 I will tell you this,

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.320
 and I know a lot of you people will not agree with me.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.040
 It's not a very popular opinion.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.640
 May lose a couple of listeners over it.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.360
 It's Jersey Shore Shark Attack,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.280
 but actually it was pretty good,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.040
 but that's not the unpopular opinion.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.040
 It was a parody of Jersey Shore,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.520
 but a bunch of sharks showed up.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.920
 I think Snooki is hot.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.760
 I know a lot of people think she's trashy.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.640
 I've always had a thing for Snooki.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.000
 And she's one of those women who gets hotter

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.040
 the older she gets.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.440
 Like normally, well, I'm not gonna finish that sentence,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.720
 but Snooki actually is really hot.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.280
 Like now that she's a mom,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.640
 she has like three kids and stuff like that,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.760
 but I actually find her more attractive

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.520
 than when she was like a drunk chick on the boardwalk.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.560
 So good on you Snooki.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.760
 God, I love Snooki.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.800
 So anyways, and they had an actress portraying Snooki,

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.440
 and somehow she was actually even hotter.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.320
 Very distracting movie.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.880
 But anyway, so it was good though.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.480
 Check it out, Jersey Shore Shark Attack.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.400
 It was funny too, which is really hard to pull off.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.800
 Horror comedies are incredibly hard.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.640
 Let's go ahead though and get to our second story

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.360
 for the evening.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.400
 The year is 1963.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.400
 It's February 1st.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.320
 And Thomas Mehan, 41 year old state worker,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.600
 is driving home from Eureka, California

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.000
 to Concord, California.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.520
 Now that's quite a distance.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.360
 It's quite a distance.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.360
 He was on a business trip.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.920
 He had to drive home.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.640
 And he was a prominent member of the community in Concord.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.920
 He was like on the hospital board.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.760
 People knew him.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.960
 He was very, very well liked at work

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.120
 and around town.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.240
 A stable individual if there was one.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.680
 Four hours out from home, he calls his wife and says,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.480
 "You know, I'm not, I don't feel good.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.320
 "Something's wrong with me.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.160
 "I don't feel good."

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.000
 And his wife's like, "Oh honey, just get a hotel somewhere.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.840
 "You'll be fine.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.840
 "You'll be fine."

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.680
 He's like, "That's why.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.600
 "My wife's sound like a creepy goblin all of a sudden."

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.280
 But he ignores that.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.640
 So he goes to the town of Garberville

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.400
 and checks into a hotel around five o'clock,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.040
 around five p.m.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.600
 Nothing suspicious about that.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.280
 Just another businessman traveling

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.880
 through a sleepy little town in California.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.720
 At 6.45, Thomas Mehan walks into

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.000
 the Garberville General Hospital.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.040
 Nurse is like, (smacking gum)

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.640
 smack and gum.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.120
 Yeah, what do you want, Busta?

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.600
 We got a lot of injured people tonight.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.880
 What are you here for?

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.920
 And Thomas goes, (sighs)

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.120
 I feel, I feel dead.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.760
 I feel dead all over was his exact words.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.600
 Nurse goes, "Take a number.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.560
 "Go sit in that other room."

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.720
 Now you may think I'm making a joke.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.520
 She didn't have a, she wasn't from the Jersey Shore,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.880
 but, oh, that'd be hot if she was snooky as a nurse.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.320
 Sexy nurse outfit.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.800
 They were busy.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.520
 And they did say, "Go sit in another room.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.140
 "We'll see you in a bit."

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.960
 And Thomas, just like he had that conversation

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.480
 with the sexy, sexy snooky nurse,

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.680
 and then hung around for a bit, but then left.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.280
 At 7 p.m., so 15 minutes later,

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.640
 two witnesses are driving down the road.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.800
 They're driving down Highway 101

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.640
 and they see a car (car honking)

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.880
 (slamming)

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.840
 go off the road into the brush

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.240
 and where the Eel River is.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.560
 Eel River is this river

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.800
 that cuts through that part of California.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.640
 They call the cops.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.160
 Now again, there's a bit of delay there.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.200
 No one had cell phones back then.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.840
 They go to a pay phone, they call the cops,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.640
 say, "We saw a car go off the side of the road."

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.680
 And cops, of course, are like, "Where's that?

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.800
 "What time did you see the car?"

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.720
 They say, "7 p.m. is when we saw this happen."

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.720
 8 p.m., Thomas Mehan walks back into his motel.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.680
 And the night manager's sitting there

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.120
 filling out some paperwork,

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.900
 and Thomas Mehan walks in.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.900
 And what the manager notices is that his ankles,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.360
 like the pants, his ankle pants,

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.600
 the, what am I trying to say?

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.840
 His pants, his pants from the ankles area.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.760
 I don't know why I'm having such a hard time

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.760
 telling you this.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.640
 His pants were wet, is what I'm trying to say.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.680
 And his shoes were wet.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.200
 And he could hear them going,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.360
 and they're like, "You chewing gum, Misty?"

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.600
 He's like, "Yeah, I got it from Snooki."

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.100
 But that sound you heard

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.720
 was actually my wet, wet shoes

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.680
 walking through your lobby.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.280
 And Thomas Mehan walks up to the manager and goes,

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.280
 this is an exact quote.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.320
 He goes, "Do I seem dead to you?

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.560
 I feel like I'm dead."

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.880
 Managers like, "No, no, you don't.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.400
 I mean, you look, you know, kind of weird."

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.000
 And Thomas Mehan just kind of walks away.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.160
 It's not like a mysterious,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.920
 he just turns like a zombie walks away.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.720
 He also says, "Hey, can you call my wife and conquer?"

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.640
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll take care of you."

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.120
 Conversation doesn't really go anywhere

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.880
 and Thomas Mehan goes to his motel room.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.960
 Anyways, at 9.30,

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.720
 another motel employee goes into his room and says,

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.520
 "Hey, we tried calling your wife and conquered,

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.720
 but there's something wrong with the phone connection.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.880
 We can't get ahold of her."

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.440
 Thomas is like, "Okay, okay."

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.040
 And then that employee says,

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.680
 "We just hadn't talked about the weather for a bit.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.920
 Like it was a normal conversation.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.960
 There was nothing weird about him, except for one detail.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.640
 He was wearing different clothes now.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.200
 He seemed to be wearing like a formal attire,

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.840
 like a black tie suit, black slacks,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.840
 black jacket, white shirt.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.840
 And he goes, "And what was weird is,

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.400
 I didn't really see him come in with any luggage,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.520
 but he was wearing different clothes

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.080
 than we had seen him earlier."

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.680
 And you figure, yeah, his pants were wet,

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.320
 so he's going to change his clothes.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.320
 At 10.45 p.m., the cops are at the river,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.680
 the eel river.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.680
 And they're looking around

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.920
 and they see this car in the river.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.800
 The convertible roof had been ripped open.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.000
 The front end had been damaged.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.760
 So it definitely had gone off the road

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.920
 and impacted into the river.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.680
 It wasn't like under 10 feet of water.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.720
 It was just like poking out of the river and hit something.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.880
 But there was a pair of glasses,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.920
 just reading glasses,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.660
 just neatly folded up and sitting on the passenger seat.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.640
 All this violent action around the car

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.840
 and you have those glasses.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.080
 Cops are like looking around

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.200
 and they're like, "Well, we don't see a body.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.560
 This is weird."

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.520
 And the other guy's like, "Hey, Tommy,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.360
 look over here."

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.960
 Shining the flashlight all dramatically on the ground.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.760
 They see a set of footprints.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.600
 (imitates footsteps)

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.280
 Not magically appear in front of them,

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.720
 but they see a set of footprints in the mud

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.960
 heading up the bank.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.240
 And they're like, "Oh, whoever was in this car accident

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.560
 that happened almost four hours ago,

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.580
 it took us that long to get out here."

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.420
 That's weird.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.660
 Actually, that's a weird detail.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.860
 It took them that long,

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.060
 but we'll get to that.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.900
 That's weird.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.740
 I didn't put that connection.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.780
 Anyways, the cops are out there.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.620
 Oh, you know what?

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.580
 Actually, now that I think about it,

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.260
 the cops probably showed up shortly,

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.980
 but it took them a while to find where the car was.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.820
 I don't know.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.660
 That's kind of weird detail.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.260
 But anyways, so the cops start following the footprints

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.580
 up the bank and they're looking at these muddy footprints

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.980
 leaving from the car up the bank.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.020
 And then they just stop.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.080
 Cops are looking at each other,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.720
 shining their flashlight around, looking through the brush.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.360
 And they see where the ground was still soft.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.360
 They see where there still should have been more footprints,

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.320
 but nothing.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.040
 It was like someone was walking up out of the bank.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.220
 It just vanished.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.520
 That all happened on February 1st,

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.760
 on February 20th, 41 year old Thomas Mehan

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.280
 was found in the eel river, drowned.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.600
 But it just floating around,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.340
 bobbing around on the river.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.540
 Now this story is very twilight zone-ish.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.480
 It's very carnival of souls.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.360
 But what's interesting about it was this was reported on

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.700
 by the Los Angeles Times

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.520
 and I think it was the San Diego Times,

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.400
 it might have been the San Diego Tribune

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.160
 and a couple other newspapers, major newspapers at the time

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.080
 'cause it's such a bizarre story.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.960
 And it's one of those stories that everyone kind of goes,

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.140
 "What? It really makes you scratch your head."

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.500
 Now one thing is clear is that he was some people,

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.120
 he interacted with people in these different locations.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.520
 It was Thomas Mehan's car in the river.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.560
 They knew that from the make and model of the car,

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.720
 registration, things like that.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.680
 That was 100% his car.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.840
 But the people who saw the car go over,

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.040
 they couldn't identify the driver.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.460
 But you had the person at the motel take his payment,

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.120
 have several conversations with Thomas Mehan,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.080
 and then you had the nurse at the hospital,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.680
 Snooki, who identified him as well,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.120
 had to take his information to treat him.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.780
 At both of those locations, he said,

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.460
 "I feel like I'm dead. I feel like I'm dead."

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.500
 And the first time that he was spotted,

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.540
 acting like a big old weirdo,

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.620
 at 645 he walks into the Garber Village General Hospital.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.740
 At 645 he checks in with the nurse and says,

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.780
 "I feel dead. I feel dead all over. Can you treat me?"

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.340
 15 minutes later, his car is spotted going off the road.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.580
 It's possible, yes, Jason,

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.420
 that he left that he was not feeling good.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.580
 He already called his wife and said

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.060
 he was not feeling good.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:04.900
 He went to the hospital,

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.720
 said, "I'm not feeling good."

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.920
 They said, "You're gonna have to wait a bit."

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.560
 He waited a short while, got in his car, drove away,

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.240
 and whatever he wasn't feeling good about,

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.120
 crashed into the river.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.600
 But from the hospital to any point at Eel River,

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.640
 from Garberville to any point at Eel River,

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.320
 it's a 55 minute drive.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.040
 So he would have had to driven incredibly fast

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.340
 to leave the hospital and crash into that river

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.920
 50 minutes later.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.020
 It's nearly an hour away.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.980
 Is that impossible?

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.740
 Could you go 150 miles an hour?

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.420
 Sure, but it's an odd detail.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.380
 You think he would have been seen speeding

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.980
 150 miles an hour before he got in there?

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:45.820
 Odd detail.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:46.660
 The car crashes.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.020
 This was what I thought happened

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.300
 'cause I'm fairly skeptical about a lot of this stuff.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.220
 This was my read on this.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.820
 The car crashes.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.460
 He gets out of the car.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.780
 He starts walking up the bank

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.060
 and then he just stops leaving footprints,

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.380
 not 'cause of any magical thing,

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.440
 but his feet aren't sinking in as much as they were

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.320
 and what the cops had just misidentified the scene.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.920
 He then goes to the hotel.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.400
 I don't think he was feeling good at all.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.280
 He's driving along.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.880
 He starts feeling sick.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.760
 He calls his wife.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.600
 He goes to the hospital.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.440
 He's not feeling good.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.800
 He goes, this isn't worth it.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.960
 He goes to the river.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.120
 Somehow he gets there going 150 miles an hour,

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.840
 crashes into the river and then walks out.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.700
 And when he goes to the hotel, he says,

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.740
 "I still don't feel good,

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.220
 "but I think he's still in shock

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.300
 "that the fact that he got in this car accident."

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.140
 Goes to the hotel.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.060
 His pants are dripping wet.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:38.900
 He goes.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.740
 He changes his clothes.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.260
 And at some point he suffered some sort of brain damage

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.940
 or was not feeling good already

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.660
 plus the horrible car accident.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.180
 At some point he goes, "Oh, crap.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.540
 "My car is in the river

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.980
 "because he's not thinking right."

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.300
 He got some brain damage.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:59.300
 He will then walk back to the car and he drowns.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.280
 Like he's messing around with his car.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.280
 He's trying to pull it out or whatever and he drowns.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.480
 The thing about being skeptical is usually,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.240
 like everything I said,

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.400
 as stupid as a decision it could be,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.920
 are things people would do.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.880
 I.e. taking two extra hits of acid

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.600
 when you're already having a bad trip.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.920
 People do stupid things,

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.480
 especially if you've had a concussion or something.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.800
 He could have walked back to the hotel and then realized,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.640
 "You know what?

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.180
 "I'll go back and pull my car out of the water myself."

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.900
 The problem with that version of events

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.540
 is that he would then have to walk back.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.300
 You would figure that,

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.380
 actually now to think about it,

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.980
 if he, whoa, okay, I didn't think about this.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.260
 If Garberville's 55 minutes away

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.540
 and he drove there in 15 minutes

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.060
 and got in this car accident at 7 p.m.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.700
 At 8 p.m. he comes back to the motel.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.860
 You couldn't, a 55 minute drive,

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.080
 you couldn't walk in 55 minutes, that's impossible.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.560
 And there's no, I didn't see any record of a taxi cab

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.640
 picking this guy up.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.680
 So as a skeptic I thought

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.080
 that it was probably something likely happened.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.640
 But at the same time we also have to say,

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.280
 there are a lot of weird things going on here.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.040
 Let's throw off our skeptic caps

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.520
 and put on our conspiracy caps.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.120
 Guy gets in a car accident.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.120
 This is my conspiracy, not conspiracy theory,

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.400
 this is my paranormal take on it.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.220
 He knew he was going to die.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.780
 His body knew that this was his last night on earth.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.580
 He wasn't feeling good, but it was time to go.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.180
 So he's facing two different things.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.700
 His body is basically saying goodbye to the mortal world.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.580
 'Cause I've always wondered if the day you die,

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.340
 if you know you're going to die.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.300
 We look at people and go,

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.420
 whoa, he was just walking on the street,

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.540
 he got hit by a car.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.260
 But we don't know if that person was like,

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.900
 you know what, just have a feeling I'm gonna die today.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.440
 And for someone who suffers anxiety attacks like I do,

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.680
 that's not a fun thought.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.960
 'Cause I always think I'm going to die every single day.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.040
 But I wonder that.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.600
 So maybe that's the reason why he wasn't feeling good

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.040
 was that he was like, I'm gonna die today.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.120
 And he goes to the hospital

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.120
 'cause he thinks I'm gonna die today.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.040
 And they're like, no, you're lunatic.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.120
 He goes, drives, he gets in the car accident.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.760
 And at that point, he basically splits

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.720
 into his own little multiverse.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.760
 He basically quantum reality or quote,

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.600
 is basically quantum immortality

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.540
 is where you die, you've moved to another universe.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.780
 He just kept moving into the same one.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.380
 I know this is getting really weird.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.280
 He dies in the car accident

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.860
 and his body floats out into the river.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.180
 Okay.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.660
 But his, him, not his spirit,

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.660
 'cause he's walking around signing paychecks

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.500
 and opening doors and stuff like that.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.860
 Him also splits off into the Thomas Mehan

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.260
 who starts walking up the bank of the river.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.800
 But because that's a physical impossibility,

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.940
 everything's like,

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.760
 things are happening that are impossible to happen,

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.100
 i.e. walking a 55 minute drive in and out.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.320
 He appears at the hotel.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.780
 He goes there, do I feel dead?

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.480
 He was already dead at that point.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.400
 And you can make the argument,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.260
 he may have even died of a heart attack

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.480
 way before he even got to Garberville.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.760
 Like he could have been splintering out every single way.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.120
 The fact of the matter is he is dead

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.420
 and people seeing him around town,

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.320
 around the time he should have really been

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.420
 floating down the river face first.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.700
 I know that's kind of a brutal image, but,

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.940
 it really makes you quite,

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.820
 it really makes you question a lot of things.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.160
 That's why I really like this story.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.140
 Because it makes you wonder if you've ever interacted

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.020
 with somebody who's already dead.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.980
 This was a big story

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.940
 because he was such a prominent member of his town.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.600
 The sheriff from Concord drove hours and hours and hours

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.920
 and up with like a team of 20 people to investigate this.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.000
 They wanted to know what happened to their buddy.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.260
 That's why it was such big news.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.200
 But you wonder,

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.440
 you ever go to like a fast food restaurant?

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.120
 You're sitting at a bar.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.120
 There's a kid sitting next to you on the bus.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.840
 And you look over at them and they look normal,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.160
 but there's something a little off about them.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.480
 No, they're not gonna turn to you and say,

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.320
 "Do I look dead?"

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.780
 They don't know you.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:18.060
 They just know they're not having a good day.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.300
 They know that there's something not right

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.000
 in the way they feel today.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.900
 You just kind of sit there and you watch them.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.780
 They just seem to be staring off into the distance.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.620
 Then eventually something catches their eye

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.220
 or they get reminded of something

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.400
 and they stand up and walk away.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.260
 You never see them again.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.180
 They're just a passerby.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.440
 We run into hundreds of people a day in the modern world.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.760
 And it's statistically improbable that this would happen.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.440
 But what if that person was already dead at home,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.580
 sitting in their favorite chair and they passed away?

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.460
 But somehow they're not a ghost.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.600
 They can still interact with the environment.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.760
 They can still talk to people.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.380
 They don't have chains,

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.320
 but they're still able to move about the world

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.960
 for a short amount of time.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.840
 And them not really knowing that they're dead,

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.460
 still interacting with us.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.740
 Do you think that's possible?

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.160
 And if that is possible,

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.320
 who's to say I'm not already dead?

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.800
 And you're listening to a podcast

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.040
 recorded by a corpse.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.700

 You don't have to listen to it every day,

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.240
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.560
 Have a great one, guys.
