00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,400
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,960
 - A fourth of July party turns into a terrifying ordeal

18
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,880
 for all involved.

19
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,920
 And then we take a look at the curious case

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,560
 of Thomas Mayhan, a businessman who left work

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,400
 and was headed home.

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,320
 But he never reached home.

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,600
 He was spotted in three locations around town,

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,160
 and in one of those locations,

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,320
 he was already dead today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,900
 (upbeat music)

27
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:07,960
 - Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,760
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,880
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,720
 I'm having a great day.

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

32
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,600
 Season six starts now.

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,360
 Now you may go, "Hmm, Jason,

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,920
 "the audio quality's a bit different.

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,620
 "I'm on vacation, man.

36
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,680
 "I'm in sunny, sunny California in sunny, sunny Sacramento.

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,920
 "Sac a potatoes, sac a tomato.

38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,760
 "This city that always sleeps."

39
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,320
 So I'm kicking it down here.

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,480
 It's like 97 degrees.

41
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,240
 I'm in an un-air conditioned apartment

42
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,920
 like I normally am because I can't have air conditioners

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,640
 or fans running while I record this show.

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,880
 So if you hear the occasional drip drop

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,800
 that is sweat leaving my body.

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,400
 But we got a lot of good stuff for you today.

47
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,520
 We got two really interesting stories.

48
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,240
 The first story just happened.

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,280
 It actually happened as I basically,

50
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
 while I was recording,

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,000
 the end of season five was on July 4th.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,080
 So this episode basically,

53
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,240
 all of this stuff was transpiring

54
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,320
 while I was messing around.

55
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,040
 And actually it was all transpiring

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,720
 while all of us were watching fireworks

57
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,320
 or sleeping because we're 80 years old.

58
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,520
 But remember what you were doing fourth of July.

59
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,880
 Think about what you were doing fourth of July.

60
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,720
 And now forget that.

61
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,660
 Forget that happened because we are going on an adventure.

62
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,680
 We are going to Bodega Bay.

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,480
 Bodega Bay, little town in California.

64
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,960
 The sunny sunny state.

65
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
 I'm just joking.

66
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,080
 Okay, so anyways, sun's always in California.

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
 Anyway, so I'm surprised there's no conspiracy

68
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,520
 yet about the earthquakes.

69
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,760
 I'm surprised there's no one saying

70
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,680
 that it's the lizard people or,

71
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,660
 I saw someone trying to say that the LA earthquakes

72
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,920
 was a sign that the Yellowstone geyser

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,040
 was going to blow up the planet.

74
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,520
 Not a geyser, it's actually like a super volcano

75
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,120
 under there and it is quite dangerous.

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
 But I'm surprised we don't get more.

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
 I wonder how flat earthers,

78
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,760
 how they explain earthquakes.

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
 Anyways, anyways, I should note to self,

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,960
 look up what maniacs think about natural events.

81
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,600
 Back to Bodega Bay.

82
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,440
 Let's go ahead and get started with the saga of Batai Coffee.

83
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,300
 Batai Coffee is a 32 year old man.

84
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,520
 Stanford graduate, upper crust, upper crust old chum.

85
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,440
 Actually he's born raised in LA.

86
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,560
 But anyways, Batai Coffee is like,

87
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,440
 he's a software engineer at YouTube right now.

88
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,880
 Well, was.

89
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,200
 He wakes up from a coma earlier this week.

90
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
 He wakes up from a coma.

91
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
 He can't move the left side of his body.

92
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,160
 He's like, what happened?

93
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,840
 Sexy nurses are all walking around taking his temperature,

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,880
 like filling out charts, a little short nurse skirts.

95
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,560
 And they're like, oh, the patient's awake.

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
 This is my dream hospital.

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,080
 Not this guy, this guy doesn't need to be there.

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,560
 But bunch of sexy nurses are like,

99
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,440
 oh, let's go get a doctor.

100
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,760
 Doctor comes in, sexy female doctor.

101
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,560
 Even shorter skirt, I didn't even know it was possible.

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,560
 She comes in, she goes, Mr. Coffee, you're awake.

103
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,120
 And he's like, what happened?

104
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,640
 What happened to me?

105
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,560
 She goes, well, first off, everything we're about to talk

106
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,280
 about is alleged.

107
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,880
 And secondly, everything we're about to talk about is true.

108
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,160
 And it's alleged in the sense that everything that happened,

109
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,760
 like the first part, is true.

110
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,560
 But it's alleged whether or not coffee did it.

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,480
 And coffee's like, what does any of that

112
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,160
 have to do with my medical condition?

113
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,200
 I want to know why I can't move the left side of my body.

114
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,960
 And sexy doctor turns back away from the camera and goes,

115
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,200
 well, Mr. Coffee, I think the police should explain to you

116
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,880
 what happened.

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,680
 Maybe you can answer a few questions.

118
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,720
 She gives a sexy wink at us as she walks out

119
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,480
 of the hospital room.

120
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,400
 So here's what happened.

121
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,080
 That was our little intro for the day.

122
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,480
 Here's what happened.

123
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,920
 Coffee, 32-year-old Petite Coffee, software engineer

124
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,840
 for YouTube, Stanford educated, good old chum, cream

125
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,000
 of the crop of American society, is hanging out with five

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,160
 of his buddies in Bodega Bay.

127
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
 They rented a place so they could spend

128
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,400
 Fourth of July all the weekend partying at this house.

129
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,040
 Now, I don't know.

130
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,920
 I party.

131
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,040
 I'll kick it with a couple friends, drink a couple beers.

132
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,720
 If that.

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,640
 Usually I just hang out and talk about magic the gathering.

134
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,960
 But these guys said, nah, nah, we're not none of those plebs.

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,120
 We're not any of those working class that drinks Budweiser.

136
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,840
 Let's drop acid.

137
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
 Taking it up a level, I guess.

138
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,480
 But anyways, they decide to drop acid.

139
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,880
 Now, I know a lot of my listeners do acid.

140
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,880
 Not a sizable amount.

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,760
 But I know a lot of people have experimented with it.

142
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,680
 I don't mess with hallucinogens.

143
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,160
 I already see ghosts flying around me.

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
 Not all the time.

145
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,720
 I'm not a lunatic.

146
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,680
 But the line is so thin where if I saw a goblin just appear,

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,360
 I'd be like, oh my god, that goblin's real.

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
 So I don't want to take a drug that's

149
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,080
 going to increase the likelihood of goblins appearing in front of me.

150
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,200
 So they decide to drop acid.

151
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,080
 Now, I'm assuming it wasn't their first time.

152
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,360
 Maybe it was.

153
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,520
 But I'm assuming it wasn't.

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,480
 Now, they all decide to take half a tab of acid.

155
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,480
 Except for coffee, because coffee is an overachiever.

156
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,080
 Stanford graduate, software engineer at YouTube.

157
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,120
 He takes two hits of acid.

158
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,960
 He's like, oh, good old chums, you don't understand.

159
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,760
 Acid is what you Americans-- he's American too.

160
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,280
 I don't know.

161
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,680
 I just imagine him very posh, because Stanford graduate, right?

162
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,320
 I graduated from community college.

163
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,240
 So anyone who graduated from college is posh.

164
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,360
 Anyways, he goes, I'm going to take two hits of acid.

165
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,000
 I'm going to do better than all you guys, just

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,840
 like I did better than you guys on the SATs.

167
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,560
 And they're like, dude, we all have the same job.

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
 You don't have to be injured.

169
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,400
 So they're partying.

170
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,080
 Now, at 3 PM-- so they started pre-gaming really, really early.

171
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,960
 At 3 PM, coffee starts freaking out.

172
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,840
 He's like, oh, man, I don't know what happened, old chum.

173
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,640
 Oh, I don't know.

174
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,440
 It could be the four times amount of acid I took over you guys.

175
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,520
 And they're like, yeah, probably.

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,320
 About an hour later, he goes, oh, old bean.

177
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,040
 I don't know what's going on.

178
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,760
 He looks at his friend.

179
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,520
 He's actually an old bean.

180
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,520
 He's like, oh, I don't know what's going on.

181
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,040
 I need to study myself.

182
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,600
 I need to study myself.

183
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,760
 And he takes two more hits of acid.

184
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,120
 He's already having a bad trip.

185
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,920
 Takes two more hits of acid.

186
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,640
 His friends are like, don't do that, dude.

187
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,760
 Like, that was the wrong move.

188
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,240
 And he's like, oh, don't tell me what to do talking watermelon.

189
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,680
 I'll take all the acid I want.

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,160
 Now, that happened at around 4, between 4 and 5 PM.

191
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,240
 He takes the two additional hits of acid.

192
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,640
 At 8 PM, fireworks are going off.

193
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,520
 Kids are poking each other with sparklers.

194
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,160
 Dogs are terrified.

195
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
 It's a great quarter of July.

196
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 He wants to leave the house.

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,760
 He wants to leave.

198
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,520
 And they're like, dude, you are in no condition to leave the house.

199
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,920
 Friends won't let him.

200
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,560
 And then, like, that, our fake British pal, our Stanford graduate,

201
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,960
 turns into Jason Bourne.

202
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,360
 Now, this is where, first off, you're thinking, oh, Jason,

203
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,000
 a guy who's getting taken a bunch of acid.

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,880
 He's going to end up running around street naked.

205
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,760
 This guy turns into an action hero, or more likely an action

206
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,080
 villain because of what happens.

207
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
 This is why Kofi ended up in the hospital,

208
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,640
 paralyzed on the left side of his body,

209
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,920
 surrounded by sexy medical staff.

210
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
 First off, so he's surrounded by his friends,

211
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,520
 and they're like, come on, Kofi, settle down.

212
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
 You can't go anywhere.

213
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,200
 He punches the woman in the chest, picks up a pencil,

214
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,800
 stabs another one of his friends,

215
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,320
 and another dude climbs on top of him.

216
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
 He starts choking him while punching

217
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,640
 another man in the face.

218
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,400
 So within a second, he's taken out four people.

219
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,440
 He takes off outside the house.

220
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,240
 Action music playing in his head because he's

221
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,160
 tripping hard on acid.

222
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,560
 Allegedly, allegedly.

223
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,600
 This is where all the crimes begin.

224
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,120
 He jumps out.

225
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,680
 He gets in his rental car.

226
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,920
 Starts to drive away.

227
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,680
 One of his friends jumps in front of the car

228
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,920
 to be like, no, no, no, don't do it, don't do it.

229
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,760
 And he ends up trying to hit his friend in the car,

230
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,280
 allegedly.

231
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,000
 And that's the last time I'm going to say allegedly.

232
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,440
 It's all allegedly.

233
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,560
 Tries to hit his friend with the car, misses,

234
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,840
 crashes into the house.

235
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,360
 Can't get the car out.

236
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,520
 Jumps out of the car.

237
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,120
 [HUMMING]

238
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,960
 He looks.

239
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,320
 And at this point, a local security guard

240
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,800
 for the subdivision they're staying in is approaching.

241
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,600
 He jumps out of his van, pulls out his little flashlight,

242
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,120
 frees, evildoer.

243
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
 Coffee looks at him and goes, evildoer.

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,800
 More like-- can't think of anything.

245
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,160
 You think of a catchphrase.

246
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,360
 He starts running towards the security guard.

247
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,000
 Security guard starts running towards them.

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,240
 Split screen, two different faces looking at each other.

249
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,800
 This is 100% real.

250
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,720
 Not the split screen.

251
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
 That didn't happen.

252
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,840
 But all of these events did.

253
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,960
 Security guard has pepper spray, billy club.

254
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,480
 It doesn't have a gun.

255
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,440
 But coffee doesn't have any weapon at all.

256
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,280
 But he's running.

257
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,800
 And this is insane.

258
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,440
 He sees those little lights that are stuck into the ground,

259
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,160
 like the little solar panel lights

260
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,640
 that people put around their yards.

261
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,800
 It kind of makes it look nice, I guess.

262
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,920
 But it's these little lanterns that are all over the lawn

263
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,640
 or along the line of the lawn.

264
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,600
 Does that make sense?

265
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,720
 But underneath the way they stick into the ground,

266
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,240
 they have a long metal spike.

267
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,640
 They stick them into the ground.

268
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,440
 You don't have to worry about them falling over

269
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,040
 during rainstorm.

270
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,480
 Now, as beautiful as it may look as a lawn ornament,

271
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,280
 coffee goes, uh-huh.

272
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,600
 It's time to make my point.

273
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,680
 Didn't really say that, but we'll just assume that he did.

274
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,080
 Because he picks one of those things up

275
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,720
 and stabs the security guard right in the chest so hard,

276
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,960
 the security guard then falls to the ground,

277
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,840
 like a straight up--

278
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
 [GROANING]

279
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,560
 And the guy's like, whoa, falling back in slow motion.

280
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,640
 Hits the ground.

281
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,560
 Coffee looks over and goes, you light up my life.

282
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
 And then it lights up.

283
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,060
 No, it's OK.

284
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,040
 So anyway, coffee goes running off.

285
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,200
 And he's happy that he came over that catchphrase.

286
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,720
 He gets into the security guard's car.

287
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
 He left it running.

288
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,360
 He's in the ignition.

289
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,280
 Peels off, starts driving through the subdivision.

290
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,000
 It's 8 PM.

291
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,720
 It's 4th of July.

292
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,880
 People are outside of their houses.

293
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,080
 Just hanging out, eating hamburgers,

294
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,280
 throwing sparklers in each other's eyes,

295
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,320
 causing harmless mayhem.

296
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
 Coffee had other plans.

297
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,360
 He sees a young couple walking out the street.

298
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,680
 [GROANING]

299
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,600
 Hits him with the vehicle.

300
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,000
 And then, at that point, you're kind of like, Jason,

301
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,280
 this stopped being a funny action story.

302
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,440
 Now he's just running over bystanders.

303
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,080
 And you would think at that point, he'd be like,

304
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,320
 wait a second, I'm not Jason Bourne anymore.

305
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,400
 I'm actually some sort of horrible terrorist.

306
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,920
 He then sees another young couple walking across the street.

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,080

308
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,880
 Hits them too.

309
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,400
 So at this point, it's pandemonium in this neighborhood.

310
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,800
 The police show up.

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,840

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
 That sounded terrible.

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,080

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920

 strikes his vehicle before opening fire,

 side, not left side down.

 the one of the women who got hit by the car was airlifted out.

 He's facing five counts of assault with a deadly weapon,

 two counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault

343
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,960
 on an officer, and one count of carjacking

344
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,640
 because he took the dude's car.

345
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,280
 You'd think it would kind of just be theft.

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,680
 But anyways, 32-year-old Stanford graduate,

347
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,240
 software engineer at YouTube, $2.35 million bail

348
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,920
 for taking four hits of acid.

349
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,720
 But I find that stories like that fascinating.

350

 We've talked about it before about people just snapping.

 To me, that's the scariest of crimes.

 Like organized crime, stuff like that.

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,560
 Like they always have an end result.

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,800
 So that's why they kill.

358
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,240
 Their mama was mean to them.

359
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,440
 That's why they kill.

360
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,320
 They can't get it up.

361
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,040
 Their dick doesn't work.

362
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,880
 Organized crime, they're saying, we need money.

363
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,720
 Like this is one of the things we do to keep order

364
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,880
 is commit these crimes to do these murders.

365
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,560
 But when people just snap,

366
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,840
 I think that's the scariest thing

367
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,920
 because it really is unpredictable.

368
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,640
 This dude was probably never on anyone's trouble charts

369
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,000
 for years and years and years and years.

370
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,720
 And then this happens.

371
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,160
 Now, yes, the four hits of acid did help that,

372
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,820
 but still though, and his life will radically change.

373
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,400
 He'll probably do eight to 10 years,

374
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,160
 plead down 'cause he doesn't have trouble life,

375
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,200
 stuff like that.

376
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,360
 He might do eight to 10 years.

377
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
 He's gonna be sued and to oblivion by these people.

378
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,800
 But because of one afternoon, his life has changed forever.

379
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,720
 I find that fascinating.

380
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,320
 And, and he almost murdered multiple people.

381
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,880
 He tried to, allegedly.

382
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,260
 I find that stuff fascinating.

383
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,440
 But anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our next story,

384
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,040
 which actually is a story that I came across,

385
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,720
 both of these stories I came across

386
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,240
 right after the end of season five.

387
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,880
 There's a couple that popped up and I was like,

388
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,600
 oh man, but I had to take that break off.

389
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,800
 It really is refreshing for me to take that break off.

390
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,240
 So I'm glad you guys are coming back to the show.

391
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,040
 And yeah, it'll probably be about two weeks.

392
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,240
 I'll be in Sacramento,

393
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,600
 but we'll be on a regular schedule and all of that.

394
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,940
 So let's go ahead and move on to the story of,

395
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,160
 where'd you go, bro?

396
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,960
 I saw a movie last night.

397
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,720
 I've been watching a ton of movies on my vacation,

398
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,480
 like I've been doing nothing.

399
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,440
 It was Jersey Shore Shark Attack.

400
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,600
 I will tell you this,

401
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,320
 and I know a lot of you people will not agree with me.

402
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,040
 It's not a very popular opinion.

403
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,640
 May lose a couple of listeners over it.

404
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,360
 It's Jersey Shore Shark Attack,

405
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,280
 but actually it was pretty good,

406
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,040
 but that's not the unpopular opinion.

407
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
 It was a parody of Jersey Shore,

408
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,520
 but a bunch of sharks showed up.

409
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,920
 I think Snooki is hot.

410
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,760
 I know a lot of people think she's trashy.

411
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,640
 I've always had a thing for Snooki.

412
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,000
 And she's one of those women who gets hotter

413
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,040
 the older she gets.

414
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,440
 Like normally, well, I'm not gonna finish that sentence,

415
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,720
 but Snooki actually is really hot.

416
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,280
 Like now that she's a mom,

417
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,640
 she has like three kids and stuff like that,

418
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,760
 but I actually find her more attractive

419
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,520
 than when she was like a drunk chick on the boardwalk.

420
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,560
 So good on you Snooki.

421
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,760
 God, I love Snooki.

422
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,800
 So anyways, and they had an actress portraying Snooki,

423
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,440
 and somehow she was actually even hotter.

424
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,320
 Very distracting movie.

425
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,880
 But anyway, so it was good though.

426
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,480
 Check it out, Jersey Shore Shark Attack.

427
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,400
 It was funny too, which is really hard to pull off.

428
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,800
 Horror comedies are incredibly hard.

429
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,640
 Let's go ahead though and get to our second story

430
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,360
 for the evening.

431
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,400
 The year is 1963.

432
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
 It's February 1st.

433
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,320
 And Thomas Mehan, 41 year old state worker,

434
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,600
 is driving home from Eureka, California

435
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,000
 to Concord, California.

436
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,520
 Now that's quite a distance.

437
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,360
 It's quite a distance.

438
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
 He was on a business trip.

439
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,920
 He had to drive home.

440
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,640
 And he was a prominent member of the community in Concord.

441
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,920
 He was like on the hospital board.

442
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,760
 People knew him.

443
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,960
 He was very, very well liked at work

444
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,120
 and around town.

445
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,240
 A stable individual if there was one.

446
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,680
 Four hours out from home, he calls his wife and says,

447
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,480
 "You know, I'm not, I don't feel good.

448
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,320
 "Something's wrong with me.

449
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,160
 "I don't feel good."

450
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
 And his wife's like, "Oh honey, just get a hotel somewhere.

451
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,840
 "You'll be fine.

452
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
 "You'll be fine."

453
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,680
 He's like, "That's why.

454
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,600
 "My wife's sound like a creepy goblin all of a sudden."

455
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,280
 But he ignores that.

456
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,640
 So he goes to the town of Garberville

457
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,400
 and checks into a hotel around five o'clock,

458
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,040
 around five p.m.

459
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,600
 Nothing suspicious about that.

460
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,280
 Just another businessman traveling

461
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,880
 through a sleepy little town in California.

462
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,720
 At 6.45, Thomas Mehan walks into

463
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,000
 the Garberville General Hospital.

464
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,040
 Nurse is like, (smacking gum)

465
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,640
 smack and gum.

466
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,120
 Yeah, what do you want, Busta?

467
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,600
 We got a lot of injured people tonight.

468
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,880
 What are you here for?

469
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,920
 And Thomas goes, (sighs)

470
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,120
 I feel, I feel dead.

471
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,760
 I feel dead all over was his exact words.

472
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
 Nurse goes, "Take a number.

473
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,560
 "Go sit in that other room."

474
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,720
 Now you may think I'm making a joke.

475
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,520
 She didn't have a, she wasn't from the Jersey Shore,

476
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,880
 but, oh, that'd be hot if she was snooky as a nurse.

477
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,320
 Sexy nurse outfit.

478
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,800
 They were busy.

479
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,520
 And they did say, "Go sit in another room.

480
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,140
 "We'll see you in a bit."

481
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,960
 And Thomas, just like he had that conversation

482
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,480
 with the sexy, sexy snooky nurse,

483
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,680
 and then hung around for a bit, but then left.

484
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,280
 At 7 p.m., so 15 minutes later,

485
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,640
 two witnesses are driving down the road.

486
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,800
 They're driving down Highway 101

487
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,640
 and they see a car (car honking)

488
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,880
 (slamming)

489
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,840
 go off the road into the brush

490
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,240
 and where the Eel River is.

491
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,560
 Eel River is this river

492
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,800
 that cuts through that part of California.

493
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,640
 They call the cops.

494
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,160
 Now again, there's a bit of delay there.

495
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,200
 No one had cell phones back then.

496
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,840
 They go to a pay phone, they call the cops,

497
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,640
 say, "We saw a car go off the side of the road."

498
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,680
 And cops, of course, are like, "Where's that?

499
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,800
 "What time did you see the car?"

500
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,720
 They say, "7 p.m. is when we saw this happen."

501
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 8 p.m., Thomas Mehan walks back into his motel.

502
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,680
 And the night manager's sitting there

503
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,120
 filling out some paperwork,

504
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,900
 and Thomas Mehan walks in.

505
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,900
 And what the manager notices is that his ankles,

506
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,360
 like the pants, his ankle pants,

507
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,600
 the, what am I trying to say?

508
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,840
 His pants, his pants from the ankles area.

509
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,760
 I don't know why I'm having such a hard time

510
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
 telling you this.

511
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,640
 His pants were wet, is what I'm trying to say.

512
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,680
 And his shoes were wet.

513
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,200
 And he could hear them going,

514
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,360
 and they're like, "You chewing gum, Misty?"

515
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,600
 He's like, "Yeah, I got it from Snooki."

516
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,100
 But that sound you heard

517
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,720
 was actually my wet, wet shoes

518
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,680
 walking through your lobby.

519
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,280
 And Thomas Mehan walks up to the manager and goes,

520
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
 this is an exact quote.

521
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,320
 He goes, "Do I seem dead to you?

522
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,560
 I feel like I'm dead."

523
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,880
 Managers like, "No, no, you don't.

524
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,400
 I mean, you look, you know, kind of weird."

525
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
 And Thomas Mehan just kind of walks away.

526
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,160
 It's not like a mysterious,

527
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,920
 he just turns like a zombie walks away.

528
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,720
 He also says, "Hey, can you call my wife and conquer?"

529
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,640
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll take care of you."

530
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,120
 Conversation doesn't really go anywhere

531
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,880
 and Thomas Mehan goes to his motel room.

532
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,960
 Anyways, at 9.30,

533
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,720
 another motel employee goes into his room and says,

534
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,520
 "Hey, we tried calling your wife and conquered,

535
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,720
 but there's something wrong with the phone connection.

536
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,880
 We can't get ahold of her."

537
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,440
 Thomas is like, "Okay, okay."

538
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,040
 And then that employee says,

539
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,680
 "We just hadn't talked about the weather for a bit.

540
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,920
 Like it was a normal conversation.

541
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,960
 There was nothing weird about him, except for one detail.

542
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
 He was wearing different clothes now.

543
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,200
 He seemed to be wearing like a formal attire,

544
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,840
 like a black tie suit, black slacks,

545
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
 black jacket, white shirt.

546
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
 And he goes, "And what was weird is,

547
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,400
 I didn't really see him come in with any luggage,

548
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,520
 but he was wearing different clothes

549
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,080
 than we had seen him earlier."

550
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,680
 And you figure, yeah, his pants were wet,

551
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,320
 so he's going to change his clothes.

552
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,320
 At 10.45 p.m., the cops are at the river,

553
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,680
 the eel river.

554
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
 And they're looking around

555
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,920
 and they see this car in the river.

556
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,800
 The convertible roof had been ripped open.

557
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,000
 The front end had been damaged.

558
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
 So it definitely had gone off the road

559
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,920
 and impacted into the river.

560
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,680
 It wasn't like under 10 feet of water.

561
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,720
 It was just like poking out of the river and hit something.

562
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,880
 But there was a pair of glasses,

563
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,920
 just reading glasses,

564
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,660
 just neatly folded up and sitting on the passenger seat.

565
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,640
 All this violent action around the car

566
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,840
 and you have those glasses.

567
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,080
 Cops are like looking around

568
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,200
 and they're like, "Well, we don't see a body.

569
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,560
 This is weird."

570
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,520
 And the other guy's like, "Hey, Tommy,

571
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,360
 look over here."

572
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,960
 Shining the flashlight all dramatically on the ground.

573
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,760
 They see a set of footprints.

574
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
 (imitates footsteps)

575
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,280
 Not magically appear in front of them,

576
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,720
 but they see a set of footprints in the mud

577
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,960
 heading up the bank.

578
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,240
 And they're like, "Oh, whoever was in this car accident

579
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,560
 that happened almost four hours ago,

580
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,580
 it took us that long to get out here."

581
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,420
 That's weird.

582
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,660
 Actually, that's a weird detail.

583
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,860
 It took them that long,

584
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,060
 but we'll get to that.

585
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,900
 That's weird.

586
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,740
 I didn't put that connection.

587
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,780
 Anyways, the cops are out there.

588
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,620
 Oh, you know what?

589
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,580
 Actually, now that I think about it,

590
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,260
 the cops probably showed up shortly,

591
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,980
 but it took them a while to find where the car was.

592
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,820
 I don't know.

593
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,660
 That's kind of weird detail.

594
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,260
 But anyways, so the cops start following the footprints

595
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,580
 up the bank and they're looking at these muddy footprints

596
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,980
 leaving from the car up the bank.

597
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,020
 And then they just stop.

598
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,080
 Cops are looking at each other,

599
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,720
 shining their flashlight around, looking through the brush.

600
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,360
 And they see where the ground was still soft.

601
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,360
 They see where there still should have been more footprints,

602
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,320
 but nothing.

603
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,040
 It was like someone was walking up out of the bank.

604
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,220
 It just vanished.

605
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,520
 That all happened on February 1st,

606
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,760
 on February 20th, 41 year old Thomas Mehan

607
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,280
 was found in the eel river, drowned.

608
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,600
 But it just floating around,

609
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,340
 bobbing around on the river.

610
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,540
 Now this story is very twilight zone-ish.

611
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,480
 It's very carnival of souls.

612
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,360
 But what's interesting about it was this was reported on

613
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,700
 by the Los Angeles Times

614
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,520
 and I think it was the San Diego Times,

615
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,400
 it might have been the San Diego Tribune

616
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,160
 and a couple other newspapers, major newspapers at the time

617
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,080
 'cause it's such a bizarre story.

618
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,960
 And it's one of those stories that everyone kind of goes,

619
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,140
 "What? It really makes you scratch your head."

620
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,500
 Now one thing is clear is that he was some people,

621
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,120
 he interacted with people in these different locations.

622
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,520
 It was Thomas Mehan's car in the river.

623
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,560
 They knew that from the make and model of the car,

624
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,720
 registration, things like that.

625
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,680
 That was 100% his car.

626
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,840
 But the people who saw the car go over,

627
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,040
 they couldn't identify the driver.

628
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,460
 But you had the person at the motel take his payment,

629
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,120
 have several conversations with Thomas Mehan,

630
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,080
 and then you had the nurse at the hospital,

631
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,680
 Snooki, who identified him as well,

632
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,120
 had to take his information to treat him.

633
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,780
 At both of those locations, he said,

634
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,460
 "I feel like I'm dead. I feel like I'm dead."

635
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,500
 And the first time that he was spotted,

636
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,540
 acting like a big old weirdo,

637
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,620
 at 645 he walks into the Garber Village General Hospital.

638
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,740
 At 645 he checks in with the nurse and says,

639
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,780
 "I feel dead. I feel dead all over. Can you treat me?"

640
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,340
 15 minutes later, his car is spotted going off the road.

641
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,580
 It's possible, yes, Jason,

642
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,420
 that he left that he was not feeling good.

643
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,580
 He already called his wife and said

644
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,060
 he was not feeling good.

645
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,900
 He went to the hospital,

646
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,720
 said, "I'm not feeling good."

647
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,920
 They said, "You're gonna have to wait a bit."

648
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,560
 He waited a short while, got in his car, drove away,

649
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,240
 and whatever he wasn't feeling good about,

650
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,120
 crashed into the river.

651
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,600
 But from the hospital to any point at Eel River,

652
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,640
 from Garberville to any point at Eel River,

653
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,320
 it's a 55 minute drive.

654
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,040
 So he would have had to driven incredibly fast

655
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,340
 to leave the hospital and crash into that river

656
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,920
 50 minutes later.

657
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,020
 It's nearly an hour away.

658
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,980
 Is that impossible?

659
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,740
 Could you go 150 miles an hour?

660
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,420
 Sure, but it's an odd detail.

661
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,380
 You think he would have been seen speeding

662
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,980
 150 miles an hour before he got in there?

663
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,820
 Odd detail.

664
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,660
 The car crashes.

665
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,020
 This was what I thought happened

666
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,300
 'cause I'm fairly skeptical about a lot of this stuff.

667
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,220
 This was my read on this.

668
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,820
 The car crashes.

669
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,460
 He gets out of the car.

670
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,780
 He starts walking up the bank

671
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,060
 and then he just stops leaving footprints,

672
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,380
 not 'cause of any magical thing,

673
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,440
 but his feet aren't sinking in as much as they were

674
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,320
 and what the cops had just misidentified the scene.

675
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,920
 He then goes to the hotel.

676
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,400
 I don't think he was feeling good at all.

677
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,280
 He's driving along.

678
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,880
 He starts feeling sick.

679
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,760
 He calls his wife.

680
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,600
 He goes to the hospital.

681
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,440
 He's not feeling good.

682
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,800
 He goes, this isn't worth it.

683
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,960
 He goes to the river.

684
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,120
 Somehow he gets there going 150 miles an hour,

685
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,840
 crashes into the river and then walks out.

686
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,700
 And when he goes to the hotel, he says,

687
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,740
 "I still don't feel good,

688
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,220
 "but I think he's still in shock

689
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,300
 "that the fact that he got in this car accident."

690
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,140
 Goes to the hotel.

691
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,060
 His pants are dripping wet.

692
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,900
 He goes.

693
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,740
 He changes his clothes.

694
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,260
 And at some point he suffered some sort of brain damage

695
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,940
 or was not feeling good already

696
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,660
 plus the horrible car accident.

697
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,180
 At some point he goes, "Oh, crap.

698
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,540
 "My car is in the river

699
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,980
 "because he's not thinking right."

700
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,300
 He got some brain damage.

701
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,300
 He will then walk back to the car and he drowns.

702
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,280
 Like he's messing around with his car.

703
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,280
 He's trying to pull it out or whatever and he drowns.

704
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,480
 The thing about being skeptical is usually,

705
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,240
 like everything I said,

706
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,400
 as stupid as a decision it could be,

707
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,920
 are things people would do.

708
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,880
 I.e. taking two extra hits of acid

709
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,600
 when you're already having a bad trip.

710
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,920
 People do stupid things,

711
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,480
 especially if you've had a concussion or something.

712
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,800
 He could have walked back to the hotel and then realized,

713
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,640
 "You know what?

714
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,180
 "I'll go back and pull my car out of the water myself."

715
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,900
 The problem with that version of events

716
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,540
 is that he would then have to walk back.

717
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,300
 You would figure that,

718
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,380
 actually now to think about it,

719
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,980
 if he, whoa, okay, I didn't think about this.

720
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,260
 If Garberville's 55 minutes away

721
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,540
 and he drove there in 15 minutes

722
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,060
 and got in this car accident at 7 p.m.

723
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,700
 At 8 p.m. he comes back to the motel.

724
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,860
 You couldn't, a 55 minute drive,

725
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,080
 you couldn't walk in 55 minutes, that's impossible.

726
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,560
 And there's no, I didn't see any record of a taxi cab

727
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,640
 picking this guy up.

728
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,680
 So as a skeptic I thought

729
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,080
 that it was probably something likely happened.

730
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,640
 But at the same time we also have to say,

731
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,280
 there are a lot of weird things going on here.

732
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,040
 Let's throw off our skeptic caps

733
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,520
 and put on our conspiracy caps.

734
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
 Guy gets in a car accident.

735
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,120
 This is my conspiracy, not conspiracy theory,

736
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,400
 this is my paranormal take on it.

737
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,220
 He knew he was going to die.

738
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,780
 His body knew that this was his last night on earth.

739
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,580
 He wasn't feeling good, but it was time to go.

740
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,180
 So he's facing two different things.

741
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,700
 His body is basically saying goodbye to the mortal world.

742
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,580
 'Cause I've always wondered if the day you die,

743
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,340
 if you know you're going to die.

744
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,300
 We look at people and go,

745
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,420
 whoa, he was just walking on the street,

746
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,540
 he got hit by a car.

747
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,260
 But we don't know if that person was like,

748
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,900
 you know what, just have a feeling I'm gonna die today.

749
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,440
 And for someone who suffers anxiety attacks like I do,

750
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,680
 that's not a fun thought.

751
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,960
 'Cause I always think I'm going to die every single day.

752
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,040
 But I wonder that.

753
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,600
 So maybe that's the reason why he wasn't feeling good

754
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,040
 was that he was like, I'm gonna die today.

755
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,120
 And he goes to the hospital

756
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
 'cause he thinks I'm gonna die today.

757
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,040
 And they're like, no, you're lunatic.

758
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,120
 He goes, drives, he gets in the car accident.

759
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,760
 And at that point, he basically splits

760
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,720
 into his own little multiverse.

761
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,760
 He basically quantum reality or quote,

762
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,600
 is basically quantum immortality

763
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,540
 is where you die, you've moved to another universe.

764
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,780
 He just kept moving into the same one.

765
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,380
 I know this is getting really weird.

766
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,280
 He dies in the car accident

767
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,860
 and his body floats out into the river.

768
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,180
 Okay.

769
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,660
 But his, him, not his spirit,

770
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,660
 'cause he's walking around signing paychecks

771
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,500
 and opening doors and stuff like that.

772
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,860
 Him also splits off into the Thomas Mehan

773
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,260
 who starts walking up the bank of the river.

774
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,800
 But because that's a physical impossibility,

775
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,940
 everything's like,

776
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,760
 things are happening that are impossible to happen,

777
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,100
 i.e. walking a 55 minute drive in and out.

778
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,320
 He appears at the hotel.

779
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,780
 He goes there, do I feel dead?

780
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,480
 He was already dead at that point.

781
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,400
 And you can make the argument,

782
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,260
 he may have even died of a heart attack

783
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,480
 way before he even got to Garberville.

784
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,760
 Like he could have been splintering out every single way.

785
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,120
 The fact of the matter is he is dead

786
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,420
 and people seeing him around town,

787
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,320
 around the time he should have really been

788
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,420
 floating down the river face first.

789
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,700
 I know that's kind of a brutal image, but,

790
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,940
 it really makes you quite,

791
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,820
 it really makes you question a lot of things.

792
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,160
 That's why I really like this story.

793
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,140
 Because it makes you wonder if you've ever interacted

794
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,020
 with somebody who's already dead.

795
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,980
 This was a big story

796
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,940
 because he was such a prominent member of his town.

797
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,600
 The sheriff from Concord drove hours and hours and hours

798
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,920
 and up with like a team of 20 people to investigate this.

799
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,000
 They wanted to know what happened to their buddy.

800
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,260
 That's why it was such big news.

801
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,200
 But you wonder,

802
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
 you ever go to like a fast food restaurant?

803
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,120
 You're sitting at a bar.

804
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,120
 There's a kid sitting next to you on the bus.

805
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,840
 And you look over at them and they look normal,

806
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,160
 but there's something a little off about them.

807
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,480
 No, they're not gonna turn to you and say,

808
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,320
 "Do I look dead?"

809
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,780
 They don't know you.

810
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,060
 They just know they're not having a good day.

811
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,300
 They know that there's something not right

812
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,000
 in the way they feel today.

813
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,900
 You just kind of sit there and you watch them.

814
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,780
 They just seem to be staring off into the distance.

815
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,620
 Then eventually something catches their eye

816
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,220
 or they get reminded of something

817
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,400
 and they stand up and walk away.

818
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,260
 You never see them again.

819
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,180
 They're just a passerby.

820
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,440
 We run into hundreds of people a day in the modern world.

821
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,760
 And it's statistically improbable that this would happen.

822
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,440
 But what if that person was already dead at home,

823
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,580
 sitting in their favorite chair and they passed away?

824
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,460
 But somehow they're not a ghost.

825
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,600
 They can still interact with the environment.

826
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,760
 They can still talk to people.

827
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,380
 They don't have chains,

828
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,320
 but they're still able to move about the world

829
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,960
 for a short amount of time.

830
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,840
 And them not really knowing that they're dead,

831
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,460
 still interacting with us.

832
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,740
 Do you think that's possible?

833
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,160
 And if that is possible,

834
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,320
 who's to say I'm not already dead?

835
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,800
 And you're listening to a podcast

836
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,040
