00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 They truly are like family to us.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.680
 When a young man sees a ghost standing in his living room,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680
 he realizes ghosts are real.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 I guess ghosts really do exist.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 But this one has a twist.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 And then we traveled to Pennsylvania to meet a young man

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 who is tasked with trying to complete an impossible task,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.680
 set up a computer for an elderly couple,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 and then teach them how to use it.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.680
 While this man may be braver than most of us,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 his courage is truly put to the test when he comes face-to-face

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.680
 with an insectoid today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 [music]

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.680
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.680
 Hope you guys are having great day, too.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.680
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680
 We got a lot of stuff to cover,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.680
 so we're gonna get started right away.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 First off, Slytherin on the ground of Dead Rabbit Command.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 Everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 ExtensionCord.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 Woohoo, yeah, yeah, watch him slither.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 The more you clap, the closer he gets to the outlet.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 Wee!

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 Okay, now he's in.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 ExtensionCord, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.680
 so that's a real Patreon's name.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 You guys are like, "Jason, you're clearly just making stuff up now."

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.680
 You just wanna advertise your Patreon.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 You're like, "Looking around your house, you're like,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 "Tomorrow we'll be sponsored by Blender."

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 ExtensionCord, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand it.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.680
 I really do.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.680
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.680
 It helps out so much.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.680
 Tell your friends, tell your family, talk about it online.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.680
 That also helps the show grow.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.680
 ExtensionCord, I'm gonna go ahead and tie you around the steering wheel

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680
 of the Jason Jalopy.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 Drive us all the way out, too.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 A haunted house.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.680
 [beatboxing]

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.680
 This is one of the stories where we don't have a location.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.680
 It was posted online anonymously.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 And it was written by a guy named Prochetto Pizza,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.680
 Prochito?

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 Prochito Pizza, we're gonna go ahead and call you Jerry.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.680
 Jerry says, "This story takes place back when I was in high school."

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.680
 "I lived in a haunted house."

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.680
 Not like one of those Halloween haunted houses where people jump out at you.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 It's on my bucket list to work in a haunted house.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 One of those, it doesn't even have to be a big haunted house,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.680
 like six flags or nothing like that.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.680
 Even a local regional haunted house would be super dope.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.680
 You have a job for a couple weeks, and then you don't have it anymore.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.680
 But for three weeks, you're giving it your all.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 I'm like jumping out of hay bales and spraying fake blood on people.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680
 I'm doing that in the parking lot.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.680
 They're like, "Jason, we told you you weren't hired.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.680
 This is one of those biblical haunted houses where we talk about sins."

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.680
 "Get out of here. I'm spraying blood at the pastor."

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680
 I'll be back tomorrow night, sir.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.680
 I've always wanted to do that. I think it'd be totally dope.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680
 But that's not the type of haunted house he's living in.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.680
 He's living in a real haunted house.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.680
 He's living in a haunted house.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 And he goes, "Here's the thing.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.680
 Like, we all knew it was haunted.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.680
 And it was the traditional things you would associate with a haunted house."

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.680
 He goes, "You'd hear footsteps throughout the house when everyone was accounted for."

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.680
 Every show often something would fall off the shelf.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.680
 It's interesting because a lot of people think that's incredibly common,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.680
 because we see it in movies all the time.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.680
 When stuff's getting knocked off your shelf, you...

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.680
 that's a rarer type of ghost.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.680
 Sounds are quite easy.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.680
 It appears for ghosts to do.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.680
 But for people to go, "Oh, I just lived in an ordinary haunted house.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.680
 Stuff was flying off of the shelves.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.680
 It's actually quite rare."

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 That's when you're getting into poltergeist activity.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
 Most hauntings are just noises or smells.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.680
 And that was another thing he said.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.680
 He goes, "Every show often you could catch the whiff of cigar smoke."

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 But I didn't really see anything.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.680
 He's saying that as a book, as Heverin around it said.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.680
 He goes, "Oh, that's normal.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.680
 But I'm talking about I never actually saw a ghost in this house."

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.680
 Until...

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.680
 One day, Jerry said that he was in the kitchen.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.680
 He's standing in the kitchen and something catches his eye.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.680
 And he turns and he looks into the living room.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.680
 And he sees a translucent apparition.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.680
 Now, even though we don't have a specific location for this haunting,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.680
 he does describe this ghost as wearing colonial-style clothing.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 Almost pilgrim-like.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 So we'll assume it's like the East Coast of the United States.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.680
 He said the reason why...

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 What caught his eye really when he saw this ghost was two things.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680
 First off, that he's looking at a translucent person.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.680
 But he said that the clothing looked old-fashioned.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.680
 It definitely wasn't modern clothing.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.680
 And he said that the pants were...

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.680
 They appear to be tucked into the socks.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.680
 Which is how the pilgrims wore it, right?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 And the apparition had no head.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.680
 And he doesn't say that it walked away.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.680
 He doesn't say that it blinked away.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.680
 But at some point it left.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 It's not there until the day he's like, "Yeah, I'm charging people $5 ahead to get it."

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.680
 "To come in here and look at this headless ghost."

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.680
 No, at some point that he vanished.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680
 The ghost vanished.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.680
 And Jerry goes, "It does make sense because this house was built in the 1700s."

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.680
 "We would definitely have..."

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.680
 "If anyone was going to show up in this house, which is haunted..."

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.680
 "...that it would be the apparition of a guy in colonial clothing."

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.680
 It's interesting because Jerry's already lived in a haunted house.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.680
 He's already heard things and smelled things and had stuff fall off shelves.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.680
 He doesn't particularly say that it was hovering around him or hitting him in the face or anything funny.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.680
 But he sees a guy...

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.680
 Just imagine he's like eating an apple.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.680
 Jerry's all, "Ugh!"

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.680
 Then he looks over and he sees a translucent man with no head in colonial garb.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.680
 And he's like, "I'm just going to take another bite of this apple. I'm still hungry."

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.680
 Well, when Jerry's dad came home that day, Jerry goes, "Hey, dad, you know, this is nuts."

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.680
 I was eating an apple.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.680
 I was eating an apple. He doesn't know how to tell stories.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.680
 It was a warm sunny day this afternoon.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.680
 And I was hungry for an apple.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.680
 Eventually he gets to the point and he goes, "I saw a ghost."

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.680
 I saw a headless ghost.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.680
 And he was dressed in peculiar clothes to say the least.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.680
 And the dad, as he's describing...

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.680
 This is such an interesting ghost story.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.680
 I know that I've kind of buried the lead.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.680
 I took a long time to get to it too, but this is so interesting.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.680
 As Jerry is telling his father this story, the dad's just going, "Uh-huh."

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.680
 He's like listening to this story.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680
 And then he's like...

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.680
 Jerry's describing the clothing and the dad's like, "Yeah, okay."

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.680
 The dad goes, "Well, you know, the dad says that's very interesting.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.680
 You saw proof of life after death, son.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.680
 I have something to add to that story.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.680
 You remember Uncle Mike?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.680
 Uncle Mike, he died a couple of months ago.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.680
 Jerry's like, "Yeah, yeah, I remember Uncle Mike."

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.680
 He goes, "Yeah, you know, we have this urn of his ashes,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.680
 and I'm going to bury them in the backyard."

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.680
 And so I'd actually taken his ashes and I moved the urn outside

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.680
 in preparation that I was going to bury him later today or tomorrow.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.680
 Whenever I get around to it, the raccoons are playing with it.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.680
 So yeah, I think that might have had something to do with the apparition you saw in the house today.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.680
 It was the fact that I moved the urn and the ashes out into the backyard.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.680
 And what Jerry... This is so crazy.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.680
 What Jerry realized in that moment was...

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.680
 Because, you know, he was describing it all to his dad,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.680
 and then once the dad mentioned Uncle Mike,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:35.680
 Jerry's like, "Oh, dude, Uncle Mike used to be big into softball.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.680
 He played a lot of softball, and it wasn't an old-timey colonial outfit he was wearing.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.680
 It was like an old-timey softball uniform.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.680
 I don't know how old I may be, but it might have been one of those lame, baggy ones.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.680
 But the point is, is that the pants were tucked into the socks.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:02.680
 So, through the translucent haze, the colonial clothes looked like...

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.680
 You're like, "Jason, this is not as interesting."

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.680
 As I'm saying it out loud, I still think it's pretty interesting.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.680
 It wasn't a colonial ghost, it was an Uncle Mike ghost.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.680
 It was a softball uniform that looked like he played for the Colonials.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.680
 I don't know, but yeah, I mean, it would make sense.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.680
 Like, you're seeing this ghost and you're going, "Yeah, pants tucked into socks.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.680
 A colonial, right? You wouldn't immediately think of some adult softball league."

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.680
 And Uncle Mike blew his brains out.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.680
 So, that's why he doesn't have a head.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.680
 I don't think that Uncle Mike, he wasn't the ghost that was making the footsteps.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:52.680
 He doesn't have a timeline here, but he doesn't connect any of the other paranormal activity.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.680
 He doesn't also go, "Oh, and Uncle Mike loves smoking cigars.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.680
 He loves smoking cigars and making books ever in midair."

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.680
 Those were his favorite hobbies of an adult softball.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.680
 I think the place was haunted.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.680
 The place was haunted before this family even got there, and when they brought home Uncle Mike's...

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.680
 I made that name up. I don't know what his uncle's actual name is, but...

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:22.680
 When they bring Uncle Mike's ashes home, his spirit joined the revelry.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.680
 And it's interesting, because I don't necessarily think the spirit was connected to the ashes,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.680
 because I don't think the physical form really has much of a connection,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.680
 but it would be connected to the emotional energy of the people living in that house,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.680
 the people who missed him the most, his family.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.680
 This ghost tags along, but it has no form whatsoever.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:51.680
 It has no energy, but it's now you've moved a recently deceased spirit into an actively haunted house.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.680
 It's going to be able to charge itself off that energy and manifest,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.680
 which is, again, one of the rarer forms of ghosts.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.680
 Those are the stories you hear the most about because they're so weird and creepy,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:09.680
 but most ghostly activity is sounds and smells and then apparitions and then moving things.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.680
 So this was a super active house. I don't think Uncle Mike was the original ghost.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.680
 I think that this ghost was able to manifest because this place had so much energy already in it.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.680
 And when they moved the ashes out, the ghost showed...

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.680
 I don't know, it's an interesting... the whole story is interesting as to why you would bury ashes in the backyard.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.680
 When the ghost shows up, I guess you have to ask yourself, are you going to listen to the ghost?

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.680
 Was the ghost saying one last goodbye?

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.680
 Or was he trying to appear because he didn't want to be buried in the backyard?

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.680
 I mean, I'm sure eventually they did bury him back there.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.680
 Is his ghost still there?

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.680
 Has he joined the collection of spirits?

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.680
 Is he there so he can spend more time with his family?

00:11:51.680 --> 00:12:00.680
 Is he trapped because they brought him to a house that is just not necessarily a positive conductor of paranormal energy,

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.680
 but a vortex that's keeping souls trapped there.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.680
 I know there's lots of hypothetical questions, but a very interesting story.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.680
 A very interesting story about getting your clothes wrong.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.680
 You thought you saw a colonial ghost, but really it was a dead relative.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.680
 He died fairly recently.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.680
 And I've always wondered like how many ghosts we see where they're like,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:29.680
 "Oh, if you look down this hallway at 3 a.m. you'll see a ghost of a maid wearing old-timey Downton Abbey clothes."

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.680
 And it was really like some sex-fetish party, some girl dressed up as a maid,

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.680
 and then tripped and landed on a broken wine bottle and slid her throat open.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.680
 She bled all over the floor.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.680
 And then now that's her. That's her ghost.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.680
 She's trapped in Downton Abbey clothes for the rest of time.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.680
 Who knows? Probably more likely some old-timey ghost.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.680
 But it could be just a costume and then you have the whole idea.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.680
 This is what I'm actually doing. I'm doing that. I know it sounds like I keep promoting.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:05.680
 And I am. I'm doing a presentation of the Oregon Ghost Conference on March 24th in Seaside, Oregon.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:12.680
 And we are going to be talking... Is it March 24th? I better double check that's the date here. Hold on.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.680
 I'll be doing a presentation on... Yeah, I'm doing a presentation on March 24th at the Oregon Ghost Conference.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.680
 And we're talking about how the spirit is or looks after death.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.680
 Like, could you imagine not having a head as a ghost?

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.680
 I mean, we don't know what it's like to be a ghost. Maybe you see through your fingertips.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.680
 But there's a lot of good ghost cigarshops out there. You want to smoke.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:43.680
 I mean, like, what is it? You would think if it was true that the manner in which you died is the manner in which you haunt.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.680
 Which, see, I don't believe. I don't believe that.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:55.680
 But there's so many ghosts that, like, are walking around, no heads, you figure the, you know, the old rap saying, "Protect your neck" would become a philosophy.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:03.680
 Like, the whole idea of life would be, "Die with a perfect body, otherwise you'll be floating around in the afterlife."

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.680
 With no head.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:12.680
 I mean, let me just give you a little advice. Don't let anything happen to your head anyways, whether or not ghosts are real.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.680
 You're like, "I don't believe in ghosts." You're like banging your head with sledgehammers. Don't do that.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.680
 It's just interesting. Like, do we need to make sure we don't die certain deaths?

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.680
 Does that make a difference in how a ghost lore is divided on this?

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:34.680
 Sometimes you get a ghost with no head and they died by most likely, you know, shooting themselves in the head or they were beheaded during life.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:43.680
 But then there are other, like, soldiers who get blown to bits by, you know, a bomb in some Godforsaken battlefield and their ghost is fine walking around.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.680
 It's an interesting question and we don't know as paranormal researchers why some ghosts are totally just, like, banged up.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.680
 They're all covered in blood, no head, missing limbs, and then other ghosts who also died in horrible way.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.680
 Most drowned ghosts aren't blue. Most drowned ghosts don't have snails crawling out of their nose.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.680
 Or a hermit crab living in their brain. I mean, so what is it? What is it?

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:13.680
 But anyways, a fascinating question, fascinating story, a fascinating way for me to advertise Oregon Ghost Conference, March 24th.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.680
 Come out and see me. This will be a lot of fun.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.680
 Extension cord, let's go ahead and plug you into the carpenter copter.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:28.680
 We are leaving behind this haunted house. Take us all the way out to Pennsylvania.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:37.720
 Pennsylvania specifically we're headed out to

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:45.440
 Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, I found this story on the amazing websites phantomsandmonsters.com

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.040
 Check it out. They got new they got like I've said before they

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.100
 Have more articles on that site than I could ever cover on this show so recommend everyone check them out

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.800
 It's a great website this story was originally sent or posted by a guy named

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.600
 P.M. Just his initials. We're gonna go ahead and call you Peter

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.960
 This story starts off in 2002 when Peter was 14 years old and

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:14.240
 A friend of his goes hey Peter. I know you're really good with setting up computers. I know you're a your whiz

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.360
 You're also very handsome and looks like you're strong. Have you been working out and Peter goes?

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:25.400
 Okay, what do you want me to do? Obviously you're trying to butter me up to do something that most people would find

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.960
 Painful and the friend goes yeah, that's pretty much what I'm doing

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.680
 I'm wondering if you can set up my

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.480
 grandparents computer

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:41.440
 I've done it I've done not for these I'm not Peter. I am admitting that I'm gonna be told this story

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:49.200
 No, everyone I think anyone who knows anything about computers has had to set one up for an elderly person or program their mother's phone

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.480
 or

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.680
 Stopped their printer from shooting out paper across the room

00:16:53.680 --> 00:17:01.740
 Anyone who knows anything about tech support has been dragged into the scenario at one point or another and that's why I feel Peter's pain

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:07.800
 Peter's like oh man, I thought I was gonna have fun tonight instead. I'm gonna be putting these people's not only does he have to

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.320
 assemble the computer

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.840
 He then needs to load the software up which at this point in time is probably the AOL disc

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.280
 They got in the mail and then he needed to do it to Torgo

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:26.480
 It's like all the worst possible things you could do but anyways Peter says sure. I'll do it and

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.040
 He writes his bike over to his friend's grandparents house

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.600
 When Peter gets there he finds that the only people in the house are the grandparents and

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:44.440
 Their six-year-old granddaughter. She was visiting. They originally tried having her set up the computer and she's like I can't even spell the word

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.400
 What I'm supposed to do with these cables so they send her to a room. She is fast asleep Peter is there

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.880
 He sets up the computer loads of all the software and

00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:00.560
 Does the tutorial this is a mouse? This is a browser. This is your monitor

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:07.240
 Slow down there Einstein. What's going on? The monitor is not the computer

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.560
 I'm doing there two separate pieces there like you're blowing my mind man

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.920
 Anyways after everything is set up all the software is loaded and the presentation is over Peter is ready to go

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.560
 It's time to leave and the grandparents are very thankful. Hey, we know this wasn't an easy task

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.120
 Thank you so much for setting this up for us

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:31.080
 We will email you tomorrow with a whole new list of questions first question how to use email and he's like

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.840
 After the presentation is done Peter is ready to leave the grandparents are now sitting on the couch in the living room

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:45.920
 But before Peter can actually walk out the front door suddenly a cold breeze sweeps through the entire room

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:55.920
 When this happens Peter sees both of the grandparents turn and begin staring into the kitchen

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:04.200
 And Peter's looking at the grandparents and he's like what and he turns and he looks into the kitchen as well

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.240
 And he sees what they're staring at

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.080
 Standing in the kitchen are two gray aliens

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:22.000
 You know they look like their traditional gray alien except for two details one their eyes

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.680
 Seem to be a little bit farther to the sides of their heads gray aliens

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:33.200
 The eyes are normally in the front of the face like a human's eyes. He also said they were wearing silver jumpsuits

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:40.600
 They also said not only were the eyes farther apart than he had seen in drawings or in movie or television shows of aliens

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:46.480
 He goes these gray aliens were taller than I had imagined gray aliens to be and their necks were thicker

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.440
 They also wore silver jumpsuits now on any given day

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:57.160
 Two gray aliens appearing in your kitchen or somebody else's kitchen if you're visiting them

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.920
 would be

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.520
 shocking and

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.400
 Probably the most exciting thing at the very least the most exciting thing you've seen that day if not ever

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.960
 but there was another figure standing in this room that

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:17.240
 Was running the show this was the main attraction standing in between these two gray aliens

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.880
 was an insectoid

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.440
 these giant bipedal

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.320
 Insect creatures they're very rare in UFO

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.480
 Stories I love them. I think they're super cool. I think they're super cool

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.680
 I think the idea of the insectoid race is just so much you could do with it as they're ripping me apart

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.040
 I'm like, oh, this is so awesome dude late eggs in my stomach. That's also awesome, too

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.120
 It's like what you're enjoying this little too much insectoid aliens. I love it

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:51.980
 There's a giant insectoid also standing in the kitchen towering over the grays and he was wearing a black robe

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.920
 With a yellow stripe going down the middle

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:04.440
 So an insectoid alien garbed in a flowing black robe and then two gray aliens flanking it with silver jumpsuits

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.360
 Peter is shocked about what he's seen

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.740
 But he's also shocked by the fact that the grandparents

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:18.020
 Don't seem to be particularly worried about what is going on

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.960
 Peter said the insectoid and the aliens walked out of the kitchen and began to move through the house

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.320
 They were gone for about a minute and

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.580
 Then the insectoid and the gray aliens began walking back towards the kitchen

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:41.360
 But now the insectoid is carrying the six-year-old granddaughter in its arms

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.440
 The insectoid looks at Peter

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.120
 And Peter's looking at this praying mantis type alien

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.560
 They've locked eyes and Peter goes listen. I don't know

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:04.640
 How I got this feeling I didn't get a telepathic signal. It definitely didn't say anything to me, but somehow

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.880
 When this thing was staring at me, I

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.480
 understood

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.480
 That this creature knew who I was

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.480
 I

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:24.040
 Don't know how he knew that and I don't know how I knew that he knew that but I knew that

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.800
 When he looked at me, I could tell in some way that he knew who I was

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.800
 And

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.280
 The whole time the grandparents are just sitting there now they're watching what's going on

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.640
 They're not like turning on the television. They're all cranking the volume up

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:45.000
 They're like oh that insectoid his chittering is so annoying. No, they were watching it in silence

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.440
 They were watching these aliens move through the house go to the granddaughter's room and now they're coming out with the granddaughter

00:22:50.440 --> 00:23:00.280
 And they're just not doing anything about it and Peter's obviously he's in shock. He's terrified

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.280
 He doesn't know what to do. He's only 14 years old, but finally

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:11.100
 He realizes the grandparents aren't gonna stop whatever whatever is about to happen isn't going to be good

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.720
 The grandparents aren't gonna do anything about it. I have to do something about it and Peter said I took one step towards

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:23.360
 These aliens I took one step and the grandfather reached out and grabbed my arm

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.400
 And he said quote

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.640
 They will bring her back

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:41.820
 At that point the aliens are now in the kitchen and a light materialized around the four of them

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:47.960
 The emantus is still holding the little girl in his arms this light materializes and then

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.560
 They vanish

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.480
 The three aliens and the little girl just disappear and Peter said

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.880
 It was interesting the light appeared out of nowhere

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:08.720
 Everyone vanished, but then there was this odd glow left behind that remains for a few seconds after whatever this was his teleportation

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:15.680
 Sequence or whatever he goes you saw this glow last for a couple seconds and then slowly fade away

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.120
 Peter's just standing there completely

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:28.440
 What words would you even you'd basically have every human emotion every negative human emotion going on through him right now

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.340
 He doesn't know what happened. He's perplexed. He's terrified

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:38.720
 But all of this stuff he doesn't understand why no one did anything to stop this

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.020
 So he's just standing there and he goes maybe a minute past. There was just silence

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:48.280
 I'm standing there. The grandparents are sitting on the couch and what do you even say?

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.400
 I'm shocked that I saw this and then the grandpa says once again

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.900
 They will bring her back

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:07.300
 Peter says about a minute passes of stunned silence. How would you react to any of this? You just saw

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.340
 in the

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.180
 Most minimalist of terms a six-year-old girl get kidnapped

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:20.460
 But it wasn't just that was it there is aliens and teleportation and the fact that the grandparents the people who should be protecting this girl

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.500
 Let it happen and a minute passes of silence in this house

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.600
 And it is finally broken when the grandfather says once again, and this is a direct quote both times

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.300
 They

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.300
 Will bring her back

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.940
 Peter got on his bike and took off

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.860
 He said the whole time I was riding home

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:47.540
 I felt like something was following me something was ready to snatch me right off my bike. I was petrified

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.180
 But he made it home

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.540
 And he couldn't sleep

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:59.020
 She's understandable right again at the very least you saw six-year-old girl get kidnapped in front of you

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:06.100
 He couldn't sleep the next day. He asks his friend about what would possibly have happened

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.540
 He goes hey remember the other night. I

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.380
 Set up your grandparents computer

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:18.860
 You know expect this I expected to spend a couple hours explaining to them the difference between a modem and

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:24.020
 A CD-ROM no three aliens showed up and kidnapped

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.540
 their granddaughter

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.860
 What are your relatives you guys are all part of the same family what the world's going on

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.300
 Do you know anything about this and Peter says his friend explained to him?

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.540
 This isn't the first time that's happened like I'm sorry to put you in that position

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:45.380
 I didn't know the night you were going over was kidnapping night, but this isn't the first time that it's happened

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.940
 he goes this has happened a lot and

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.140
 Every time it's happened people have tried to stop it

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:57.060
 The grandparents have tried to stop it other family members who had been there when this happened try to stop it

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.540
 But they never could they can never stop this from happening and

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.420
 They always brought her back

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:15.340
 In fact, I'll tell you right now Peter she did come back home a couple hours after you left they did bring her back that night

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:22.360
 Because they always do and there's no way to stop it

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.020
 So you just let it happen

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:37.340
 Peter said shortly after this event the entire family moved out of the area so not just the grandparents, but

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.180
 Everybody

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:44.420
 Everyone who was a part of this family they just moved and he lost contact with his friend and with the grandparents

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.420
 He doesn't really know what happened after

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.500
 that one night

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.820
 It's a very interesting story what I love about it other than having one of my favorite

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:59.260
 Alien races involved in at the insectoid. We can really take this story apart

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.420
 I I'll try not to drone on too quickly get it

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:07.460
 You're like, you know, okay, let me explain a lot of times great aliens are considered drones

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:12.420
 Some people some UFOologists say that they are part of their own race

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.540
 Well, there's other UFO. I'll just who believe that the grays are actually

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:25.940
 Biodrones they're like organic material or their actual robots, but they're constructs. They have no feelings

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.260
 They have no emotions. They're basically the same as a tractor on earth

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:35.180
 It's a vehicle or a mechanism meant to carry out a study

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.220
 What's interesting about this one is the two gray aliens

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:43.100
 Their eyes are farther off to the sides of their heads than the normal gray alien

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.340
 Almost like an insectoid insectoid aliens don't have the eyes right in front of their head

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.820
 They're kind of offset to the sides as well not completely on the sides, but

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:56.140
 So it's almost like the gray aliens they were being manufactured

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.220
 to

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:03.660
 Serve the race they were with in this story because there's are some the gray aliens wearing clothes

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.860
 We actually see that a lot in UFO

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:13.180
 Stories like actual people's encounters with gray aliens in television and movie shows gray aliens don't wear clothes

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:19.260
 But when you dig through the reports great aliens wearing clothes are very very common

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.620
 So the silver jumpsuits that doesn't that's not really a signifier of anything

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.380
 That's just they do tend to wear clothes from time to time

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:33.340
 But the larger necks they were actually a little bit taller than the average gray alien or the thicker neck

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:39.020
 Taller than the average gray alien and the eyes kind of offset makes me think these may have been if not

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.820
 If we don't go with the gray because I don't know if I'm sold on that the gray aliens are just tools

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:51.460
 They're just kind of like mindless drones whether or not they're mindless drones or they do have their own unique personality

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.020
 Their own unique race these ones may have been genetically modified by the insectoids

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.740
 To appear more like them

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:06.540
 So that's an interesting little tidbit, but Jason actually the most interesting tidbit is the six-year-old getting kidnapped

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.700
 You're talking about fashion choices. Well, this is what is so interesting to me about

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.380
 UFOology with ghosts it is a very one-on-one

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:21.380
 Ghosts don't seem to be more powerful than the average human. They don't seem uniquely strong

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.500
 Sure, they can float through walls and they can throw stuff at you

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.740
 And like if you punch them your hand just goes through them

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:32.180
 But ghosts basically seem to be limited to the strength level of a human

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.020
 Aliens

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.700
 Have been nerfed a lot again when we talk about like television shows and movies

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:44.100
 But when you dig through the lore aliens are incredibly powerful beings

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:52.500
 And we see a lot of even when you look through the reports of missing time and

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.780
 things like that

00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:02.240
 Being knocked unconscious that we've done a whole episode about our great aliens evolved from dolphins because they both have the same type of

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:09.060
 Sonic attacks all this interesting stuff in the lore when you watch movies and television the great aliens are just like we come in peace

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.580
 Clean your environment, but in real life

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.060
 I mean the we've come across aliens that were bulletproof

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:20.500
 We've come across aliens that people have tried stabbing them and the knife just slides off their skin

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:26.900
 They can also be incredibly strong again outside of all of the paranormal stuff teleportation and

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:34.060
 Mind-wiping people a lot of these aliens you could you could not go toe-to-toe with a reptilian or an insectoid

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.060
 They would gut you on the spot

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:42.820
 Great aliens do seem to be quite frail they seem to be built basically for

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:48.820
 You know pressing buttons on computers flying spaceships if they are a designed race. They're not built for combat

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.380
 but reptilians and

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:59.660
 Insectoids are like whatever world they evolved on must be hell because they're just built to kill and

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:07.420
 So at the end of the day like this insectoid could have just massacred everyone in this house and not have thought twice about it

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.220
 You could have been a house of the kid

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.860
 Just the way the power level the of these things is off the charts

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.780
 But what I like is that the insectoid wasn't doing that however

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:25.340
 The people did try to stop this from happening before and they never could we don't get any info on

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:30.980
 If they were physically harmed or they had some sort of psionic block on them that they couldn't move

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:36.580
 But to the point where the grandfather was resigned to just like not even get up off the couch

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:40.540
 He's not even pretending he has a guest over he's not even like oh great now

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.620
 I got to pretend that I can do this he knew it was fruitless

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:51.140
 He knew that they were gonna take her no matter what these beans were just far too powerful for the average human to interact with

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.620
 He had tried before

00:32:53.620 --> 00:33:00.780
 Other family members had tried before and it has failed every single time so at this and it would have had to have been a

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.300
 Ton of times for you not even for you to not even get off the couch

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:11.780
 It's that idea of the groundhog day syndrome, right? Even by day five or day 50

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:17.980
 You may still be trying to figure out the mystery but by the by the 200th time this had happened

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.540
 You're just like whatever. I'm just gonna lay in bed

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:28.080
 You hear the sound of the six-year-old getting kidnapped like there's nothing we can do and they always bring her back

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:37.020
 So if I don't do anything they're gonna bring her back if I do something there's a chance that I could get injured or that they won't bring her back

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.820
 You know, I think that's kind of implied as well

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:47.340
 If you ended up injuring these beans if you set a trap for him or busted out a shotgun and took out one of the gray aliens blew away half

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.700
 Of his skull

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:53.620
 You may never see your daughter again that teleportation still going to happen. They're just bringing up one less

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.380
 alien

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:03.900
 So it's a super interesting story. It's quite creepy the idea of how powerless a human is we are the

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.580
 dominant species on this planet, but

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.260
 On this planet is the key part of that sentence

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:19.820
 You know at any point these more powerful means can show up and do whatever they want

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.700
 And there's nothing you do about it

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:30.540
 That's the key takeaway to really UFO stories their technology is

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.820
 Greater than ours their scientific understanding

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.220
 Hand in hand with the technology would be greater than ours

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.660
 It's just raw power. It's just raw

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:45.140
 unadulterated power that we can't even understand

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:50.820
 We have it in our sci-fi shows and we have scientists working around the clock all over the world

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:56.740
 To move an atom from one millimeter away. That's not even a millimeter

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:02.300
 It's even closer than that but to make like a molecule jump and go look at look at we're working towards

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.580
 teleportation aliens can do that with three dudes and then pick up a fourth

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.540
 And then just go back home like we can't even comprehend that

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.380
 That's like their Sunday

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.580
 That's like what they that's just what they do to get around

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.420
 So there's saw they outmatch us on science a

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:26.260
 Lot of the races outmatch us on physical power. We have had stories of people shooting aliens

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.140
 Sure, we have had aliens get killed by humans with shotguns or

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.620
 Rifles or whatever it is. We have had stories of UFOs getting shot down

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:41.220
 By a fighter craft, but they're incredibly rare when you look at the amount of alien encounters that we have

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:47.580
 Versus the amount of alien encounters that when they come down to some sort of physical conflict the humans win

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:54.980
 It's incredibly rare and again you have that survivor bias. We don't have the accounts of the times the aliens killed the humans

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:01.180
 There was an encounter that went sideways and the aliens killed everybody because there's no one to tell that story

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:06.340
 So we only have the stories where people survive alien encounters and I think that may also skew

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:13.780
 How we feel and I'm talking about hand-to-hand combat at this point great aliens might be incredibly strong

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.860
 but anyone who's ever gone toe-to-toe with one and lost

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:23.180
 There's no one to tell the story and the people who haven't physically gone after great aliens

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.780
 They go I don't know yet skinny arms. He looks like a big old whim

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:35.580
 It's fascinating story. What do you do when an overwhelming force takes the person you love?

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:43.580
 It's a simple question, but it has no answer if it was a

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:51.460
 Armed raid from across your nation's borders where they broke in and they sacked the town and took all the women back home with

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:56.660
 Them the town population could get what guns they had left and rally an army and go to take them back

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.860
 We've seen that happen throughout history

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:05.580
 But if an invading army simply teleported into your house and

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:11.140
 Took your wife and then teleported away

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:17.460
 First off where do you even attack? Where did this army come from? Who are they?

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.620
 overwhelming force

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.620
 superior technology

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.820
 massive

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:30.860
 physical strength differences all of these things add up to make humans quite weak on the galactic scale

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:37.700
 So when these encounters do happen when this

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.180
 Really for lack of a better term invading force

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:49.480
 Canaps the ones we love the most we know we can't defeat them. We know we can't fight back all we can do

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.460
 is hope

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.340
 That they bring our loved ones back

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.980
 But if they don't

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.260
 They're still

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.460
 Nothing we can do about it

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:11.180
 Dead rapper radio a gmail.com is gonna be our email address

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.980
 You can also it is up at facebook.com slash dead rapper radio

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:20.220
 Tick tock is at the rubber radio that rubber radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.380
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listen to it today
