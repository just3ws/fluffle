1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,680
 When a young man sees a ghost standing in his living room,

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,680
 he realizes ghosts are real.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,680
 I guess ghosts really do exist.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
 But this one has a twist.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,680
 And then we traveled to Pennsylvania to meet a young man

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,680
 who is tasked with trying to complete an impossible task,

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,680
 set up a computer for an elderly couple,

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,680
 and then teach them how to use it.

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,680
 While this man may be braver than most of us,

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,680
 his courage is truly put to the test when he comes face-to-face

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,680
 with an insectoid today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,680
 [music]

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,680
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
 I'm having a great day.

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,680
 Hope you guys are having great day, too.

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,680
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
 We got a lot of stuff to cover,

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
 so we're gonna get started right away.

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,680
 First off, Slytherin on the ground of Dead Rabbit Command.

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,680
 Everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter,

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
 ExtensionCord.

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,680
 Woohoo, yeah, yeah, watch him slither.

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,680
 The more you clap, the closer he gets to the outlet.

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
 Wee!

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
 Okay, now he's in.

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,680
 ExtensionCord, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot,

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
 so that's a real Patreon's name.

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,680
 You guys are like, "Jason, you're clearly just making stuff up now."

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
 You just wanna advertise your Patreon.

44
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
 You're like, "Looking around your house, you're like,

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
 "Tomorrow we'll be sponsored by Blender."

46
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,680
 ExtensionCord, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,680
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand it.

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
 I really do.

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,680
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Command.

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
 It helps out so much.

51
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,680
 Tell your friends, tell your family, talk about it online.

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,680
 That also helps the show grow.

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,680
 ExtensionCord, I'm gonna go ahead and tie you around the steering wheel

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
 of the Jason Jalopy.

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
 Drive us all the way out, too.

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
 A haunted house.

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
 [beatboxing]

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,680
 This is one of the stories where we don't have a location.

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,680
 It was posted online anonymously.

61
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,680
 And it was written by a guy named Prochetto Pizza,

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
 Prochito?

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,680
 Prochito Pizza, we're gonna go ahead and call you Jerry.

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,680
 Jerry says, "This story takes place back when I was in high school."

65
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,680
 "I lived in a haunted house."

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,680
 Not like one of those Halloween haunted houses where people jump out at you.

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,680
 It's on my bucket list to work in a haunted house.

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,680
 One of those, it doesn't even have to be a big haunted house,

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
 like six flags or nothing like that.

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
 Even a local regional haunted house would be super dope.

71
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,680
 You have a job for a couple weeks, and then you don't have it anymore.

72
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,680
 But for three weeks, you're giving it your all.

73
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,680
 I'm like jumping out of hay bales and spraying fake blood on people.

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
 I'm doing that in the parking lot.

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
 They're like, "Jason, we told you you weren't hired.

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
 This is one of those biblical haunted houses where we talk about sins."

77
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
 "Get out of here. I'm spraying blood at the pastor."

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
 I'll be back tomorrow night, sir.

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
 I've always wanted to do that. I think it'd be totally dope.

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
 But that's not the type of haunted house he's living in.

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,680
 He's living in a real haunted house.

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,680
 He's living in a haunted house.

83
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
 And he goes, "Here's the thing.

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
 Like, we all knew it was haunted.

85
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,680
 And it was the traditional things you would associate with a haunted house."

86
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,680
 He goes, "You'd hear footsteps throughout the house when everyone was accounted for."

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,680
 Every show often something would fall off the shelf.

88
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,680
 It's interesting because a lot of people think that's incredibly common,

89
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
 because we see it in movies all the time.

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,680
 When stuff's getting knocked off your shelf, you...

91
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,680
 that's a rarer type of ghost.

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
 Sounds are quite easy.

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,680
 It appears for ghosts to do.

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,680
 But for people to go, "Oh, I just lived in an ordinary haunted house.

95
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
 Stuff was flying off of the shelves.

96
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
 It's actually quite rare."

97
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
 That's when you're getting into poltergeist activity.

98
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,680
 Most hauntings are just noises or smells.

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
 And that was another thing he said.

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,680
 He goes, "Every show often you could catch the whiff of cigar smoke."

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
 But I didn't really see anything.

102
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
 He's saying that as a book, as Heverin around it said.

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
 He goes, "Oh, that's normal.

104
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,680
 But I'm talking about I never actually saw a ghost in this house."

105
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
 Until...

106
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,680
 One day, Jerry said that he was in the kitchen.

107
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,680
 He's standing in the kitchen and something catches his eye.

108
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
 And he turns and he looks into the living room.

109
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
 And he sees a translucent apparition.

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,680
 Now, even though we don't have a specific location for this haunting,

111
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,680
 he does describe this ghost as wearing colonial-style clothing.

112
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
 Almost pilgrim-like.

113
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,680
 So we'll assume it's like the East Coast of the United States.

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
 He said the reason why...

115
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 What caught his eye really when he saw this ghost was two things.

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
 First off, that he's looking at a translucent person.

117
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,680
 But he said that the clothing looked old-fashioned.

118
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
 It definitely wasn't modern clothing.

119
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
 And he said that the pants were...

120
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
 They appear to be tucked into the socks.

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,680
 Which is how the pilgrims wore it, right?

122
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,680
 And the apparition had no head.

123
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,680
 And he doesn't say that it walked away.

124
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
 He doesn't say that it blinked away.

125
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
 But at some point it left.

126
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,680
 It's not there until the day he's like, "Yeah, I'm charging people $5 ahead to get it."

127
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,680
 "To come in here and look at this headless ghost."

128
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,680
 No, at some point that he vanished.

129
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
 The ghost vanished.

130
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,680
 And Jerry goes, "It does make sense because this house was built in the 1700s."

131
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
 "We would definitely have..."

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,680
 "If anyone was going to show up in this house, which is haunted..."

133
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,680
 "...that it would be the apparition of a guy in colonial clothing."

134
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,680
 It's interesting because Jerry's already lived in a haunted house.

135
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,680
 He's already heard things and smelled things and had stuff fall off shelves.

136
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,680
 He doesn't particularly say that it was hovering around him or hitting him in the face or anything funny.

137
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
 But he sees a guy...

138
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
 Just imagine he's like eating an apple.

139
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
 Jerry's all, "Ugh!"

140
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,680
 Then he looks over and he sees a translucent man with no head in colonial garb.

141
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,680
 And he's like, "I'm just going to take another bite of this apple. I'm still hungry."

142
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,680
 Well, when Jerry's dad came home that day, Jerry goes, "Hey, dad, you know, this is nuts."

143
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,680
 I was eating an apple.

144
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,680
 I was eating an apple. He doesn't know how to tell stories.

145
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
 It was a warm sunny day this afternoon.

146
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
 And I was hungry for an apple.

147
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,680
 Eventually he gets to the point and he goes, "I saw a ghost."

148
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
 I saw a headless ghost.

149
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,680
 And he was dressed in peculiar clothes to say the least.

150
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
 And the dad, as he's describing...

151
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
 This is such an interesting ghost story.

152
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
 I know that I've kind of buried the lead.

153
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,680
 I took a long time to get to it too, but this is so interesting.

154
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,680
 As Jerry is telling his father this story, the dad's just going, "Uh-huh."

155
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
 He's like listening to this story.

156
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
 And then he's like...

157
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
 Jerry's describing the clothing and the dad's like, "Yeah, okay."

158
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,680
 The dad goes, "Well, you know, the dad says that's very interesting.

159
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,680
 You saw proof of life after death, son.

160
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,680
 I have something to add to that story.

161
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,680
 You remember Uncle Mike?

162
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,680
 Uncle Mike, he died a couple of months ago.

163
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,680
 Jerry's like, "Yeah, yeah, I remember Uncle Mike."

164
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,680
 He goes, "Yeah, you know, we have this urn of his ashes,

165
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,680
 and I'm going to bury them in the backyard."

166
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,680
 And so I'd actually taken his ashes and I moved the urn outside

167
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,680
 in preparation that I was going to bury him later today or tomorrow.

168
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,680
 Whenever I get around to it, the raccoons are playing with it.

169
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,680
 So yeah, I think that might have had something to do with the apparition you saw in the house today.

170
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,680
 It was the fact that I moved the urn and the ashes out into the backyard.

171
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,680
 And what Jerry... This is so crazy.

172
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,680
 What Jerry realized in that moment was...

173
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
 Because, you know, he was describing it all to his dad,

174
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,680
 and then once the dad mentioned Uncle Mike,

175
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,680
 Jerry's like, "Oh, dude, Uncle Mike used to be big into softball.

176
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,680
 He played a lot of softball, and it wasn't an old-timey colonial outfit he was wearing.

177
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,680
 It was like an old-timey softball uniform.

178
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,680
 I don't know how old I may be, but it might have been one of those lame, baggy ones.

179
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,680
 But the point is, is that the pants were tucked into the socks.

180
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:02,680
 So, through the translucent haze, the colonial clothes looked like...

181
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,680
 You're like, "Jason, this is not as interesting."

182
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,680
 As I'm saying it out loud, I still think it's pretty interesting.

183
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,680
 It wasn't a colonial ghost, it was an Uncle Mike ghost.

184
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,680
 It was a softball uniform that looked like he played for the Colonials.

185
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,680
 I don't know, but yeah, I mean, it would make sense.

186
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,680
 Like, you're seeing this ghost and you're going, "Yeah, pants tucked into socks.

187
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,680
 A colonial, right? You wouldn't immediately think of some adult softball league."

188
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,680
 And Uncle Mike blew his brains out.

189
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,680
 So, that's why he doesn't have a head.

190
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,680
 I don't think that Uncle Mike, he wasn't the ghost that was making the footsteps.

191
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,680
 He doesn't have a timeline here, but he doesn't connect any of the other paranormal activity.

192
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,680
 He doesn't also go, "Oh, and Uncle Mike loves smoking cigars.

193
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,680
 He loves smoking cigars and making books ever in midair."

194
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,680
 Those were his favorite hobbies of an adult softball.

195
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,680
 I think the place was haunted.

196
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,680
 The place was haunted before this family even got there, and when they brought home Uncle Mike's...

197
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,680
 I made that name up. I don't know what his uncle's actual name is, but...

198
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,680
 When they bring Uncle Mike's ashes home, his spirit joined the revelry.

199
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,680
 And it's interesting, because I don't necessarily think the spirit was connected to the ashes,

200
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,680
 because I don't think the physical form really has much of a connection,

201
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,680
 but it would be connected to the emotional energy of the people living in that house,

202
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,680
 the people who missed him the most, his family.

203
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,680
 This ghost tags along, but it has no form whatsoever.

204
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:51,680
 It has no energy, but it's now you've moved a recently deceased spirit into an actively haunted house.

205
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,680
 It's going to be able to charge itself off that energy and manifest,

206
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
 which is, again, one of the rarer forms of ghosts.

207
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,680
 Those are the stories you hear the most about because they're so weird and creepy,

208
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:09,680
 but most ghostly activity is sounds and smells and then apparitions and then moving things.

209
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,680
 So this was a super active house. I don't think Uncle Mike was the original ghost.

210
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,680
 I think that this ghost was able to manifest because this place had so much energy already in it.

211
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,680
 And when they moved the ashes out, the ghost showed...

212
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,680
 I don't know, it's an interesting... the whole story is interesting as to why you would bury ashes in the backyard.

213
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,680
 When the ghost shows up, I guess you have to ask yourself, are you going to listen to the ghost?

214
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
 Was the ghost saying one last goodbye?

215
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,680
 Or was he trying to appear because he didn't want to be buried in the backyard?

216
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,680
 I mean, I'm sure eventually they did bury him back there.

217
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
 Is his ghost still there?

218
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,680
 Has he joined the collection of spirits?

219
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,680
 Is he there so he can spend more time with his family?

220
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:00,680
 Is he trapped because they brought him to a house that is just not necessarily a positive conductor of paranormal energy,

221
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,680
 but a vortex that's keeping souls trapped there.

222
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,680
 I know there's lots of hypothetical questions, but a very interesting story.

223
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,680
 A very interesting story about getting your clothes wrong.

224
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,680
 You thought you saw a colonial ghost, but really it was a dead relative.

225
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,680
 He died fairly recently.

226
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,680
 And I've always wondered like how many ghosts we see where they're like,

227
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:29,680
 "Oh, if you look down this hallway at 3 a.m. you'll see a ghost of a maid wearing old-timey Downton Abbey clothes."

228
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,680
 And it was really like some sex-fetish party, some girl dressed up as a maid,

229
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,680
 and then tripped and landed on a broken wine bottle and slid her throat open.

230
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
 She bled all over the floor.

231
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
 And then now that's her. That's her ghost.

232
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,680
 She's trapped in Downton Abbey clothes for the rest of time.

233
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,680
 Who knows? Probably more likely some old-timey ghost.

234
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,680
 But it could be just a costume and then you have the whole idea.

235
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,680
 This is what I'm actually doing. I'm doing that. I know it sounds like I keep promoting.

236
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,680
 And I am. I'm doing a presentation of the Oregon Ghost Conference on March 24th in Seaside, Oregon.

237
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,680
 And we are going to be talking... Is it March 24th? I better double check that's the date here. Hold on.

238
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,680
 I'll be doing a presentation on... Yeah, I'm doing a presentation on March 24th at the Oregon Ghost Conference.

239
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,680
 And we're talking about how the spirit is or looks after death.

240
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,680
 Like, could you imagine not having a head as a ghost?

241
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,680
 I mean, we don't know what it's like to be a ghost. Maybe you see through your fingertips.

242
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,680
 But there's a lot of good ghost cigarshops out there. You want to smoke.

243
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:43,680
 I mean, like, what is it? You would think if it was true that the manner in which you died is the manner in which you haunt.

244
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 Which, see, I don't believe. I don't believe that.

245
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:55,680
 But there's so many ghosts that, like, are walking around, no heads, you figure the, you know, the old rap saying, "Protect your neck" would become a philosophy.

246
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,680
 Like, the whole idea of life would be, "Die with a perfect body, otherwise you'll be floating around in the afterlife."

247
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,680
 With no head.

248
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,680
 I mean, let me just give you a little advice. Don't let anything happen to your head anyways, whether or not ghosts are real.

249
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,680
 You're like, "I don't believe in ghosts." You're like banging your head with sledgehammers. Don't do that.

250
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,680
 It's just interesting. Like, do we need to make sure we don't die certain deaths?

251
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,680
 Does that make a difference in how a ghost lore is divided on this?

252
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:34,680
 Sometimes you get a ghost with no head and they died by most likely, you know, shooting themselves in the head or they were beheaded during life.

253
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:43,680
 But then there are other, like, soldiers who get blown to bits by, you know, a bomb in some Godforsaken battlefield and their ghost is fine walking around.

254
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,680
 It's an interesting question and we don't know as paranormal researchers why some ghosts are totally just, like, banged up.

255
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,680
 They're all covered in blood, no head, missing limbs, and then other ghosts who also died in horrible way.

256
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,680
 Most drowned ghosts aren't blue. Most drowned ghosts don't have snails crawling out of their nose.

257
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,680
 Or a hermit crab living in their brain. I mean, so what is it? What is it?

258
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,680
 But anyways, a fascinating question, fascinating story, a fascinating way for me to advertise Oregon Ghost Conference, March 24th.

259
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
 Come out and see me. This will be a lot of fun.

260
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,680
 Extension cord, let's go ahead and plug you into the carpenter copter.

261
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,680
 We are leaving behind this haunted house. Take us all the way out to Pennsylvania.

262
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:37,720
 Pennsylvania specifically we're headed out to

263
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:45,440
 Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, I found this story on the amazing websites phantomsandmonsters.com

264
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
 Check it out. They got new they got like I've said before they

265
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,100
 Have more articles on that site than I could ever cover on this show so recommend everyone check them out

266
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,800
 It's a great website this story was originally sent or posted by a guy named

267
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,600
 P.M. Just his initials. We're gonna go ahead and call you Peter

268
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,960
 This story starts off in 2002 when Peter was 14 years old and

269
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:14,240
 A friend of his goes hey Peter. I know you're really good with setting up computers. I know you're a your whiz

270
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,360
 You're also very handsome and looks like you're strong. Have you been working out and Peter goes?

271
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:25,400
 Okay, what do you want me to do? Obviously you're trying to butter me up to do something that most people would find

272
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,960
 Painful and the friend goes yeah, that's pretty much what I'm doing

273
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,680
 I'm wondering if you can set up my

274
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,480
 grandparents computer

275
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,440
 I've done it I've done not for these I'm not Peter. I am admitting that I'm gonna be told this story

276
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:49,200
 No, everyone I think anyone who knows anything about computers has had to set one up for an elderly person or program their mother's phone

277
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,480
 or

278
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,680
 Stopped their printer from shooting out paper across the room

279
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:01,740
 Anyone who knows anything about tech support has been dragged into the scenario at one point or another and that's why I feel Peter's pain

280
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,800
 Peter's like oh man, I thought I was gonna have fun tonight instead. I'm gonna be putting these people's not only does he have to

281
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,320
 assemble the computer

282
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,840
 He then needs to load the software up which at this point in time is probably the AOL disc

283
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,280
 They got in the mail and then he needed to do it to Torgo

284
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,480
 It's like all the worst possible things you could do but anyways Peter says sure. I'll do it and

285
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,040
 He writes his bike over to his friend's grandparents house

286
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,600
 When Peter gets there he finds that the only people in the house are the grandparents and

287
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:44,440
 Their six-year-old granddaughter. She was visiting. They originally tried having her set up the computer and she's like I can't even spell the word

288
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,400
 What I'm supposed to do with these cables so they send her to a room. She is fast asleep Peter is there

289
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,880
 He sets up the computer loads of all the software and

290
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,560
 Does the tutorial this is a mouse? This is a browser. This is your monitor

291
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:07,240
 Slow down there Einstein. What's going on? The monitor is not the computer

292
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,560
 I'm doing there two separate pieces there like you're blowing my mind man

293
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,920
 Anyways after everything is set up all the software is loaded and the presentation is over Peter is ready to go

294
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,560
 It's time to leave and the grandparents are very thankful. Hey, we know this wasn't an easy task

295
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,120
 Thank you so much for setting this up for us

296
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,080
 We will email you tomorrow with a whole new list of questions first question how to use email and he's like

297
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,840
 After the presentation is done Peter is ready to leave the grandparents are now sitting on the couch in the living room

298
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:45,920
 But before Peter can actually walk out the front door suddenly a cold breeze sweeps through the entire room

299
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:55,920
 When this happens Peter sees both of the grandparents turn and begin staring into the kitchen

300
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:04,200
 And Peter's looking at the grandparents and he's like what and he turns and he looks into the kitchen as well

301
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,240
 And he sees what they're staring at

302
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,080
 Standing in the kitchen are two gray aliens

303
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:22,000
 You know they look like their traditional gray alien except for two details one their eyes

304
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,680
 Seem to be a little bit farther to the sides of their heads gray aliens

305
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:33,200
 The eyes are normally in the front of the face like a human's eyes. He also said they were wearing silver jumpsuits

306
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,600
 They also said not only were the eyes farther apart than he had seen in drawings or in movie or television shows of aliens

307
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,480
 He goes these gray aliens were taller than I had imagined gray aliens to be and their necks were thicker

308
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,440
 They also wore silver jumpsuits now on any given day

309
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,160
 Two gray aliens appearing in your kitchen or somebody else's kitchen if you're visiting them

310
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,920
 would be

311
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,520
 shocking and

312
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,400
 Probably the most exciting thing at the very least the most exciting thing you've seen that day if not ever

313
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,960
 but there was another figure standing in this room that

314
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:17,240
 Was running the show this was the main attraction standing in between these two gray aliens

315
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,880
 was an insectoid

316
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,440
 these giant bipedal

317
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,320
 Insect creatures they're very rare in UFO

318
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,480
 Stories I love them. I think they're super cool. I think they're super cool

319
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,680
 I think the idea of the insectoid race is just so much you could do with it as they're ripping me apart

320
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,040
 I'm like, oh, this is so awesome dude late eggs in my stomach. That's also awesome, too

321
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,120
 It's like what you're enjoying this little too much insectoid aliens. I love it

322
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:51,980
 There's a giant insectoid also standing in the kitchen towering over the grays and he was wearing a black robe

323
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,920
 With a yellow stripe going down the middle

324
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:04,440
 So an insectoid alien garbed in a flowing black robe and then two gray aliens flanking it with silver jumpsuits

325
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,360
 Peter is shocked about what he's seen

326
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,740
 But he's also shocked by the fact that the grandparents

327
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:18,020
 Don't seem to be particularly worried about what is going on

328
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,960
 Peter said the insectoid and the aliens walked out of the kitchen and began to move through the house

329
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,320
 They were gone for about a minute and

330
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,580
 Then the insectoid and the gray aliens began walking back towards the kitchen

331
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:41,360
 But now the insectoid is carrying the six-year-old granddaughter in its arms

332
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,440
 The insectoid looks at Peter

333
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,120
 And Peter's looking at this praying mantis type alien

334
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,560
 They've locked eyes and Peter goes listen. I don't know

335
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:04,640
 How I got this feeling I didn't get a telepathic signal. It definitely didn't say anything to me, but somehow

336
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,880
 When this thing was staring at me, I

337
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,480
 understood

338
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,480
 That this creature knew who I was

339
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 I

340
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:24,040
 Don't know how he knew that and I don't know how I knew that he knew that but I knew that

341
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,800
 When he looked at me, I could tell in some way that he knew who I was

342
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,800
 And

343
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,280
 The whole time the grandparents are just sitting there now they're watching what's going on

344
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,640
 They're not like turning on the television. They're all cranking the volume up

345
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,000
 They're like oh that insectoid his chittering is so annoying. No, they were watching it in silence

346
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,440
 They were watching these aliens move through the house go to the granddaughter's room and now they're coming out with the granddaughter

347
00:22:50,440 --> 00:23:00,280
 And they're just not doing anything about it and Peter's obviously he's in shock. He's terrified

348
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,280
 He doesn't know what to do. He's only 14 years old, but finally

349
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:11,100
 He realizes the grandparents aren't gonna stop whatever whatever is about to happen isn't going to be good

350
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,720
 The grandparents aren't gonna do anything about it. I have to do something about it and Peter said I took one step towards

351
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,360
 These aliens I took one step and the grandfather reached out and grabbed my arm

352
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,400
 And he said quote

353
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,640
 They will bring her back

354
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:41,820
 At that point the aliens are now in the kitchen and a light materialized around the four of them

355
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,960
 The emantus is still holding the little girl in his arms this light materializes and then

356
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,560
 They vanish

357
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,480
 The three aliens and the little girl just disappear and Peter said

358
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,880
 It was interesting the light appeared out of nowhere

359
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:08,720
 Everyone vanished, but then there was this odd glow left behind that remains for a few seconds after whatever this was his teleportation

360
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,680
 Sequence or whatever he goes you saw this glow last for a couple seconds and then slowly fade away

361
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,120
 Peter's just standing there completely

362
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:28,440
 What words would you even you'd basically have every human emotion every negative human emotion going on through him right now

363
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,340
 He doesn't know what happened. He's perplexed. He's terrified

364
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:38,720
 But all of this stuff he doesn't understand why no one did anything to stop this

365
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,020
 So he's just standing there and he goes maybe a minute past. There was just silence

366
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,280
 I'm standing there. The grandparents are sitting on the couch and what do you even say?

367
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,400
 I'm shocked that I saw this and then the grandpa says once again

368
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,900
 They will bring her back

369
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:07,300
 Peter says about a minute passes of stunned silence. How would you react to any of this? You just saw

370
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,340
 in the

371
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,180
 Most minimalist of terms a six-year-old girl get kidnapped

372
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:20,460
 But it wasn't just that was it there is aliens and teleportation and the fact that the grandparents the people who should be protecting this girl

373
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,500
 Let it happen and a minute passes of silence in this house

374
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,600
 And it is finally broken when the grandfather says once again, and this is a direct quote both times

375
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,300
 They

376
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,300
 Will bring her back

377
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,940
 Peter got on his bike and took off

378
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,860
 He said the whole time I was riding home

379
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:47,540
 I felt like something was following me something was ready to snatch me right off my bike. I was petrified

380
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,180
 But he made it home

381
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,540
 And he couldn't sleep

382
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,020
 She's understandable right again at the very least you saw six-year-old girl get kidnapped in front of you

383
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:06,100
 He couldn't sleep the next day. He asks his friend about what would possibly have happened

384
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,540
 He goes hey remember the other night. I

385
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,380
 Set up your grandparents computer

386
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:18,860
 You know expect this I expected to spend a couple hours explaining to them the difference between a modem and

387
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,020
 A CD-ROM no three aliens showed up and kidnapped

388
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,540
 their granddaughter

389
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,860
 What are your relatives you guys are all part of the same family what the world's going on

390
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,300
 Do you know anything about this and Peter says his friend explained to him?

391
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,540
 This isn't the first time that's happened like I'm sorry to put you in that position

392
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:45,380
 I didn't know the night you were going over was kidnapping night, but this isn't the first time that it's happened

393
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,940
 he goes this has happened a lot and

394
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,140
 Every time it's happened people have tried to stop it

395
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,060
 The grandparents have tried to stop it other family members who had been there when this happened try to stop it

396
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,540
 But they never could they can never stop this from happening and

397
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,420
 They always brought her back

398
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:15,340
 In fact, I'll tell you right now Peter she did come back home a couple hours after you left they did bring her back that night

399
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:22,360
 Because they always do and there's no way to stop it

400
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,020
 So you just let it happen

401
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:37,340
 Peter said shortly after this event the entire family moved out of the area so not just the grandparents, but

402
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,180
 Everybody

403
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,420
 Everyone who was a part of this family they just moved and he lost contact with his friend and with the grandparents

404
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,420
 He doesn't really know what happened after

405
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
 that one night

406
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,820
 It's a very interesting story what I love about it other than having one of my favorite

407
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,260
 Alien races involved in at the insectoid. We can really take this story apart

408
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,420
 I I'll try not to drone on too quickly get it

409
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,460
 You're like, you know, okay, let me explain a lot of times great aliens are considered drones

410
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,420
 Some people some UFOologists say that they are part of their own race

411
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,540
 Well, there's other UFO. I'll just who believe that the grays are actually

412
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:25,940
 Biodrones they're like organic material or their actual robots, but they're constructs. They have no feelings

413
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,260
 They have no emotions. They're basically the same as a tractor on earth

414
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,180
 It's a vehicle or a mechanism meant to carry out a study

415
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,220
 What's interesting about this one is the two gray aliens

416
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,100
 Their eyes are farther off to the sides of their heads than the normal gray alien

417
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,340
 Almost like an insectoid insectoid aliens don't have the eyes right in front of their head

418
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,820
 They're kind of offset to the sides as well not completely on the sides, but

419
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,140
 So it's almost like the gray aliens they were being manufactured

420
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,220
 to

421
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:03,660
 Serve the race they were with in this story because there's are some the gray aliens wearing clothes

422
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,860
 We actually see that a lot in UFO

423
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:13,180
 Stories like actual people's encounters with gray aliens in television and movie shows gray aliens don't wear clothes

424
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:19,260
 But when you dig through the reports great aliens wearing clothes are very very common

425
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,620
 So the silver jumpsuits that doesn't that's not really a signifier of anything

426
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,380
 That's just they do tend to wear clothes from time to time

427
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,340
 But the larger necks they were actually a little bit taller than the average gray alien or the thicker neck

428
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,020
 Taller than the average gray alien and the eyes kind of offset makes me think these may have been if not

429
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,820
 If we don't go with the gray because I don't know if I'm sold on that the gray aliens are just tools

430
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:51,460
 They're just kind of like mindless drones whether or not they're mindless drones or they do have their own unique personality

431
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,020
 Their own unique race these ones may have been genetically modified by the insectoids

432
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,740
 To appear more like them

433
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:06,540
 So that's an interesting little tidbit, but Jason actually the most interesting tidbit is the six-year-old getting kidnapped

434
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:11,700
 You're talking about fashion choices. Well, this is what is so interesting to me about

435
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,380
 UFOology with ghosts it is a very one-on-one

436
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,380
 Ghosts don't seem to be more powerful than the average human. They don't seem uniquely strong

437
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,500
 Sure, they can float through walls and they can throw stuff at you

438
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,740
 And like if you punch them your hand just goes through them

439
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:32,180
 But ghosts basically seem to be limited to the strength level of a human

440
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,020
 Aliens

441
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,700
 Have been nerfed a lot again when we talk about like television shows and movies

442
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,100
 But when you dig through the lore aliens are incredibly powerful beings

443
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:52,500
 And we see a lot of even when you look through the reports of missing time and

444
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,780
 things like that

445
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:02,240
 Being knocked unconscious that we've done a whole episode about our great aliens evolved from dolphins because they both have the same type of

446
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,060
 Sonic attacks all this interesting stuff in the lore when you watch movies and television the great aliens are just like we come in peace

447
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,580
 Clean your environment, but in real life

448
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,060
 I mean the we've come across aliens that were bulletproof

449
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,500
 We've come across aliens that people have tried stabbing them and the knife just slides off their skin

450
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:26,900
 They can also be incredibly strong again outside of all of the paranormal stuff teleportation and

451
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:34,060
 Mind-wiping people a lot of these aliens you could you could not go toe-to-toe with a reptilian or an insectoid

452
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,060
 They would gut you on the spot

453
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:42,820
 Great aliens do seem to be quite frail they seem to be built basically for

454
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:48,820
 You know pressing buttons on computers flying spaceships if they are a designed race. They're not built for combat

455
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,380
 but reptilians and

456
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:59,660
 Insectoids are like whatever world they evolved on must be hell because they're just built to kill and

457
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:07,420
 So at the end of the day like this insectoid could have just massacred everyone in this house and not have thought twice about it

458
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,220
 You could have been a house of the kid

459
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,860
 Just the way the power level the of these things is off the charts

460
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,780
 But what I like is that the insectoid wasn't doing that however

461
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:25,340
 The people did try to stop this from happening before and they never could we don't get any info on

462
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,980
 If they were physically harmed or they had some sort of psionic block on them that they couldn't move

463
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:36,580
 But to the point where the grandfather was resigned to just like not even get up off the couch

464
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,540
 He's not even pretending he has a guest over he's not even like oh great now

465
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,620
 I got to pretend that I can do this he knew it was fruitless

466
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:51,140
 He knew that they were gonna take her no matter what these beans were just far too powerful for the average human to interact with

467
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,620
 He had tried before

468
00:32:53,620 --> 00:33:00,780
 Other family members had tried before and it has failed every single time so at this and it would have had to have been a

469
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,300
 Ton of times for you not even for you to not even get off the couch

470
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:11,780
 It's that idea of the groundhog day syndrome, right? Even by day five or day 50

471
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:17,980
 You may still be trying to figure out the mystery but by the by the 200th time this had happened

472
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,540
 You're just like whatever. I'm just gonna lay in bed

473
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:28,080
 You hear the sound of the six-year-old getting kidnapped like there's nothing we can do and they always bring her back

474
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:37,020
 So if I don't do anything they're gonna bring her back if I do something there's a chance that I could get injured or that they won't bring her back

475
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,820
 You know, I think that's kind of implied as well

476
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:47,340
 If you ended up injuring these beans if you set a trap for him or busted out a shotgun and took out one of the gray aliens blew away half

477
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,700
 Of his skull

478
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,620
 You may never see your daughter again that teleportation still going to happen. They're just bringing up one less

479
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,380
 alien

480
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:03,900
 So it's a super interesting story. It's quite creepy the idea of how powerless a human is we are the

481
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,580
 dominant species on this planet, but

482
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,260
 On this planet is the key part of that sentence

483
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:19,820
 You know at any point these more powerful means can show up and do whatever they want

484
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,700
 And there's nothing you do about it

485
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:30,540
 That's the key takeaway to really UFO stories their technology is

486
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,820
 Greater than ours their scientific understanding

487
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,220
 Hand in hand with the technology would be greater than ours

488
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,660
 It's just raw power. It's just raw

489
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:45,140
 unadulterated power that we can't even understand

490
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:50,820
 We have it in our sci-fi shows and we have scientists working around the clock all over the world

491
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,740
 To move an atom from one millimeter away. That's not even a millimeter

492
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:02,300
 It's even closer than that but to make like a molecule jump and go look at look at we're working towards

493
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,580
 teleportation aliens can do that with three dudes and then pick up a fourth

494
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,540
 And then just go back home like we can't even comprehend that

495
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,380
 That's like their Sunday

496
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,580
 That's like what they that's just what they do to get around

497
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,420
 So there's saw they outmatch us on science a

498
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:26,260
 Lot of the races outmatch us on physical power. We have had stories of people shooting aliens

499
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,140
 Sure, we have had aliens get killed by humans with shotguns or

500
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,620
 Rifles or whatever it is. We have had stories of UFOs getting shot down

501
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:41,220
 By a fighter craft, but they're incredibly rare when you look at the amount of alien encounters that we have

502
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,580
 Versus the amount of alien encounters that when they come down to some sort of physical conflict the humans win

503
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:54,980
 It's incredibly rare and again you have that survivor bias. We don't have the accounts of the times the aliens killed the humans

504
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,180
 There was an encounter that went sideways and the aliens killed everybody because there's no one to tell that story

505
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,340
 So we only have the stories where people survive alien encounters and I think that may also skew

506
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:13,780
 How we feel and I'm talking about hand-to-hand combat at this point great aliens might be incredibly strong

507
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,860
 but anyone who's ever gone toe-to-toe with one and lost

508
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:23,180
 There's no one to tell the story and the people who haven't physically gone after great aliens

509
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,780
 They go I don't know yet skinny arms. He looks like a big old whim

510
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:35,580
 It's fascinating story. What do you do when an overwhelming force takes the person you love?

511
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:43,580
 It's a simple question, but it has no answer if it was a

512
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:51,460
 Armed raid from across your nation's borders where they broke in and they sacked the town and took all the women back home with

513
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,660
 Them the town population could get what guns they had left and rally an army and go to take them back

514
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,860
 We've seen that happen throughout history

515
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:05,580
 But if an invading army simply teleported into your house and

516
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:11,140
 Took your wife and then teleported away

517
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:17,460
 First off where do you even attack? Where did this army come from? Who are they?

518
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,620
 overwhelming force

519
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,620
 superior technology

520
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,820
 massive

521
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:30,860
 physical strength differences all of these things add up to make humans quite weak on the galactic scale

522
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:37,700
 So when these encounters do happen when this

523
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,180
 Really for lack of a better term invading force

524
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:49,480
 Canaps the ones we love the most we know we can't defeat them. We know we can't fight back all we can do

525
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,460
 is hope

526
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,340
 That they bring our loved ones back

527
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,980
 But if they don't

528
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,260
 They're still

529
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,460
 Nothing we can do about it

530
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:11,180

 Tick tock is at the rubber radio that rubber radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast

533
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,380
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listen to it today

534
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:53,060
 In America it's estimated that four percent of people in prison are actually

535
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,340
 innocent

536
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:00,340
 When I saw them for the very first time like I knew who my jury will be doing trial to be honest

537
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:08,620
 I knew I lost in in 2002 the state of Georgia found Kerry guilty for his alleged involvement in a vicious rape

538
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,880
 Only a small

539
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,460
 Percentage of those people have their convictions overturned, you know, it's one great justice said many years ago

540
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,480
 We don't find our witnesses from church pews. What series of events led to Kerry's wrongful conviction

541
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:30,120
 Could this happen to anyone what finally convinced the courts to overturn his conviction

542
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:36,060
 From zappier in partnership with the Georgia innocence project. This is the four percent
