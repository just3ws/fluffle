 Brought to you by Mammoth Live and AG Touring.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Today we go for a hike in the Orgonian Woods...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 And watch our back for the sound of a noisy ghost.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Was he there?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Was he there?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 And then we travel to Brazil to look at the story of a group of warriors...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Who went toe to toe with a one-eyed alien.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 And then that alien started sleeping with their women.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 We got a problem.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 We got a problem.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 It's a very interesting one.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 We'll talk about that in a second.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 A little teaser for you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Jimmy Moore!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Jimmy Moore, named after that hit Britney Spears song, Jimmy Moore.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 I bet you didn't know that Jimmy.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 That's how you got that name.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Jimmy, Jimmy Moore, Jimmy, Jimmy Moore.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 I love that song.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Anyways, thank you Jimmy.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 You are another enduring part of Britney Spears Legacy.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 You are going to be our pilot, our guide for this episode.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 That really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 We also have a merch store.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 It's in the show notes.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And, if you're supporting the Patreon and I haven't gotten your address yet for the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 stickers, send me your address over.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Because we're starting to mail those stickers out and they're really, really cool.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Now, Jimmy, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy, but just keep it idling

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 right now.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Outdoors, not, we're not in the garage.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Something weird is going on.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Something weird is going on.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 This is what I meant by saying we have a problem, guys.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 So, every day I wake up and I go to about five different news websites.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 I go to Fox News, CNN, Drudge Report.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 That's where I get my mainstream news at.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 And, Drudge Report always has some weird tabloid headlines and stuff like that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 So, I got that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 And then I'll go to the export and I'll go to Reddit.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Between all of those combined, I usually get about four to eight leads.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 I may not fully investigate any of those stories.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 There may be a story that's so intriguing I'm recording that day.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 You can go either way.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 What's super weird is in the past five or six days I have gotten in almost no news stories.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 At all.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Across all those formats.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 At all.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 The last story I got actually was from Reddit.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 We're going to cover it Friday.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 It's a mind-blower.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 I never, ever, ever heard of this story before.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 It's absolutely jaw-droppingly nuts.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Almost got no engagement on Reddit.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Vito, Vito Scoletta sent me a story last night.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 I don't think I'm going to do a full story on it, but I wanted to give him a mention.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Because it's fairly intriguing.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 I guess the video, this was on the export.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 The video game Carneval was created by, it was interesting because it started off really interesting.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And then, like a lot of this stuff does, the mythology starts tripping up the myth.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Originally, the video game was supposed to have this deleted level that was considered too obscene.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 When Midway was looking at it, it was a tunnel of love theme.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Carneval is a light shooter video game where you're like, it's pretty gross.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Especially for its time it came out in the 90s.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 And apparently they had a tunnel of love level that people thought probably had like,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 "S" and "D" stuff in it.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Midway goes gross.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 You can't do that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 That's possible, right?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 There's possible some programmers are joking around.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 But then it gets into this thing that it's really this cult.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 This ancient cult was building the video game and some of the programmers were like,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 working for the cult and one of them was trying to meet one of the Sailor Moon characters.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And I checked out at that point.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 So thanks for the recommendation, but other than the story we're going to talk about Friday,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 which I'm not going to give away, and the Carneval story.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Oh, and some guy's also saying he's made telepathic communication with a cute alien.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 I mean, that's all I've gotten in the past four or five days.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 I'm not covering that story, right?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 It's almost seen.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 You could say it's the news cycle.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 You go, Jason, things are really turbulent right now.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 No, that's not it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 I've been doing research like this for years and years and years,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 and I've never run into a drought like this.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 I mean, obviously it could be that I'm getting more picky,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 but I'm not even getting stuff to be picky about.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Carneval, cute alien telepathic girl, and the Friday story,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 which I'm probably hyping up at this point, but I mean, it's super bizarre.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And it's real.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 It's one of those stories that worked its way through the legal system and the court system and stuff like that.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 It involves all sorts of stuff, space and conspiracy and truth, right?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 It almost-- I don't know, man.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 I don't know.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 It almost-- I don't know, man.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 It feels like maybe the veil's tightening, maybe thing.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 And hopefully I'm wrong.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Hopefully we just aren't some weird dry spell,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 but what if the world is getting less weird?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 It'd be a very dull place if across five websites that I normally get four to eight weird stories,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 I'm finding nothing except two people arping on the export

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 and then this story that happened back in the '80s.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 The weird story again happened in the past back in the '80s, so.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Who knows?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 But it is something we're going to keep an eye on.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Okay, so you got that car warmed up, Jimmy.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 We are driving out from Hood River, Oregon.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Bup, bup, bup.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 We are headed to-- oh, Oregon.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 I forgot.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 We're going to Oregon.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 We're leaving Hood River, Oregon.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 We are headed to Forest Grove, Oregon.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 So it's the early 1900s, Forest Grove, Oregon.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And there we're going to meet an unnamed dude.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 I know, I just heard your eyes roll.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 My eyes rolled as well.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 We just heard we are going to meet this big, giant, unnamed dude.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 We're going to name him Barry.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 He's just a big, strapping man.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 He's an outdoorsman, so of course you're going to be strapping.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And he does chops down trees and stuff like that.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 That's not his job.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 He's actually an accountant.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 That's what he does on the weekend.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 He chops down trees.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 But he's most known, not for being a big burly guy,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 because that's pretty much a lot of woodsmen.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 It is-- he's known for having a big brass bugle.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 He always carried around with him in the middle of the woods.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Which, you know, could be like a romantic thing, you know,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 like a guy up alone in the woods, his dog sitting next to him.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 You're like out and you see like a little silhouette on the mountain side.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 You see a little dog and you see a guy, a mournful soul with his bugle.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And you're like stoking the campfire and stuff like that.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 That's not what he did.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 That's not what this guy did.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 That would be fine, right?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 That would be slightly romantic.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 But he wouldn't do that.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 He may have done that after work as the accountant.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 What he was known for, what this guy was known for,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 is you would be in the woods, okay?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 You would be in the woods.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 You're hunting.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 You're fishing.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 You're enjoying the solitude of me.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 This is so funny.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 I love this guy.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Except for what he does later.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 You would enjoy the solitude of nature.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 You go out to woods to find some peace.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 This dude would creep up behind you, this guy would creep up behind you

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 with his big bugle, get as close as he could and go

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 (bark)

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 and totally freak you out, right?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 You've been in the woods.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 You've been alone for like two hours at this point.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Just a little fishing rod.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 (bark)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 (bark)

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 and then (bark)

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 I'm moving away from the mic to do that sound effect.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 He wasn't.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 He was getting as close as possible to blow a giant bugle right in your ear.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 So people in town hated his guts.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 They absolutely hated him.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 So when he was found murdered, or more specifically

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 when he was found killed later on,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 I don't think there was a really big obituary written for this guy.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Assuming he's real.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Now again, before I finish the story, we're going to put our skeptic cats on

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 because we're going to take it off in a second.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 This story, this is the local legend.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 The fact that we don't have an exact time period

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 or the name of the guy makes it very suspicious this guy may have never existed.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 But in Forrest Grove, this is the local legend.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 People do believe this is real, while others may just poo-poo the whole thing.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Burn that skeptic cat, because now we're going to get into the fun stuff.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 So anyways, this dude's body is found dead.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Now the story is that they find him,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 and next to him they find a dead mountain lion.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 And this dude was totally like all gashed up and stuff.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 "Ah no, the dramatic reenactment. No, my face, oh no, not my arm, oh no, my other arm."

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 And he's getting eaten up by this dude, this mountain lion.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 But at the same time he's using this brass bugle, it's so heavy

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 he's just bashing in this mountain lion's skull.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 So they basically both kill each other in their blood pools together into one big puddle.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 And that's the end.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 I mean, that's interesting, right?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 A practical joker getting killed by a mountain lion, maybe he tried surprising him.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Maybe the hunter became the hunted.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 But what makes this story unique is that it is one of the very few times that a ghost kills a person.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 What? You haven't even gotten to the ghost part yet.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 So what happens is they start finding people in the woods with their heads bashed in.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 What? What's going on?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 The detective comes out there, he's shining, they don't have flashlights.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 The detective comes out there, he's holding a candle, he's dropping wax all over the crime scene.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 He's covering up all the fingerprints.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 It appears that this man has had his face caved in.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 And according to all my experience being a forensic scientist and a band leader,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 I can tell that this injury is caused by a large brass bugle.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Does anyone in town know anyone who has a large brass bugle?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 What? Well, Barry used to? Well, let's get him.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Barry's been dead for two years, detective.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 Huh? You like that? Theater of the Mind, folks!

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Bet you pictured that perfectly.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 People are starting to get found in the woods with their heads bashed in with the bugle.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Now, it's funny, I was telling Sabine this story and I was like, "Yeah, and this ghost killed a bunch of people."

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 And she's like, "Oh, okay."

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 I was like, "That's super rare."

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 It's incredibly rare to come across a story where a ghost is killing people.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 In my experience, like off the top of my head, I know of two.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 And I've been researching this stuff for decades.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Two actual ghost killing people.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 We've had stories of like Freddy Kruger is based on a demon in Hmong culture.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 That's a demon.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 We've had stories about, um, actually, I have an upcoming story about a village that was getting killed by a spirit,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 but that was like a haunting curse.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 As far as a human dying and the ghost coming back and killing people, extremely rare.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 At the top of my head, I can think of two. Lucky Boy Mine, which we covered that a long time ago.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 We just did a repeat of that.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 And this story is very, very rare.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 And it's funny because Sabine was surprised because in the movies, it's super common.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 A ghost is killing people.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 That's the movies, guys.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 In real life, in real ghost life, it's extremely rare.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Extremely rare.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 So, one, that makes me think that this guy was not killed by a mountain lion.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 If he existed, let's again assume he just existed.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Somebody got bugled by this dude, right?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Just burp right in his ear and then killed him.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 And then, maybe he already had a dead mountain lion in the backseat of his car.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 And he's like, "Ugh, they didn't have cars."

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Maybe he had a back--in the backseat of his horse.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 "Ugh, throws a dead mountain lion on top of Barry, our bugler."

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Who knows?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 I mean, okay, that's a little--that's a little harder to pull off.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 He kills a man and he's like, "And now I must hunt a mountain lion to have the perfect crime."

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 He spends the next four days in there trying to track down a mountain lion.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 But it doesn't make sense why a man would get killed by a mountain lion.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 A man who wasn't murdering people in the first place, okay?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 He was a normal jerk.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 He basically would have a YouTube channel with two million subscribers if he did this today.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 And he was a normal guy and then he gets killed by a mountain lion

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 and then he begins murdering people.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Like, that's--first off, ghost murdering people is extremely rare.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 But then, to have just--I just think it's--that's weird enough.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 But then, to not be a revenge-seeking ghost.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 The Lucky Boy Mine was a revenge-seeking ghost.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 There, there, odd story.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 The reason why people think that the bugler was doing this was that

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 some guy almost got his head caved in and he turns around and as he sees the bugle coming towards his head,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 he turns around and sees a ghastly glowing outline of a man whose face was all gashed up.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Uuugh!

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 And he's swinging the bugle and the guy jumped out of the way.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 And then he went to town and said, "This dude who--who may or may not be fictional, honestly,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 but this dude tried killing me with the bugle and his face was all gross."

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 And people go, "Oh, we know who that is."

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 There's only one gross guy who ever played with the bugle and that was Barry.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 So, an exceptional story because we have a ghost murdering people.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 It's super, super, super--and you could go Jason Wille, your cherry picking.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Maybe the ghost demon.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Even if we included demons killing people, we're still looking at maybe a dozen of like a ghost--

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 of a non-caporial ghost, not a possessed person, but a non-caporial ghost or a demon killing someone.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Not making them kill themselves, actually killing them.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 We're looking at maybe a dozen stories.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 It's incredibly, incredibly rare.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 So basically, more of the story is, don't go to Forest Grove, Oregon.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Apparently, there's skies making weird sounds.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 There are ghosts can do the impossible.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 People still think this guy's out there.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 This guy's still out there playing that lonely bugle.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 I'm actually thinking about visiting some of these haunted places in Oregon.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 If you guys know how much I despise traveling, you guys would be like, "Oh, I'd go there all the time.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 I don't like--I don't like going any place I can't walk back home from."

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 So anyways, I may go to Forest Grove or I may just stand a camera crew down there and I'll watch them.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 I'll watch them like Obama was watching Osama bin Laden being killed.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 I'm just watching on cam.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 I'm like, "Good job, guys."

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 They're just like watching the spooky forest that I'm eating popcorn.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 I'm watching them just getting killed with bugles and I'm like, "Too spooky.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 I'm so glad I'm not there.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 So glad I sent out my B team."

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Not the fans that I really love.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Jimmy Moore, light up that carbonicopter.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 We're leaving behind Forest Grove, Oregon.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 I want you to fly us all the way out to Brazil.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 [imitates flying]

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Flying over the Pacific Ocean.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 We're headed out to that emerald country.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 I don't know, the country with a bunch of trees.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 See, it's the only country with a bunch of trees.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 We're flying out there.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Now, most of this information, really all of it, I got from a very well-written post on Above Top Secret as a website.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 It was written by someone named Fro Charoka.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 So I want to give a tip of the hat to that, a tip of the space helmet to you.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Thank you so much for doing all this research.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Now, I did find a couple other mentions of this.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 It wasn't a fictional story, but for the most part, because of the age of the story and because of the language barrier,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 you don't find a lot of stuff.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Like, when people send me stuff from Mexico and Brazil, I really love to read it, or really any country.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 But I was getting a lot of stuff from Fabio from Italy.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 There is that language barrier.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 It makes it a little bit harder.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 And actually, I can run and translate on it.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Just, there's not a lot of resources on it to begin with.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 It hasn't really got into the paranormal world.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 We're going to go out to the Sara Pucatote Mountain.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 [imitates a sound of a mountain]

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Now, everything used to be sepia tone, and now it's all lush green jungles and stuff like that.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 But this story still takes place fairly recently, in the past 100 and 150 years.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 So this story takes place an old time in Brazil.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 There's a tribe known as the Bendocari tribe.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 So they're walking around and stuff.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 They can do other stuff.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 They can also sit and sleep, but there are no Matic tribe.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 So they go where the food goes.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 So they got their arrows, and they're looking, and they see like this gazelle standing there,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 and they go to shoot in and moves.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 And then they go shoot in and moves again.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 And they go to shoot in and moves again.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 And next thing they know, they're 400 miles away, and they finally kill it.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 And they're like, "All right, where do we cook it at?"

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 And they're like, "Oh man, we left the fire.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 We left the fire all the way back there."

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 So they got to set up a new fire.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 And then the next day they see Gazelle walking, they're like, "This time we're going to kill it right here."

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 And then they end up in another country.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 They end up camping near this Sarah Pucatote mountain in Brazil.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So they're sitting there, they're eating their gazelle,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 which I don't actually even think exist in Brazil, right?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 They're eating a taper or something, right?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Originally they were hunting a gazelle in Africa, and then they chased it across the ocean.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 It's all swimming.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 They're swimming after it.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 They're swimming in Brazil.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 So they're eating a taper, they're eating a big old bow constrictor, whatever's down there.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 And they see mist all around the mountain.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And you're like, "Jason, that's pretty normal."

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 But this was cursed mist.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 See, at this mountain they would often see like weird lights,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 and like the mist seemed especially cursed.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 They're like, "Don't go to the mountain. That mountain's spooky.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Like we can hang out down here.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 We can eat all the animals we want.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Don't go to the mountain."

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 But they are camping near the mountain.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 They see the mist.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 And then one time they see a light,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 [explosion]

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 fly out of the dark night sky through the mist,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 and then [explosion]

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 crash somewhere near the foot of the mountain.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 So they go, "We better go investigate that tomorrow morning."

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Like, let's not go, let's not rush to go out there right now.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 What they used to describe it as was a flying canoe.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 So the next morning they get the warriors and they wake up.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 They get the actual street gang, the warriors.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 They fly them out from New York City.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 They get the warriors of the tribe and they're like, "Wake up, wake up.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 You gotta go check out that big old flying canoe."

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, I forgot about that."

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 And the warrior was hoping everyone else forgot about it

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 because he's super scared.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 He's like, "Oh yeah, I'm already sure it's nothing."

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 I think I saw that last week. It's no big deal.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 They have it all the time.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Anyway, the warriors, the super scared warriors go out to where it's at

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 and they see a man, not a man, a humanoid thing

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 kind of walking around where the canoe had crashed.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 And they're like, "Oh, that's weird."

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 They see this guy walking around, right?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 And he's like big and puffy.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 He's like a big puffy dude walking around.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 And he turns and he looks at the warriors

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 and he has just one giant eyeball on his face.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 The warrior's kind of, "Ugh."

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 First they just thought he was like a puffy albino dude,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 but now they realize he's an alien.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 So they start shooting arrows at him.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 That's their first instinct because this is an outsider,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 this is an invader.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 And the guy doesn't even flinch.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Arrows are just going, "Point, point, point, point."

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Bouncing off of them.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 One eye just staring at him.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 And then the dude, this alien guy, has this big old stick

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 and he points it at a rock and the rock disappears.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 So the warriors can't look at each other at this point.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 They can't run away.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 This is the reason they exist.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 They have to protect their tribe.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 They've been training their entire life for combat.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 They get another volley of arrows.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 They're shooting arrows.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 "Pling, plink, plink, plink, plink.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Shoot him in the eye.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Shoot him in the eye."

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Someone says, "Pling, plink, doesn't matter."

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 He points the staff at a tree.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 [explosion]

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Tree disintegrates.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 One of the warrior pulls out his club,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 runs up and starts beating the guy, beating the alien up.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Alien just shrugs the dude off.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 He points his wand at one of the tribe members.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 He passes out, just falls to the ground.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 He points at another one.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Arrows are still bouncing off this dude.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 "Ping, plink, plink, plink."

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 He points at another one.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 That guy passes out too.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 At this point, the warriors are like,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 "Okay, I need to get a new profession.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 I wonder if I can still get into that hunter-gatherer thing

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 I've been hearing about."

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 They grab their fallen comrades.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 They take off into the jungle and they look behind

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 and they see this one-eyed monster just kind of standing there.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Not that one-eyed monster.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Don't be perverted.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 They see it standing there.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And from that time on, people are like,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 "Okay, remember how we said the mountain was cursed?"

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 And all that like, mist and stuff.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 It's 100% cursed now.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 There's a one-eyed monster there that he's shooting you with stuff.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Again, don't be dirty.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 He's shooting you with stuff and he's making you fall asleep

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 and just stay away from that mountain.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 And one's like, "What?"

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 So, people just kind of avoided that area.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 And since it's a nomadic tribe, it wasn't a huge issue.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 They're still kind of moving around the area.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 A couple years later, some people are hanging out.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 They go to the, like, Laundromat,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 aka the lake to do their laundry.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 And someone sees this giant dude,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 just skinny-dipping.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 And they're like, "What?"

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 And then they stand there and they watched for a while.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 And then, like, 20 minutes later, they're still watching.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 And someone's like, "Hey, Onako, are you done doing the laundry yet?"

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 And she's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, almost. I'm almost there."

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 She's still watching this guy just swim around naked.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 And then after she's gotten a good eyeful or two,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 she goes back to village.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 She's smoking a cigarette.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 She goes, "You guys won't believe what I saw.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 There's this giant naked dude, skinny-dipping,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 and all the girls are like, "Oh, the choppin's like,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 'No, no, no, you crazy girls. Let's send the warriors out.'"

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 And the warriors are like, "Mmm-hmm, yeah, we want to see it, too."

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 So anyways, the warriors go out and there's this giant naked guy

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 swimming in this lake.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 And he turns around and he goes,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 "Hey, hey guys, how you doing?"

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 And he's speaking their language.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 And they're like, "What? How'd you know that?

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 How'd you know to speak a language?"

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 And he goes, "I know a lot about you guys.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 You guys might not recognize me

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 because I'm this giant, tall, albino-looking dude,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 but you guys shot a bunch of arrows at me a couple years ago."

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And they're like, "What? No, that was a one-eyed monster

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 that we were shooting stuff at."

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 And he's like, "You mean that?"

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 And he points over.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 You guys might have picked up on this to begin with his space suit.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 His astronaut space suit.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 He says his name is Bepp Caroti.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 And in that language of that tribe,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 it means "starborn" or "man of the stars."

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 And he goes, "Listen, I know we got off to a bad start.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 I paralyzed a couple of you guys,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 and I destroyed that rock."

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 And someone goes, "That was my favorite rock."

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 I'm sorry, man. I know it was your favorite rock,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 but I was trying to show you guys how powerful it was.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 We got off to a bad start, but I'm kind of bored and lonely.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 You see, I'm not going to be able to leave for a while.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 I'm stuck here on your planet.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Can I hang out with you guys?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 So they invited him into the tribe.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 The other option is they say "no," and he's like,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 "Then I'll destroy you all."

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 I mean, like, you're going to invite him into your tribe, right?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 He's a super powerful monster man

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 who paralyzed your greatest warriors.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Really, I'm not going to tell him no.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 So he comes to the tribe, he starts hanging out.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Now, we have this weird classic tale

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 where he's hanging out at the tribe,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 and there's like a young maiden watching him.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 He has clothes on at this point.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 I'm assuming, I don't think he was naked the whole time,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 but there's this young maiden kind of checking him out,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 and he's sitting there, and he's eating dinner,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 and he's like, "Oh, this is really good."

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 And she's like waiting him.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 And then he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 So, I mean, that's just a weird name.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Maybe it's a normal name in that community,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 but I don't think so.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 I don't... It could be wrong.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 That could be the most racist thing I've ever said on the show.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 They're like, "What? President of Brazil?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 His name is Cobb, you racist.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 I'm pretty sure it's a space alien name."

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Again, could be wrong,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 but the fact that her dad was a space alien,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 I think I'm fine on saying that Cobb is a space alien name.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Anyways, while he's raising this family,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 he also starts teaching them to not be nomads anymore.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 They're like, "Go to hunt the gazelle."

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 And he's like, "No, no, no. Not only is that animal

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 not indigenous to this continent,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 but you don't have to do that anymore.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 I'm going to show you how you can build a civilization in one place.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 And I'm going to make your weapons better.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 I'm going to train your warriors to be better.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 And then there's a montage of him like training the warriors.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 They're like punching sides of gazelle flesh.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 They invent stairs, and then they're running up them.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And Beth is sitting there with his little timer.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Click. Yeah, good job. Good job.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 It's a sundial. They have to run until it goes from 1 to 2 p.m.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Everyone's training. He teaches them how to build a better society.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 And then, so everything's going great.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 He's met the love of his life. He's having kids.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 He's training these people to become much better fighters.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 He's training them to become a more cohesive civilization.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 So one day, everything's going great, right?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 He's building up their society. He has grandkids for crying out loud.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 One day he goes out on a hunt.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 He's showing the hunters how to do this stuff.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 He's like, "This is how you do it. You don't have to track him across two continents.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 You can do this."

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Arrow goes right through the tapers neck.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 [BEEPING]

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Great job, Beth. Thanks for showing us that.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Beth?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Beth?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Beth is gone.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 Where did he go? I don't know. Where'd he go?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 The hunters get back to the village,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 and everyone in the village is like, "Uh, dude, dude, get ready.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 We think something bad's going to happen."

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 What happened? Well, Beth came back here,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 and he painted his family black.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 So that's just weird. That's just weird, right?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 That's very, very uncommon that someone's going to come back,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 paint their family any color, really,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 and be having a good day.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 But he paints them black, and he locks them in the hut.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And as they're telling the hunters this,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 they notice Beth, he's walking out from behind the hut,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 wearing his astronaut suit.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 Which everyone in town knows full well is

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 arrow-proof, and spear-proof, and club-proof.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 And he walks into the center village, and he starts going,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 "Okay, guys, who's going to fight me?"

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 "I am taking control of this village,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 unless one of you guys stops me."

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 You're a space alien who's indestructible,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 and you have magical powers. We're not going to fight.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 He then, because no one will fight him,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 he starts upsetting the forest on fire.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 He's like, "Okay, who's going to fight me?"

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 "Who's going to fight me?"

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 People are like, "Bep, no one's going to fight you, right?"

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 "For first off, there's a raging forest fire behind you,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 and I'm pretty sure your family's in a thatched hut,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 so not a great planning on that one.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 But secondly, bro, we're not going to fight you.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 What's going on?"

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 And Bep says, "That's it. That's it. I'm out of here."

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 And he walks out of the village,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 flaming forest fire, leaving his family painted black in the hut.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 He walks out of the village, and they watch him.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 I don't know how they saw this part.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 I mean, unless Inspector Gadget has his telescopic eyes,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 they watch him walk all the way to the mountain.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And at that point, a beam...

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 BOOM!

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Shines on the family's hut.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 People run into the hut.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 At this point, I'm assuming they've put out the fire.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 Otherwise, everyone's been burned to death, but they run into the hut,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 they open the door.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 His family's gone, and they see the flying canoe.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 *Swoosh*

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 Fly through space.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 But his family being gone

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 isn't entirely accurate, because his daughter,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 his son-in-law, and his grandchild are still left there.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 So they automatically, they're like, "Ask the daughter."

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 They ask his daughter, "What was that?"

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Like, "What just happened?"

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 She's like, "I don't know why my dad did that, but I do know this."

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 "He'll always be in here."

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 She taps her head.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Because I've been in contact, I'm in telepathic contact with him.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 And if we ever need our help again, he'll come back.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Fast forward years later,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 crops aren't doing too well.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 All of the structure that Bepp had set up starts to fall apart.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 Crops aren't doing well.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Famine hits, disease hits.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 The village is dying off.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 And one day, and the daughters watching all this happen,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 and everyone's getting sick, and she goes,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 "Now's the time."

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 In our darkest hour,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 she paints herself and her kid and her husband black.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 She prays

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 to her father.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 [BOOM]

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 The light canoe comes back.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 He comes back down, goes, "What?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 You guys have totally messed this stuff up."

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 "I told you to irrigate, irrigate, irrigate.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 What's this?"

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 He replants all their crops, gives them new crops,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 gives them crops that were not indigenous to the area at all.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 He shows them how to build stone houses,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 which technically he should have shown them how to do that the first time.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 He actually tells them to get closer to the mountain.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 "This should be your home, closer to the mountain.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 This mountain will help protect you."

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 And they change the name of the tribe at that point to the "Cayapo."

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And to this day, they have celebrations

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 where the people in the village have a bamboo suit

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 that they wear and they dance around in as their celebration to bep.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Now, what's interesting, when you look at the photos of this guy,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 the first thing you think of, that looks like an astronaut suit.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 In the 1970s, you had some kids that had come from those tribes into other, like, big cities.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 This isn't one of those--this tribe still exists.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 It's not one of those completely isolated tribes.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 And this story I told you about, this is--when I said "Old Time Brazil,"

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 we're not talking 1400s, 1200s, 600s Brazil.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 We're talking, like, 17, 1800s Brazil.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 There was a time period fairly recent that this story took place.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 This isn't a creation myth.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 The conquistadors had already been there.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 This tribe was already interacting with other nations.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 But they're just like, "Nope, we don't want any part of that,"

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 and they were moving around Brazil.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 This wasn't an ancient, ancient myth.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 So you have people still doing the ceremony at Bep.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 And when you have these kids do a cultural exchange,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 they went to a big city and they're seeing footage

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 and seeing photos of US astronauts landed on the moon.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 They go, "That is what Bep Karate looked like."

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 That is--that's exactly what he looked like.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 That was the description.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 That one eye is basically the giant glass visor.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Which is how you--if you're calling stuff flying canoes,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 if you saw an astronaut turn around and look at you,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 it would look like a giant eyeball.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 So that's the story of Bep Karate.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 It definitely could be--we got to run through these always.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 It could be fiction.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 It could be 100% fiction made up.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 That's leaked onto the internet and has become this story.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 It's definitely possible.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Two, it could be made up at the time.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 It could be a legend that was made up by the tribe

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 to explain certain things.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Someone's like, "Where'd you get those beet seeds at?"

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 And he's like, "Uhhh, let me tell you a story.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 Let me tell you a really long, complicated story

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 about an alien coming down and having kids and stuff like that."

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 The person who originally made the story popular

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 before it got to a above-top secret was

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Hawa Ameriko Arett.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 He was a researcher who worked with Native tribes,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 and he was with the tribe like in the '70s.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 So even if it was 100 years from when--

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 even if their timeline was accurate, we're talking 1800s.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 I'm giving them a little bit of wiggle room,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 but that means that that genetic line, Bep's kid--

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 if he had a daughter and the daughter had a son,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 and that was only 100 years ago, 150 years ago maybe,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 you know, give or take some years, and that was happening,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 that genetic line should still exist in that group of people.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 There should still be someone who were now

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 maybe five generations removed, six generations removed

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 from this story.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 We should still be able to find a spark

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 of genetic information of this star man.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 But the thing is, this story is so obscure,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 nobody really knows about it.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 If this story was more popular, you know that History Channel

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 or Gaia or whatever would send someone out there

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 to start testing these people's DNA to see if they could find

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 the star child.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Nobody knows about this story.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 I think it would be really interesting,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 and I think people in that community would want to know

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 because it would prove their story that their culture is based around.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 So yeah, if you work for one of those companies, why not?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 If you work for one of those companies and you're listening

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 to my podcast, let's do this.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 We can actually, again, with their permission--

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 I'm not saying that we need to take their blood against their permission,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 but with their permission, let's--

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 we can prove if this is real.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 If this is real.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 If there really was a man from the stars who slept with a woman

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 and had kids and grandkids, and most likely it went on from there,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 and then came back again to give them more fruits and vegetables

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 and stuff like that, and maybe, you know,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 dropped off a couple of gazelles.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Those gazelles they'd been hunting all along,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Bepp dropped some off from their ship.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 So if you're ever driving through the middle of nowhere

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 and you happen to see a spaceship crash in the distance,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 you will want to check it out.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 I think we all would want to check it out.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 I would check it out via webcam.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 But if you drive off towards the crash site

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 to see if there really is a crash ship there,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 just make sure that you're not traveling with any attractive women.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Or if you are an attractive woman yourself, just be prepared.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Because the alien that crashed on the ship may not just be

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 an indestructible warrior.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 He may also be a man looking for the love of his life.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 I mean, ladies, could you do worse than an alien?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Who can make stuff disappear?

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 But guys, be careful, because you're hunting with your girl

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 and she sees this giant naked dude walking around.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 No matter how much you swing your club,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 it doesn't work.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 This other guy just bounces off this other dude.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Don't blame me when she leaves you.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 I'm telling you right now, if you want to keep your girlfriend,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 don't go towards the crash UFO.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 But if you're a girl and you're looking for love,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 you should just keep heading out to that crash site

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 until you approach the radioactive debris.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Nah, that's not dangerous.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 That's just the glow of romance.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
