 Brought to you by Mammoth Live and AG Touring.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Today we go for a hike in the Orgonian Woods...

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 And watch our back for the sound of a noisy ghost.

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Was he there?

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Was he there?

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 And then we travel to Brazil to look at the story of a group of warriors...

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Who went toe to toe with a one-eyed alien.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And then that alien started sleeping with their women.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I'm having a great day.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 We got a problem.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 We got a problem.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It's a very interesting one.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 We'll talk about that in a second.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 A little teaser for you.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Jimmy Moore!

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Jimmy Moore, named after that hit Britney Spears song, Jimmy Moore.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I bet you didn't know that Jimmy.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 That's how you got that name.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Jimmy, Jimmy Moore, Jimmy, Jimmy Moore.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I love that song.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Anyways, thank you Jimmy.

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You are another enduring part of Britney Spears Legacy.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 You are going to be our pilot, our guide for this episode.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 That really, really helps out a lot.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 We also have a merch store.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 It's in the show notes.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And, if you're supporting the Patreon and I haven't gotten your address yet for the

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 stickers, send me your address over.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Because we're starting to mail those stickers out and they're really, really cool.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Now, Jimmy, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy, but just keep it idling

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 right now.

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Outdoors, not, we're not in the garage.

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Something weird is going on.

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Something weird is going on.

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 This is what I meant by saying we have a problem, guys.

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 So, every day I wake up and I go to about five different news websites.

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I go to Fox News, CNN, Drudge Report.

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 That's where I get my mainstream news at.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And, Drudge Report always has some weird tabloid headlines and stuff like that.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So, I got that.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And then I'll go to the export and I'll go to Reddit.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Between all of those combined, I usually get about four to eight leads.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I may not fully investigate any of those stories.

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 There may be a story that's so intriguing I'm recording that day.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 You can go either way.

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 What's super weird is in the past five or six days I have gotten in almost no news stories.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 At all.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Across all those formats.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 At all.

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 The last story I got actually was from Reddit.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 We're going to cover it Friday.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It's a mind-blower.

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I never, ever, ever heard of this story before.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 It's absolutely jaw-droppingly nuts.

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Almost got no engagement on Reddit.

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Vito, Vito Scoletta sent me a story last night.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I don't think I'm going to do a full story on it, but I wanted to give him a mention.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Because it's fairly intriguing.

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I guess the video, this was on the export.

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 The video game Carneval was created by, it was interesting because it started off really interesting.

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And then, like a lot of this stuff does, the mythology starts tripping up the myth.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Originally, the video game was supposed to have this deleted level that was considered too obscene.

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 When Midway was looking at it, it was a tunnel of love theme.

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Carneval is a light shooter video game where you're like, it's pretty gross.

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Especially for its time it came out in the 90s.

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And apparently they had a tunnel of love level that people thought probably had like,

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 "S" and "D" stuff in it.

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Midway goes gross.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 You can't do that.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 That's possible, right?

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 There's possible some programmers are joking around.

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But then it gets into this thing that it's really this cult.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 This ancient cult was building the video game and some of the programmers were like,

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 working for the cult and one of them was trying to meet one of the Sailor Moon characters.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And I checked out at that point.

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So thanks for the recommendation, but other than the story we're going to talk about Friday,

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 which I'm not going to give away, and the Carneval story.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Oh, and some guy's also saying he's made telepathic communication with a cute alien.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I mean, that's all I've gotten in the past four or five days.

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I'm not covering that story, right?

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 It's almost seen.

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 You could say it's the news cycle.

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 You go, Jason, things are really turbulent right now.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 No, that's not it.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I've been doing research like this for years and years and years,

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 and I've never run into a drought like this.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I mean, obviously it could be that I'm getting more picky,

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 but I'm not even getting stuff to be picky about.

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Carneval, cute alien telepathic girl, and the Friday story,

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 which I'm probably hyping up at this point, but I mean, it's super bizarre.

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And it's real.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 It's one of those stories that worked its way through the legal system and the court system and stuff like that.

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It involves all sorts of stuff, space and conspiracy and truth, right?

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It almost-- I don't know, man.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 I don't know.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 It almost-- I don't know, man.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 It feels like maybe the veil's tightening, maybe thing.

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And hopefully I'm wrong.

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Hopefully we just aren't some weird dry spell,

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 but what if the world is getting less weird?

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 It'd be a very dull place if across five websites that I normally get four to eight weird stories,

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I'm finding nothing except two people arping on the export

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 and then this story that happened back in the '80s.

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 The weird story again happened in the past back in the '80s, so.

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Who knows?

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 But it is something we're going to keep an eye on.

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Okay, so you got that car warmed up, Jimmy.

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 We are driving out from Hood River, Oregon.

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Bup, bup, bup.

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 We are headed to-- oh, Oregon.

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I forgot.

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 We're going to Oregon.

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 We're leaving Hood River, Oregon.

140
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 We are headed to Forest Grove, Oregon.

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So it's the early 1900s, Forest Grove, Oregon.

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And there we're going to meet an unnamed dude.

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 I know, I just heard your eyes roll.

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 My eyes rolled as well.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 We just heard we are going to meet this big, giant, unnamed dude.

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 We're going to name him Barry.

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 He's just a big, strapping man.

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 He's an outdoorsman, so of course you're going to be strapping.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And he does chops down trees and stuff like that.

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 That's not his job.

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 He's actually an accountant.

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 That's what he does on the weekend.

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 He chops down trees.

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But he's most known, not for being a big burly guy,

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 because that's pretty much a lot of woodsmen.

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It is-- he's known for having a big brass bugle.

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 He always carried around with him in the middle of the woods.

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Which, you know, could be like a romantic thing, you know,

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 like a guy up alone in the woods, his dog sitting next to him.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 You're like out and you see like a little silhouette on the mountain side.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 You see a little dog and you see a guy, a mournful soul with his bugle.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And you're like stoking the campfire and stuff like that.

165
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 That's not what he did.

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 That's not what this guy did.

167
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 That would be fine, right?

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 That would be slightly romantic.

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 But he wouldn't do that.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 He may have done that after work as the accountant.

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 What he was known for, what this guy was known for,

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 is you would be in the woods, okay?

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 You would be in the woods.

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You're hunting.

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 You're fishing.

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 You're enjoying the solitude of me.

177
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 This is so funny.

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I love this guy.

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Except for what he does later.

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You would enjoy the solitude of nature.

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 You go out to woods to find some peace.

182
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 This dude would creep up behind you, this guy would creep up behind you

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 with his big bugle, get as close as he could and go

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 (bark)

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 and totally freak you out, right?

186
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 You've been in the woods.

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 You've been alone for like two hours at this point.

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Just a little fishing rod.

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 (bark)

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 (bark)

191
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 and then (bark)

192
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I'm moving away from the mic to do that sound effect.

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 He wasn't.

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 He was getting as close as possible to blow a giant bugle right in your ear.

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 So people in town hated his guts.

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 They absolutely hated him.

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So when he was found murdered, or more specifically

198
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 when he was found killed later on,

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 I don't think there was a really big obituary written for this guy.

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Assuming he's real.

201
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Now again, before I finish the story, we're going to put our skeptic cats on

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 because we're going to take it off in a second.

203
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 This story, this is the local legend.

204
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 The fact that we don't have an exact time period

205
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 or the name of the guy makes it very suspicious this guy may have never existed.

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 But in Forrest Grove, this is the local legend.

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 People do believe this is real, while others may just poo-poo the whole thing.

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Burn that skeptic cat, because now we're going to get into the fun stuff.

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 So anyways, this dude's body is found dead.

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Now the story is that they find him,

211
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 and next to him they find a dead mountain lion.

212
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And this dude was totally like all gashed up and stuff.

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 "Ah no, the dramatic reenactment. No, my face, oh no, not my arm, oh no, my other arm."

214
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And he's getting eaten up by this dude, this mountain lion.

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 But at the same time he's using this brass bugle, it's so heavy

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 he's just bashing in this mountain lion's skull.

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So they basically both kill each other in their blood pools together into one big puddle.

218
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And that's the end.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I mean, that's interesting, right?

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 A practical joker getting killed by a mountain lion, maybe he tried surprising him.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Maybe the hunter became the hunted.

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 But what makes this story unique is that it is one of the very few times that a ghost kills a person.

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 What? You haven't even gotten to the ghost part yet.

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 So what happens is they start finding people in the woods with their heads bashed in.

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 What? What's going on?

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 The detective comes out there, he's shining, they don't have flashlights.

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 The detective comes out there, he's holding a candle, he's dropping wax all over the crime scene.

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 He's covering up all the fingerprints.

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It appears that this man has had his face caved in.

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And according to all my experience being a forensic scientist and a band leader,

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I can tell that this injury is caused by a large brass bugle.

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Does anyone in town know anyone who has a large brass bugle?

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 What? Well, Barry used to? Well, let's get him.

234
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Barry's been dead for two years, detective.

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Huh? You like that? Theater of the Mind, folks!

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Bet you pictured that perfectly.

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 People are starting to get found in the woods with their heads bashed in with the bugle.

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Now, it's funny, I was telling Sabine this story and I was like, "Yeah, and this ghost killed a bunch of people."

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And she's like, "Oh, okay."

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I was like, "That's super rare."

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 It's incredibly rare to come across a story where a ghost is killing people.

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 In my experience, like off the top of my head, I know of two.

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And I've been researching this stuff for decades.

244
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Two actual ghost killing people.

245
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 We've had stories of like Freddy Kruger is based on a demon in Hmong culture.

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 That's a demon.

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 We've had stories about, um, actually, I have an upcoming story about a village that was getting killed by a spirit,

248
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 but that was like a haunting curse.

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 As far as a human dying and the ghost coming back and killing people, extremely rare.

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 At the top of my head, I can think of two. Lucky Boy Mine, which we covered that a long time ago.

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 We just did a repeat of that.

252
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And this story is very, very rare.

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And it's funny because Sabine was surprised because in the movies, it's super common.

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 A ghost is killing people.

255
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 That's the movies, guys.

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 In real life, in real ghost life, it's extremely rare.

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Extremely rare.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 So, one, that makes me think that this guy was not killed by a mountain lion.

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 If he existed, let's again assume he just existed.

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Somebody got bugled by this dude, right?

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Just burp right in his ear and then killed him.

262
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And then, maybe he already had a dead mountain lion in the backseat of his car.

263
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And he's like, "Ugh, they didn't have cars."

264
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Maybe he had a back--in the backseat of his horse.

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 "Ugh, throws a dead mountain lion on top of Barry, our bugler."

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Who knows?

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I mean, okay, that's a little--that's a little harder to pull off.

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 He kills a man and he's like, "And now I must hunt a mountain lion to have the perfect crime."

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He spends the next four days in there trying to track down a mountain lion.

270
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 But it doesn't make sense why a man would get killed by a mountain lion.

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 A man who wasn't murdering people in the first place, okay?

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 He was a normal jerk.

273
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 He basically would have a YouTube channel with two million subscribers if he did this today.

274
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And he was a normal guy and then he gets killed by a mountain lion

275
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 and then he begins murdering people.

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Like, that's--first off, ghost murdering people is extremely rare.

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 But then, to have just--I just think it's--that's weird enough.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 But then, to not be a revenge-seeking ghost.

279
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 The Lucky Boy Mine was a revenge-seeking ghost.

280
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 There, there, odd story.

281
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 The reason why people think that the bugler was doing this was that

282
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 some guy almost got his head caved in and he turns around and as he sees the bugle coming towards his head,

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 he turns around and sees a ghastly glowing outline of a man whose face was all gashed up.

284
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Uuugh!

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And he's swinging the bugle and the guy jumped out of the way.

286
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And then he went to town and said, "This dude who--who may or may not be fictional, honestly,

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 but this dude tried killing me with the bugle and his face was all gross."

288
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And people go, "Oh, we know who that is."

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 There's only one gross guy who ever played with the bugle and that was Barry.

290
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 So, an exceptional story because we have a ghost murdering people.

291
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It's super, super, super--and you could go Jason Wille, your cherry picking.

292
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Maybe the ghost demon.

293
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Even if we included demons killing people, we're still looking at maybe a dozen of like a ghost--

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 of a non-caporial ghost, not a possessed person, but a non-caporial ghost or a demon killing someone.

295
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Not making them kill themselves, actually killing them.

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 We're looking at maybe a dozen stories.

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 It's incredibly, incredibly rare.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 So basically, more of the story is, don't go to Forest Grove, Oregon.

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Apparently, there's skies making weird sounds.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 There are ghosts can do the impossible.

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 People still think this guy's out there.

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 This guy's still out there playing that lonely bugle.

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I'm actually thinking about visiting some of these haunted places in Oregon.

304
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 If you guys know how much I despise traveling, you guys would be like, "Oh, I'd go there all the time.

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 I don't like--I don't like going any place I can't walk back home from."

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 So anyways, I may go to Forest Grove or I may just stand a camera crew down there and I'll watch them.

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I'll watch them like Obama was watching Osama bin Laden being killed.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 I'm just watching on cam.

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I'm like, "Good job, guys."

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 They're just like watching the spooky forest that I'm eating popcorn.

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I'm watching them just getting killed with bugles and I'm like, "Too spooky.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 I'm so glad I'm not there.

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 So glad I sent out my B team."

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Not the fans that I really love.

315
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Jimmy Moore, light up that carbonicopter.

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 We're leaving behind Forest Grove, Oregon.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I want you to fly us all the way out to Brazil.

318
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 [imitates flying]

319
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Flying over the Pacific Ocean.

320
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 We're headed out to that emerald country.

321
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 I don't know, the country with a bunch of trees.

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 See, it's the only country with a bunch of trees.

323
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 We're flying out there.

324
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Now, most of this information, really all of it, I got from a very well-written post on Above Top Secret as a website.

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 It was written by someone named Fro Charoka.

326
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 So I want to give a tip of the hat to that, a tip of the space helmet to you.

327
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Thank you so much for doing all this research.

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Now, I did find a couple other mentions of this.

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 It wasn't a fictional story, but for the most part, because of the age of the story and because of the language barrier,

330
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 you don't find a lot of stuff.

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Like, when people send me stuff from Mexico and Brazil, I really love to read it, or really any country.

332
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 But I was getting a lot of stuff from Fabio from Italy.

333
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 There is that language barrier.

334
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 It makes it a little bit harder.

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And actually, I can run and translate on it.

336
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Just, there's not a lot of resources on it to begin with.

337
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 It hasn't really got into the paranormal world.

338
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 We're going to go out to the Sara Pucatote Mountain.

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 [imitates a sound of a mountain]

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Now, everything used to be sepia tone, and now it's all lush green jungles and stuff like that.

341
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 But this story still takes place fairly recently, in the past 100 and 150 years.

342
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 So this story takes place an old time in Brazil.

343
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 There's a tribe known as the Bendocari tribe.

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So they're walking around and stuff.

345
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 They can do other stuff.

346
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 They can also sit and sleep, but there are no Matic tribe.

347
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So they go where the food goes.

348
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 So they got their arrows, and they're looking, and they see like this gazelle standing there,

349
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 and they go to shoot in and moves.

350
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And then they go shoot in and moves again.

351
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And they go to shoot in and moves again.

352
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And next thing they know, they're 400 miles away, and they finally kill it.

353
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And they're like, "All right, where do we cook it at?"

354
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And they're like, "Oh man, we left the fire.

355
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 We left the fire all the way back there."

356
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 So they got to set up a new fire.

357
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And then the next day they see Gazelle walking, they're like, "This time we're going to kill it right here."

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And then they end up in another country.

359
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 They end up camping near this Sarah Pucatote mountain in Brazil.

360
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 So they're sitting there, they're eating their gazelle,

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 which I don't actually even think exist in Brazil, right?

362
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 They're eating a taper or something, right?

363
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Originally they were hunting a gazelle in Africa, and then they chased it across the ocean.

364
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 It's all swimming.

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 They're swimming after it.

366
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 They're swimming in Brazil.

367
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 So they're eating a taper, they're eating a big old bow constrictor, whatever's down there.

368
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And they see mist all around the mountain.

369
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And you're like, "Jason, that's pretty normal."

370
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 But this was cursed mist.

371
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 See, at this mountain they would often see like weird lights,

372
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 and like the mist seemed especially cursed.

373
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 They're like, "Don't go to the mountain. That mountain's spooky.

374
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Like we can hang out down here.

375
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 We can eat all the animals we want.

376
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Don't go to the mountain."

377
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 But they are camping near the mountain.

378
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 They see the mist.

379
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And then one time they see a light,

380
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 [explosion]

381
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 fly out of the dark night sky through the mist,

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 and then [explosion]

383
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 crash somewhere near the foot of the mountain.

384
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 So they go, "We better go investigate that tomorrow morning."

385
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Like, let's not go, let's not rush to go out there right now.

386
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 What they used to describe it as was a flying canoe.

387
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 So the next morning they get the warriors and they wake up.

388
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 They get the actual street gang, the warriors.

389
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 They fly them out from New York City.

390
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 They get the warriors of the tribe and they're like, "Wake up, wake up.

391
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 You gotta go check out that big old flying canoe."

392
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, I forgot about that."

393
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And the warrior was hoping everyone else forgot about it

394
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 because he's super scared.

395
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He's like, "Oh yeah, I'm already sure it's nothing."

396
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I think I saw that last week. It's no big deal.

397
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 They have it all the time.

398
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Anyway, the warriors, the super scared warriors go out to where it's at

399
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 and they see a man, not a man, a humanoid thing

400
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 kind of walking around where the canoe had crashed.

401
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 And they're like, "Oh, that's weird."

402
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 They see this guy walking around, right?

403
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And he's like big and puffy.

404
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 He's like a big puffy dude walking around.

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And he turns and he looks at the warriors

406
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 and he has just one giant eyeball on his face.

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 The warrior's kind of, "Ugh."

408
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 First they just thought he was like a puffy albino dude,

409
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 but now they realize he's an alien.

410
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 So they start shooting arrows at him.

411
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 That's their first instinct because this is an outsider,

412
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 this is an invader.

413
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And the guy doesn't even flinch.

414
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Arrows are just going, "Point, point, point, point."

415
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Bouncing off of them.

416
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 One eye just staring at him.

417
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And then the dude, this alien guy, has this big old stick

418
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 and he points it at a rock and the rock disappears.

419
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So the warriors can't look at each other at this point.

420
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 They can't run away.

421
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 This is the reason they exist.

422
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 They have to protect their tribe.

423
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 They've been training their entire life for combat.

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 They get another volley of arrows.

425
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 They're shooting arrows.

426
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 "Pling, plink, plink, plink, plink.

427
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Shoot him in the eye.

428
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Shoot him in the eye."

429
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Someone says, "Pling, plink, doesn't matter."

430
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 He points the staff at a tree.

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 [explosion]

432
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Tree disintegrates.

433
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 One of the warrior pulls out his club,

434
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 runs up and starts beating the guy, beating the alien up.

435
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Alien just shrugs the dude off.

436
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 He points his wand at one of the tribe members.

437
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 He passes out, just falls to the ground.

438
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 He points at another one.

439
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Arrows are still bouncing off this dude.

440
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 "Ping, plink, plink, plink."

441
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 He points at another one.

442
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 That guy passes out too.

443
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 At this point, the warriors are like,

444
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 "Okay, I need to get a new profession.

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I wonder if I can still get into that hunter-gatherer thing

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I've been hearing about."

447
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 They grab their fallen comrades.

448
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 They take off into the jungle and they look behind

449
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 and they see this one-eyed monster just kind of standing there.

450
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Not that one-eyed monster.

451
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Don't be perverted.

452
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 They see it standing there.

453
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And from that time on, people are like,

454
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 "Okay, remember how we said the mountain was cursed?"

455
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And all that like, mist and stuff.

456
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 It's 100% cursed now.

457
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 There's a one-eyed monster there that he's shooting you with stuff.

458
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Again, don't be dirty.

459
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 He's shooting you with stuff and he's making you fall asleep

460
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 and just stay away from that mountain.

461
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And one's like, "What?"

462
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 So, people just kind of avoided that area.

463
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And since it's a nomadic tribe, it wasn't a huge issue.

464
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 They're still kind of moving around the area.

465
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 A couple years later, some people are hanging out.

466
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 They go to the, like, Laundromat,

467
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 aka the lake to do their laundry.

468
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And someone sees this giant dude,

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 just skinny-dipping.

470
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And they're like, "What?"

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And then they stand there and they watched for a while.

472
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And then, like, 20 minutes later, they're still watching.

473
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And someone's like, "Hey, Onako, are you done doing the laundry yet?"

474
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And she's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, almost. I'm almost there."

475
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 She's still watching this guy just swim around naked.

476
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And then after she's gotten a good eyeful or two,

477
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 she goes back to village.

478
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 She's smoking a cigarette.

479
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 She goes, "You guys won't believe what I saw.

480
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 There's this giant naked dude, skinny-dipping,

481
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and all the girls are like, "Oh, the choppin's like,

482
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 'No, no, no, you crazy girls. Let's send the warriors out.'"

483
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 And the warriors are like, "Mmm-hmm, yeah, we want to see it, too."

484
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So anyways, the warriors go out and there's this giant naked guy

485
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 swimming in this lake.

486
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And he turns around and he goes,

487
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 "Hey, hey guys, how you doing?"

488
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And he's speaking their language.

489
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And they're like, "What? How'd you know that?

490
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 How'd you know to speak a language?"

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And he goes, "I know a lot about you guys.

492
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 You guys might not recognize me

493
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 because I'm this giant, tall, albino-looking dude,

494
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 but you guys shot a bunch of arrows at me a couple years ago."

495
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And they're like, "What? No, that was a one-eyed monster

496
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 that we were shooting stuff at."

497
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And he's like, "You mean that?"

498
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And he points over.

499
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 You guys might have picked up on this to begin with his space suit.

500
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 His astronaut space suit.

501
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 He says his name is Bepp Caroti.

502
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 And in that language of that tribe,

503
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 it means "starborn" or "man of the stars."

504
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And he goes, "Listen, I know we got off to a bad start.

505
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 I paralyzed a couple of you guys,

506
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 and I destroyed that rock."

507
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And someone goes, "That was my favorite rock."

508
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I'm sorry, man. I know it was your favorite rock,

509
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 but I was trying to show you guys how powerful it was.

510
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 We got off to a bad start, but I'm kind of bored and lonely.

511
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 You see, I'm not going to be able to leave for a while.

512
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I'm stuck here on your planet.

513
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Can I hang out with you guys?

514
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 So they invited him into the tribe.

515
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 The other option is they say "no," and he's like,

516
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 "Then I'll destroy you all."

517
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 I mean, like, you're going to invite him into your tribe, right?

518
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 He's a super powerful monster man

519
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 who paralyzed your greatest warriors.

520
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Really, I'm not going to tell him no.

521
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 So he comes to the tribe, he starts hanging out.

522
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Now, we have this weird classic tale

523
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 where he's hanging out at the tribe,

524
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 and there's like a young maiden watching him.

525
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 He has clothes on at this point.

526
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I'm assuming, I don't think he was naked the whole time,

527
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 but there's this young maiden kind of checking him out,

528
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 and he's sitting there, and he's eating dinner,

529
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 and he's like, "Oh, this is really good."

530
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And she's like waiting him.

531
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And then he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

532
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

533
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

534
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

535
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

536
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

537
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

538
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

539
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

540
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

541
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

542
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

543
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

544
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

545
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

546
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

547
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

548
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

549
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the tribe."

550
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 So, I mean, that's just a weird name.

551
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Maybe it's a normal name in that community,

552
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 but I don't think so.

553
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I don't... It could be wrong.

554
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 That could be the most racist thing I've ever said on the show.

555
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 They're like, "What? President of Brazil?

556
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 His name is Cobb, you racist.

557
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I'm pretty sure it's a space alien name."

558
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Again, could be wrong,

559
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 but the fact that her dad was a space alien,

560
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I think I'm fine on saying that Cobb is a space alien name.

561
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Anyways, while he's raising this family,

562
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 he also starts teaching them to not be nomads anymore.

563
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 They're like, "Go to hunt the gazelle."

564
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And he's like, "No, no, no. Not only is that animal

565
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 not indigenous to this continent,

566
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 but you don't have to do that anymore.

567
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I'm going to show you how you can build a civilization in one place.

568
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And I'm going to make your weapons better.

569
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I'm going to train your warriors to be better.

570
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And then there's a montage of him like training the warriors.

571
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 They're like punching sides of gazelle flesh.

572
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 They invent stairs, and then they're running up them.

573
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And Beth is sitting there with his little timer.

574
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Click. Yeah, good job. Good job.

575
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 It's a sundial. They have to run until it goes from 1 to 2 p.m.

576
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Everyone's training. He teaches them how to build a better society.

577
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And then, so everything's going great.

578
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 He's met the love of his life. He's having kids.

579
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 He's training these people to become much better fighters.

580
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 He's training them to become a more cohesive civilization.

581
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 So one day, everything's going great, right?

582
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 He's building up their society. He has grandkids for crying out loud.

583
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 One day he goes out on a hunt.

584
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 He's showing the hunters how to do this stuff.

585
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 He's like, "This is how you do it. You don't have to track him across two continents.

586
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 You can do this."

587
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Arrow goes right through the tapers neck.

588
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 [BEEPING]

589
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Great job, Beth. Thanks for showing us that.

590
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Beth?

591
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Beth?

592
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Beth is gone.

593
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Where did he go? I don't know. Where'd he go?

594
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 The hunters get back to the village,

595
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 and everyone in the village is like, "Uh, dude, dude, get ready.

596
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 We think something bad's going to happen."

597
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 What happened? Well, Beth came back here,

598
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 and he painted his family black.

599
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 So that's just weird. That's just weird, right?

600
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 That's very, very uncommon that someone's going to come back,

601
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 paint their family any color, really,

602
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 and be having a good day.

603
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 But he paints them black, and he locks them in the hut.

604
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And as they're telling the hunters this,

605
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 they notice Beth, he's walking out from behind the hut,

606
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 wearing his astronaut suit.

607
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Which everyone in town knows full well is

608
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 arrow-proof, and spear-proof, and club-proof.

609
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And he walks into the center village, and he starts going,

610
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 "Okay, guys, who's going to fight me?"

611
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 "I am taking control of this village,

612
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 unless one of you guys stops me."

613
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 You're a space alien who's indestructible,

614
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 and you have magical powers. We're not going to fight.

615
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 He then, because no one will fight him,

616
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 he starts upsetting the forest on fire.

617
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 He's like, "Okay, who's going to fight me?"

618
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 "Who's going to fight me?"

619
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 People are like, "Bep, no one's going to fight you, right?"

620
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 "For first off, there's a raging forest fire behind you,

621
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 and I'm pretty sure your family's in a thatched hut,

622
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 so not a great planning on that one.

623
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 But secondly, bro, we're not going to fight you.

624
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 What's going on?"

625
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And Bep says, "That's it. That's it. I'm out of here."

626
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And he walks out of the village,

627
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 flaming forest fire, leaving his family painted black in the hut.

628
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 He walks out of the village, and they watch him.

629
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 I don't know how they saw this part.

630
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I mean, unless Inspector Gadget has his telescopic eyes,

631
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 they watch him walk all the way to the mountain.

632
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And at that point, a beam...

633
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 BOOM!

634
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Shines on the family's hut.

635
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 People run into the hut.

636
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 At this point, I'm assuming they've put out the fire.

637
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Otherwise, everyone's been burned to death, but they run into the hut,

638
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 they open the door.

639
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 His family's gone, and they see the flying canoe.

640
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 *Swoosh*

641
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Fly through space.

642
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 But his family being gone

643
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 isn't entirely accurate, because his daughter,

644
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 his son-in-law, and his grandchild are still left there.

645
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 So they automatically, they're like, "Ask the daughter."

646
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 They ask his daughter, "What was that?"

647
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Like, "What just happened?"

648
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 She's like, "I don't know why my dad did that, but I do know this."

649
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 "He'll always be in here."

650
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 She taps her head.

651
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Because I've been in contact, I'm in telepathic contact with him.

652
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 And if we ever need our help again, he'll come back.

653
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Fast forward years later,

654
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 crops aren't doing too well.

655
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 All of the structure that Bepp had set up starts to fall apart.

656
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Crops aren't doing well.

657
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Famine hits, disease hits.

658
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 The village is dying off.

659
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 And one day, and the daughters watching all this happen,

660
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 and everyone's getting sick, and she goes,

661
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 "Now's the time."

662
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 In our darkest hour,

663
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 she paints herself and her kid and her husband black.

664
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 She prays

665
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 to her father.

666
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 [BOOM]

667
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 The light canoe comes back.

668
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 He comes back down, goes, "What?

669
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 You guys have totally messed this stuff up."

670
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 "I told you to irrigate, irrigate, irrigate.

671
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 What's this?"

672
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 He replants all their crops, gives them new crops,

673
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 gives them crops that were not indigenous to the area at all.

674
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 He shows them how to build stone houses,

675
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 which technically he should have shown them how to do that the first time.

676
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 He actually tells them to get closer to the mountain.

677
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 "This should be your home, closer to the mountain.

678
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 This mountain will help protect you."

679
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 And they change the name of the tribe at that point to the "Cayapo."

680
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And to this day, they have celebrations

681
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 where the people in the village have a bamboo suit

682
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 that they wear and they dance around in as their celebration to bep.

683
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Now, what's interesting, when you look at the photos of this guy,

684
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 the first thing you think of, that looks like an astronaut suit.

685
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 In the 1970s, you had some kids that had come from those tribes into other, like, big cities.

686
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 This isn't one of those--this tribe still exists.

687
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 It's not one of those completely isolated tribes.

688
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And this story I told you about, this is--when I said "Old Time Brazil,"

689
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 we're not talking 1400s, 1200s, 600s Brazil.

690
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 We're talking, like, 17, 1800s Brazil.

691
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 There was a time period fairly recent that this story took place.

692
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 This isn't a creation myth.

693
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 The conquistadors had already been there.

694
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 This tribe was already interacting with other nations.

695
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 But they're just like, "Nope, we don't want any part of that,"

696
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 and they were moving around Brazil.

697
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 This wasn't an ancient, ancient myth.

698
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 So you have people still doing the ceremony at Bep.

699
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 And when you have these kids do a cultural exchange,

700
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 they went to a big city and they're seeing footage

701
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and seeing photos of US astronauts landed on the moon.

702
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 They go, "That is what Bep Karate looked like."

703
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 That is--that's exactly what he looked like.

704
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 That was the description.

705
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 That one eye is basically the giant glass visor.

706
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Which is how you--if you're calling stuff flying canoes,

707
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 if you saw an astronaut turn around and look at you,

708
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 it would look like a giant eyeball.

709
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 So that's the story of Bep Karate.

710
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 It definitely could be--we got to run through these always.

711
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 It could be fiction.

712
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 It could be 100% fiction made up.

713
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 That's leaked onto the internet and has become this story.

714
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 It's definitely possible.

715
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Two, it could be made up at the time.

716
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It could be a legend that was made up by the tribe

717
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 to explain certain things.

718
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Someone's like, "Where'd you get those beet seeds at?"

719
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 And he's like, "Uhhh, let me tell you a story.

720
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Let me tell you a really long, complicated story

721
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 about an alien coming down and having kids and stuff like that."

722
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 The person who originally made the story popular

723
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 before it got to a above-top secret was

724
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Hawa Ameriko Arett.

725
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 He was a researcher who worked with Native tribes,

726
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 and he was with the tribe like in the '70s.

727
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 So even if it was 100 years from when--

728
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 even if their timeline was accurate, we're talking 1800s.

729
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 I'm giving them a little bit of wiggle room,

730
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 but that means that that genetic line, Bep's kid--

731
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 if he had a daughter and the daughter had a son,

732
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 and that was only 100 years ago, 150 years ago maybe,

733
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 you know, give or take some years, and that was happening,

734
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 that genetic line should still exist in that group of people.

735
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 There should still be someone who were now

736
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 maybe five generations removed, six generations removed

737
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 from this story.

738
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 We should still be able to find a spark

739
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 of genetic information of this star man.

740
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 But the thing is, this story is so obscure,

741
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 nobody really knows about it.

742
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 If this story was more popular, you know that History Channel

743
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 or Gaia or whatever would send someone out there

744
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 to start testing these people's DNA to see if they could find

745
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 the star child.

746
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Nobody knows about this story.

747
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 I think it would be really interesting,

748
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 and I think people in that community would want to know

749
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 because it would prove their story that their culture is based around.

750
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 So yeah, if you work for one of those companies, why not?

751
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 If you work for one of those companies and you're listening

752
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 to my podcast, let's do this.

753
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 We can actually, again, with their permission--

754
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 I'm not saying that we need to take their blood against their permission,

755
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 but with their permission, let's--

756
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 we can prove if this is real.

757
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 If this is real.

758
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 If there really was a man from the stars who slept with a woman

759
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 and had kids and grandkids, and most likely it went on from there,

760
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 and then came back again to give them more fruits and vegetables

761
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 and stuff like that, and maybe, you know,

762
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 dropped off a couple of gazelles.

763
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Those gazelles they'd been hunting all along,

764
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Bepp dropped some off from their ship.

765
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 So if you're ever driving through the middle of nowhere

766
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 and you happen to see a spaceship crash in the distance,

767
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 you will want to check it out.

768
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 I think we all would want to check it out.

769
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 I would check it out via webcam.

770
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 But if you drive off towards the crash site

771
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 to see if there really is a crash ship there,

772
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 just make sure that you're not traveling with any attractive women.

773
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Or if you are an attractive woman yourself, just be prepared.

774
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Because the alien that crashed on the ship may not just be

775
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 an indestructible warrior.

776
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 He may also be a man looking for the love of his life.

777
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 I mean, ladies, could you do worse than an alien?

778
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Who can make stuff disappear?

779
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 But guys, be careful, because you're hunting with your girl

780
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 and she sees this giant naked dude walking around.

781
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 No matter how much you swing your club,

782
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 it doesn't work.

783
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 This other guy just bounces off this other dude.

784
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Don't blame me when she leaves you.

785
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 I'm telling you right now, if you want to keep your girlfriend,

786
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 don't go towards the crash UFO.

787
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 But if you're a girl and you're looking for love,

788
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 you should just keep heading out to that crash site

789
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 until you approach the radioactive debris.

790
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Nah, that's not dangerous.

791
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 That's just the glow of romance.
