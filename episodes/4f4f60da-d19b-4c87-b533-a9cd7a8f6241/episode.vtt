00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.400
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.520
 - Ah, the great outdoors, place of wonderment,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.200
 sunsets, and spooky encounters.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.360
 First off, on today's Travel Special of Dead Rabbit Radio,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.920
 two men riding horses encounter a bundle

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.760
 in the middle of the road.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.640
 But what seemingly looked like trash turned into

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.400
 a deadly threat.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.240
 And then we hit the high seas,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.240
 aboard the passenger liner known as the SS Warataw.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.440
 We bought a ticket to go on a luxury cruise.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.640
 Instead, we found ourselves sailing towards oblivion.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.220
 (upbeat music)

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.760
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.800
 I'm your host, Jason Garvinder.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.640
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.080
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.160
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.960
 doing whatever you're doing.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.120
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.680
 So first off, walking, it's a Dead Rabbit Command,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.680
 hand in hand, our newest feature on supporters.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.200
 Everyone give it up for Genevieve Kara and Rebel Miner.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.920
 Woo hoo, yeah!

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.760
 Wee!

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.800
 Coming in, walking on into Dead Rabbit Command

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.600
 with big backpacks.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.320
 They're ready to go traveling.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 Genevieve, Kara, Kara, Genevieve and Rebel are nomads.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.680
 What's the term for it where you just drive around?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.160
 Do you like this normal person?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.760
 People drive around all the time.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.760
 They're into just traveling around America, exploring.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.040
 They actually have a Instagram,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.120
 I'll put it in the show notes.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.080
 You're like, wow, Jesus, you're impressive.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.280
 They have an Instagram.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.120
 Well, no, it's an Instagram of all their adventures.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.240
 They have an Instagram and a website.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.080
 I'll put it all in.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.840
 They're professional travelers traveling

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.080
 around the United States and documenting the journey

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.360
 the whole way.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.600
 And that's why we're having a travel special today.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.640
 You know what, I feel kind of bad.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.800
 'Cause yesterday, vaccine was the Patreon support.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.400
 He just had on a pair of VR goggles.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.720
 I sometimes, he's like, what?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.760
 Thinkin' stories, thinkin' themed stories.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.240
 I just walked around in a VR goggles set.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.640
 I gotta be honest, like, you know,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.280
 the show so much of it is improv.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.880
 Throwin' it, this, even this theme.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.320
 I just threw these stories together in the last minute.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.640
 I was like, oh, this will work.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.760
 Sometimes I feel bad for Patreon supporters.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.560
 Some of them, I'm like, come here

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.320
 and bare wrestling some of them.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.080
 They're going on these crazy jokes,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.600
 these awesome fun adventures,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.680
 and then other people are like, hey, buddy, welcome.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.600
 Get inside, get in the vehicle, let's go.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.960
 I don't mean to do that.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.080
 It's nothing personal.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.600
 Vaccine, sorry if he's all sad in his VR goggles.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.120
 Sorry about that, buddy.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.520
 Rebel and Genevieve, you guys are gonna be our captains,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.680
 our pilots this episode.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.080
 If you guys can't support the Patreons,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.000
 I totally understand, just help spread the word

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.760
 about Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.720
 That helps out so much.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.480
 You can also right now vote for us

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.040
 in the Paranormality Magazine poll for best podcast.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.580
 They do this every month.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.320
 That's another way to get new eyeballs on the podcast,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.020
 or new ear balls, I guess to be specific.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.160
 Genevieve, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.040
 the hair hang glider.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.560
 Let's all climb onto her back.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.480
 We'll climb inside of her backpack.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.480
 Jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.320
 We're gonna glide all the way out to Cuba.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:06.960
 We're in Cuba.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.960
 Specifically, we're in Gicota, Las Villas, Cuba.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.440
 The year is 1915.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.880
 So this is an old timey story.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.800
 It's late one evening, and we're at a sugar cane field.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.200
 Normally in the sugar canes,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.640
 you're like, Jason, I'm just trying to lose weight.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.720
 I was like, yeah, but this is healthy.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.800
 This is a lot of fiber in these canes.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 I'm eating these sugar canes.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.960
 Two men show up and they're on horseback.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.880
 They're actually security for the sugar cane field.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.380
 I think normally they are gonna chase away rodents

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.920
 or wolves or something like that.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.120
 They don't expect to see a bunch of people

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.160
 that are eating their sugar.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.040
 Human locusts eating their sugar canes.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.360
 They're like, ah, these two men,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.320
 we're gonna go and call them Charles and Victor.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.640
 They're riding their horses around the perimeter

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.480
 of this sugar cane field, checking everything out.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.760
 Right when they come to the bend and erode, their horses.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.840
 (laughs)

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.080
 They were naeing and raring up and making all this noise

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.760
 and they wouldn't go any further.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.160
 So Charles and Victor hop off of their horses

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.080
 and they don't know why their horses are freaking out,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.480
 but they definitely see something that they didn't expect.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.040
 Laing in the middle of this road is this small white sack.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.160
 This little bundle is laying right in the middle of the road

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.840
 and it's just chilling.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.880
 And the horses are still like (makes horse noises)

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.360
 not wanting to go anywhere.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.200
 Charles and Victor are just kind of staring at this bundle

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.640
 and at the same time, they both kind of get the idea

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.480
 in their head.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.560
 They both get the impression that this bundle is alive.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.520
 There's something about this bundle.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.520
 They couldn't really put their finger on it,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.520
 but this bundle is not just a sack of clothing

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.960
 that fell off some bumps back.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.640
 It's not anything like that.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.280
 It's just this bundle sitting in the middle of the road,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.520
 but they feel like it's alive.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.520
 And at that point, the bundle begins to move

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.720
 towards the two men.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.640
 I don't say if it got up and started walking like oogie boogie,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.880
 whatever his name is from Nightmare Before Christmas,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.520
 or if it just kind of slithered on the ground.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.880
 They didn't go into detail.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.760
 They just said that the sack began to move toward.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.680
 I can imagine them telling the story to their boss

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.240
 still like, "Hey, did you finish the perimeter sweep?"

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.840
 You won't believe us, but this bag showed up.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.640
 He's like, "What? It started moving?

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.560
 How much sugar cane did you eat before work?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.940
 Are you like having a sugar rush or something?"

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.160
 The bag's getting closer and closer.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.660
 So Charles does the reasonable thing.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.500
 I guess.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.080
 If I saw, if I was walking in the middle of nowhere

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.160
 and a bag started moving towards me

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.200
 and I thought it was alive,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.080
 my first inclination would be that there's a baby in that bag.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.460
 There's a baby in that bag and it's crawling towards me.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.000
 That'd be my first inclination, right?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.440
 'Cause babies move and babies are often in bags.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.360
 That's why there's always that warning on the bag saying,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.860
 "Don't put your baby in this."

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.540
 I figured at first it was a baby.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.620
 Well, Charles probably is like,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.900
 "Listen, we're out in the middle of nowhere

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.060
 on the outskirts of the sugar cane field."

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.520
 It's probably not a baby.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.340
 It's definitely something that the horses

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.480
 don't want to go near.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.540
 It's alive and it's moving.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.040
 So Charles pulls out his revolver and opens fire.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.420
 (fire crackling)

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.480
 Click, click, click.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.420
 He fires multiple rounds into this bundle

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.180
 as quickly as possible.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.520
 But what happens is it happens so quickly.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.720
 He probably should have stopped shooting

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.040
 after the first or second bullet.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.880
 Each time a bullet went into this bundle, it got bigger.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.980
 And he fired multiple rounds so it got bigger and bigger

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.240
 and bigger and bigger and bigger until eventually

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:08.920
 it was the size of a horse, this giant bundle coming towards

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.040
 him.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.120
 He's like, "I don't have any more bullets."

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.100
 And Victor's like, "Good, every time you shot it,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.620
 it only got bigger."

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.420
 Now it's the size of a horse.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:22.100
 This horse-sized sack is now moving towards them.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.040
 And they took off.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.880
 They just took off.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.300
 They didn't worry about the horses.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.200
 They were out of there.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.040
 They ran off, got out of the area.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.900
 Guess what else are you gonna do?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.980
 Right, you're out of bullets.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.820
 The bullets didn't work.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.980
 The bullets made the situation worse.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.700
 There's a bag the size of a horse.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.240
 'Cause what else are you gonna do, right?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.220
 I mean, the horses aren't moving.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.480
 So it's not like they're like, "Oh no,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.060
 we can't leave Black Stallion."

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.180
 And then you hop on board.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.980
 You're like, "Come on, horse, kicking them in the ribs.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.040
 Let's go, let's go."

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.220
 They're already, you're just riding those horses off

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.180
 as a tax right off.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.660
 You're like, "Ah, they're dead."

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.920
 This bundle, whatever this is, right?

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.880
 This big old bundles, as big as they are,

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.400
 big as the horses, probably gonna eat them

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.240
 or something like that.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.080
 We're out of here.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.620
 When Charles and Victor took off running,

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.420
 they completely left the area.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.760
 The next day, when people show back up for work,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.720
 everyone's getting their sugar cane tools ready,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.640
 their skis and their like hacksaws and stuff like that.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.160
 They're delicious Kool-Aid.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.920
 They're like, "Oh, let's put a little sugar in the Kool-Aid.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.320
 Let's test the good stuff."

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.600
 People show up to work to head up to the sugar cane field.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.040
 And when they get out to that area where the bundle was,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.960
 the two horses are still just kind of hanging out there.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.080
 They're not frozen in time.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.040
 They're eating grass.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.480
 They're doing horse stuff, booping.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.320
 But the bundle was nowhere to be seen

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.740
 and the horses were left unmolested.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.400
 They seemed totally fine.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.760
 They didn't seem to have any sort of PTSD,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.600
 which is known as pony trauma disorder.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.440
 Anyways, two horses show up.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.680
 They just find the horses randomly there.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.240
 And that's the end of that story.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.080
 It's interesting.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.560
 I found this on thinkaboutadox.com,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.760
 one of my favorite resources.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.600
 And they're really good at citing where they get the story,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.560
 whether it's from like some defunct UFO newsletter

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.600
 that published the story back in 1990

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.600
 or more modern like Mufon Mutual UFO Network report

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.120
 in the early 2000s.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.640
 They're really good at citing their sources.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.920
 This source is just cited as quote, personal investigation.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.880
 So I don't know where they got it from.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.000
 We do have an exact year

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.280
 and considering it was 1915, how old that is,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.280
 we have a city, the names Charles and Victor

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.080
 were just made up for the narrative.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.160
 But it's a fascinating story.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.480
 This kind of dovetails onto the Kangaroo Man story

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.520
 from yesterday's episode.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.680
 And so many other stories we've covered on this podcast.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.680
 I love the most bizarre types of events.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.320
 And I mean, who would have thought, right?

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.840
 When you showed up to work that day

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.480
 that you were gonna be chased by a bundle.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.160
 Like you could never ever be like,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160
 "Oh man, today's the day.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.720
 Today might be Bundleday."

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.720
 Your coworkers like what?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.160
 You're like, "Oh, you know, once every six billion years,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.200
 once since the time the planet Earth was created,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.320
 at least one person's gonna get chased by a bundle."

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.160
 Your coworkers are like, "What are you talking about?"

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.560
 It happened once in 1915, but it's possible

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.280
 today could be Bundleday as well.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.360
 You would never ever expect.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.960
 If you were out in the middle of nowhere,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.600
 like Rebel and Genevieve, they're traveling,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.800
 they're going places and they're carrying around

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.560
 their backpacks, walking around poking bushes with a stick.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.640
 I would imagine if eventually they're gonna see

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.840
 like a skeleton, not like a human skeleton,

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.560
 well actually a human skeleton, but it's walking

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.160
 towards them, that's gonna happen sooner or later.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.560
 They're gonna come across the ghost skeleton

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.760
 or a screaming head flying through the bushes

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.760
 or like a goat man, like some weird cryptid

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.480
 who's been lost to time.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.560
 Like all the legends that he existed in that area are gone.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.360
 They're gonna be traveling through this town.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.560
 All of a sudden some starts banging on the side

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.160
 of their van, they're like, "Oh my God, oh my God."

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.040
 And then the goat man starts ripping his way in.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.840
 He's like, "Ah, there's an Instagram photo.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.040
 It's the last photo."

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.080
 They're taking it as this creature's crawling

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.480
 into the back of their van.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.000
 You figure those things might happen, right?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.640
 You're like, "Jason, one of those things

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.600
 are reasonably gonna happen to this duo."

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.120
 But they might, but my thing is

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.040
 they'll never be chased by a bundle.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.680
 No one ever, ever will be chased by a bundle.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.720
 You would never think that, especially a bundle

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.080
 that gets bigger each time you shoot it.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.360
 Like it's just so bizarre.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.840
 It's such a bizarre encounter.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.280
 It doesn't fall in the line

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.960
 with what anything else we know of.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.240
 It wasn't a cryptid, it was like a pile of clothes.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.640
 It was a pile of clothes that became the size of a horse,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.040
 but it was also alive and sentient.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.240
 It's a crazy story, absolutely love it.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.640
 It's just so bonkers.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.520
 And I want to, I've never seen this.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.920
 I mean, I spend a lot of time on ThinkAboutDucks.com

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.080
 and I've never come across the notation

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.240
 that says personal investigations.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.120
 Even if someone at ThinkAboutDucks.com

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.000
 like read a book on it, they would source the book.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Do they actually, are they actually related

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.440
 to Charles or Victor?

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.920
 Like they're like, yeah, I grew up every single day.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.400
 Every single day, my dad Charles refused

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.560
 to change my diaper.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.680
 He goes, no, the bundle, the bundle.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.480
 It was just an excuse he used.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.600
 So I didn't have to smell baby poop.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.920
 Crazy story, is the bundle still out there?

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.760
 What happened to it?

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.920
 And the horses were alive.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.360
 That's a bit of a change.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.440
 For dead rabbit radio,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.880
 there's been a lot of animals getting killed lately.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.440
 Genevieve and Rebel, go ahead and put on your flight suits.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.440
 I'm gonna toss you guys co-keys to the carbonar copter.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.720
 We are leaving behind dead rabbit command.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.000
 He didn't get to fly the hang glider.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.360
 I don't know why, I don't know why he got left off.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.480
 He was in, he was in her backpack with the rest of us.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.040
 But Genevieve and Rebel, I'm gonna toss you co-keys

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.920
 to the carbonar copter.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.560
 We're leaving behind Cuba.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560
 Everyone check your pockets,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.840
 make sure there's no bundles in them.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.840
 Take us out of Cuba and fly us all the way out to Australia.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.880
 (mimicking engine)

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.960
 The year is 1909,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.240
 and we're about to board the SS Warataw.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.120
 This is a fine boat, very luxurious boat.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.760
 And it makes its journeys from Australia to Europe

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.760
 with a couple of stops in South Africa,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.800
 which at that point was a British colony.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.640
 And it's a nice ride.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.320
 I mean, sure it's gonna take a while.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.200
 You know, this is 1909, this boat's pretty slow.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.120
 And how else were you gonna travel, right?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.840
 Unless the red baron flew over your house

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.000
 and you grabbed onto his airplane.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.600
 It's like a boat or nothing, you're in Australia.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.840
 You had a lot of people waiting to go on this boat.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.840
 It had only been on one previous journey.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.960
 The great thing about this boat,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.280
 the one thing that people loved about it,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.000
 'cause remember man, this is 1909,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.760
 traveling anywhere was super dangerous.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.040
 And if you're traveling by boat,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.760
 you always had to worry about, you know,

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.000
 big sea storms or pirates even.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.560
 But don't worry, the SS Waratah was unsingable.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.840
 It was designed in such a way

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.400
 that it could actually never be sunk.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.560
 So people were like, okay, I read the brochure.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.240
 You said it's pirate proof.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.800
 They're like, we never said that part.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.760
 Pirates definitely could take over this boat.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.600
 They're like, okay.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.280
 But you also said that it's unsingable.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.040
 And they're like, yes, the unsingable SS Waratah.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.560
 Don't worry, once you're on board,

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.840
 you may dive several different ways, food poisoning,

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.520
 murder, slipping and falling off the boat,

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.560
 but you will never sink in this boat.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.120
 You may sink, you may sink, you may get thrown off,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.040
 but the boat itself will stay up.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.160
 You will be able to watch it as it sails away from you.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.580
 This is a terrible sales pitch.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.800
 The SS Waratah had all these accommodations

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.560
 for first class, super luxurious.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.240
 You had like the piano player, do do do do do.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.960
 You had like the captain walking around

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.920
 and the people are drinking wine and eating oysters.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.560
 It also had the steerage class,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.600
 where you had all the people like, papa, papa,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.880
 is it true we're leaving Australia?

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.600
 We broke out of jail, is it true?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.720
 It's true there's a warrant for your arrest.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.360
 He's like, yes, kid, we're convicts,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.600
 but we're gonna make our way back to France.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.980
 We're headed to Europe.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.120
 We couldn't afford a fancy person ticket,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.920
 so we are down here with the rats.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.960
 But that's okay, son.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.560
 We'll have a better life in France

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.120
 where I'll once again become a criminal

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.920
 and probably get sent to Australia.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.960
 Now this all might seem super familiar, right?

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.260
 Titanic, you guys have all heard of that boat.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.960
 Unsinkable, you had all the rich, wealthy people on top.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.120
 All the poor people in the bottom.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.000
 Yes, this boat is known as the Titanic of Australia.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.080
 So that's kind of given away the storyline.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.520
 This boat will sink.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.720
 Or will it?

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.960
 This is an interesting story.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.200
 It goes beyond just you're like,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.000
 oh, Jason, tell another story of human misery.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 People dying at sea.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.800
 This one's super creepy.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.360
 The SS War Tall is getting ready for its second journey.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.040
 Do you have the rich people on top?

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.720
 Do you have the poor people in the bottom?

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.160
 That section also doubled as the meat storage.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.120
 So I don't think it was super comfortable down there.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.400
 Like dress warm, kids, just warm, kids.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.720
 We're gonna be sleeping next to a slab of beef.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.760
 It's gonna be refrigerated.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.400
 This boat, because it's so old,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.080
 they don't have a radio on it.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.160
 So the only way they could communicate with other boats

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.280
 is they would do that flashing light thing.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.120
 You would have like that big old,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.200
 playing that Kanye West song the whole time.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.520
 You know, they have those big old black circles

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.920
 and then they flip it, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip,

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.960
 the flippers and then when make light shine on and off

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.840
 and so you would go like, hello boat.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.480
 They would say their name.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.520
 They would say SS War Tall

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.360
 and then the other boat would go Charles.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.920
 Boat man and then you'd go,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.080
 oh, that's the Charles boat man.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.520
 And so that's how they would communicate.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.640
 Unless there was an emergency,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.520
 then they would say like SOS.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.600
 Anyway, so no radio.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.680
 They just had the flashing lights thing.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.840
 This is the second voyage on the maiden voyage

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.960
 and it goes super smooth.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.560
 The boat kept catching on fire.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.120
 That's kind of underplaying it.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.280
 You're like, ah, we didn't have the smoothest trip.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.120
 What happened?

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.080
 Flames, flames coming out from everywhere.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.480
 They had the way they built the boat.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.040
 It's unsinkable from the outside,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.480
 but the engine room wasn't well insulated.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.960
 So part of the room's catching on fire.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.440
 I mean, again, it's the worst place.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.120
 A fire in the water is the worst place to have a fire.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.760
 But if you're gonna have a fire,

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.440
 it's better to be say in the meat slab room

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.960
 where it's too cold for the fire to hang out

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.920
 versus the engine,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.480
 which just keeps getting hotter and hotter.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.680
 Anyways, they repaired it.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.840
 They repaired that design flaw

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.800
 and now it's ready for the second journey

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.240
 The captain of the boat,

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.040
 this guy named Captain Ilbury,

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.520
 was like, ah, I don't have a good feeling about this boat.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.480
 It seems to tip.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.640
 This is what we talked about a week or two ago.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.960
 He goes, the boat seems to tip

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.920
 and it gets worse when we're loading it.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.840
 And the designers are like, oh, don't worry.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.160
 It's just natural.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.440
 You must not have been captain that long.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.400
 Boats often tip.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.480
 And he's like, ah, it's tipping a little bit more.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.800
 What's it caught on fire?

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.680
 I mean, guys, I'm not being a hypochondriac about this thing.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.920
 I don't really know if I like this boat that much.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.280
 And so they had to be very careful

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.080
 about how they loaded it up.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.040
 They could do it, but they had to get it just right.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.800
 Well, now we're on our second journey

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.480
 with the SS Hortel.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.200
 It's July 7th, 1909.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.160
 It's on its second run.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.600
 It has just left Australia

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.640
 with 212 passengers and crew combined.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.840
 212 souls are on this boat.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.880
 It left Australia.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.440
 It's going to go to Durban,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.800
 which is in South Africa.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.720
 Then it's going to go to Cape Town, also in South Africa.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.120
 And then it's going to sail onwards north to Europe.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.920
 July 25th, it finally reaches Durban.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.280
 And a passenger disembarks at Durban.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.240
 The boat people are like,

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.320
 you're not going to finish the journey.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.160
 Like, I don't know if you know maps,

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.240
 but we're the quickest way to get back to Europe.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.480
 You're home.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.560
 And this guy, his name is Claude G. Sawyer.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.440
 He's like, I'm good.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.240
 I think I'll be better off here

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.440
 at the most southern part of the continent

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.040
 than getting back on the boat.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.680
 He was an experienced engineer

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.040
 and he had a lot of experience traveling at sea.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.720
 He's supposed to go to London.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.200
 He ends up in South Africa,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.160
 in Durban, South Africa.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.600
 And he sends his wife a telegram.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.360
 It says, quote, "Thought war a tall, top heavy,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.080
 landed Durban."

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.920
 I know you have to pay by the penny.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.280
 When you send a telegram,

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.600
 you might want to give her a little more information than that.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.360
 But he sends the telegram out,

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.080
 "See you in 18 months as I try to travel by land

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.560
 and have this wacky adventure across Africa

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.400
 to get up to Europe."

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.560
 I'm sure actually not thinking about it.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.280
 I probably just took another boat.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.920
 But it wasn't the war a tall.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.920
 He was like, I don't have a good feeling about that boat.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.840
 But he only told her half the story.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.160
 So that happened on July 25th.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.960
 It dropped him off and then continued on its way to Cape Town

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.480
 and then eventually they get to Europe.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.320
 On July 27th off the coast of South Africa,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.240
 the war a tall sends out a signal,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.840
 sees another ship passing by called the Clan McIntyre.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.360
 And it's a normal exchange.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.360
 The SS war a tall sends its name.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.920
 So they can kind of keep track of each other where boats are.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.880
 That happened on July 27th.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.320
 And the two boats are sailing in opposite directions

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.940
 and they're in visual range for about five hours.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:07.080
 That night a cyclone hits the area.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.160
 This was one of the reasons why having an unseenable ship

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.760
 was good to put on the brochure.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.960
 Very, very bad weather in this area.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.200
 It's not unheard of for a cyclone to hit

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.160
 but even long time sea captains were like,

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.280
 this is the worst storm I've ever been in.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.000
 I've never been in a storm like that.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.720
 This cyclone hits the area

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.880
 and the SS war a tall was never seen again.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:37.440
 People waited for weeks for the SS war a tall to show up.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.920
 But it never showed back up.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.520
 And apparently that was pretty common

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.760
 because these boats would take so long to get somewhere.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.160
 Like they would have a scheduled date to show up

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.480
 but because of certain conditions,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.600
 they could be a week or two late.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.440
 But once boats that were leaving Australia

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.240
 after the war a tall were showing up at Cape Town,

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.040
 at Durban, that's when people really started worrying.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.600
 So they gave it about three weeks

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.600
 before they really started looking for the war a tall.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.360
 And before the investigations began

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.740
 'cause now you have two things going on.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.120
 You're trying to find the boat or pieces of the boat,

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.520
 survivors hopefully or bodies.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.480
 And then they're trying to figure out

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.160
 they have a separate investigation.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.800
 You have like the rescue part

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.080
 and then you have the investigation as to what happened.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.680
 The boat, there has been no confirmed sightings

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.120
 of the war a tall sends nothing.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.920
 Not a piece of driftwood, not a lifeboat,

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.940
 not a person, not even a body part.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:49.560
 The SS war a tall completely vanished.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.200
 And people have been looking for it since

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.160
 like eventually, you know,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.720
 people were originally looking for it as a rescue operation

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.800
 and then people were looking for it

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.800
 to see if they could find out what happened to it.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.560
 And then people started looking for it

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.760
 to see if they could salvage it.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.720
 And then in more modern times,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.680
 it's been just to solve the mystery.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.500
 This one guy spent 20 years trying to find

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.920
 the wreckage of the war a tall either under the water

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.240
 or washed up somewhere, somewhere, anywhere.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.080
 No piece of it has ever been found.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.720
 You started to have people say,

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.920
 "Oh, we found this piece of wood."

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.760
 That was the first thing,

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.080
 like some wood washed upon a nearby beach.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.800
 They said this was the SS war a tall.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.080
 These are the remains of the boat.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.480
 And it was nothing.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.360
 There were alleged sightings of it

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.400
 within that period of that first couple of days

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.360
 since that cyclone.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.000
 You had some Navy officers, some sailors

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.620
 saying that they saw what it looked like a fire

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.400
 in the distance and then just darkness.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.120
 But no confirmation.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.720
 You had another boat that was in the area.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.680
 During the storm, the cyclone was so bad.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.560
 During the storm, they saw a boat

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.160
 doing the Morris Code, flashing their light.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.640
 And they only picked up three letters.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.920
 T-A-H.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.200
 So it's possible to write the war a tall.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.520
 We don't know what the message was, probably help.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.720
 Probably help were trapped in the cyclone.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.760
 You had another boat say that they saw

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.360
 what looked like a ship tipping over in the waves.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.560
 'Cause I mean, again, people are like,

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.340
 this is the worst weather we've ever had.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.660
 What could have happened to this boat?

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.480
 But the ship was unsinkable.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.640
 So they had a really hard time figuring out

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.540
 like that it crashed into something

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.360
 or you got too much water in it.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.200
 The theories came out to be it caught on fire, right?

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.040
 Because we knew that.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.520
 But see, even then they go,

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.720
 if it caught on fire and blew up,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.500
 that would mean debris everywhere.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.640
 Whatever happened to this boat

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.880
 would have had to have happened so completely

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.720
 that not a single remnant,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.400
 I mean, boats are built to float.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.960
 That's if they can't float, they're not a boat.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.000
 So all the wood and all the pieces of it

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.880
 that are light enough to float on their own, plus bodies,

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.120
 nothing, the boat completely vanished.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.160
 And it's funny because at the beginning,

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.280
 people were thinking, 'cause they're hearing this stuff,

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.200
 they're looking for the boat,

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.440
 they're thinking maybe it's lost at sea.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.280
 The SS War at all, this is crazy,

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.480
 I wonder if new cruise liners do this.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.160
 It had enough supplies on that boat

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.040
 that it could spend a year at sea.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.680
 Like all the passengers, all the crew, everything,

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.440
 there was enough supplies in that boat

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.080
 that you would not starve or run out of water for a year.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.640
 So they had hope.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.000
 You can't find it, they're thinking,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.840
 'cause it's out there somewhere,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.080
 we'll find it, but the weeks and the months passed on

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.680
 and they've never found a single part of this boat.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.040
 So the theories have been freak wave,

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.680
 knocking the boat over, explosion,

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.720
 which they go, we would have found parts of it.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.720
 But the boat was lost at sea and we all know,

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.960
 including the investigators,

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.920
 'cause there was a whole like, Lloyds of London insurance

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.000
 thing that had to be paid out.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.360
 There was a big investigation of it.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.960
 I was able to find that old timey article,

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.880
 talking about this, that's like, it's really cool.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.320
 There was an article about,

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.040
 remember Claude got off the boat.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.480
 Everyone knew that.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.840
 He was the one survivor of the SS War at all.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.640
 So of course the investigators wanted to talk to him.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.480
 He was an experienced engineer,

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.960
 he was an experienced sea traveler,

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.560
 maybe he could give them some clue.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.840
 Why did he get off?

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.560
 Why did he get off the boat?

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.720
 And when he spoke before this tribunal,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.120
 the headline about his testimony,

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:52.960
 'cause it was in the news,

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.160
 this is so weird, well one,

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.920
 the missing ship was in the news,

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.040
 just like when we had that plane go down,

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.000
 what was it, MH370 or 380, 387?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.800
 That plane that's been missing for years now,

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.880
 it was in the news, it was such a mystery.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.760
 This article, the headline was the war at all.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.060
 A professor's alarm,

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.300
 saved by a vision.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:21.920
 This is December 23rd, 1909.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.040
 He's in Caxton Hall in London.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.320
 And this courtroom,

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.000
 they're talking to the only survivor, Claude G. Sawyer.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.080
 And he goes, listen, I didn't feel the boat was safe.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.400
 Just based on my experience,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.840
 I didn't feel the boat was safe.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.000
 It was way too top heavy.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.360
 For example,

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.840
 I tried taking a bath,

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.260
 I tried, this would be so scary, right?

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.780
 I mean, I may not realize it,

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.660
 'cause I'm just a layman, but this guy's a seaman.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.220
 And he said, I went to go take a bath.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.420
 While I was taking a bath,

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.420
 I could feel the rolling of the ship so much,

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.860
 like we were at a 45 degree angle,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.900
 like my bath water splashing out all over the place.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.420
 And not because I'm playing with a rubber ducky,

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.460
 we're listing way too hard, way too hard.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.640
 And I told the crew, I said, hey guys,

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.440
 I know you guys don't know me from dirt,

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.680
 but this boat, something's wrong with this boat,

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.920
 we're already at sea.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.680
 He said the crew blew him off.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.120
 He said, you had people walking around

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.800
 getting thrown from one side of the boat to the other.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.760
 They constantly were falling down.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.880
 He goes, you know what, the second we hit Durban,

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.360
 which was the next stop after leaving Australia,

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.720
 'cause he's rolling across the floor,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.080
 he has his hand on his chin.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.620
 He's like, the second we get to Durban, I'm getting off.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.420
 Like this is just ridiculous.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.220
 I don't know why I keep ordering milkshakes

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.100
 to go everywhere, I'm starving.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.740
 I'm getting off at Durban.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.300
 But what happened was, after a couple more days,

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.620
 like a day or two, everything seemed calmer.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.980
 It was almost like the crew must have moved something around

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.220
 down to the cargo area,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.540
 or they were controlling the boat a little bit better.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.140
 He's more experienced to just think,

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.340
 oh, it's calm weather now, the boat's better.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.460
 No, he goes, something seemed different

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.520
 about the boat actually seemed under control.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.820
 And I decided, you know what, I'm just gonna keep on going.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.100
 I'm not gonna get off at Durban.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.060
 Whatever the issue was, it's been handled.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.100
 Everything's a lot more stable now.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:26.740
 But then I had the dreams.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:33.220
 Claude told this hearing while he's in court,

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:38.220
 he said, I had the same dream three times in a row.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.140
 He said this man would be standing there,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:49.020
 wearing what he called, quote, very peculiar dress.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.300
 He goes, there's nothing I could recognize.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.380
 It wasn't a particular uniform,

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.760
 or anything I could put my hand on,

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.180
 but this man would be standing there

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.100
 and he was dressed in an odd way.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.540
 And he'd be standing before myself

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.380
 and all the passengers of the SS Warataw.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.420
 And in one hand, he held this long sword

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.180
 and he was pointing it towards us.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:20.660
 And in the other hand, he was holding a rag

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.620
 soaked in blood.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.420
 And I'd wake up.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.900
 That was the whole dream.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:35.460
 But after I had made the decision to continue on past Durban,

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.380
 once I said, no, I'm not gonna get off on Durban.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.340
 Once I had said they got the boat ready,

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.940
 it's not gonna tip over.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.940
 Once I had made that decision to travel onto Europe,

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.940
 to not get off at Durban,

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.220
 I had that same dream three times.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.300
 The man standing before us with the long sword

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.940
 and the bloody rag.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.660
 I said, I took this as a warning to leave.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.300
 I knew at this point that I had to get off at Durban.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.780
 And I tried.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.240
 I tried to get other people to get off with me.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.300
 I talked to people, I said, hey, listen.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.540
 I don't know if he told them about the dream,

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.940
 he said, guys, I had a crazy dream, listen.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.900
 He was telling people,

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.140
 I think we should get off at Durban.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.580
 I just have a better feeling about this boat.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.540
 He probably did use the Fakunamin engineer.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.780
 And if he had tried to convince them earlier, right,

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:39.460
 when the boat was so topsy-turvy to get off at Durban,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.220
 he might've gotten a few people off.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.900
 But it wasn't possible at this point.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.460
 People were like, no, 'cause it's so, this was their,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.800
 it would be so expensive and so hard to get back to Europe

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.140
 that he could not convince a single person

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.420
 to get off the boat.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.540
 The ship was stable,

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.140
 they weren't getting thrown around anymore,

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.560
 their baths were peaceful,

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.460
 so not a single person got off.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:13.780
 But Claude himself disembarked from the SS Warataw

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.020
 and entered the town of Durban,

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.540
 sending that telegram to his wife,

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.140
 not telling her the whole story.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:25.780
 And he was the only survivor of the SS Warataw.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:30.180
 And it's interesting, at this inquest, they asked,

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.220
 did you have any other dreams?

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.880
 And he said, yes, this is a quote,

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.720
 on July 28th, so this was it.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.040
 So remember, the cyclone hit on July 27th.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:49.280
 There wasn't word that the SS Warataw

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.320
 was even missing for weeks later.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.920
 Like, it was supposed to get to Cape Town,

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.560
 it was a little bit late, but boats are late.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.160
 And then about two weeks passed

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.380
 and it still hadn't shown up, but boats are late.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.700
 It was really at the three week mark

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.420
 when other boats that had left after it

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.380
 were reaching Cape Town before it.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.740
 That's when people started going,

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.340
 the SS Warataw is missing.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.300
 For those first couple of weeks,

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.140
 there was nobody really looking for the boat

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.220
 because its boats are constantly going missing.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.340
 So on July 28th, it was the day after the cyclone,

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.500
 two days after he had gotten off of the Warataw.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.380
 The boat had not been reported missing at this point.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.860
 Did you have another dream?

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.960
 Quote, yes.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.880
 On July 28th, I dreamt that the ship was in a heavy sea.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.280
 That a big wave came over the bowels

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.320
 and it sat down upon her.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:45.880
 And that she rolled over on the starboard and disappeared.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.120
 And he said, they asked him, were you a passenger

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.120
 in the dream, were you on the deck of the ship?

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.480
 And he's like, no, I saw the whole ship.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.940
 So I was like, just watching it.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.180
 He goes, I could see the whole ship

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.440
 so almost as if he's floating in the air.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.340
 Just watching the entire ship disappear under the waters.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:13.340
 It's interesting, you know,

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.860
 I have two more things to talk about.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.020
 First off, I wanna talk about the idea

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.500
 of being warned to not to go.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.920
 All right, that's a really terrifying thing.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.240
 And I think a lot of people,

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.080
 I mean, I've never had a warning this dire or this graphic.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.040
 I guess like really my thing is a lot of times

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.160
 when I'm flying on planes,

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.200
 I start like right before the plane takes off,

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.760
 sometimes I'll start to get anxious

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.640
 and I was thinking like, get off, get off the plane.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.360
 This is your final destination moment.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.920
 This anxiety that's coursing through your body,

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.000
 it's trying to get you to leave

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.520
 'cause if you don't leave now, you're gonna die.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.100
 Oh no, the plane takes off.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.940
 I'm just listening to music, reading a book.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:59.780
 You know what I mean?

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.900
 Like I get that inclination.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.780
 If I listened to my panic every single time

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.260
 I would get nothing done.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.220
 I wouldn't even leave the house.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.500
 It'd be like, 'cause there would be times

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.540
 I'd be like looking for my keys

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.660
 and I was like, where are my keys?

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.180
 And I go, oh, they're right here.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.460
 And I'm thinking, oh, the time you spent looking

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.260
 for that keys, what if that was time enough

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.220
 for that dog to get out of the backyard?

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.480
 If you had left earlier, if you'd left five minutes earlier,

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.480
 this is quite my existence.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.480
 You're like, man, that sounds pretty overwhelming.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.600
 It's better now.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.360
 My anxiety is not as bad, but I'll still get it.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.800
 Like my brain's telling me like, you have to leave right now

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.680
 'cause if you wait another five minutes to leave,

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.280
 that is when the car will hit you.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.640
 That's when the dog will rush out of its backyard

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.880
 and try to eat you.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.160
 But you can't, like those are the type of warnings I get.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.820
 They're really just anxiety attacks

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.740
 because I haven't been hit by a car or eaten by a dog yet.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.580
 But you know what I mean?

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.740
 Like I'll get that.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.940
 I think it's interesting 'cause you wonder like,

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.420
 how often this type of stuff happens and people go,

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.900
 no, I'm good, and then they die a horrible death

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.780
 and they don't tell the story.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.100
 They don't say, yeah, it was really weird.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.700
 I kept having these horrible nightmares

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.220
 about dying in a helicopter crash, right?

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.700
 I'd be flying this helicopter

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.340
 and then all of a sudden this bloody bird

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.980
 would hit the front window and then I'd wake up.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.740
 That dream happened two or three times.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.760
 But today's my first day at helicopter flight school.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.880
 That was clearly just nerves.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.480
 And then they die in the helicopter crash

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.320
 and they don't pass on that vision.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.120
 You wonder how often that happens.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.880
 You also wonder how many people, yeah,

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.840
 like aboard the SS war to itself.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.220
 Was he the only one to get the vision?

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.840
 What was that?

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.900
 What was the man?

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.740
 Who was that?

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.280
 What type of clothes was he wearing?

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.640
 With the long sword and the bloody rag.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.220
 There's so much stuff to just interpret from the dream.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.060
 Like who was that?

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.780
 Was that, if it was death, why was he warning him?

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.060
 Did anyone else have the dream?

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.220
 And they just wrote it off.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.840
 Were kids having nightmares and their parents weren't,

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.180
 oh, you know, you're just having a nightmare

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.940
 because you're sleeping next to dead cows.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.460
 Buck up, Johnny, don't worry.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.340
 That repetitive dream you have about dying,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.620
 I'm sure is nothing.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.820
 The one that you keep seeing,

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.900
 your loved ones drown in front of you.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.780
 I'm sure that has nothing to do with the fact

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.180
 that you're all on this boat.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:23.060
 Where other people getting the dream,

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.640
 how often do these type of dreams happen?

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:31.120
 It's terrifying because you don't wanna listen

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.580
 to that little voice in your head all the time

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.460
 because it may be wrong.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.220
 And then you miss out on a really cool opportunity

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.200
 to do something 'cause you're too scared to do it.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.720
 Like in the, like you ready to go

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.960
 for your very first day at parachuting, right?

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.720
 You wanna be a skydiver and you can't wait.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.040
 You saved up your money, you're ready to go

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.060
 and then that day you have a nightmare.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.900
 That night you have a nightmare that you die skydiving.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.460
 Do you not go skydiving that day?

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.720
 I mean, you waited all this time to do this.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.300
 Is that really a premonition or is it just your nerves?

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.780
 Like that's that gamble, right?

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.540
 That's that gamble we're rolling.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.620
 You're rolling your dice in your skydive anyways,

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.360
 but you know what I mean?

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.640
 Like that you can't let it get in the way

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.680
 but what happens when the vision turns out to be true?

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.260
 He was the only survivor of this boat

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.860
 that mysteriously went down.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.900
 And it's interesting because I have to say

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.680
 he had that dream of the wave knocking over the boat.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.320
 He never saw the boat again.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.760
 And while that is possible and that's one of the theories,

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.420
 they still go we should have found something from the boat.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:42.800
 Even boats get knocked over by waves, not all the time,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.280
 but it used to be we'd still find pieces of the boat

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.800
 somewhere, a body, a life raft and or nothing.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.640
 We found nothing from this boat.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.760
 What I thought was creepy and we'll wrap it up like this

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.960
 is one of the theories of what may have happened to this boat.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.080
 We'll take his dream at, you know,

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.800
 he may have the dream where the wave hit it

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.440
 and it got knocked over, maybe not.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.760
 Maybe that was just not a vision.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.380
 Maybe that was just a fear.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.480
 But one of the theories is that the boat,

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.640
 the reason why we never found any pieces of the boat

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.640
 and never will most likely is the cyclone blew the boat,

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.040
 off course, fire, 'cause again, we saw those fires burning.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.300
 They go as possible that the engine did catch on fire,

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.980
 they were able to put it out.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.440
 But now they're in a boat with no way

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.760
 to control where it's going.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.560
 And the ocean just kept pushing it further and further south

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.900
 to Antarctica.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.120
 They go as 100% possible that this would happen.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.960
 They go, that would explain why we found

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.840
 no nothing from it.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.720
 Because once it got to Antarctica,

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.740
 anything that was breaking off of that boat

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.960
 would just be floating around the Arctic coastline.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.480
 And if you didn't spot it, I mean,

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.120
 I know we have research bases out there

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.080
 and things like that, but they're not taking fun runs

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.900
 along the coastline to find the seashells.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.680
 If that boat got pushed towards Antarctica,

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.640
 you have a year's worth of supplies onboard.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.840
 But there's no hope for rescue.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.680
 You don't have a radio, nobody knows where you're at.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.800
 You don't even know where you're at.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.500
 You just know you're at the most southern point of the world.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:36.060
 You're on board with any passengers who survived the storm.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.100
 Right, if the boat did get tipped and came back up

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:43.600
 or just got blown around, off course, damaged engine.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.360
 You have a year of food,

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.220
 but you can't leave the shelter of the ship.

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:53.220
 It would be pitch black most of the time.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:57.660
 Fresh air meant freezing cold conditions.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.180
 You would have to be huddled

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.620
 as deep into the boat as possible at almost all times.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.300
 And even then, it gives you very little protection

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.120
 from the extreme cold weather.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:14.940
 Cold winds whipping against the side of the boat slowly,

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.280
 but surely destroying what little safety you have.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.260
 You and hundreds of other people crowded

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:27.260
 into the deepest and warmest parts of the SS Waratah.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:33.820
 But you know this can't last.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:38.500
 You know not only will you die here,

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.060
 but no one will ever find your body.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.580
 As you sit there huddled in the darkness,

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.340
 you can only think of one thing.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.620
 I should have listened to the man,

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.460
 the man who tried to warn me.

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.180
 (timeitian music)

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:03.580
 (upbeat music)
