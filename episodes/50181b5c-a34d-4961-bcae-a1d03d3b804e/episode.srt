1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
 Would you be willing to play a video game that if you died, you die?

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,320
 And then we end season 19 with a terrifying look at our possible future.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,440
 We always hear stories about the great reset, an idea that eventually we will be forced

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,200
 to eat bugs and be happy about it.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,280
 Well, what if things are actually worse than that?

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,080
 What if it's not bugs that we'll be forced to eat?

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,040
 You knew this would end the season.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,440
 What if it's not bugs that we will be forced to eat?

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,400
 What if we have to eat poop today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:56,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,040
 I'm your host Jason Garbiner, I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,800
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
 We got a bunch of announcements too.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,600
 So let's get started right away for the last episode of season 19.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now was our newest Patreon supporter.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,440
 He's carrying a spear and a shield.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,040
 I don't know, maybe he's just carrying a 32 on sprite.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command, everyone give it up for Harun Shaik.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,760
 Everyone's like, "Dude, learn how to pronounce people's names.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
 I'm trying.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,960
 Harun, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,040
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that I do.

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,520
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
 That helps out so much.

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,720
 If you get any value from this show, please help the show grow."

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,600
 This is also the last episode of season 19.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
 I'm going to be taking a break until December 1st.

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,800
 So I hope you guys stick around until the break's over.

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,520
 I'm hoping you play some Dying Light.

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,400
 I just got that game on a steam sale not too long ago.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,600
 I'm a huge fan of Dead Island, so I think it's like Dead Island, but faster and spookier.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
 We'll find out.

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,920
 But even though I'm not coming out with brand new episodes until December 1st, on November

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,680
 24th at 12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, we will be doing our annual Thanksgiving livestream

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
 special.

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,320
 I hope you guys are able to join us for that.

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,800
 Listen, I get it if you can't.

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 It's a huge holiday.

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,880
 You guys are out doing stuff as well.

41
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,000
 But if you do have some free time, stop on by November 24th, 12 p.m. Pacific Standard

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Time.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 It's always been fun.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 We've done a lot of these.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 We'll for them.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Or this will be the fourth one.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
 Over the years, that's a lot of fun.

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,360
 And lastly, before we get the episode started, there's a billion cars driving by today.

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,560
 I don't know why it's so busy and I'm recording in my living room again.

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,480
 But before we get started, one more thing.

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,160
 Let's take a look at this submission for Fanart Friday.

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 Look at this little bunny.

53
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
 This little bunny man.

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,640
 It's technically a dead wrap radio logo.

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
 It's not a man.

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,760
 But this was sent to me by Lyssa on the Patreon Discord.

57
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
 I love it.

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
 I love these little sketches.

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,760
 It never stops humbling me when I see people take time out of their day to do a little

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
 sketch.

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
 That's really cool.

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
 Or just even to listen.

63
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,200
 People constantly sending me emails that they listen to the show during their work or during

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,720
 their commute or while they're washing the dishes.

65
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 That's really cool.

66
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,800
 That's honestly really cool because that's how I enjoy podcasts.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,240
 And it's cool that I'm part of that day for you.

68
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
 I really, really enjoy it.

69
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
 And that's why I keep doing this show.

70
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
 Haroon.

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,920
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started.

72
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,640
 This episode I'm really excited about.

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
 This is some cool stuff here.

74
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
 Haroon.

75
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,880
 I'm going to touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

76
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,160
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

77
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:41,600
 Take us all the way out to an eSports arena.

78
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,680
 Haroon pulls up outside of this arena and he's like, "Is this the place?"

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,040
 And I'm like, "No, this is an actual sport being played.

80
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,640
 There's football going on in there.

81
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
 Keep driving.

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,320
 We need to find an eSports arena."

83
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
 So he's driving.

84
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,760
 He gets to a college campus and there's like a little room off to the side and we see people

85
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,680
 walking in with their laptops and they're like, "This LAN party is going to be great.

86
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,040
 Doom emulators for all."

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
 And I'm like, "Nope.

88
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
 Nope.

89
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
 We're not going here either."

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
 And you're like, "What?

91
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
 Where are we going?"

92
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,760
 And those guys definitely were the definition of an eSports.

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,880
 In 1999, Jason, who's still having LAN parties.

94
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,120
 How old are you?

95
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 Okay.

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
 Come on.

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
 Get back in the car.

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
 Haroon.

99
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
 This isn't the right eSports arena.

100
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
 Keep driving.

101
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,320
 So he's driving through the city and we pass like all these other arenas.

102
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,400
 And finally, he pulls up to this auto mechanics garage.

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,760
 I was like, "Here's the place."

104
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
 Apparently, I turned into a prospect.

105
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,360
 They're all of a sudden, "Here's the place.

106
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,360
 This is where the gold be."

107
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,000
 So we walk into this mechanics shop and there seems to be no one around.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,920
 And I was like, "It's pretty clever.

109
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,520
 It's pretty clever hiding spot, isn't this?

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,200
 I saw this on an episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and I hit a button and all

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,480
 of a sudden the lift that lifts the car up, it lifts up and now you see there's like a

112
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,520
 staircase descending under the ground, which seemed great on an episode of Teenage Mutant

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
 Ninja Turtles.

114
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,320
 But now that I think about it, it's kind of a different story.

115
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,160
 I think it's a bit of a dead giveaway because people would be like, "Hey, can you work on

116
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
 my car?"

117
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
 And they're like, "No."

118
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,080
 You're like, "There's a lift right there.

119
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,160
 Just lift it up.

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
 Use my car.

121
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
 Fix it."

122
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
 And they're like, "No."

123
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,600
 Because there's a hidden passageway down there built by Baxter Stockman.

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,160
 We go down this staircase and we hear this, "Oh yeah.

125
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
 Woo, go yeah.

126
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
 Woo."

127
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
 We're like, "What in the world was that?"

128
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,840
 We keep walking down the stairs and we keep hearing like, "Yeah, yeah.

129
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
 Place your bets.

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
 Place your bets.

131
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,240
 Who's going to win this time?"

132
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
 Yeah, yeah.

133
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,640
 And we walk into this massive underground eSports arena.

134
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,140
 We see two teams.

135
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,080
 They're both maybe 32 people in each team.

136
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,240
 Pretty standard for first person shooter, player versus player.

137
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,740
 Hold on.

138
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,840
 I got to move my studio back into the closet.

139
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,040
 Yeah, I moved it out last night.

140
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,160
 I was hoping to record it out here.

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,400
 But apparently, Autobots and Decepticons are fighting in the front yard.

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
 It's so loud here.

143
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,960
 So give me a second.

144
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,160
 Okay, sorry about that.

145
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,760
 That was super annoying.

146
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,560
 It's like every car in the neighborhood decided to test out their snow tires on dry roads

147
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
 today.

148
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,520
 That's why everything is so loud out there in the living room.

149
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,720
 We're in this underground eSports arena.

150
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
 We see on opposite sides of the room two different teams.

151
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,080
 And there's about 32 players on each team and they're playing a first person shooter.

152
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
 But seated all around them.

153
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,960
 This really is like a sports arena.

154
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:46,040
 We see the rich and powerful and the dark and mysterious as well.

155
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,280
 Not Darth Vader, not Darth Vader, although he fits both of those descriptions.

156
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
 Well this isn't just any old eSports.

157
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,080
 I'm sure you could have guessed that the fact that we had to walk through an underground

158
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,700
 tunnel in a hidden passageway in a mechanics shop.

159
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,760
 This isn't any old regular old League of Legends nonsense.

160
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,000
 This is truly a one of a kind event.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,160
 It is a gaming competition where if your character dies in the game, your head blows

162
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
 up.

163
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
 Can you go chase him?

164
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,400
 Yes, I'm sure this is possible like in science fiction.

165
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,440
 I've seen tons of stuff with this in it.

166
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,480
 From the lawnmower man to the lawnmower man too.

167
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,560
 The idea of dying in the video game makes you die in real life.

168
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,720
 Well it was a work of fiction until just recently.

169
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,520
 Well to be fair it still is a work of fiction.

170
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,400
 The situation I laid out has not happened yet.

171
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,760
 But recently Shananigans, a long time supporter of the show, Shananigans on Twitter sent me

172
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,280
 this article about this man named Palmer Lucky.

173
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
 Palmer Lucky.

174
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,800
 If anyone sounds like a character from a Philip K Dick novel, it's this guy.

175
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,760
 Palmer Lucky, apparently he's the co-founder of the Oculus, the VR headset.

176
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:19,240
 He also has defense contracts and he has created a VR headset that has three bombs in it.

177
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,640
 Right now he says this is kind of a piece of art sitting around the office but he's

178
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,520
 constructed this.

179
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:34,640
 He goes, the idea is it's a VR headset that if you die in the game you die in real life.

180
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,280
 You go why would anyone invent this?

181
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,440
 Why would anyone invent this?

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,760
 Well apparently he's a big fan of an anime called Sword Art Online and the premise of

183
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,880
 that show is people put on VR headsets and they get teleported to this completely realistic

184
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
 VR world.

185
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,520
 It's not realistic, I guess there's dragons and stuff, little talking mushrooms.

186
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,680
 But you think that you're actually in this world but in the real world you're hooked

187
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,920
 up to this VR system and if you die in the video game you die in real life.

188
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,520
 He's a big fan of that and he goes, you know what?

189
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,360
 I used to be a big fan of Godzilla.

190
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,120
 I irradiated a bunch of iguanas that didn't do anything.

191
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,840
 Maybe I'll be a big fan of this cartoon.

192
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,440
 Maybe I should invent something that will kill you if you die in the game.

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,600
 And you're going, why would anyone, even if someone's a big fan of something.

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,480
 I mean there's two elements to it.

195
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,600
 One you die in the game.

196
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,320
 Two the game is awesome enough to want to take the risk of dying.

197
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,240
 The Sword Art Online world is so vivid that it's worth that risk.

198
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,880
 If you're hooked up to this headset you're playing Medal of Honor for the PS2.

199
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
 I mean that's not worth it, right?

200
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,240
 But imagine if you could go to a virtual world that was so beautiful and everything was amazing

201
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,040
 and it was everything that the real world isn't.

202
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,600
 Would you risk your head blowing up?

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,120
 You might be shaking your head no but remember talking mushrooms, talking mushrooms.

204
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
 You have those guys as well.

205
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,720
 He's invented this and he goes, listen there are a few things I need to work out.

206
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,440
 There are a few glitches I need to work out with this bomb you strapped to your head.

207
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,200
 He goes first off, we'd have to make it so the charges don't accidentally go off.

208
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,160
 Which is yes, that's a pretty big problem when you're dealing with bombs.

209
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,160
 He goes, the way I envision it is that the bombs will detonate when a specific frequency

210
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,440
 of red flashing lights appears in the game.

211
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,080
 That'll cause the bomb to go off.

212
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,640
 So that way you could have it for different video games.

213
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,320
 The developer of the video game would know the frequency that would be game over.

214
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,880
 Not just the frequency of somebody flashing a flashlight in your face.

215
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,880
 You're just floating around neopets and some dudes like click click click click and your

216
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,160
 head blows up.

217
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,040
 You could trigger it to be a specific frequency of red lights.

218
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,040
 That's the first thing he has to get that thing done.

219
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,920
 He goes secondly, the game world and then the kind of what I was saying he goes you

220
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:17,120
 would have to have a game world that was so vivid and so amazing that yes it would be

221
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,560
 risky it would be worth the rest to get your head blown off.

222
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,000
 Like otherwise when you put the goggles on if you are playing like Chester Cheetah's

223
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,760
 jail break out that you got free when you ordered a pizza had pizza.

224
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:37,080
 Obviously that would be the most stressful platformer you'd ever played but you would

225
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,880
 know when that prickly cactus was shooting its thorns at you that you're not really

226
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
 in danger.

227
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,600
 I mean you are you do have a bomb strap to your head but in the game world you would

228
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 just be like oh that's just a guy shooting sprites at me.

229
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,800
 Now that would be the last thought you had as your head disintegrates into a pile of

230
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,200
 blood brain matter skull and half chewed pizza.

231
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,520
 He goes the game would have to be indistinguishable from reality to make it all fit.

232
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,600
 It is something that I think game designers are working towards and what's funny is that

233
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,120
 I would love a system like this.

234
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,640
 Not necessarily my brain blowing up but when I play Minecraft I play in hardcore mode and

235
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,520
 that's where when you die your whole world gets erased and I'll drop like 30-40 hours

236
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,240
 into a one world and I like find a village and I build a wall around it and I do all

237
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,440
 this stuff and then I make up missions for myself.

238
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,520
 I'd be like oh I must go find a treasure chest so I'm walking around and I basically

239
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,640
 play in this Minecraft game which is okay to be fair for me making fun of League of

240
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,080
 Legends multiple times.

241
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,880
 I get it Minecrafts for babies but I love Minecraft.

242
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,880
 I play in the hardcore mode and then I put 30-40 hours into a single world and then Creeper

243
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,920
 blows me up and it makes the impact so monumental.

244
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,240
 So I get like the need for it.

245
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,720
 He has a quote he goes quote "Pumped up graphics may make a game look more real but only the

246
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,760
 threat of serious consequences can make a game feel real to you and every other person in

247
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
 the game."

248
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
 And I do agree with that.

249
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,760
 I would love the idea of a game that if you died in it the game is deleted.

250
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
 Like you have to buy another copy of the game.

251
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,160
 I think that would be great.

252
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,920
 I think it would be great if you had a first person shooter and if you die in the game

253
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:37,360
 there's then like a 5-10 minute unskippable cutscene of the army going to your wife's

254
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,200
 house and knocking on the door and you see her sobbing and then they cut to a scene of

255
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
 a mom.

256
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,120
 It's actually your mom before you play the game.

257
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,160
 You have to get digital photos of everyone you know and your mom's like no not my son

258
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
 no.

259
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,600
 And then there's like a full there's a full length funeral and it would really make the

260
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,160
 dying in the game be more consequential.

261
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,440
 Imagine GTA but you get a car accident and the cops arrest you they're like that's it

262
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,360
 we're gonna find you $1,000 we take all your weapons and you can't play this game for the

263
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,240
 next 10 days.

264
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,080
 Palmer Lucky says as far as he knows this has never been done before but the genie is

265
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,400
 out of the bottle.

266
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:30,600
 And this would be awesome for the Illuminati that we talk about we recently did an episode

267
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,840
 on this guy named Donald Marshall who talked about underground gladiator combats and they

268
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:43,840
 use clones and he fought Mick Jagger and Brendan Fraser stabbed him in the intestines and

269
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
 all this stuff.

270
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,320
 They were clones by the way if you're a huge Brendan Fraser fan don't give up on him it

271
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,280
 was his clone but he believes that celebrities from around the world have killed him and

272
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:03,760
 the gladiator and this cloned gladiator arena and as foolish as that is what you're really

273
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,040
 doing in essence is you're taking two people you're giving them weapons and then you're

274
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,160
 like fight fight to the death and then you as a businessman standing about 20 feet from

275
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,760
 them or sitting in some arena as these two people you've kidnapped are hacking at each

276
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,560
 other with swords now we've all watched enough movies where you have the two people being

277
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,840
 like you know what we're the ones with the swords they're just some rich guy in a suit

278
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,600
 let's team up and we can hack our way out of here and all of a sudden the guys like

279
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,880
 no no don't kill me I'm from Wall Street and the two guys start a slave revolution.

280
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,000
 Just them it's revolution of two but it works.

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,560
 You would think that right you would always you'd basically be getting these trained fighters

282
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,240
 and locking them up and being like you will fight to the death until you become too weak

283
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,340
 to fight anymore and then you will die and then the prisoners like or or you just start

284
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,960
 beating you up now and I'm assuming they'd also have goons with guns the Illuminati people

285
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,920
 have goons with guns and around but my point is is that you can do it like that you can

286
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,240
 have people place wagers but when you look at something like the squid game that's squid

287
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,920
 game show they had to build these massive sets massive sets and even when you had like I

288
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,840
 think it started off with like 460 people they did have guards with guns but you could easily

289
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,760
 have these uprisings but imagine if the squid games with just people with bombs on their

290
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,080
 heads playing playing squid game mods on roblox and they're like all the controls totally

291
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,880
 suck what are you talking about oh man my keyboard stuck and their heads are just blowing up

292
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:46,560
 I totally could see that happening I could totally see some sort of underground group

293
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,920
 forcing people to fight to the death but instead of giving them weapons and you figured this

294
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,520
 would even the battlefield like imagine if a super buff dude got kidnapped and then

295
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,040
 next to him got kidnapped to scientists and he's like oh man never worked out my muscles

296
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,120
 except for my brain obviously I mean is a when you're betting you're gonna be like

297
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:13,200
 this is a joke I'm gonna bet on the buff dude but if everyone was in a VR world and

298
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,960
 they died it would be more even playing field I mean obviously the nerd would have an advantage

299
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,800
 there but a fascinating thing he says that this is the first time as far as he knows

300
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:27,560
 they've been invented I'm sure there have been other versions of this okay I guess I

301
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:33,120
 can't say I'm sure it is pretty science science fiction even now that the cats out of the bag

302
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:41,040
 I can see people going make us 64 of these we're gonna hold a tournament and whoever

303
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,640
 sucks at this first person shooter their brains blow up although now that I think about it

304
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,960
 you you would imagine the you imagine the Illuminati would have better things to do than

305
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,520
 hosting these type of summits and actually that's a great segue into our next story Haroon

306
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,760
 let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter we're taking it out one more

307
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,880
 time this season flies away from this gladiator arena there's only one dude left with his

308
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,120
 brains intact he's the winner he's covered in brains you imagine playing a first person

309
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,560
 video game with a VR headset on and you know it's to the death and when another player

310
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,960
 like the guy sitting at the computer next to you when he died you're playing a game

311
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,240
 right you have a perfect sniper position and then all of a sudden two feet away you hear

312
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,640
 a BAM and you're just covered in brain matter like it would totally freak you out that would

313
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,000
 be the worst possible thing I guess the worst possible thing would be the guy sitting next

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,800
 to you with no head that would be the worst but the second worst possible thing is you're

315
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,200
 trying to not die and all of a sudden you're just getting covered that loud explosion you're

316
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,200
 getting covered in brains and guts and gore I just had to leave you with that last horrible

317
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,160
 image Haroon take this carpenter copter away from this arena we're flying all the way out

318
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:11,320
 to a weightlifting gym there's a company called fit biomex they probably mispronounce in that

319
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,920
 it's probably fit by oh I don't know is there another way to pronounce anyways fit biomex

320
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,960
 is closer to probably what it is there's a company called fit biomex and and that fit

321
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,680
 biomex they have this new product invented by dr. Jonathan shyman it's called Nella

322
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:41,600
 it's not a bad name right remind you of Nutella well be prepared to not eat any more Nutella

323
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,520
 after shyman he has invented this thing called the Nella he goes here's the thing I've discovered

324
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,920
 through my research that to be a super athlete it's more than just your training it's more

325
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,160
 than just your diet it's even more than just your genetics a large part of it is also your

326
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,920
 gut biome so then we're standing there in this weightlifting gym and we see this muscle

327
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,280
 bound dude like doing all these reps he's like oh yeah look at me look at me he definitely

328
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,960
 has some issues he's like life doesn't matter unless people look at me he's left on all these

329
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,680
 weights he's like look at me and dr. shyman goes have you guys ever wanted to be as thick

330
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:29,760
 and muscular as this dude here take this pill I've invented it's called Nella he's holding

331
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,440
 this pill out to us and on the one hand yeah sure would be awesome to be this total buff

332
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,720
 dude who has issues with people paying attention to one but on the other hand hey doc didn't

333
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,000
 you just say something about gut biome like trying to figure out like how athletes and

334
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,840
 their what's inside their guts is actually helping them out and as you're asking that

335
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,120
 question I put my hand up over my mouth I'm like as you're asking that question he flicks

336
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:05,360
 the pill in your throat you're like uh uh if you take the Nella you can actually become

337
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,640
 an elite athlete now Nella before you get too excited for you run to the store you're

338
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,080
 like oh I got a marathon coming up can I get one box of Nella let me tell you what's in

339
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:24,640
 it what he does and this is what he discovered he said he drove around Boston for two weeks

340
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:34,840
 eight hours a day he's driving around Boston he's collecting stool samples from elite runners

341
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,960
 and what he realized was if you look at elite runners they have this thing called well I

342
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,920
 guess most people have it it's called bacterium vellanella atypica and he goes when you look

343
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:52,480
 at elite runners they have very very high consistently high levels of this bacterium

344
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,800
 he said a normal person this spikes during exertion and this is one of the reasons why

345
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:03,920
 your muscles get sore but if I took the stool samples from these elite athletes he didn't

346
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,880
 tell them he just snuck into their house late at night he's all hiding in the closet waiting

347
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,880
 till they go to bed and then he crawls out in the darkness with a little spoon with a

348
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,800
 little wooden spoon a taster spoon from Baskin Robbins go up in their butthole he realized

349
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:25,200
 that they have this in them they have a lot of this bacterium vellanella atypica and this

350
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:33,920
 is part of being an elite athlete he injected this bacterium into mice and what can only

351
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:43,040
 be described as the funniest and cruelest experiment he injected this bacterium into

352
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:50,800
 mice and they were able to run 13 percent longer than normal so I mean that's something

353
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,760
 you give the intern to do right I'm sure Dr. Shyam is like no no I want to inject them

354
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,160
 I did all the work I get to have all the fun he's injecting it into the mice but then you

355
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,640
 make your intern just watch two mice run two mice run around on these wheels they're like

356
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,480
 tell me how long the one with the gut biome stuff tell me how much more he runs and then

357
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,240
 he goes out on another fecal gathering mission so if you take a mice who's injected with

358
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,000
 this he could run 13 times longer now others go you know sure the science might be there

359
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,560
 we do know that your gut biome is a huge part of who you are they say 90 percent of the

360
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,920
 body serotonin gets produced by your gut bacteria I think it's really interesting when people

361
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,160
 go I have a craving for sugar I have a craving for that that's all your gut bacteria if you've

362
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,280
 ever gone a couple days without sugar because I very rarely have sugar but it's weird when

363
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:50,160
 I do have sugar then the next three days I'm craving it because all the flora in your stomach

364
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,480
 is there it pops up when you eat sugar and it's sending signals to your brain going eat

365
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,200
 more sugar eat more sugar because if it doesn't get sugar it dies off the whole life form in

366
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,920
 your stomach it's almost like a parasite in there and it's controlling you and that's

367
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,600
 why when you start overeating it's hard to stop and you have food addicts it's different

368
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,840
 where you're like a gambling addict that's like a serotonin thing in your brain or your

369
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:21,280
 heroin addict that's the heroin interacting with the dopamine receptors in your brain

370
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,880
 food addiction sugar addiction is actually a new life form in your stomach developing

371
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:35,920
 and then releasing chemicals into the bloodstream saying feed us feed us and you're building

372
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,560
 up this new life form in your stomach and when you stop eating sugar like it takes three

373
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:47,960
 days for this life form to completely die out then it will stop sending the signals because

374
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,800
 it's dead it can no longer talk to you it's totally different it's super weird the addiction

375
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,640
 to food is different there's a new life form in you trying to get you to eat more of what

376
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,200
 it needs fascinating stuff so we know the gut biome is super important but he's saying

377
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,720
 you can take this Nella and you now have the gut biome or you take it regularly of course

378
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,640
 there's a monthly subscription for $59 a box which you can either go wow that's really

379
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,040
 low to be an elite athlete or wow that's really high to eat someone else's poop but you can

380
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,920
 get a monthly subscription of Nella and they're saying that if you take this you will be able

381
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,040
 to run longer than normal I'm sure I'm sure that's not the only thing on the box because

382
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,360
 otherwise you're like I know I'm good I don't run that much anyways but I saw that and I

383
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,880
 go okay the this the VR brain thing that's something that I could see in a sci-fi movie

384
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,560
 and then I could see someone building it in real life if you wanted to have real life

385
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,280
 gladiator combat this would be the way to do it it'd be the safest way I mean not for

386
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,480
 the participants but for you or could just be a novelty this one this is really being

387
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:07,440
 produced and it is a performance enhancing supplement imagine a world where if you want

388
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,600
 to compete in sports you have to eat human poop because everyone else is eating human

389
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:21,800
 poop now to be very clear to be very clear 20 30 minutes into talking about this he is

390
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,160
 not selling I guess I should clear this up for the lawsuit for the inevitable lawsuit

391
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:34,600
 he is not selling pills of human poop I keep human poop I also accuse this guy of hiding

392
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,920
 in people's closets with tiny wooden spoons and taking their poop out without their knowledge

393
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,640
 that's just hearsay your honor that's just hearsay I heard it in my own head and then

394
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,440
 I said it he's not selling pills of human poop but he's selling pills of this bacterium

395
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:57,960
 cocktail but in essence I mean tomato tomato right you're taking a pill that at one point

396
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:05,520
 this bacteria was in some dude's butthole now maybe once I said that I go game it's

397
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,640
 not that maybe he cultured this bacteria right once he knows what it is he could then bring

398
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,560
 more of it in his laboratory but I would still argue in this upcoming defamation case that

399
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,880
 if you this is a philosophers question right if you took a piece of poop out of a man's

400
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,960
 butthole and then isolated a small piece of that poop and then use that small piece of

401
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:34,520
 poop to create a chemical are you still not eating a man's poop are you still not that

402
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,520
 was the origin point are you still not eating something that came out of some other dudes

403
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:48,600
 but now I'm not a runner I don't run for nothing but if I was a runner I would be thinking

404
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,960
 well everyone else in the race is eating human poop why why aren't I there's some guy there's

405
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,000
 some guy just scooping it up he's like what oh you're supposed to think this is in a form

406
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,600
 of a pill this is a supplement that you could see almost you having to take if you are doing

407
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,560
 any sorts of sports at all you're going up against people who are eating human poop and

408
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,440
 you're not there's a lot of stuff that we would never do if we were forced to no one

409
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,920
 no one would want to live in a society where people go you gotta eat this poop it'll make

410
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,200
 you work harder do it I work at best by how hard do I have to work I'd have to eat human

411
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,000
 poop but if it's voluntary right it's voluntary this is something that you could see athletes

412
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,320
 going if I want to compete at an elite level I gotta eat the poop I almost feel like this

413
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,680
 isn't a social issue or a science issue it feels I don't I know I tossed a word around

414
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,920
 demonic I know I toss a word demonic around a lot on this show but it sounds like something

415
00:28:50,920 --> 00:29:04,920
 that is so anti-human to eat something that came from fecal matter now I have to be very

416
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:12,120
 very clear I am going to go and check and and see because now I'm thinking about it

417
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:19,200
 now that I accused Dr. Scheinman of hiding people's closets taking stool samples without

418
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,080
 their permission getting enjoyment out of injecting fecal matter into mice I'm starting

419
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:32,440
 to think I'm starting to think of something here there's going to be two things one I

420
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,200
 either in the episode going is it possible we'll live in a world where people aren't

421
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,480
 taking fecal matter fecal matter to win sports but really they're enacting some sort of ancient

422
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,560
 right to an old pagan god like really this is what it sounds like devouring fecal matter

423
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,520
 is that's like belphagore there's a demon who loves poop and every time you use the

424
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,080
 toilet I believe his name is belphagore I'll double check that but you every time you go

425
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,840
 poop you're basically worshiping him and this sounds almost like a demonic plot and people

426
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,920
 having like this is really what it comes down with deals with the devil right you can train

427
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,000
 hard and you can do your best but eventually everyone else in your sport is taking human

428
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,680
 poop now you have to make a deal with the devil are you going to stick up for yourself

429
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,640
 and say you know what I run for the enjoyment I don't run to win so I don't want to eat

430
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,600
 human poop that's what a deal or you know I am going to eat poop I'm going to eat poop

431
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,400
 to win that's really what a deal with the devil is you're making you're compromising

432
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:37,600
 your own idea of what it means to be human and somewhat argue what means to be fair in

433
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:47,880
 sports you're eating human fecal matter to become a better athlete and that sounds like

434
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:57,480
 a demonic pact you're giving away a bit of your humanity for a simple contest something

435
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,520
 that's meaningless on the grand scale of things but you're eating poop to do it and all the

436
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:08,680
 while this great demon is watching all of this with glee while the world became more

437
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,520
 sanitized as we cleaned up the streets from just logs of poop rolling down the open sewers

438
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,880
 of London to a world that's so sanitized that kids get peanut allergies because they're

439
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,280
 not getting exposed to germs and bacterium that they normally are in childhood we've

440
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:30,080
 come a long way in a very short period of time any sort of demonic entity that fed off

441
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,240
 of filth and disease would be losing power but now in the guise of a pill that makes

442
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,560
 you a better athlete people are willingly ingesting fecal matter this demon who had

443
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,360
 been slowly but steadily losing influence over the world is now in its own way being

444
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,600
 worshipped when people are taking the Nella pill they're not like this is for you grand

445
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,280
 demon of fecal matter globe but in a way they're doing that sacrament it's more than that it's

446
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,800
 more than that throughout all human history people hated waste product but now they're

447
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:11,800
 willingly eating it and so is this the return of this belphagore type character this demon

448
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:18,680
 who lives in the waste waters a demon that lives in the filth you're taking the sacrament

449
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,080
 just like you were taking the Lord's Supper taking the consecrated wafer and a little

450
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:35,520
 bit of wine could this be his way back to power if you want to win you have to ingest

451
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:47,000
 the poop if you want to win you have to worship the demon of the toilet that's one way I can

452
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,600
 in the episode but I am gonna say this I'm recording this for a little bit of safety

453
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,160
 there's a possibility I thought about this as I was recording it that he's not actually

454
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:02,320
 he's not actually giving people pooped I thought about this like a wait a second I never care

455
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,840
 to me until I was reading over my notes and I'm recording the last I was so to season

456
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:16,680
 19 maybe he wasn't feeding people poop maybe I'm sure there was a bunch of you shaking

457
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,360
 your heads this whole time and you're like is Jason does actually think that these Nell

458
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,000
 the bills are like brown there's a little piece of corn there's a little piece of corn

459
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,880
 in some of them no I don't think that but I'm thinking now that the stool samples were

460
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,480
 just for the experiments in the sense that he goes I wonder if there's something different

461
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,760
 in an elite runner stools so he went into the creepy way into the creepy way like I said

462
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,400
 he asked people hey can I have some of your stool please which that's actually super creepy

463
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,680
 as well but he gets this stool of elite runners and he gets stool of regular people and then

464
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,200
 he matches it goes wow if you're an elite runner your stool has more of this bacterium

465
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:12,640
 this Vella Nella atypica interesting so then no stool involved in the production process

466
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:19,560
 I didn't think about this I totally didn't even think about this then he throws away

467
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:27,640
 all of the poop and he is able to produce Vella Nella atypica in some other sort of way

468
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:32,320
 like he's puts out like a piece of bread like he's doing some sort of science project for

469
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,240
 fifth grade he leaves a piece of bread after a couple days and it grows mold and he's

470
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,880
 able to isolate the Vella Nella atypica maybe he was able to produce this Saiyans butthole

471
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,120
 and that's what the pill is the pill just like probiotics when you go and buy him at

472
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:53,280
 the store it's possible just to be clear I'm gonna double check before I release this episode

473
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,480
 he's gonna be like clearly you're all this man is no no idea what he's talking about he

474
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,320
 disparaged me for 30 minutes he called me a freak a freak who's hiding in the shadows

475
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:12,040
 of people's closets so maybe he didn't I will I will record this part just in case maybe

476
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,880
 he didn't maybe he wasn't hiding people's closets maybe this has nothing to do with human poop

477
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:29,160
 in its final form that might have just been the experiment or maybe tonight when you're

478
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,840
 getting ready to go to bed you go you know what man season 19 that sure was a wild ride

479
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:39,120

481
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:51,320
 big marathon tomorrow well I'll figure it out later you fall asleep then your closet

482
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:58,960
 door opens in the middle of the night and you see a doctor shyman shaped silhouette start

483
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,560
 to creep out and you're like what oh no oh no exactly what it's so it looks like it's

484
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,960
 not just I'm it's not just shy man and you see him pull up a little wooden spoon and

485
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,200
 you go to get up then you realize there's four super strong men surrounding your bed they've

486
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,720
 had all the fecal matter they want which is only a lot there's some weird fetish colt

487
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,880

488
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:33,760
 walking closer and closer with his little taster spoon he's like ah yes for $59 a month

489
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,880
 requires a lot of poop it's like it's like that old what was it the outer limits or the

490
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,000
 twilight zone tells from the dark side about the box you got the box if you press the button

491
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,800
 someone you didn't know would die and you would get a million dollars but if you don't

492
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,040
 press the button then you don't get a million dollars and you had like an hour to decide

493
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,440
 and the woman presses the button and she gets a million dollars and then the guy the ending

494
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:05,520
 goes ah yes everyone presses the button I will give this box to someone else now someone

495
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:14,600

499
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,960
 your butthole because how else are they gonna produce enough of this probably without buttholes

500
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,640

501
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:51,040
