00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 Would you be willing to play a video game that if you died, you die?

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.320
 And then we end season 19 with a terrifying look at our possible future.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.440
 We always hear stories about the great reset, an idea that eventually we will be forced

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.200
 to eat bugs and be happy about it.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.280
 Well, what if things are actually worse than that?

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.080
 What if it's not bugs that we'll be forced to eat?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.040
 You knew this would end the season.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.440
 What if it's not bugs that we will be forced to eat?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.400
 What if we have to eat poop today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:56.040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 I'm your host Jason Garbiner, I'm having a great day.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.480
 We got a bunch of announcements too.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.600
 So let's get started right away for the last episode of season 19.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now was our newest Patreon supporter.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.440
 He's carrying a spear and a shield.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.040
 I don't know, maybe he's just carrying a 32 on sprite.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command, everyone give it up for Harun Shaik.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.760
 Everyone's like, "Dude, learn how to pronounce people's names.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 I'm trying.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.960
 Harun, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.040
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that I do.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.520
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 That helps out so much.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.720
 If you get any value from this show, please help the show grow."

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.600
 This is also the last episode of season 19.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.400
 I'm going to be taking a break until December 1st.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.800
 So I hope you guys stick around until the break's over.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.520
 I'm hoping you play some Dying Light.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.400
 I just got that game on a steam sale not too long ago.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.600
 I'm a huge fan of Dead Island, so I think it's like Dead Island, but faster and spookier.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600
 We'll find out.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.920
 But even though I'm not coming out with brand new episodes until December 1st, on November

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.680
 24th at 12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, we will be doing our annual Thanksgiving livestream

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.680
 special.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.320
 I hope you guys are able to join us for that.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.800
 Listen, I get it if you can't.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
 It's a huge holiday.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.880
 You guys are out doing stuff as well.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.000
 But if you do have some free time, stop on by November 24th, 12 p.m. Pacific Standard

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Time.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 It's always been fun.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 We've done a lot of these.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 We'll for them.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Or this will be the fourth one.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.240
 Over the years, that's a lot of fun.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.360
 And lastly, before we get the episode started, there's a billion cars driving by today.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.560
 I don't know why it's so busy and I'm recording in my living room again.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.480
 But before we get started, one more thing.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.160
 Let's take a look at this submission for Fanart Friday.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
 Look at this little bunny.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
 This little bunny man.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.640
 It's technically a dead wrap radio logo.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640
 It's not a man.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.760
 But this was sent to me by Lyssa on the Patreon Discord.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760
 I love it.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.760
 I love these little sketches.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.760
 It never stops humbling me when I see people take time out of their day to do a little

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760
 sketch.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.760
 That's really cool.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760
 Or just even to listen.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.200
 People constantly sending me emails that they listen to the show during their work or during

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.720
 their commute or while they're washing the dishes.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.720
 That's really cool.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.800
 That's honestly really cool because that's how I enjoy podcasts.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.240
 And it's cool that I'm part of that day for you.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.240
 I really, really enjoy it.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.240
 And that's why I keep doing this show.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.240
 Haroon.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.920
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.640
 This episode I'm really excited about.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 This is some cool stuff here.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 Haroon.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.880
 I'm going to touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.160
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.600
 Take us all the way out to an eSports arena.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.680
 Haroon pulls up outside of this arena and he's like, "Is this the place?"

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.040
 And I'm like, "No, this is an actual sport being played.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.640
 There's football going on in there.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640
 Keep driving.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.320
 We need to find an eSports arena."

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.320
 So he's driving.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.760
 He gets to a college campus and there's like a little room off to the side and we see people

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.680
 walking in with their laptops and they're like, "This LAN party is going to be great.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.040
 Doom emulators for all."

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040
 And I'm like, "Nope.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.040
 Nope.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.040
 We're not going here either."

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040
 And you're like, "What?

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040
 Where are we going?"

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.760
 And those guys definitely were the definition of an eSports.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.880
 In 1999, Jason, who's still having LAN parties.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.120
 How old are you?

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120
 Okay.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 Come on.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 Get back in the car.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 Haroon.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120
 This isn't the right eSports arena.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.120
 Keep driving.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.320
 So he's driving through the city and we pass like all these other arenas.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.400
 And finally, he pulls up to this auto mechanics garage.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.760
 I was like, "Here's the place."

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.760
 Apparently, I turned into a prospect.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.360
 They're all of a sudden, "Here's the place.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.360
 This is where the gold be."

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.000
 So we walk into this mechanics shop and there seems to be no one around.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.920
 And I was like, "It's pretty clever.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.520
 It's pretty clever hiding spot, isn't this?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.200
 I saw this on an episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and I hit a button and all

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.480
 of a sudden the lift that lifts the car up, it lifts up and now you see there's like a

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.520
 staircase descending under the ground, which seemed great on an episode of Teenage Mutant

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520
 Ninja Turtles.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.320
 But now that I think about it, it's kind of a different story.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.160
 I think it's a bit of a dead giveaway because people would be like, "Hey, can you work on

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.160
 my car?"

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.160
 And they're like, "No."

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.080
 You're like, "There's a lift right there.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.160
 Just lift it up.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.160
 Use my car.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.160
 Fix it."

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160
 And they're like, "No."

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.600
 Because there's a hidden passageway down there built by Baxter Stockman.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.160
 We go down this staircase and we hear this, "Oh yeah.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
 Woo, go yeah.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160
 Woo."

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.440
 We're like, "What in the world was that?"

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.840
 We keep walking down the stairs and we keep hearing like, "Yeah, yeah.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.840
 Place your bets.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840
 Place your bets.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.240
 Who's going to win this time?"

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.640
 And we walk into this massive underground eSports arena.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.140
 We see two teams.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.080
 They're both maybe 32 people in each team.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.240
 Pretty standard for first person shooter, player versus player.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.740
 Hold on.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.840
 I got to move my studio back into the closet.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.040
 Yeah, I moved it out last night.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.160
 I was hoping to record it out here.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.400
 But apparently, Autobots and Decepticons are fighting in the front yard.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.400
 It's so loud here.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.960
 So give me a second.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.160
 Okay, sorry about that.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.760
 That was super annoying.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.560
 It's like every car in the neighborhood decided to test out their snow tires on dry roads

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.560
 today.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.520
 That's why everything is so loud out there in the living room.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.720
 We're in this underground eSports arena.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.960
 We see on opposite sides of the room two different teams.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.080
 And there's about 32 players on each team and they're playing a first person shooter.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.480
 But seated all around them.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.960
 This really is like a sports arena.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:46.040
 We see the rich and powerful and the dark and mysterious as well.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.280
 Not Darth Vader, not Darth Vader, although he fits both of those descriptions.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.280
 Well this isn't just any old eSports.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.080
 I'm sure you could have guessed that the fact that we had to walk through an underground

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.700
 tunnel in a hidden passageway in a mechanics shop.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.760
 This isn't any old regular old League of Legends nonsense.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.000
 This is truly a one of a kind event.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.160
 It is a gaming competition where if your character dies in the game, your head blows

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160
 up.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.960
 Can you go chase him?

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.400
 Yes, I'm sure this is possible like in science fiction.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.440
 I've seen tons of stuff with this in it.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.480
 From the lawnmower man to the lawnmower man too.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.560
 The idea of dying in the video game makes you die in real life.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.720
 Well it was a work of fiction until just recently.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.520
 Well to be fair it still is a work of fiction.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.400
 The situation I laid out has not happened yet.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.760
 But recently Shananigans, a long time supporter of the show, Shananigans on Twitter sent me

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:54.280
 this article about this man named Palmer Lucky.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280
 Palmer Lucky.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.800
 If anyone sounds like a character from a Philip K Dick novel, it's this guy.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.760
 Palmer Lucky, apparently he's the co-founder of the Oculus, the VR headset.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:19.240
 He also has defense contracts and he has created a VR headset that has three bombs in it.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.640
 Right now he says this is kind of a piece of art sitting around the office but he's

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.520
 constructed this.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:34.640
 He goes, the idea is it's a VR headset that if you die in the game you die in real life.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.280
 You go why would anyone invent this?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.440
 Why would anyone invent this?

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.760
 Well apparently he's a big fan of an anime called Sword Art Online and the premise of

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.880
 that show is people put on VR headsets and they get teleported to this completely realistic

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.880
 VR world.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.520
 It's not realistic, I guess there's dragons and stuff, little talking mushrooms.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.680
 But you think that you're actually in this world but in the real world you're hooked

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.920
 up to this VR system and if you die in the video game you die in real life.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.520
 He's a big fan of that and he goes, you know what?

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.360
 I used to be a big fan of Godzilla.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.120
 I irradiated a bunch of iguanas that didn't do anything.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.840
 Maybe I'll be a big fan of this cartoon.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.440
 Maybe I should invent something that will kill you if you die in the game.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.600
 And you're going, why would anyone, even if someone's a big fan of something.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.480
 I mean there's two elements to it.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.600
 One you die in the game.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.320
 Two the game is awesome enough to want to take the risk of dying.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.240
 The Sword Art Online world is so vivid that it's worth that risk.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.880
 If you're hooked up to this headset you're playing Medal of Honor for the PS2.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.800
 I mean that's not worth it, right?

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:53.240
 But imagine if you could go to a virtual world that was so beautiful and everything was amazing

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.040
 and it was everything that the real world isn't.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.600
 Would you risk your head blowing up?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.120
 You might be shaking your head no but remember talking mushrooms, talking mushrooms.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.720
 You have those guys as well.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.720
 He's invented this and he goes, listen there are a few things I need to work out.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.440
 There are a few glitches I need to work out with this bomb you strapped to your head.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.200
 He goes first off, we'd have to make it so the charges don't accidentally go off.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.160
 Which is yes, that's a pretty big problem when you're dealing with bombs.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.160
 He goes, the way I envision it is that the bombs will detonate when a specific frequency

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.440
 of red flashing lights appears in the game.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.080
 That'll cause the bomb to go off.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.640
 So that way you could have it for different video games.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.320
 The developer of the video game would know the frequency that would be game over.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.880
 Not just the frequency of somebody flashing a flashlight in your face.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.880
 You're just floating around neopets and some dudes like click click click click and your

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.160
 head blows up.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.040
 You could trigger it to be a specific frequency of red lights.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.040
 That's the first thing he has to get that thing done.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:08.920
 He goes secondly, the game world and then the kind of what I was saying he goes you

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:17.120
 would have to have a game world that was so vivid and so amazing that yes it would be

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.560
 risky it would be worth the rest to get your head blown off.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.000
 Like otherwise when you put the goggles on if you are playing like Chester Cheetah's

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.760
 jail break out that you got free when you ordered a pizza had pizza.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.080
 Obviously that would be the most stressful platformer you'd ever played but you would

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.880
 know when that prickly cactus was shooting its thorns at you that you're not really

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880
 in danger.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.600
 I mean you are you do have a bomb strap to your head but in the game world you would

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.600
 just be like oh that's just a guy shooting sprites at me.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.800
 Now that would be the last thought you had as your head disintegrates into a pile of

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.200
 blood brain matter skull and half chewed pizza.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.520
 He goes the game would have to be indistinguishable from reality to make it all fit.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.600
 It is something that I think game designers are working towards and what's funny is that

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.120
 I would love a system like this.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.640
 Not necessarily my brain blowing up but when I play Minecraft I play in hardcore mode and

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:25.520
 that's where when you die your whole world gets erased and I'll drop like 30-40 hours

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.240
 into a one world and I like find a village and I build a wall around it and I do all

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.440
 this stuff and then I make up missions for myself.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.520
 I'd be like oh I must go find a treasure chest so I'm walking around and I basically

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.640
 play in this Minecraft game which is okay to be fair for me making fun of League of

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.080
 Legends multiple times.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.880
 I get it Minecrafts for babies but I love Minecraft.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.880
 I play in the hardcore mode and then I put 30-40 hours into a single world and then Creeper

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.920
 blows me up and it makes the impact so monumental.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.240
 So I get like the need for it.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.720
 He has a quote he goes quote "Pumped up graphics may make a game look more real but only the

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.760
 threat of serious consequences can make a game feel real to you and every other person in

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.760
 the game."

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.760
 And I do agree with that.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.760
 I would love the idea of a game that if you died in it the game is deleted.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.760
 Like you have to buy another copy of the game.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.160
 I think that would be great.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.920
 I think it would be great if you had a first person shooter and if you die in the game

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:37.360
 there's then like a 5-10 minute unskippable cutscene of the army going to your wife's

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:43.200
 house and knocking on the door and you see her sobbing and then they cut to a scene of

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.200
 a mom.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.120
 It's actually your mom before you play the game.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.160
 You have to get digital photos of everyone you know and your mom's like no not my son

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.160
 no.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.600
 And then there's like a full there's a full length funeral and it would really make the

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:02.160
 dying in the game be more consequential.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.440
 Imagine GTA but you get a car accident and the cops arrest you they're like that's it

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.360
 we're gonna find you $1,000 we take all your weapons and you can't play this game for the

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.240
 next 10 days.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.080
 Palmer Lucky says as far as he knows this has never been done before but the genie is

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.400
 out of the bottle.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:30.600
 And this would be awesome for the Illuminati that we talk about we recently did an episode

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.840
 on this guy named Donald Marshall who talked about underground gladiator combats and they

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.840
 use clones and he fought Mick Jagger and Brendan Fraser stabbed him in the intestines and

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.840
 all this stuff.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.320
 They were clones by the way if you're a huge Brendan Fraser fan don't give up on him it

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.280
 was his clone but he believes that celebrities from around the world have killed him and

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:03.760
 the gladiator and this cloned gladiator arena and as foolish as that is what you're really

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:09.040
 doing in essence is you're taking two people you're giving them weapons and then you're

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:15.160
 like fight fight to the death and then you as a businessman standing about 20 feet from

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.760
 them or sitting in some arena as these two people you've kidnapped are hacking at each

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.560
 other with swords now we've all watched enough movies where you have the two people being

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.840
 like you know what we're the ones with the swords they're just some rich guy in a suit

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.600
 let's team up and we can hack our way out of here and all of a sudden the guys like

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.880
 no no don't kill me I'm from Wall Street and the two guys start a slave revolution.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.000
 Just them it's revolution of two but it works.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.560
 You would think that right you would always you'd basically be getting these trained fighters

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.240
 and locking them up and being like you will fight to the death until you become too weak

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.340
 to fight anymore and then you will die and then the prisoners like or or you just start

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.960
 beating you up now and I'm assuming they'd also have goons with guns the Illuminati people

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.920
 have goons with guns and around but my point is is that you can do it like that you can

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:11.240
 have people place wagers but when you look at something like the squid game that's squid

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:17.920
 game show they had to build these massive sets massive sets and even when you had like I

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:24.840
 think it started off with like 460 people they did have guards with guns but you could easily

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.760
 have these uprisings but imagine if the squid games with just people with bombs on their

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:35.080
 heads playing playing squid game mods on roblox and they're like all the controls totally

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.880
 suck what are you talking about oh man my keyboard stuck and their heads are just blowing up

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:46.560
 I totally could see that happening I could totally see some sort of underground group

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.920
 forcing people to fight to the death but instead of giving them weapons and you figured this

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.520
 would even the battlefield like imagine if a super buff dude got kidnapped and then

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.040
 next to him got kidnapped to scientists and he's like oh man never worked out my muscles

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:06.120
 except for my brain obviously I mean is a when you're betting you're gonna be like

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:13.200
 this is a joke I'm gonna bet on the buff dude but if everyone was in a VR world and

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.960
 they died it would be more even playing field I mean obviously the nerd would have an advantage

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.800
 there but a fascinating thing he says that this is the first time as far as he knows

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.560
 they've been invented I'm sure there have been other versions of this okay I guess I

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:33.120
 can't say I'm sure it is pretty science science fiction even now that the cats out of the bag

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:41.040
 I can see people going make us 64 of these we're gonna hold a tournament and whoever

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.640
 sucks at this first person shooter their brains blow up although now that I think about it

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.960
 you you would imagine the you imagine the Illuminati would have better things to do than

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:57.520
 hosting these type of summits and actually that's a great segue into our next story Haroon

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.760
 let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter we're taking it out one more

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.880
 time this season flies away from this gladiator arena there's only one dude left with his

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:13.120
 brains intact he's the winner he's covered in brains you imagine playing a first person

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:20.560
 video game with a VR headset on and you know it's to the death and when another player

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.960
 like the guy sitting at the computer next to you when he died you're playing a game

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.240
 right you have a perfect sniper position and then all of a sudden two feet away you hear

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.640
 a BAM and you're just covered in brain matter like it would totally freak you out that would

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:41.000
 be the worst possible thing I guess the worst possible thing would be the guy sitting next

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.800
 to you with no head that would be the worst but the second worst possible thing is you're

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.200
 trying to not die and all of a sudden you're just getting covered that loud explosion you're

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:56.200
 getting covered in brains and guts and gore I just had to leave you with that last horrible

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.160
 image Haroon take this carpenter copter away from this arena we're flying all the way out

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:11.320
 to a weightlifting gym there's a company called fit biomex they probably mispronounce in that

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.920
 it's probably fit by oh I don't know is there another way to pronounce anyways fit biomex

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.960
 is closer to probably what it is there's a company called fit biomex and and that fit

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:29.680
 biomex they have this new product invented by dr. Jonathan shyman it's called Nella

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:41.600
 it's not a bad name right remind you of Nutella well be prepared to not eat any more Nutella

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:47.520
 after shyman he has invented this thing called the Nella he goes here's the thing I've discovered

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:54.920
 through my research that to be a super athlete it's more than just your training it's more

00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:01.160
 than just your diet it's even more than just your genetics a large part of it is also your

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:06.920
 gut biome so then we're standing there in this weightlifting gym and we see this muscle

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.280
 bound dude like doing all these reps he's like oh yeah look at me look at me he definitely

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.960
 has some issues he's like life doesn't matter unless people look at me he's left on all these

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.680
 weights he's like look at me and dr. shyman goes have you guys ever wanted to be as thick

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:29.760
 and muscular as this dude here take this pill I've invented it's called Nella he's holding

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.440
 this pill out to us and on the one hand yeah sure would be awesome to be this total buff

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:41.720
 dude who has issues with people paying attention to one but on the other hand hey doc didn't

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.000
 you just say something about gut biome like trying to figure out like how athletes and

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.840
 their what's inside their guts is actually helping them out and as you're asking that

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.120
 question I put my hand up over my mouth I'm like as you're asking that question he flicks

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:05.360
 the pill in your throat you're like uh uh if you take the Nella you can actually become

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.640
 an elite athlete now Nella before you get too excited for you run to the store you're

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.080
 like oh I got a marathon coming up can I get one box of Nella let me tell you what's in

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:24.640
 it what he does and this is what he discovered he said he drove around Boston for two weeks

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:34.840
 eight hours a day he's driving around Boston he's collecting stool samples from elite runners

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.960
 and what he realized was if you look at elite runners they have this thing called well I

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:45.920
 guess most people have it it's called bacterium vellanella atypica and he goes when you look

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.480
 at elite runners they have very very high consistently high levels of this bacterium

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.800
 he said a normal person this spikes during exertion and this is one of the reasons why

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:03.920
 your muscles get sore but if I took the stool samples from these elite athletes he didn't

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.880
 tell them he just snuck into their house late at night he's all hiding in the closet waiting

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.880
 till they go to bed and then he crawls out in the darkness with a little spoon with a

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.800
 little wooden spoon a taster spoon from Baskin Robbins go up in their butthole he realized

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:25.200
 that they have this in them they have a lot of this bacterium vellanella atypica and this

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:33.920
 is part of being an elite athlete he injected this bacterium into mice and what can only

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:43.040
 be described as the funniest and cruelest experiment he injected this bacterium into

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:50.800
 mice and they were able to run 13 percent longer than normal so I mean that's something

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.760
 you give the intern to do right I'm sure Dr. Shyam is like no no I want to inject them

00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.160
 I did all the work I get to have all the fun he's injecting it into the mice but then you

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.640
 make your intern just watch two mice run two mice run around on these wheels they're like

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:11.480
 tell me how long the one with the gut biome stuff tell me how much more he runs and then

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:17.240
 he goes out on another fecal gathering mission so if you take a mice who's injected with

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:24.000
 this he could run 13 times longer now others go you know sure the science might be there

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.560
 we do know that your gut biome is a huge part of who you are they say 90 percent of the

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.920
 body serotonin gets produced by your gut bacteria I think it's really interesting when people

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.160
 go I have a craving for sugar I have a craving for that that's all your gut bacteria if you've

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:44.280
 ever gone a couple days without sugar because I very rarely have sugar but it's weird when

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:50.160
 I do have sugar then the next three days I'm craving it because all the flora in your stomach

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.480
 is there it pops up when you eat sugar and it's sending signals to your brain going eat

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.200
 more sugar eat more sugar because if it doesn't get sugar it dies off the whole life form in

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.920
 your stomach it's almost like a parasite in there and it's controlling you and that's

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.600
 why when you start overeating it's hard to stop and you have food addicts it's different

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.840
 where you're like a gambling addict that's like a serotonin thing in your brain or your

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:21.280
 heroin addict that's the heroin interacting with the dopamine receptors in your brain

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:27.880
 food addiction sugar addiction is actually a new life form in your stomach developing

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:35.920
 and then releasing chemicals into the bloodstream saying feed us feed us and you're building

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.560
 up this new life form in your stomach and when you stop eating sugar like it takes three

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:47.960
 days for this life form to completely die out then it will stop sending the signals because

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.800
 it's dead it can no longer talk to you it's totally different it's super weird the addiction

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.640
 to food is different there's a new life form in you trying to get you to eat more of what

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.200
 it needs fascinating stuff so we know the gut biome is super important but he's saying

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:10.720
 you can take this Nella and you now have the gut biome or you take it regularly of course

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.640
 there's a monthly subscription for $59 a box which you can either go wow that's really

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:22.040
 low to be an elite athlete or wow that's really high to eat someone else's poop but you can

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.920
 get a monthly subscription of Nella and they're saying that if you take this you will be able

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.040
 to run longer than normal I'm sure I'm sure that's not the only thing on the box because

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:39.360
 otherwise you're like I know I'm good I don't run that much anyways but I saw that and I

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.880
 go okay the this the VR brain thing that's something that I could see in a sci-fi movie

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.560
 and then I could see someone building it in real life if you wanted to have real life

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.280
 gladiator combat this would be the way to do it it'd be the safest way I mean not for

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.480
 the participants but for you or could just be a novelty this one this is really being

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:07.440
 produced and it is a performance enhancing supplement imagine a world where if you want

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.600
 to compete in sports you have to eat human poop because everyone else is eating human

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:21.800
 poop now to be very clear to be very clear 20 30 minutes into talking about this he is

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:27.160
 not selling I guess I should clear this up for the lawsuit for the inevitable lawsuit

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:34.600
 he is not selling pills of human poop I keep human poop I also accuse this guy of hiding

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.920
 in people's closets with tiny wooden spoons and taking their poop out without their knowledge

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.640
 that's just hearsay your honor that's just hearsay I heard it in my own head and then

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.440
 I said it he's not selling pills of human poop but he's selling pills of this bacterium

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:57.960
 cocktail but in essence I mean tomato tomato right you're taking a pill that at one point

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:05.520
 this bacteria was in some dude's butthole now maybe once I said that I go game it's

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.640
 not that maybe he cultured this bacteria right once he knows what it is he could then bring

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:17.560
 more of it in his laboratory but I would still argue in this upcoming defamation case that

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.880
 if you this is a philosophers question right if you took a piece of poop out of a man's

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.960
 butthole and then isolated a small piece of that poop and then use that small piece of

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:34.520
 poop to create a chemical are you still not eating a man's poop are you still not that

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.520
 was the origin point are you still not eating something that came out of some other dudes

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:48.600
 but now I'm not a runner I don't run for nothing but if I was a runner I would be thinking

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.960
 well everyone else in the race is eating human poop why why aren't I there's some guy there's

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.000
 some guy just scooping it up he's like what oh you're supposed to think this is in a form

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.600
 of a pill this is a supplement that you could see almost you having to take if you are doing

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:10.560
 any sorts of sports at all you're going up against people who are eating human poop and

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.440
 you're not there's a lot of stuff that we would never do if we were forced to no one

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.920
 no one would want to live in a society where people go you gotta eat this poop it'll make

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:25.200
 you work harder do it I work at best by how hard do I have to work I'd have to eat human

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.000
 poop but if it's voluntary right it's voluntary this is something that you could see athletes

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.320
 going if I want to compete at an elite level I gotta eat the poop I almost feel like this

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:45.680
 isn't a social issue or a science issue it feels I don't I know I tossed a word around

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:50.920
 demonic I know I toss a word demonic around a lot on this show but it sounds like something

00:28:50.920 --> 00:29:04.920
 that is so anti-human to eat something that came from fecal matter now I have to be very

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:12.120
 very clear I am going to go and check and and see because now I'm thinking about it

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:19.200
 now that I accused Dr. Scheinman of hiding people's closets taking stool samples without

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.080
 their permission getting enjoyment out of injecting fecal matter into mice I'm starting

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:32.440
 to think I'm starting to think of something here there's going to be two things one I

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.200
 either in the episode going is it possible we'll live in a world where people aren't

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:44.480
 taking fecal matter fecal matter to win sports but really they're enacting some sort of ancient

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.560
 right to an old pagan god like really this is what it sounds like devouring fecal matter

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:54.520
 is that's like belphagore there's a demon who loves poop and every time you use the

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.080
 toilet I believe his name is belphagore I'll double check that but you every time you go

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.840
 poop you're basically worshiping him and this sounds almost like a demonic plot and people

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.920
 having like this is really what it comes down with deals with the devil right you can train

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:13.000
 hard and you can do your best but eventually everyone else in your sport is taking human

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.680
 poop now you have to make a deal with the devil are you going to stick up for yourself

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.640
 and say you know what I run for the enjoyment I don't run to win so I don't want to eat

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:26.600
 human poop that's what a deal or you know I am going to eat poop I'm going to eat poop

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.400
 to win that's really what a deal with the devil is you're making you're compromising

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:37.600
 your own idea of what it means to be human and somewhat argue what means to be fair in

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:47.880
 sports you're eating human fecal matter to become a better athlete and that sounds like

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:57.480
 a demonic pact you're giving away a bit of your humanity for a simple contest something

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.520
 that's meaningless on the grand scale of things but you're eating poop to do it and all the

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:08.680
 while this great demon is watching all of this with glee while the world became more

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:14.520
 sanitized as we cleaned up the streets from just logs of poop rolling down the open sewers

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.880
 of London to a world that's so sanitized that kids get peanut allergies because they're

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.280
 not getting exposed to germs and bacterium that they normally are in childhood we've

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:30.080
 come a long way in a very short period of time any sort of demonic entity that fed off

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:36.240
 of filth and disease would be losing power but now in the guise of a pill that makes

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:42.560
 you a better athlete people are willingly ingesting fecal matter this demon who had

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:48.360
 been slowly but steadily losing influence over the world is now in its own way being

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.600
 worshipped when people are taking the Nella pill they're not like this is for you grand

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:59.280
 demon of fecal matter globe but in a way they're doing that sacrament it's more than that it's

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.800
 more than that throughout all human history people hated waste product but now they're

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:11.800
 willingly eating it and so is this the return of this belphagore type character this demon

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:18.680
 who lives in the waste waters a demon that lives in the filth you're taking the sacrament

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:24.080
 just like you were taking the Lord's Supper taking the consecrated wafer and a little

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:35.520
 bit of wine could this be his way back to power if you want to win you have to ingest

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:47.000
 the poop if you want to win you have to worship the demon of the toilet that's one way I can

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.600
 in the episode but I am gonna say this I'm recording this for a little bit of safety

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.160
 there's a possibility I thought about this as I was recording it that he's not actually

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.320
 he's not actually giving people pooped I thought about this like a wait a second I never care

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.840
 to me until I was reading over my notes and I'm recording the last I was so to season

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:16.680
 19 maybe he wasn't feeding people poop maybe I'm sure there was a bunch of you shaking

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.360
 your heads this whole time and you're like is Jason does actually think that these Nell

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:28.000
 the bills are like brown there's a little piece of corn there's a little piece of corn

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.880
 in some of them no I don't think that but I'm thinking now that the stool samples were

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:42.480
 just for the experiments in the sense that he goes I wonder if there's something different

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:48.760
 in an elite runner stools so he went into the creepy way into the creepy way like I said

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.400
 he asked people hey can I have some of your stool please which that's actually super creepy

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.680
 as well but he gets this stool of elite runners and he gets stool of regular people and then

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.200
 he matches it goes wow if you're an elite runner your stool has more of this bacterium

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:12.640
 this Vella Nella atypica interesting so then no stool involved in the production process

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:19.560
 I didn't think about this I totally didn't even think about this then he throws away

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:27.640
 all of the poop and he is able to produce Vella Nella atypica in some other sort of way

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:32.320
 like he's puts out like a piece of bread like he's doing some sort of science project for

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.240
 fifth grade he leaves a piece of bread after a couple days and it grows mold and he's

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:42.880
 able to isolate the Vella Nella atypica maybe he was able to produce this Saiyans butthole

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.120
 and that's what the pill is the pill just like probiotics when you go and buy him at

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:53.280
 the store it's possible just to be clear I'm gonna double check before I release this episode

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:58.480
 he's gonna be like clearly you're all this man is no no idea what he's talking about he

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:04.320
 disparaged me for 30 minutes he called me a freak a freak who's hiding in the shadows

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:12.040
 of people's closets so maybe he didn't I will I will record this part just in case maybe

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:17.880
 he didn't maybe he wasn't hiding people's closets maybe this has nothing to do with human poop

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:29.160
 in its final form that might have just been the experiment or maybe tonight when you're

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.840
 getting ready to go to bed you go you know what man season 19 that sure was a wild ride

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:39.120
 dead rubber you talk about poop the whole season it wasn't just last episode some weird

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.600
 stuff this season you're like you know it's time for me to go to bed but I do have that

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:51.320
 big marathon tomorrow well I'll figure it out later you fall asleep then your closet

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:58.960
 door opens in the middle of the night and you see a doctor shyman shaped silhouette start

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.560
 to creep out and you're like what oh no oh no exactly what it's so it looks like it's

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.960
 not just I'm it's not just shy man and you see him pull up a little wooden spoon and

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:13.200
 you go to get up then you realize there's four super strong men surrounding your bed they've

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:19.720
 had all the fecal matter they want which is only a lot there's some weird fetish colt

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:24.880
 they're holding you down with their fecal empowered muscles you're like no no and doctor shyman's

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:33.760
 walking closer and closer with his little taster spoon he's like ah yes for $59 a month

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:40.880
 requires a lot of poop it's like it's like that old what was it the outer limits or the

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.000
 twilight zone tells from the dark side about the box you got the box if you press the button

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.800
 someone you didn't know would die and you would get a million dollars but if you don't

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.040
 press the button then you don't get a million dollars and you had like an hour to decide

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.440
 and the woman presses the button and she gets a million dollars and then the guy the ending

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:05.520
 goes ah yes everyone presses the button I will give this box to someone else now someone

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:14.600
 you don't know that's this if you order if you order now what you really do is giving

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:22.200
 your address to fit biomics and now they're also gonna make you part of the food chain

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:28.040
 if you order this you're like alright my netella I mean my now it's finally here oh and then

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.040
 your address went into a database they're going to drive up to your house and start harvesting

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.960
 your butthole because how else are they gonna produce enough of this probably without buttholes

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.640
 he's probably culturing it in some other way but in the world of conspiracy theory who knows

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:51.040
 what is possible who knows what who knows what defamation is can you really define slander

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.400
 or libel when you're talking about the world of paranormal can you you're on or I rest

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:04.840
 like case dead rabbit radio at gmail.com is gonna be your email address you can also

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:34.600
 do so.
