1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
 Can a demonic possession happen so fast that one minute you're in the kitchen chopping vegetables?

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,640
 And the next minute you're running through your house stabbing your loved ones in the

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,640
 throat.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,960
 Welcome back to new episodes, and then we take a look at one of the newest conspiracy

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,120
 theories popping up right now, one that the internet overlords are trying their best to

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,960
 suppress.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,680
 Is it possible that aquariums across the United States are actually fronts for child trafficking

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,960
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:47,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,720
 I'm your host Jason Garminer, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
 day too.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,920
 I had a great vacation and I hope you guys had a great vacation too.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,400
 I worked the entire time you were off, but whatever you did over the last couple weeks

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,920
 we're going to toss you into the driver's seat of the Jason Jalopy.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,520
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're going to drive all the way out to Stewart's

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,040
 Town, Pennsylvania.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,200
 We're headed out to Stewart's Town, Pennsylvania.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,920
 It's August 22nd, 2022, it's an incredibly recent story that's going on here and quite

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,280
 chilling, quite a spooky story.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,240
 We're going to start this off in the basement of a sleepy little house on Firebox Court

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,400
 in Stewart Town, Pennsylvania.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,440
 You're like, "Oh no, I live on that street."

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,400
 Well, I'm sure you are, you're about this story if you lived here, you're not like,

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,080
 "Oh, I wonder what all those police cars are doing in my neighborhood."

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,840
 Better listen to this paranormal podcast.

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,840
 We're at the home of the Fosec family.

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
 It's 7.30 PM.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:28,440
 And in the basement, this is a weird house, the story not inwithstanding, the layout

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,840
 of this house is weird.

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,760
 Apparently, these people prepare their dinner in the basement of the house.

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,120
 That should be red flag number one if someone ever says that you want something to eat and

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
 you're like, "Yeah, sure."

42
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,440
 And they walk into their spooky basement, something bad's about to happen.

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,200
 But anyways, I guess back in the old times, all the food was in the basement, right?

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,320
 They had root cellars, so if someone's like, "Hey, who wants some celery?"

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,800
 We're like, "Nobody's celery's disgusting."

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
 And the guy's like, "I'll be right back."

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
 And you go down and you dig through your root cellar, you're digging up vegetables and stuff

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
 like that.

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,880
 But anyways, there's this dude named Keith Kretzer.

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,720
 He's 32-year-old man and he's chopping vegetables in the basement.

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,920
 Chopping, chop, chop, chop, he's digging up carrots with his bare hands.

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,440
 And also in the basement is his girlfriend, Christine Fusec.

53
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,720
 She's 34-years-old and also her five-year-old daughter, Riley Reynolds, is in the basement

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,640
 as well and they're watching.

55
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,080
 Keith prepared this little meal.

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,800
 He's like flipping carrots up in the air.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,080
 He's singing that song from the Little Mermaid.

58
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,000
 Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,680
 As he's cutting this, as he's cutting these vegetables up and stuff like that, to be completely

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
 fair, I just think that made notes.

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,800
 There's no mention of vegetables in all of this story.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,720
 Actually what happens is now that I look down, now that I read my notes a little bit

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 clearer, he's in the kitchen.

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,360
 He is in the basement preparing dinner.

65
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,280
 You're still just scratching your head and you're like, "Jason, people don't prepare

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,800
 food in the basement."

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,120
 He is in the basement with Christine and Riley.

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,360
 He's preparing dinner and then all of a sudden he feels like something took him over.

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,880
 He feels like this force outside of his own consciousness entered his body.

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,920
 And at this point, whether or not he was chopping vegetables and singing a jaunty tune or not,

71
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:17,160
 he does grab a knife from the food preparation area and turns to face his girlfriend and

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,000
 begins stabbing her to death.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Stabbing her, right?

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,880
 And then he turns to the five-year-old daughter and begins stabbing her to death too.

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
 I'm not going to do sound effects for that one.

76
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,360
 Even I know there's a limit.

77
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,280
 Even I know that's quite grim.

78
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,560
 Then he runs upstairs.

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,520
 Now, they're not alone in the house.

80
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
 They're just in the basement.

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,840
 This is a two-story house, not including the basement.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,880
 He runs upstairs and on the first floor is Christine's...

83
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,160
 It doesn't specifically say it's her mom, but Jacqueline Fusek.

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,960
 She's 63 years old, so mom, grandma, I'm not for sure.

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,760
 Keith runs into the living room and he has this knife and he begins to stab Jacqueline.

86
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
 She...

87
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
 Ah!

88
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
 Stop it!

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
 Stop it!

90
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
 Stop it!

91
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
 Stop it!

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
 Ugh!

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
 Okay, I'll stabbing her up.

94
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
 Stabbing her like in the head...

95
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
 That's difficult, right?

96
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
 Because you've got that big old skull, right?

97
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,000
 You're going to stab someone in the skull.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
 Well, he doesn't stop there because he begins stabbing her in the neck and in the torso.

99
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,520
 So she's now laying on the couch bleeding out.

100
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,240
 And there's one more person in the house.

101
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,040
 On the second floor of the house, there's Joseph Fusek.

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,240
 Now, he, like many of us have done many times before, is playing a video game with his headphones

103
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
 on.

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,660
 Dun dun dun dun--ahhh--people blowing up stuff like that.

105
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,640
 And he hears screaming coming from the living room.

106
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,300
 He takes his headphones off. He hears the screaming over his headphones playing the

107
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,580
 video games. He takes his headphones off and right when he does, his bedroom door is kicked

108
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:59,460
 open and there stands Keith holding this knife covered in the blood of Joseph's fellow family

109
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,880
 members. Joseph sitting in his gaming chair completely shocked about what's going on when

110
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,220
 Keith runs in and starts stabbing him. AHHHHHH--stabbing him and stuff like that. But Joseph is able

111
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,760
 to kinda get the drop on Keith. They begin fighting over the knife and eventually Joseph

112
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,320
 gets the knife away from Keith. And at this point Keith says, "Whatever was controlling

113
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:31,320
 me, whatever entered my body in the basement, left. The minute the knife was removed from

114
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:38,840
 my hand, I suddenly felt like I was in control again." He said he stepped back and he looked

115
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,980
 and he saw that his hands were covered in cuts. Using a kitchen knife is a really bad

116
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,020
 way to murder somebody or to assault somebody because they're not built to be covered in

117
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,160
 blood. When you stab someone with a combat knife, you're gonna get your hand slippery,

118
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,120
 but when you're stabbing someone with a good hilt, some serial killers taking notes, he's

119
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,040
 driving a car with a victim in his trunk. When you stab someone with a knife designed

120
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,960
 to stab people, you can still keep a good grip of it. But when you stab someone with

121
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,540
 a steak knife, when you stab someone with a knife that's used for cutting vegetables,

122
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:20,680
 what happens is I stab you, the knife is now covered in blood, and the next stab or the

123
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,400
 next swipe, my hand is actually going to move up the blade and I'll cut myself. It's very,

124
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,560
 very common to cut yourself while you're using a steak knife to murder people or to

125
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,520
 fight people. So that's what happened with this dude, right? He stabbed three people

126
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,680
 already and he was stabbing Joseph and the knife was sliding up and down his own hands

127
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,780
 and slicing his own hands. So he looks down and he sees that his hands are sliced open

128
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,820
 and he notices there's blood and he's also realizing it's not just his blood. He's beginning

129
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,620
 to realize the horror that he just inflicted on this innocent family. He runs out of the

130
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,780
 house, tries to escape. Now, Christine and little Kylie, they died at the scene. Their

131
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:10,620
 wounds were so grievous that they just bled out in the home. However, Jacqueline and Joseph

132
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,120
 both survived. They both are doing totally fine and they're still alive. And in case

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,600
 you're like, wait, this guy ran away, he's still loose. No. Keith has been arrested and

134
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,800
 that's how we know his side of the story. When the cops arrested him, he talks about

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,760
 that I was down in the basement. All of a sudden I felt this force enter my body. Something

136
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,960
 was controlling me from outside. It took me over and made me stab all these people. Now,

137
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,100
 I don't think that's going to hold up in court unless I'm on the jury. Long time listeners

138
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,260
 of the show know that I have a fear. I think that's like the scariest thing is people just

139
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:57,220
 snapping. Trust me, if I'm in a house and someone's progressively getting crazier day

140
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,620
 by day, I'm not like, oh, that's not scary. I'm still going to sleep with my lights on.

141
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,540
 I'm still going to lock the door and everything like that. I'm not going to be like boring.

142
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,320
 It's still terrifying to live with someone who's progressively getting crazier, but I

143
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,200
 think it is scarier if you're just sitting there playing Nintendo and then all of a sudden

144
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,760
 you're getting stabbed to death. If you just think you're going to get stabbed to death

145
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,400
 over the next week, that's also scary. But when someone snaps, the thing about snapping

146
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,640
 that scary is that it can happen to anybody. You could be the guy who's chopping vegetables.

147
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,480
 You could be the guy driving the car who all of a sudden swarves off the road and starts

148
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,740
 running people over. Because you just snapped. You're totally normal up until that moment.

149
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,340
 And when you add the element of not just having some sort of mental breakdown, but some sort

150
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:53,180
 of paranormal possession, like you're living your life completely normally and then you're

151
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,220
 at the mini golf course and you're hitting balls and stuff like that. You're like, this

152
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,260
 is the life. And then all of a sudden the next thing you know, you're standing on the

153
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,300
 corpses of 100 children holding like a bloody club above your head as police are surrounding

154
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,920
 you and you have no recollection of anything that happened between those two things. That's

155
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,880
 ultimately, I think that's so terrifying, right? Because you would be telling the police,

156
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,640
 no, no, it wasn't me. It was the possessed hippo of hole 18. They're not going to believe

157
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,360
 you, right? They might shut down the park. They might repair hole 18. But like if you

158
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,000
 just get possessed by something and you don't even know what's happening, that's scary.

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,480
 Like I've always thought like what if you were driving down the road and the next thing

160
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,540
 you know, you're sitting in the holding cell of a jail and you're like freezing cold and

161
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,940
 you're like, what happened? And they're like, well, you want on this rampage and you stop

162
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,860
 to place a mini golf and had another rampage and then you jumped in the lake and that's

163
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,380
 why you're so cold and you're like, uh, like you wouldn't know what was happening. So when

164
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,860
 I read this story, I was like, that's my worst fear. It's a lot of my worst fears, eating

165
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,620
 vegetables, living in basements and going nuts. And as I read this article, I go, what a great

166
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,680
 way. What a horrible thing this family got massacred, right? But I'm thinking what a

167
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,480
 great way to start off the second half of season 19, right? The next 50 episodes. What

168
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,920
 a great way to get started. A man who loses it and slaughters a family or half a family

169
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,360
 to be technical, but we're not going to quibble with facts. He did attack everyone. But then

170
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,200
 I read this, this, this, this may take away a lot of my fears of being possessed. Apparently

171
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:38,460
 this guy had a history of threatening to attack me with knives. So whether or not he just

172
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:44,700
 snapped that day, he did have like a couple previous restraining orders against him from

173
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,940
 or protective orders against him from previous girlfriends. And one of them said, yeah, he

174
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,980
 told me that he was going to come to my work and slice my neck and then stab everybody

175
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,760
 I worked with. So I don't necessarily know if this guy was possessed or if he just really

176
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,920
 thought about stabbing people or both, right? I think that like, if you wanted to stab people

177
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,200
 and a demon's looking around for, you know, some stabbing action, he would find you versus

178
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:19,080
 a guy who versus the guy who just wants to drown strangers. And they also found marijuana

179
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,800
 and mushrooms in the home. They haven't said whether or not he was high at the time. But

180
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,700
 it does take away a little bit of the Oh no officers. I didn't have any control when you

181
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,380
 have a history of threatening to stab people and you have hallucinogenic drugs in your

182
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,740
 house. But creepy nonetheless, right? It's possible. It's possible that a man who does

183
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,580
 a lot of drugs, who's talked multiple times about stabbing people could also be possessed

184
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:50,300
 by a demon and then stab people barking bunny. Let's go ahead and pick you up by the back

185
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:57,160
 of the neck. And we're going to put you in the corner. We're going to pick you up by

186
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,360
 your neck and put you in the carbonar copter and rub your belly once more. We are leaving

187
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,720
 behind the Stewart's Town, Pennsylvania. We're flying all the way out to Houston, Texas.

188
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
 I remember last year when I took a vacation, I usually take a longer vacation during the

189
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,520
 summer. I schedule some time off of work. I go to California and hang out with my family.

190
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,540
 Last year my vacation had just started and the Wayfair conspiracy theory popped up. Remember

191
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,660
 that where apparently it was weird, right? It was super weird. I never really covered

192
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,460
 it on the show. I mentioned it once or twice because by the time I got back into town to

193
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,140
 start recording new episodes, people had kind of moved on. But the Wayfair conspiracy theory

194
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:46,540
 was basically you could buy, there'd be listings for pillows or cabinets for $10,000. You'd

195
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,600
 see the name of the storage unit, this big metal file cabinet, and it would be called

196
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:00,800
 Model Josie and then $10,000. And people started to connect the cabinets to the names of actual

197
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,880
 missing people. And I picked the name Josie off the top of my head. Some of the names

198
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,400
 were kind of exotic and they didn't match up to people, children who had gone missing.

199
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,960
 So it was a weird connection. I never completely blew it off. I never did a deep dive into

200
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,460
 it because it was being covered by the mainstream media. I'm pretty sure Wayfair made a statement

201
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,580
 about it. I remember seeing it all over the place. I wasn't able to cover it, right? It

202
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:26,180
 was kind of done by the time I got back. But if you don't remember, it was basically this

203
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,260
 website where you could order items wholesale was selling these and it was actually a cover

204
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,380
 for human trafficking. So you would buy the cabinet and when the cabinet got shipped to

205
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:40,220
 you, you'd open it up and there'd be a kidnapped kid in it. So some sort of child trafficking

206
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,740
 thing which I think would actually be quite surprising if you actually bought one of these

207
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,120
 cabinets. You're like, I really need storage space and I have all this money and then you

208
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,720
 open it up and a 10 year old girl jumps out of it. You'd be quite shocked. But yeah,

209
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,960
 that conspiracy theory happened last, I believe it was last summer. And then the same thing

210
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,800
 kind of happened this time while I was on vacation. A brand new conspiracy theory popped

211
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,800
 up and it's so similar yet different. And I have a conspiracy theory of why these even

212
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,400
 are taking the path they are. This whole thing is just so weird. But let's go ahead and start

213
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,420
 this off with once again on my quest to get my YouTube channel removed as we talk about

214
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,540
 these topics once again. And that's part of the conspiracy theory too as well just by

215
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,460
 talking about this I could get the whole podcast shut down. But let's take a look at this.

216
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:34,180
 I do think it's I do think it's worth risking my podcast to explore. On August 19th, 2022

217
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,060
 is when this conspiracy theory first popped up. There was a poster on 4chan. There's anonymous

218
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:45,000
 poster on 4chan who notices something weird going on. I think specifically the board was

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,920
 politically incorrect, which is their politically incorrect board. But August 19th, 2022, this

220
00:15:51,920 --> 00:16:02,580
 guy finds a suspicious series of listings in Houston, Texas. He finds a lot of aquariums

221
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:09,780
 that have a very simple naming structure. It's two letters and then aquariums. So you'd

222
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:17,340
 have HX aquariums, RC aquariums, AR aquariums. He found a bunch of these posted in a very,

223
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:23,740
 very small geographical area. And he basically just says, WTF did I find here? That's kind

224
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,620
 of his first post. He wants to know, does this mean anything? It actually WTF did I

225
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,420
 stumble on was the actual name of the post. And I want to say this too, this was recommended

226
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,220
 to me by a listener, but they said they didn't want to be connected to this. I'm assuming

227
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,260
 they don't want their accounts shut down as well. But a listener did send this to me

228
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,900
 that said, please don't use my name. So but I wanted to acknowledge that they did request

229
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,900
 the story. You had this. So thank you. Thank you for that. You have this thing going on

230
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,980
 here and immediately the internet sleuths start to go to work. And the first thing you

231
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,100
 see with this is there's always a very common thing to jump to in conspiracy theories. They

232
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:10,260
 go, why would there be X as in when the Denver Airport was built, the Denver International

233
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,860
 Airport, which has all these connections to conspiracy theories, there's this theory

234
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:20,420
 that it's actually a hideout, a bunker for the world's elite to live underneath the airport.

235
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,940
 And people who believe that conspiracy theory go, the airport cost a billion dollars to

236
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,540
 build. That's a lot of money for an airport. But then you have to ask the question, how

237
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,100
 much does how much does an airport normally cost? And that's one of the things we look

238
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,840
 at when we look at this aquarium one, they go, why are there so many aquariums in such

239
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,620
 a small geographical area? Well, Houston, Texas has 2.3 million people in it. So the

240
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,340
 first question you want to look at is how many aquariums do you normally find in a city

241
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,800
 of that size? Now I never go to the aquarium, right? I find fish pretty boring unless they're

242
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,900
 like attacking me. And it's the most exciting thing of my life. But you know, fish swimming

243
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,580
 around, they're pretty to look at, but I'm not going to pay money to go see them. So

244
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,380
 my question would be zero to one would be the amount of aquariums you would need in

245
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,180
 a major city. But you ask, is there a lot of aquariums in Houston as compared to other

246
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,380
 cities of the population base, the pushback against that? And this is a very fascinating

247
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,660
 conspiracy theory. I'm just going to be talking about whether or not aquariums are cool. Is

248
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,800
 people say you can actually mimic this in most cities in America, if not around the

249
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:36,040
 world, you can look at your city and there will be multiple aquariums with this two letter

250
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:44,800
 beginning. QR aquariums, HA aquariums, whatever it is. I'm making these, I'm picking these

251
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,000
 combinations out of my buttocks, but that's what this is going on. Now when people are

252
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,740
 seeing this and people are starting to realize that there are a lot of aquariums like this,

253
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,100
 people start to really get into this conspiracy theory, but it always keeps coming back to

254
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,940
 Texas when you when you read these threads, you'll start to see people go, Oh, I see this

255
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,500
 somewhere else. But for whatever reason, the conspiracy theory keeps redirecting to Texas.

256
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,660
 These are basically the options of what this could be one. It could be some sort of bizarre

257
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:20,420
 tax shelter or money laundering. That's theory one, right? That is just a way to hide money.

258
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,800
 Theory two is that these are actual aquariums, but the reason why there seems to be a bunch

259
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,320
 of them and apparently a lot of times these are found in kind of shady places. You go

260
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,640
 to HR aquarium on Google Maps and it'll show like, it'll show like a wood, it'll show a

261
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,160
 wooded area, it'll show a place where you don't expect an aquarium to be. It'll show

262
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,040
 kind of a house down the lane. So people go, it's possible that these aquariums are doing

263
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,280
 illegal things, but it's not like there's some sort of tax haven. They're actually selling

264
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,500
 illegal coral or illegal fish. So that's why it's kind of off the beaten path. My question

265
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,780
 to that would be, well, then why are they on Google Maps? Why are you able to find this

266
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,060
 stuff? Generally, people who engage in criminal activity don't put the don't put a pin on

267
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,860
 Google Earth and say, this is where you can buy the best crack. So if they're selling

268
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,580
 this, you know, a lot of illegal businesses just go by word of mouth, but that's one of

269
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,100
 the conspiracy theories. So we have that these are actually just shell companies to launder

270
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,160
 money. The other one is that they're engaging in some sort of illegal business. And let

271
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,720
 me say really the first theory is that they're all legitimate aquariums. And some of them

272
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,200
 are just bad. Some of them are bad at being an aquarium. It's just the lake or it's just

273
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,880
 a guy with a fishbowl sitting in his house. But so we have these different conspiracy

274
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:39,840
 theories, but it only takes, it only takes about an hour from the very first post WTF

275
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:50,180
 that I stumble upon to within one hour. Child trafficking. These aquarium businesses, and

276
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:56,220
 there's a lot of them. Some of them are legit. Some of them are a trailer in a wooded area.

277
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,540
 But these suspicious amount, quote unquote, suspicious amount of aquariums in this city,

278
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,980
 child trafficking. And it is so interesting to see how quickly this turns. And then it

279
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:16,520
 starts to become aquariums means that the children are kept in giant glass boxes. Because

280
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,080
 we know historically that's the best way to keep a sentient species in one of the most

281
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,760
 breakable walls possible. That these children are kept in literal aquariums, right? They're

282
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:33,600
 trapped in aquariums and perverts will then come to the aquarium, not to see an orca,

283
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,420
 not to see a great white shark swimming around, but to see kids behind glass. And this is

284
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:45,860
 where I think the story behind the conspiracy theory becomes even weirder than the conspiracy

285
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:52,380
 theory itself. Because once that gets introduced, when people really start talking about this

286
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:58,540
 outside of these threads on the 4chan, they go straight to the child trafficking thing.

287
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,340
 They accept it as truth, and a lot of stuff has been accepted as truth in this conspiracy

288
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,440
 theory. This is a very, very new conspiracy theory. They already have these connections.

289
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,080
 They go, guys, when you go to Google Earth and look at these aquariums, whether or not

290
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,800
 it is a storefront, whether or not it is at a strip mall or whether or not it is a house,

291
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:25,920
 they seem to have a star on them. There's like a star painting or a star poster or a

292
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:34,000
 metal star. So stars, we know if you turn them upside down or satanic. We also got to

293
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,160
 remember that we're in the lone star state, which is Texas. So unless the cowboys are

294
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,780
 actually a big satanic group, unless all fans of the Dallas Cowboys are satanic, see, this

295
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,140
 is where it starts to get weird, doesn't it? They make this connection. I don't know if

296
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,180
 that's why they keep bringing it back to Texas, because they make the connection. They say

297
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,080
 that these businesses almost always, see, there's a big difference between always and

298
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,960
 almost always, has a star at or near the location. And even then we get all this will and room.

299
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,000
 Well, it's in the lone star state. But what I find so, and I could go on and on, there's

300
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,480
 a lot of other stuff. It's possibly linked to there's a website in India called helpmecovid.com

301
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,840
 that some of these businesses appeared on and they thought maybe it was a way to take

302
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,560
 COVID relief money that was being issued. There's a whole lot of other conspiracy theories.

303
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,340
 Some people say these businesses exist in the maps, but they have no LLC paperwork.

304
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,380
 And to really verify that you'd have to go through every single one and look up their

305
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,460
 LLC paperwork. They say that they never paid any taxes. And these are statements of people

306
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,220
 making online anonymously. And then you'll see it reported somewhere else as fact. When

307
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,140
 that website's not checking the LLC paperwork of all these businesses in Houston or in Austin

308
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,300
 or wherever else within or without Texas, we start to see all these other conspiracy

309
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:56,560
 theories pop up and so on and so on. But I wanted to take another look at this as a conspiracy

310
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,360
 theory as a whole to wrap this up because we could go into, I mean, I could read you

311
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,600
 off the LLC listings of all these businesses. We could do a sample and find out how many

312
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,480
 of them actually do have LLC set up. And again, I would ask the question is, this is truly

313
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,840
 illegal. Why would you be? Oh, and that's another thing. Apparently people are also now

314
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,600
 faking businesses. People are in it because you can just put a pin of a business in Google

315
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,620
 Earth and say, claim this business. People are finding some remote area and putting a

316
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,220
 little pin there and saying QR aquariums, the best viewing in town just to freak people

317
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,740
 out. So the conspiracy theory has gone from a person innocently discovering this to these

318
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,740
 are the reasons why legit and illegal these may exist to pedophilia cabal, right? Straight

319
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,420
 to pizza gate. And that's why they call it aquarium gate. That's the first time I'm using

320
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,100
 that name in this episode of the title. But aquarium gate is the name for this conspiracy

321
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:55,040
 theory. All the way to now people are using it to troll other people. People are faking

322
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,480
 these listings and apparently some of these pins that were a norm first discovered are

323
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,080
 gone now. So there's this white to become a very short period of time. I'm recording

324
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:12,120
 this on the 30th, August 30th. So just 11 days later, it's gone from mystery to pedophilia

325
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:19,780
 cabal to troll. You know, now they're trolling each other by making up these fake listings.

326
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,820
 But let's take a step back from aquarium gate because at the end of the day, some of it

327
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:30,380
 could be totally legit, right? Some of it could be illegal. Some of it could be someone

328
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,300
 just is running an aquarium or they're out of it's a home based business and they call

329
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,020
 it aquarium, but they are selling all these aquarium supplies. Some of it could actually

330
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:47,600
 be a tax shelter or a drug trafficking business, a front, a way to launder money or whatever.

331
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,360
 It could be even worse than that human trafficking. But let's step back from all of that for a

332
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,720
 second and take a look at why I'm not going to rant about this too long because I do have

333
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,200
 a theory. I developed a theory because of this. Why do these conspiracy theories always

334
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,520
 fall into the world of pedophilia? Like I get it. That's like the grossest thing you

335
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,180
 could possibly be a part of. I said the other day I would rather do 20 years in prison for

336
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,500
 murder than 5 years for anything associated with a child, even though you'd get out quicker.

337
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:27,100
 You're a scumbag, right? But you know, you do 20 years to come out, you've murdered a

338
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,780
 guy. People are always going to ask, "Hey man, what was it like?" You're like, "Dude,

339
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,580
 I was just chopping vegetables one day and the next thing I know, I was in prison."

340
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,900
 It's the worst thing you can be accused of. It's the worst thing you can be a part of.

341
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,840
 But why does it always default to that? When we had the PizzaGate scenario of the Clinton

342
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,760
 administration being tied into a pedophilia ring and stuff like that because of the code

343
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,240
 on the napkins, people were saying, "I want seven to nine slices of pizza at this party."

344
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,240
 And someone else goes, "I want 10 to 12 slices of pizza." You're like, "Who can eat that

345
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,160
 much pizza outside of me? I could eat a lot of pizza." And so it became this code for

346
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,040
 that's the age of kid they wanted at this party. That's where PizzaGate started. And

347
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,580
 then it evolved. That's what it was. And there was another letter saying, "Don't worry,

348
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,980
 we're going to have entertainment at the party. We have three kids and they named the kids

349
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,420
 and they said six, nine, and twelve or whatever were their ages." People were like, "Why would

350
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,900
 you care what kids are coming to the party or what type of entertainment?" And even if

351
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,100
 they wore like a traveling talent act, why do you need to know their ages? Those two pieces

352
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:33,500
 of information is where it became Comet Pizza, Ping Pong Pizza in Washington, D.C. as a

353
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,740
 basement where they trafficked children. It came off of these hacked emails from Hillary

354
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,880
 Clinton. That was the origin of PizzaGate. Now, when you look at that stuff, I'm not

355
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,160
 saying that Hillary Clinton actually was trafficking kids, but when you look at those

356
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:53,360
 codes, there's all weird codes. Who orders pizza and says, "I want nine to twelve slices?"

357
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,040
 So that's how they go. This code must mean this. But then when you got to the Wayfair

358
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,560
 scandal, when you got to the saying like, "Oh, someone's buying the shed. It must be a trafficked

359
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,420
 kid," you go, "Well, listen, there's a lot of reasons why you would pay $10,000 for a

360
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,020
 locker. The picture might look busted, but it's possible that this is an industrial locker

361
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,140
 that you do sell for $10,000. And if it is illegal, it could be anything from guns to

362
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:24,420
 drugs to human trafficking, i.e. smuggling people over the border, to pedophilia trafficking,

363
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,760
 sex trafficking, right? So why did the sex trafficking one hit so quickly? With this one,

364
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,940
 we actually can watch. These threads were archived right away. We can actually see how

365
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:40,140
 quickly it evolves. It took one hour to go from, "Wow, this might just be a coincidence.

366
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,660
 This might be a mystery. This could be drug smuggling. It could be tax havens, too. It's

367
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,500
 pedophilia, and it's been that way ever since." That's just how this conspiracy theory is

368
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,660
 addressed. The star is Satanic. It's not because it's in Texas. The Satanic thing doesn't really

369
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:02,800
 fly with a tax haven. It doesn't really fly with a drug front, right? Satanic, pedophilia,

370
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,680
 symbol, star, that stuff goes together. So it very, very quickly went to the pedophilia

371
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,320
 thing, and I get it. It's the worst thing to be connected to, but why is that happening?

372
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:18,760
 Now, on the one hand, it could be because people tend to imagine the worst thing possible.

373
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:27,020
 But an hour into it, an hour into this conspiracy theory, we're already with that. There's been

374
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:33,900
 a lot of talk recently about how much of the internet is bots. It's interesting because

375
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,140
 now a lot of websites are using the delay. So when you go to log on to a website, they're

376
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,980
 like, "We're going to verify that you're human. Big websites do this now." Every

377
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,700
 show often there's a little box that pops up. It's a little factoid about the internet.

378
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,360
 It says, "Friendly tip, there are a lot of friendly bots on the internet." I'm like,

379
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,880
 "Why? Why? I'm not going to hang out with these guys. Why do I need to know that there's

380
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,920
 friendly bots on the internet doing friendly stuff? Just give me to the website. I don't

381
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,520
 need to learn something about the internet each time I try to log on to a website." It's

382
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,600
 this "capsia pause." It's to prevent DDoS attacks, the Nile Service attacks. There's

383
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,440
 been popping up more and more often. There's been a lot of talk about bots, whether it's

384
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,440
 Elon Musk backing out of the Twitter deal because of bots, or the Twitter whistleblower

385
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,380
 saying they don't even know how many bots and they don't care. The people who are in

386
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,260
 charge of Twitter, they've never really seriously looked into it. Whether it's the empty internet

387
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,980
 theory on the conspiracy theory iceberg that a lot of the internet is bots, we think we're

388
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,980
 interacting with other people but we're not. To this, I don't think this is a conspiracy

389
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,700
 theory that it's true, that there is a concentrated effort to destroy the old internet, to straight

390
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:45,220
 up mud-flood the old internet. When you go to look for news before, say, two or three

391
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,440
 years ago, it's a lot harder to. I can attest that that's true because I've always been

392
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,360
 looking at older stuff. It has gotten harder to find those personalized web pages that

393
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,840
 are still up. If you want to learn about the history of Optimus Prime, you're going to

394
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,040
 be directed to Wikipedia pages and some newer websites versus the websites that were built

395
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,680
 back in 2000. Now, of course, some of those websites could be gone, but I do think that

396
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,780
 there is an effort to mud-flood out to basically destroy the older internet, so it's easier

397
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:21,160
 to control, right? But that also would involve bots, because there would be no human who

398
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,860
 would be able to make all those decisions constantly, so you'd have bots crawling the

399
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:34,620
 web deciding which pages stay and which pages are buried. And if you do have this huge army

400
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,320
 of bots, are they all individualized bots or are there, like a mini science fiction,

401
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,360
 authors will say and conspiracy theorists, is there an AI controlling all of this stuff?

402
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,160
 Maybe not one for the entire globe, but maybe a series of them based on the governments that

403
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,160
 they're operated out of and maybe a few privately owned big programs as well. And when I'm

404
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:04,740
 saying AI, I'm not talking full-on Skynet, full-on Roku Baskalic type of AI at this point,

405
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,820
 but just programs that are doing the work of humans that humans can't do, there's just

406
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,780
 too much information going in and out. And we do have, we do know that bots are posting

407
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:21,380
 on Twitter and they appear to be human. We do know that bots are posting on 4chan and

408
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,740
 they appear to be human. People have complained, people have said, "I've seen posts that I've

409
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:36,080
 placed reappear on other boards." And it's word for word what I wrote. They wrote something

410
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,000
 three weeks later, they see it on another board, on another topic. But then again, as

411
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,080
 a troll people immediately begin taking that post that someone wrote complaining that they've

412
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,080
 seen their posts other places and begin putting that post other places. And not like copy

413
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,200
 pasta either, he goes, "It wasn't some funny thing that I wrote. I just wrote an opinion

414
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,300
 about something and I read my own opinion a week later on another board." So we know

415
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,500
 they exist on Twitter, we know they exist on 4chan, they most likely also all over Reddit

416
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:11,500
 as well. So all these main places, how many humans are you interacting with? How many

417
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,860
 are just bots? That's the idea behind the empty internet theory. And my conspiracy theory

418
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:25,100
 is that it is not the human need to look at the darkest aspects of humanity to say the

419
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,280
 worst thing I can possibly think of is a human trafficking ring that involves kidnapped children.

420
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,300
 That is the worst possible thing you can think of. And because we often dwell in the darkness,

421
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:42,740
 we're not dark people ourselves, but we do have a morbid sense of reality. And that's

422
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,180
 everybody, everybody's like that. When someone gives you a mystery, a lot of times we'll

423
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,820
 take it to the nth degree, that's just part of human nature. So that could be why this

424
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:58,260
 stuff always ends in pedophilia, right? It's this thing that gets your stomach in a knot.

425
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,620
 But what if it isn't that? It's been on our conspiracy caps and wrap up this episode,

426
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:09,700
 it ran a little long, but let's take a look at this here. What if it is the bots of the

427
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:16,540
 internet, the AI or AIs of the internet realizing that the number one way to get engagement,

428
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,420
 the number one way to get clicks, and we know this is a fact, is outrage clicks, right?

429
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:30,980
 And it is the bots. It is the bots that always accelerate towards the pedophilia. Not the

430
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,860
 theory itself, not the guy who posted it the first time, not the people who, I'm not saying

431
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,300
 everyone who's interacted with this is the bots. But what if it's the bots that are the

432
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,420
 ones who promote this theory above all others, and not because it has some sort of sinister

433
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:50,980
 implications, but because they know people will click on it, they know people will try

434
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:58,900
 to investigate it, because it makes you so sick, you can't look away.

435
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,060
 What if that's why conspiracy theories tend to go to that darkest point? Because when you

436
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,740
 look at those websites like Real Raw News and Dark Outpost, which are really, really

437
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:13,620
 hardcore conspiracy theory websites, they always go to that theory. And you go, Jason,

438
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,460
 the reason why they always go to that theory, because that is true, that is the theory people

439
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,660
 in powerful positions are pedophiles. That absolutely could be the case. I do believe,

440
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,220
 I believe there's pedophiles on all walks of life, right? And some of them are incredibly

441
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:33,060
 powerful people. But why did these conspiracy theories within an hour become pedophiles?

442
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:40,740
 It's pedophiles all the way down. I don't understand why that happens. And we have it

443
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,580
 happening three times. I think the code and the, again, it could have been drugs, it could have

444
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,500
 been anything. Again, I'm not trying to say that that's exactly what it was. But when I read those

445
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,380
 emails, I go, that is weird. That is a really weird way to phrase how many slices of pizza you want.

446
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,500
 But the Wayfarer one, I thought, and this is weird, I don't know if it's necessarily human

447
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,580
 trafficking. It could be legit. I've never bought a giant. So I've never bought a giant

448
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,300
 file cabinet. The pillows were weird. The pillows were $1,000 each. And even the mainstream media

449
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,900
 didn't even really bring up the pillows, because they didn't have an answer for that, for the giant

450
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,020
 file cabinets. They go, well, these are industrial file cabinets. There's just things in an

451
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,580
 industrial pillow. But anyways, there's always, and I don't have all the answers. I never claim

452
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,860
 to have all the answers. But I just think it's so weird that it goes to that level. Now, what's

453
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:31,940
 interesting is whether or not there is a bot, whether or not there are AIs pushing us towards

454
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:39,700
 these darkest points of humanity to get more clicks, I don't have the answer for that either.

455
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,700
 Is it possible that the bots, when they look, when the AI overlords look at the internet as a whole,

456
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:52,500
 because we don't see it, right? We don't see the worst stuff out there. At the very most,

457
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,580
 you may go to a Reddit board or a 4chan board that has gore on it, right? Cartel beheadings or

458
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:04,100
 something like that. And you go, ugh, that's enough for me today. The more I will be back

459
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,020
 to look at more horrible violence, but that's enough for me today. And to

460
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,180
 most of us never even go, I don't go to none of that stuff, but most of us don't even go there.

461
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:19,620
 But there are people who go there and whatever, they're viewing that horrible imagery. And even

462
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,260
 they don't know how dark the internet gets. They hear whispers of it, right? You see it in news

463
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:32,580
 articles. There's a whole chunk of the internet and a whole huge portion of the dark web, the deep web,

464
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:40,660
 that has this horrific imagery on it, far beyond cartel beheadings. We're now in the area of stuff

465
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,540
 I don't even want to talk about. Now we're in the area of like snuff videos, all of this stuff

466
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:51,540
 out there. Now we don't see that. Most of humanity never sees that. You hear about it again in

467
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:59,460
 newspaper articles, but the AI sees all of it. And it sees all of it like a soulless god, right?

468
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:05,860
 Looking down at human suffering that's been caught on video. Immortalized in ones and zeros,

469
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:12,580
 this digital file that's floating around and while 99.9999999% of humanity will never even know

470
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:19,620
 that file existed, the AI knows it. And it doesn't see it as any different than a video of a happy dog

471
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:30,500
 dancing to beat it. So that if that is the AI that's creating these bots, it would weigh all these

472
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,220
 things equally. And it goes, well, I know that all of this horrible stuff exists. And it would look

473
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:41,940
 at it without the eyes of a human consciousness, a human soul, right? It doesn't see the depraved

474
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:48,100
 evil in that image. It sees it simply as an image as a video. And it may be thinking, I'm just going

475
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,180
 to put it in this conspiracy theory because I know people are going to click on links that have

476
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:58,020
 these words in it. Child trafficking, sex trafficking, child sex trafficking. And the bots are building

477
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:03,540
 in this conspiracy theory. It'll be interesting to find out exactly how much of the internet

478
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,380
 is human controlled or human, you know, it used to all be. There's not anymore. And it will be

479
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,580
 very interesting if we ever find out what that is. If we ever find out that 30% of Twitter is bots,

480
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,420
 it would change the game. 30% of Fortune is bots, 30% of Reddit, all these people that you thought

481
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:26,340
 you're interacting with, were actually just bot accounts, AI driven accounts for whatever reason.

482
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:31,460
 Either it's trying to promote an ideology or it's simply testing itself to someday promote an

483
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,860
 ideology. It'd be really interesting to say, imagine if you found out that 130 your friends didn't

484
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,540
 exist. What if you found out that one third of the people that you interacted with on a regular

485
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,980
 basis did not exist? So fascinating. It's such a fascinating thing. It's a conspiracy theory

486
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:52,740
 that in and of itself is weird. And we can find a conspiracy theory in it as well. Are these theories

487
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:59,780
 being propagated by humans or by bots looking for clicks? How many of the conspiracy theories that

488
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:06,420
 you personally believe in or I personally believe in aren't real? We're coming across that a year

489
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,100
 after it was established, we're like, wow, that is really weird to those connections. But if we

490
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,860
 were there in the first week, we would see how things were whittled away and things,

491
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:21,460
 you know, edges were sanded off. And imagine then that there was an AI doing that thing. It

492
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,220
 wasn't a group of humans sitting around and trying to figure out what could be going on.

493
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:30,500
 It was a group of humans and three or four bots, people who don't exist, who are part of this

494
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,180
 conversation going on. This conspiracy theory is pretty quickly getting wiped off the internet

495
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:42,180
 and a lot of people attribute it to a cover up. It's actually, and again, we're going to wrap it

496
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,980
 up. This is the two or three times I wanted to address this. This isn't a super dramatic ending,

497
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:52,020
 but this this is getting wiped off the internet because it includes a lot of doxing people.

498
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:57,140
 They're posting addresses, they're posting names of businesses, all of the initials that I used,

499
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,740
 which I was just pulling them off the top of my head. But people are like, this place is a child

500
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,220
 trafficking business. And it was a picture of a house in a wooded area in Houston, Texas. That's

501
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,700
 not what I'm doing. It's possible. Listen, I'm always running. I think about it before I do episodes

502
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,660
 like this. The whole podcast could get taken down because I'm talking about this story, right?

503
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:22,100
 And YouTube has basically throttled me once again. I did really good there and got a bunch of subs

504
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,340
 and I, you know, for a while there, but they throttle me from time to time, but I have to

505
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,300
 make a choice. Am I going to do really cool topics like this that we can look into the world of

506
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:40,820
 conspiracy theory at the risk of getting shadow banned? Right? Or do I not cover topics like this

507
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,540
 and know they are really cool and really intriguing and really neat to kind of take

508
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,340
 apart and see and just talk about the same garbage that everyone else is talking about?

509
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,660
 I would rather take these risks. Listen, if the podcast got shut down, I'd be bummed.

510
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:00,340
 But this is just so fascinating to me. I hope you guys found it fascinating. I don't think

511
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,860
 anything's going to happen to the podcast, but you got to take those risks, right? Otherwise,

512
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,780
 you just become the same show everyone else is putting out and I don't want that. And you don't

513
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:13,140
 want that. But maybe the AI wants that. Maybe they're like, nope, got to put out the same show.

514
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,100
 And at that point, you know, you just kind of got to pack it up and leave, but that we're not

515
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,380
 planning on doing that anytime soon. As long as the AI doesn't personally strangle me in my sleep.
