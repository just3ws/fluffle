1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,360
 They make me happy and they make me feel better.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,560
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,720
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,720
 A man who does not believe the Mandela effect

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,720
 is a real phenomenon is confronted with information that he

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,720
 may be the Mandela effect.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,720
 It's not Nelson Mandela.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,720
 He's not on this show, but you know what I mean?

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,720
 You're like, "I have no idea, Jason."

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,720
 And then you'll find out when you listen to the episode.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,720
 And then we travel to Australia to meet a little boy

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,720
 and his imaginary friend.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,720
 But is it possible that this little boy's imaginary playmate

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,720
 could unveil a dark secret about the relationship between

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,720
 time and death today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,720
 (upbeat music)

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
 I'm your host Jason Garbiter.

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
 I'm having a great day.

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,720
 I hope you guys had an awesome Thanksgiving.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,720
 We are starting off season 20, the countdown to episode 1,000

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
 That is amazing and I couldn't have done it without you guys.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
 Thank you so much for your support.

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,720
 And someone who supported the show during the Dead Rabbit Radio

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,720
 Thanksgiving live stream, walking into Dead Rabbit Command

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 right now, everyone give it up for Ba June.

38
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,720
 Woohoo, yeah, come on in Ba June.

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

40
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,720
 That Thanksgiving live stream was pretty fun.

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 We went for two hours and talked about a whole bunch of stuff.

42
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
 Thanks everyone who showed up.

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
 And if you couldn't show up, totally understand.

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,720
 It's Thanksgiving, right?

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
 People have other stuff to do and they're driving around.

46
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
 They're hanging out with their friends and family.

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
 I totally get it.

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,720
 But Ba June made a very generous donation during our live stream.

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,720
 So you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

50
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,720
 If you guys can't support the show financially,

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 I totally understand.

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,720
 That helps out so much.

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,720
 Ba June lets dust off the Jason Jalopy

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,720
 and we are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

56
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 Drive us all the way out too.

57
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
 An elementary school.

58
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
 [imitates car horn]

59
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,720
 No, I gotta say, before we get the story started,

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
 this story sounds...

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,720
 Even among the stuff we cover on this show,

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,720
 this story sounds super made up.

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 And it could be...

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
 Right?

65
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 It could totally be made up.

66
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 But if it's true...

67
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
 What a story, man.

68
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
 What a story.

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
 Now I'm sure if it isn't made up,

70
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
 at least one person is going to be laughing really loud

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
 and be like, "Oh, what? I fooled them."

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
 I fooled Jason.

73
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
 I hope it's not true.

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 Well, it's hard to say, right?

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,720
 Because if it's made up, then I've just wasted your time.

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,720
 And I mean, myself look like a fool.

77
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
 But if it's true,

78
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,720
 this could be one of the weirdest Mandela effects

79
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,720
 we've come across, then that'd be awesome.

80
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,720
 We're hanging out at this elementary school.

81
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,720
 It's back in 1984, around there.

82
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,720
 We're gonna meet a young boy named Morris.

83
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
 He's sitting there on the playground,

84
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,720
 hands in his pockets, his Oshkosh bagosh overalls.

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,720
 And these kids are like, "Hey, Morris, what's going on?"

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
 And he's like, "Hey, buddies, how's life?

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,720
 He's a very deep thinker for an elementary school student."

88
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,720
 His friends are like, "Hey, Morris, did you hear about that spooky movie?

89
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,720
 Hear about that really cool spooky movie that's out right now?"

90
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
 Morris is like, "No, not really.

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
 I'm talking about elementary school. I don't watch a lot of spooky movies."

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
 And they go, "Well, we have big brothers, so we do.

93
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,720
 And there's a movie out right now."

94
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,720
 And the villains named Morris.

95
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,720
 Morris, Morris, please don't kill us.

96
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,720
 And he's like, "What? That's kind of a grim taunt."

97
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,720
 But it fits because there was a horror movie that had just come out

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,720
 and the killer in it, the blood-soaked maniac in this movie,

99
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,720
 went by the name of Morris Knight.

100
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
 And he goes, "Morris goes, listen, you know, it was gentle teasing, right?

101
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,720
 I mean, they did say that I was gonna murder them."

102
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
 But he goes, "It wasn't anything too intense.

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,720
 Like, I would get teased now and then this movie came out.

104
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,720
 This guy named Morris Knight was killing all these teenagers.

105
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,720
 And yeah, my name's Morris. I get it. It's probably their most common name, sure.

106
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,720
 He said eventually he did see the movie for himself when he was a kid.

107
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,720
 And it was about this serial killer named Morris.

108
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 And they're trying to find out the identity of this killer,

109
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,720
 because they needed a clue to be able, if they uncover his identity,

110
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,720
 it'll give them an idea of what they're up against.

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
 These teenagers are trying to figure out who's killing them one by one.

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,720
 And they find out at the end of the movie, the killer's name is Morris Knight.

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 Morris was like, "That's kind of dumb.

114
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,720
 There's nothing wrong with the name Morris!" Morris exclaimed.

115
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
 But Morris Knight doesn't even make any sense.

116
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,720
 It's not like scary or anything like that, whatever.

117
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,720
 So now I know why people are, again, lightly ribbing me.

118
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
 It wasn't a full-on bullying situation.

119
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,720
 They weren't afraid he was gonna murder them one by one after all.

120
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,720
 He goes, "But I'd come to terms with the fact that I was named after a famous horror movie villain.

121
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,720
 And I have to say, I'm gonna interject myself here for a second.

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,720
 When I was a kid, the fact that there was a killer named Jason Vorhees,

123
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
 I didn't even think about this.

124
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
 I've read this story multiple times since I was typing the notes up.

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,720
 I just remembered that my name's Jason, and growing up, there was a gentle ribbing.

126
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,720
 People would call me Jason Vorhees all the time and stuff like that.

127
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,720
 And I hated it. I absolutely hated it.

128
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
 I don't mind that those movies scared me so bad.

129
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,720
 I never really watched any of the Friday the 13th movies until I was much, much older.

130
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
 But they scared me so bad.

131
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,720
 But if someone called me Jason or Jason Vorhees or something like that, people still do that.

132
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
 They're like, "Hey, like the serial killer."

133
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
 Whatever. You do get it.

134
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,720
 I mean, there's worse things to be made fun of about, I guess, being compared to a 6'6 supernatural serial killer.

135
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
 You know? That's fine.

136
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,720
 So I get where he's coming from.

137
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
 There is this weird, and Jason's not the most uncommon name,

138
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,720
 and people still make that connection between Jason Vorhees and Jason Carpenter,

139
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 but you just kind of go on with it, right?

140
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
 Well, he ends up at one point going, "You know what would be really funny?"

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 Because now he's in high school, and now he's in high school, he goes,

142
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 "You know what would be funny? I'm going to dress up as Morris Knight, and everyone will get it."

143
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
 Morris is dressed up as Morris Knight. It'll be really funny.

144
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,720
 And he says, "Sure enough, that's what happened. He went to high school.

145
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
 He was dressed up as Morris Knight."

146
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,720
 And we're like, "Oh, dude, we totally get it. Your name's Morris."

147
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,720
 Well, let's fast forward now to just a couple months ago.

148
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,720
 It's October 2022.

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,720
 You know, Halloween time. People are getting ready to get scared, and Morris goes,

150
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,720
 "You know what, actually, I should re-watch that horror movie from when I was a kid,

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,720
 because it's been 20, 30, close to 40 years since the last time I saw it, right?

152
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,720
 It was in elementary school in the '80s.

153
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,720
 I'm going to watch that horror movie, that famous horror movie about the killer Morris Knight."

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,720
 So Morris puts it in, probably downloads it right stream in it,

155
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 and he's watching it, but this is not the movie he remembers.

156
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,720
 Sure, the plot elements are the same.

157
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
 Pretty much it's all the same.

158
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,720
 But the character's name is not Morris Knight.

159
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
 And he's watching this movie, and the further the movie goes along,

160
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,720
 the deeper the dread in Morris, because he's really starting to trip out now.

161
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,720
 He knows for certain that this movie was about a serial killer named Morris,

162
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,720
 and he knows it for certain because he experienced it throughout his life.

163
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 Morris says, "Listen, I have not been a huge believer in the Mandela Effect,

164
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,720
 because I've always thought it was things that were so unrelated to somebody's existence,

165
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 and they have a half-memory of it, that they just go, "Oh, no, no, I remember it used to be the Bernstein Bears."

166
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,720
 Or, "I remember there used to be a cornucopia on Fruit of the Loom."

167
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,720
 When the fact of the matter is, like, when we were kids,

168
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
 first of all, none of us bought our own underwear, right?

169
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,720
 Our parents or your orphanage bought you the underwear, and I never looked too closely at it.

170
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
 I'm pretty sure the cornucopia was on the Fruit of the Loom logo.

171
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,720
 I'm pretty sure, but I'm going off memories of me being eight, opening a bag of underwear.

172
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
 I mean, they were instantly faded, right?

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,720
 I went through underwear like a baby does diapers, but maybe, right?

174
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,720
 You could say a lot of the stuff, when you get to things like Captain Crunch versus Captain Crunch,

175
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,720
 you can go, "Well, you know, these people, they don't work."

176
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 They weren't working on the boat of the Captain himself.

177
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,720
 They ate it maybe once every couple of weeks, and then they didn't think about it for 30 years,

178
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,720
 and then they see the logos change, and they're like, "Ah."

179
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,720
 Morris goes, "But that's not the case with this one. This was part of my childhood."

180
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,720
 This character's name is Morris Knight. I know that for a fact, because I was teased about this in elementary school.

181
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,720
 When I dressed up as this character for Halloween as a teenager, people still got the joke.

182
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,720
 This character's name is Morris Knight.

183
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 This is not a Mandela Effect, where it's just some vague recollection.

184
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,720
 I know for a fact this character's name is Morris Knight, but as I'm sitting here and watching this horror movie,

185
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 titled A Nightmare on Elm Street, this character's name is not Morris Knight.

186
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:24,720
 It's Freddy Krueger, and I know 100%. I know 100% of this character's name used to be Morris Knight.

187
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,720
 I have no idea who this Freddy Krueger dude is.

188
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,720
 I will admit that's a better name, but it used to be Morris Knight.

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,720
 I know that for a fact.

190
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,720
 So Morris ended up messaging one of his buddies, who is a big believer in the Mandela Effect.

191
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 He messages one of his buddies and goes, "Dude, listen, I know I've given you a bunch of grief.

192
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,720
 I know that I spray-painted Bernstein all over your house that one night.

193
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,720
 I know I've given you a bunch of grief about believing in the Mandela Effect,

194
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:05,720
 but I actually found one that I know for certain got changed in the timeline."

195
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 You know that movie A Nightmare on Elm Street? The movie starring Morris Knight.

196
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,720
 The character's name is Morris Knight, and I know that because my name is Morris.

197
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,720
 And Morris begins to text out this entire story that I've just told you.

198
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,720
 He grew up getting teased. Morris, now he's watching this movie in 2022, and the character's name is Freddy Krueger.

199
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,720
 What is going on? This doesn't make any sense.

200
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,720
 I know for a fact it was Morris because I got teased all the time, and he's texting all of this stuff out.

201
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 And his friend responds, "Dude, what in the world? Even for the most hardcore Mandela Effect person, right?"

202
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
 The friend goes, "What in the world are you going on about?"

203
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,720
 Now, Morris figured he would get this response from his buddy, but then what his friend said next was,

204
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:02,720
 "Dude, what are you talking about? Your name is Freddy."

205
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,720
 And Morris said he looked down at his phone, and he was just staring at it.

206
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 Staring at that last message his friend sent, "Your name is Freddy."

207
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:28,720
 Morris grabs his wallet, looks at his ID card, "Frederick," it says on the ID card.

208
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,720
 Frederick, formerly known as Morris, said he felt like he was going insane.

209
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,720
 He thought for the past however long, right? He's a little kid.

210
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,720
 He probably calls him my age, a little kid in the 1980s.

211
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:52,720
 Up till that moment he believed his name was Morris, but now his name's Frederick on his government ID.

212
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,720
 His best friend calls him Freddy, and it all hits him at once.

213
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,720
 He actually thinks he's going crazy, which is a totally acceptable thing, right?

214
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,720
 He said he called his parents in a panic, which would be an alarming phone call, "Mom, Dad!"

215
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,720
 I think I'm crazy! I think I'm crazy! I think I'm crazy!

216
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
 Frederick said that he actually then made an appointment with the doctor,

217
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,720
 and over a period of time was having multiple visits done and getting tested for, you know,

218
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,720
 the good old mental illness test. They take a little bit of your blood, swirl it around, look for the crazy gene.

219
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,720
 He said that he had been checked out, and the doctor said, "You're not nuts."

220
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 At least there's nothing we can see biological. We don't see like a brain tumor. We don't see anything like that going on.

221
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:52,720
 But you might want to go see a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but as far as biologically speaking, we don't see anything wrong with you.

222
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,720
 No amnesia. No underlying mental issues that we know of.

223
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:08,720
 And that's the story of Frederick, aka Morris, a man who became the Mandela Effect himself.

224
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,720
 This is a super fascinating story. I found it posted anonymously on the export. It 100% could be made up.

225
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,720
 Trust me, it totally could be made up, right? Which would suck, and I would apologize for wasting your time.

226
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:32,720
 But in the idea of what we think of the Mandela Effect, it does track, right? The Mandela Effect is basically the theory behind his timelines shifting.

227
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:40,720
 Now, like he said earlier, the Mandela Effect tends to be stuff that doesn't affect your life.

228
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,720
 It tends to be these changes that whether or not Darth Vader said, "Luc, I am your father," or "No, I am your father."

229
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,720
 Whether or not he said either one, it doesn't affect your life in any real way.

230
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,720
 But this one he remembered, he absolutely remembered, it was so personal to him. If the movie just changed, right?

231
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:09,720
 If Morris' name remained Morris, but he watched "A Nightmare in Home Street" in the year 2022 and he saw the character's name was Freddy Krueger,

232
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,720
 that would be crazy. Because he's like, "I know for a fact I was teased about this all the time."

233
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,720
 But now we have his name also changing as well. We have Morris' name also changing.

234
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,720
 It's a Frederick that's so weird because it's like when he's, we accept the Mandela theory, the Mandela Effect theory is fact,

235
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:36,720
 when he switched universes and when he got slotted into this one, whatever mechanism causes the Mandela Effect

236
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:45,720
 to make sure that he ended up in a universe that the horror movie villain from the 1980s had the same name as it had before,

237
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:54,720
 would it have been even more jarring if the character's name in the movie was Freddy Krueger in this universe, but his name was Morris?

238
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,720
 I can't imagine, I can't imagine that would be more jarring than finding out his name was Freddy this entire time.

239
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:08,720
 It's just weird, like you would basically have two variables, his name and the character's name and out of all the things that could change in the universe,

240
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,720
 those are the two details that changed as they're flying through the multiverse.

241
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 I mean, if you accept the Mandela Effect as a real phenomenon, you'd have to wonder about all the movies you've never watched, right?

242
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:36,720
 I would never know if a plot point changed in, you know, Bermuda's intrigue, some lifetime movie of the week, starring Jessica Morris as a land developer in Bermuda,

243
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,720
 and she falls in love with a dude who happens to be a bad guy.

244
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,720
 I would have no idea if that plot changed. It changed a thousand times in a day, I would have no idea.

245
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,720
 Imagine how many times these events, these changes could be happening that we're not aware of.

246
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,720
 It's just interesting because it could be happening all the time, but he has such a personal connection to it.

247
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,720
 His name changed and it changed to match a horror movie villain, like what does it mean?

248
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,720
 It's actually such a perfect story. That's what makes me think it could be fake, right?

249
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
 But I wanted to share that with you. I thought it was really interesting. I really do.

250
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,720
 So, Frederick, if you're out there, try not to go crazy. Try not to go too crazy.

251
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,720
 And if you do, don't get a job as a janitor at an elementary school. It will not end up well for you.

252
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,720
 I guess I shouldn't say that. He might be a janitor right now. He's like, "Is that a threat? Are you going to get me fired?"

253
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 "Bad June, let's go ahead and get out the world famous carbonicopter. We're leaving behind this man.

254
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,720
 He's in the throes of insanity. He's like, "Ah, my name, my name." We're like, "See you later, dude."

255
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,720
 "See you later, possibly psychotic man. We're leaving behind this dude. Let's fly all the way out to Australia."

256
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,720
 [imitates gunshots]

257
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:02,720
 This is one of those stories that we don't have a specific time period of when it took place.

258
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,720
 I would say relative, you know, relative modern age, right?

259
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 We're not in the 19th century steampunk era, probably in the past 20 years around there.

260
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,720
 I don't have a specific location. I was able to go through this person's posting history, find out she's from Australia.

261
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:26,720
 She lives in Australia. So somewhere in the Great Wilderness of the continent of Australia, this story takes place.

262
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,720
 It was posted by someone who goes by the name "Am Kuala Bear." We're going to go ahead and call her Maggie.

263
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:44,720
 This story starts like this. Maggie and her husband have a little boy, a little two-year-old boy, and they're living in this house somewhere in Australia.

264
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,720
 It's a rental house. It's not one that they own, but they're making it their own, right?

265
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,720
 They're actually changing the deed. They're doing that mortgage scam. They're stealing it from some old lady.

266
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,720
 No, they're making it their place. They're turning this house into a home type of thing.

267
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,720
 But what they notice is they're a little boy. We're going to call him Joey.

268
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:11,720
 Joey, while living in this house, he's two years old, he meets an imaginary friend or creates one, right?

269
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,720
 I've never had kids. I don't know how that works. I had imaginary friends when I was a kid.

270
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
 Good old Frederick Krueger. He killed all my enemies.

271
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,720
 No, but I don't remember the mechanism. I knew they weren't real.

272
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,720
 I knew they weren't real, but I'm wondering, like, do you, do parents sit there and go, "It's that time. The kids, too."

273
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,720
 He's going to start imagining possibly spooky guys running around.

274
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,720
 You would wonder, I think, if you were a parent and you were a believer in the paranormal.

275
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 I wonder if you would go through that. Is it a ghost or an imaginary friend?

276
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,720
 You would have to ask yourself that. Maybe not.

277
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:56,720
 Maybe most parents don't think that their kids are contacting Cthulhu whenever they're like, "Oh, I have a friend. His name's Jenny."

278
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,720
 But when we have Joey here, his imaginary friend, the way that they really start to figure out what's going on is they wouldn't know.

279
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:12,720
 This sounds kind of funny. They would notice their little boy, the son, he would take his toys and he would throw them down the hallway.

280
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,720
 There was this long hallway that ran through the house that connected the bulk of the house to the garage.

281
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:26,720
 He would throw his toys down the hallway and then he would turn around and he would mumble to himself as he was walking back into the living room.

282
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
 Parents are like, "What in the world are you doing, bro?"

283
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,720
 And he goes, "There's a boy who wants to play with the toy."

284
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,720
 Why sounds like Jack Nicholson? Let me not do a kid voice.

285
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 The little boy goes, "My friend, he's down the hallway and he wants to play with my toys, so I throw my toys to him."

286
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,720
 It's super interesting. I don't want to dissect it right now. We'll talk about it. I don't want to go on too many diversions.

287
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 But remind me of that. Remind this recording to bring that idea back up of him throwing toys on the hallway.

288
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:07,720
 So time goes on and Joey keeps interacting with his imaginary friend and the parents start to ask him questions about the imaginary friend.

289
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,720
 And then Maggie goes, "What's his name? What's your imaginary friend's name?"

290
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,720
 And Joey goes, "His name's Don." His name's Don, like D-O-N.

291
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,720
 And he describes Don as a little boy. He describes Don as a little boy, which would make sense.

292
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,720
 Which makes sense, right? Age appropriate. I mean, Pete's Dragon, I don't know how old he was.

293
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,720
 Actually, he was an imaginary. He was real. Actually, he's a fictional character.

294
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,720
 He's a fictional character, so it doesn't matter what he was in imaginary in the movie.

295
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,720
 Don was a little boy who was in the house with his family, his imaginary friend, who was interacting with Joey.

296
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,720
 She asks, like, "What's his name?" That's a totally normal question. But then she's asking, "What is he doing here? Why is he here?"

297
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,720
 Which makes me think that maybe she thought there was something paranormal going on.

298
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:59,720
 The mom goes, "Why is he here?" And Joey always had the same answer. Joey would always say, "He's waiting for his mom to pick him up."

299
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,720
 So he's throwing the toys down the hallway. He's talking to Don.

300
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:16,720
 And he always has the same answer to what he's doing there. What's Don doing here? He's waiting for his mom to pick him up.

301
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,720
 Everything seems to be fairly normal. Kids have imaginary friends, hyper-imaginations, right?

302
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,720
 They're constantly saying totally weird stuff. Borderline creepy stuff.

303
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:36,720
 What happens is this starts to escalate where Maggie and her husband are in bed, and all of a sudden they hear Joey screaming from his room.

304
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 And they get up and they run into the room, and thankfully Joey's just laying there in bed.

305
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:54,720
 But Joey says he can't sleep. I can't sleep, mom. I can't sleep. Whenever I close my eyes to fall asleep, Don shows up.

306
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,720
 And I'm trying to sleep, and he keeps tickling my toes. I want him to stop. I want to go to sleep.

307
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,720
 But he stands there at the edge of my bed, and he tickles my toes, and I can't sleep, and it makes me so mad.

308
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:14,720
 And this goes on for a while. Not just that night. This goes on for a while.

309
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:22,720
 Joey says when I'm trying to sleep, Don comes into the bedroom and tickles his toes, and he's doing it to irritate him.

310
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,720
 Joey just wants to get a good night's sleep. So eventually Joey starts sleeping with the parents.

311
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:38,720
 Well, one day Maggie and her husband get a notification from the real estate agent saying that they're going to have to leave the house.

312
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,720
 They're going to leave the house. This was a short-term rental, but it was a little shorter than they had planned.

313
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:54,720
 And what had happened was, while they were living there, the owner of the house passed away, and he'd passed away for about the past six months or so.

314
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:05,720
 And the family was deciding what to do with the property, but at this point, they've decided to sell it, and they're going to split the earnings, split the money from the house.

315
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:14,720
 So this family's going to have to find the new home, and they're totally fine with it. We'll go, we'll find some place else. Everything will be fine.

316
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
 And they do.

317
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,720
 And Don doesn't follow them to the new house.

318
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:34,720
 You could easily chalk this up to being an imaginary friend. You could even chalk this up to it being a ghost boy in the house.

319
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,720
 Being mistaken as an imaginary friend. We see so many stories like this. It could be a tulpa.

320
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,720
 The kid is imagining the friend. I don't know if children can create tulpas, honestly, but possibly.

321
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,720
 I mean, their imagination. They don't know what's real. Children don't.

322
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,720
 So maybe they're more likely to create tulpas.

323
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,720
 But anyways, you have a possibility that is a ghost mistaken for an imaginary friend.

324
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,720
 You have an imaginary friend, and the boy is imagining all of this.

325
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:10,720
 You have the kid having an imaginary friend he believed in so much it became a thought form. It could tickle him in the middle of the night. All sorts of stuff.

326
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,720
 But that's not the wrap up to the story, because there's something even weirder going on here.

327
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 What happens is, a while after they've moved out. This takes place a while after Maggie and Joey and the husband have left this house.

328
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:37,720
 Maggie comes across the news article from a local newspaper. Local news website. What have you.

329
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,720
 And it talked about Dawn.

330
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,720
 She's reading this article. Dawn was a real person.

331
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,720
 So what we were looking at was a ghost. But here's the weirdest part of all of this.

332
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,720
 And I've really been trying to think of another example of this.

333
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,720
 Dawn, that was the house he grew up in. He grew up in that house with a single mother.

334
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,720
 But Dawn died as an old man.

335
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,720
 Dawn was the owner of the house who died, not in the house.

336
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,720
 Dawn did not die in that house. Dawn died somewhere else.

337
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:45,720
 And for the six months between his death and them being told they had to move out, that was the six months when the family above them, not Maggie and Joey and the husband, the owners of the house, that family was deciding what to do with the house.

338
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:54,720
 And that coincides with the six months that Joey saw the child, Dawn.

339
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:04,720
 So what we're getting at is an elderly man. It doesn't necessarily say he's elderly, but obviously he has adult children.

340
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:15,720
 So Dawn's probably in his 60s or 70s, grew up in this household, raised by a single mother. He was a baby in that house and a kid in that house.

341
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,720
 And eventually he struck out on his own, but he always owned that house.

342
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:29,720
 He dies, but his ghost in that house is a little boy.

343
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:40,720
 I cannot think of another time we've come across this. I almost feel this episode is going to go a little bit long because I have a ton of stuff to say about this.

344
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
 This is such an interesting phenomenon.

345
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,720
 I will say this too. We'll go back to the hallway about him throwing the toys down the hallway.

346
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,720
 Generally if you're handling a toy to somebody that you like, that you're not scared of, you just hand it to him.

347
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:06,720
 The fact that he was throwing the toys down the hallway and then walking away murmuring makes me think that even Joey was a little off put by this phantom.

348
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:14,720
 Even Joey, even though he did interact with this dude, this little boy ghost who we find out later was a 70 year old man.

349
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,720
 It sounds like a Marlon Wayne's movie.

350
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,720
 He seemed to be scared of it.

351
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,720
 There's one other story I know of where kids were throwing toys to the ghost.

352
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 That was that terrifying one. I'll try to find it in the show notes, but it was on a military base.

353
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,720
 If I remember correctly, there was a house that burned down with a bunch of children in it.

354
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,720
 Or maybe they got brutally murdered by their dad. It was one of the two.

355
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:51,720
 Like four or five kids died and then right next to it, there was a daycare center. The two things didn't exist at the same time.

356
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,720
 This I think was an unused plot of land since the murder or the burning. It was one of the two or maybe both.

357
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,720
 The next thing was this daycare center and that was built later.

358
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,720
 The daycare kids would throw their toys over the fence to this unused piece of property.

359
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,720
 The teachers were like, "Dude, those toys cost money. Why do you keep throwing those over the fence?"

360
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,720
 The kids go because the children on the other side of the fence want to play with their toys too.

361
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,720
 The idea was the victims of whatever tragedy happened. They were still there and only the kids could see them.

362
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,720
 I believe those kids would have easily handed those toys to those kids if they could have.

363
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
 They had to throw them over the fence because that was the only way they could get them there.

364
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
 They didn't seem to be scared of those fandoms.

365
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:46,720
 The kids throwing the stuff down the hallway doesn't make it seem like Joey was not totally comfortable with Don.

366
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:56,720
 The idea that we have, like I've been trying to think of another phenomenon like this and the only one that I could come up with was the ending of Titanic.

367
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,720
 The other one was the old lady walking around on the boat being all old and stuff.

368
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,720
 Then when she died, she was super hot. Kate Winslet.

369
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,720
 I can't use that as evidence, right? I can't go, "Paranormal researchers, let's remember the haunting of the Titanic."

370
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
 They're like, "What are you talking about?"

371
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:31,720
 You had that. Listen, it would make sense that you wouldn't be a ghost in a wheelchair.

372
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:39,720
 Now that I think about it, I can't think of a time, I know there's haunted hospitals where you might hear the sound of the wheelchairs,

373
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:47,720
 but if you were paralyzed from the neck down and then you died, I don't think your ghost would be paralyzed from the neck down.

374
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,720
 I have nothing to back that up.

375
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:59,720
 I mean, there are stories of ghost peg-leg pirates that they make a clumpety-clump sound as they're walking around on their peg-leg.

376
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,720
 But see, now we're getting into the whole, because when I was telling this story to my friend Sabine, she goes,

377
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,720
 "Is it possible that this was like a residual recording type of ghost?"

378
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,720
 And that's why it's a little boy and not the old man as he died.

379
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,720
 And I go, "It's unlikely because it's interacting with these people."

380
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 The recording theory of ghosts, which I do think explains a lot of ghosts, is there's a strong emotional charge in an area,

381
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,720
 and a happy memory or a tragic memory is played over and over again.

382
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,720
 So that's why at 3 a.m. every so often you wake up in the middle of the night, you go to the fridge to get some leftover stuffin' from Thanksgiving,

383
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,720
 and you see a naked man standing in your doorway.

384
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
 Which I would always say default that there might actually be a real person.

385
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
 Don't go, "Well, that's a ghost."

386
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
 That guy, that obvious hobo who broke in, that's a ghost.

387
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,720
 But you know, at some point, a man died in his underwear in your living room,

388
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,720
 and so his ghost shows up, like almost as a recording.

389
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,720
 He was so depressed, he was so depressed, he's like, "Oh, I didn't die in my furry outfit.

390
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,720
 Oh, I'm gonna be remembered as an underwear ghost."

391
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,720
 But the fact that he was tickling them, the fact that they assumed to be some sort of conversation going on,

392
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,720
 like, "Give me your toys," and think, "Or can I play with your toys?"

393
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
 "Hey, Joey, you wanna play?"

394
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
 Makes me think it wasn't a recording.

395
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:26,720
 It's so fascinating though, because it does really open up to what you are as a ghost.

396
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,720
 We recently did an episode, "Why Aren't There A Lot Of Fat Ghosts?"

397
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,720
 When there's a lot of overweight people out there.

398
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:41,720
 And I would argue we don't have as many elderly people ghosts as we would assume was out there.

399
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,720
 Ghosts all seem to fall in an age range of child, you know, creepy child ghosts.

400
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,720
 All the way up, I mean, honestly, when you think about it, maybe to their 50s.

401
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,720
 We don't see a lot of stories of elderly ghosts dying on the toilet.

402
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,720
 And I think statistically that there should be a lot of them.

403
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,720
 So is it possible that when you're a ghost, whatever phenomenon creates ghosts,

404
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,720
 that you actually become what you wanna be?

405
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,720
 And that's what we were kind of talking about with the overweight ghosts.

406
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,720
 Like, is it possible that if you died, you're 350 pounds, you died?

407
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
 That's not how you saw yourself in life.

408
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,720
 That's how your physical representation was, but you always saw yourself as being different.

409
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,720
 Like I said, when I'm overweight, right? I'm like 290.

410
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,720
 I don't have dreams. I'm not fat in my dreams.

411
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,720
 So that's not how my mind sees my own body.

412
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,720
 So is it possible that when you die, if you become a ghost, and again,

413
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
 we don't know what that mechanism is, 'cause not everyone's a ghost,

414
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,720
 but is there something about you becoming how you see yourself?

415
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,720
 And then, or is it, I mean, again, here we have an old man, again, we don't have his age,

416
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,720
 but we're gonna assume he's 60s, 'cause he has adult children,

417
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,720
 who are trying to decide what happens to his house.

418
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,720
 And then he becomes a boy as a ghost.

419
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
 That's so fascinating. It's such a fascinating story.

420
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
 Again, if it's real, it could totally be made up.

421
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,720
 But it's such a fascinating story, 'cause it forces us to look at that question.

422
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,720
 What is aging vis-a-vis death?

423
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,720
 We do know that the body can age so much, it just stops working,

424
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,720
 but does your physical age correspond to your soul?

425
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,720
 How your soul will look?

426
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
 And we don't have the answer for that.

427
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,720
 We don't have the answer for so much.

428
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,720
 And it would be interesting, because remember, they sold the house and his family moved.

429
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
 Is Dawn's spirit still in this house?

430
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:47,720
 Is Dawn's spirit still this little boy interacting with other children living here?

431
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,720
 There's just so many unanswered questions, and there's so much for us to explore.

432
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
 And this one's a big question.

433
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,720
 And it would explain why we don't have a bunch of elderly ghosts floating around.

434
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,720
 'Cause that's not the form they're choosing.

435
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,720
 And then you really have to think,

436
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,720
 all of these children ghosts we do get reports of,

437
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
 how many of them are adults?

438
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,720
 Like, think about it, if you woke up in the middle of the night,

439
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,720
 and you saw a little boy, the ghost of a little boy, standing in the corner.

440
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,720
 He's standing in the opposite corner from the underwear, man.

441
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,720
 You see a little ghost boy standing in the corner,

442
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,720
 you, at this point you're having a heart attack, right?

443
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,720
 At this point you're just not, you're not even thinking about having things give me leftovers at this point.

444
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,720
 You're trying to keep from becoming a ghost yourself.

445
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,720
 But if you saw a little boy ghost, you know, huddled in the corner shivering,

446
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,720
 you're like, "Just why do you keep making it more creepy?"

447
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,720
 As you're clutching your chest.

448
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,720
 You would think like, "Wow, that would suck, right?"

449
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
 "A little boy ghost, he died as a little boy."

450
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
 But let me ask you, what's creepier?

451
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
 What's creepier?

452
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,720
 Having your house haunted by a little boy,

453
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,720
 or having your house haunted by a little boy who's actually a 38-year-old man.

454
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,720
 Because I figure as creepy as a little boy would be, like he could stand in the corner of the room,

455
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
 you gotta get bored of that.

456
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,720
 You turn him into an end table, you have like a little piece of wood bouncing on his head.

457
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,720
 Little boy, I mean, how, I mean, very worse than Dennis the Menace, right?

458
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,720
 He's breaking your windows, he's making your vases fly around and stuff like that.

459
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
 But a little boy can only do so much.

460
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,720
 Sure, you'd probably try to switch souls with one of your living kids, but other than that.

461
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,720
 But imagine the type of weirdness you would have.

462
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,720
 You had a little boy who actually had the mind of a 38-year-old man.

463
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,720
 Because then, man, he can get into some stuff, right?

464
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,720
 He's constantly like smoking cigarettes and drinking.

465
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,720
 He's smoking and he's smoking in your house, he's drinking.

466
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
 He's buying porn on pay-per-view.

467
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,720
 You're like, dude, what is going on?

468
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
 What is going on?

469
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,720
 You got a little ghost boy who has all of the weird mental hang-ups as a full-grown adult.

470
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
 Like, I think that would be the worst.

471
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,720
 I think it would make it creepier.

472
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,720
 And then, really, you gotta think about it, what if there's like a little girl in the woods?

473
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
 You're like, okay, that's enough.

474
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
 I'm leaving my house.

475
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,720
 You're like, get out of the way, get out of the way, man, in underwear.

476
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,720
 You walk in through the woods and you see a little girl with a jump rope going...

477
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,720
 (singing)

478
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,720
 And you're like, I need to move, I need to move, but I want to go check that out.

479
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
 And you go out there.

480
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,720
 What if that little girl is actually not a little girl creepily jumping...

481
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
 Jump rope?

482
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,720
 What if it's like a Malaysian war criminal or something like that?

483
00:37:51,720 --> 00:38:01,720
 Somebody died, some guy died in the 1940s as he was just killing people with a homemade machete in the middle of Malaysia.

484
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:10,720
 And then, he's like, I'm gonna be a little girl in Massachusetts and I'm just gonna stand in the woods, dude.

485
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
 You're like, you want this guy?

486
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,720
 This guy's the freakiest of them all.

487
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,720
 And you think about it, like, if you can choose your form as a ghost, which we don't know if it's true, right?

488
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
 We don't know if it's true.

489
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
 Then all bets are off.

490
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:35,720
 Because every time you see, like, a ghost doing something, it could be, like, a craziest man in the world, disguised as a little girl jump roping right outside your house.

491
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
 You're gonna run outside your house with a baseball bat.

492
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
 There's, like, real kids jump roping.

493
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
 You're like, yeah, get away from me, get away from me.

494
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
 Malaysian dictator.

495
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
 They're like, what?

496
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,720
 It really would make you question all of it.

497
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:57,720
 Because if some of it can happen, that beautiful girl, not little girl, that beautiful maiden, that civil war ghost that's dressed in the full gown, the antebellum gown,

498
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,720
 because her boyfriend got his brains blown out by a cannonball in Gettysburg.

499
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,720
 And she's like, oh no, I loved him so much.

500
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
 And then she jumps off a lighthouse, right?

501
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
 Super hot.

502
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,720
 You go to hang out with your own ghost tour.

503
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,720
 You show up at a ghost tour with roses and chocolates.

504
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
 They're like, what are you here?

505
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
 He's like, I'm here to woo the ghost.

506
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,720
 But then it turns out that that's like, it's an impersonator.

507
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,720
 It's not that hot chick.

508
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
 It's some, like, grandma.

509
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,720
 Some grandma who also died during some wars.

510
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,720
 She's like, oh no, I really was in love with that guy who fired the cannon.

511
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,720
 And the cannon blew up and killed my lover as well.

512
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,720
 But then, like, she's impersonating this beautiful maiden.

513
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,720
 I guess that wouldn't be so bad because then it's just an old lady who looks like a beautiful girl.

514
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,720
 That's going back to the whole Titanic thing.

515
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
 But what if it wasn't?

516
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,720
 What if you were trying to hook up with this super hot Civil War chick

517
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,720
 and then all of a sudden turned around and was Saddam Hussein.

518
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
 He was disguised.

519
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,720
 He was disguised as a beautiful ghost.

520
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
 I don't know.

521
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
 I don't know if that's possible.

522
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
 I just read this story.

523
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
 I just read this story and it's possible.

524
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,720
 This story is true that she could become an old, be an old man and become a little boy ghost.

525
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,720
 And really, you have to ask yourself, how many other times has this happened?

526
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,720
 Now, they're probably not a bunch of Malaysian warlords.

527
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,720
 Saddam Hussein is probably not currently in disguise in an antebellum dress.

528
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,720
 But prove me wrong.

529
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,720
 Prove me wrong because there are some hot ghosts out there.

530
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:40,720
 But I'm not willing to take that chance that it could be the third world dictator.

531
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,720
 That's how we end the first episode of Season 20.
