00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,800
 Can you smell terror?

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,400
 That's terror, like spooky stuff.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,600
 Damn my speech impediment.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,800
 And then we take a look at a hideous winged cryptid.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,600
 No one has the man-bat.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:55,000
 Is this winged cryptid currently stalking the city of Chicago today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I don't know, I'm a walkie-talkie.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Actually, I'm a walkie-talkie.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,400
 I'm having a great day.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,400
 We're gonna go ahead and just jump on into this again.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
 I got no news to talk about.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,000
 Everything's going pretty good.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,400
 I got a mouthful of nicotine lozenges.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
 And I'm feeling great.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,200
 So, let's go ahead and get started with the first story.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,600
 The first story is interesting because I've had this, I have a super super sensitive nose.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,800
 To the point that this might discuss some of you guys, but it's natural.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
 It's totally natural.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,800
 I remember I've always been able to do this, but I never was able to tell what the smell was.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,800
 As I got older and learned more about human biology, I started to figure it out.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 But especially when I was in high school, it happened a lot.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,000
 And especially in college, it happened a lot.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,600
 I would smell wet pennies every so often.

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,000
 I would smell iron-o-

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 It smelled like iron oxide or wet pennies would be another way to describe it.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And I can smell when a woman's on her period.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I can smell the blood.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,800
 And it was something that I kind of figured out, but I never wanted to be like,

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
 "Hey, you on the rag?"

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,600
 Like, I didn't want to really like say-

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,800
 So I never really had any confirmation until I was like maybe like 19 or 20.

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,400
 I did end up discussing it with a woman.

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,400
 I said, "Yeah, I can smell when a woman's on her period."

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
 And she's like, "Really?"

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
 I was like, "Yeah, it smells like pennies."

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,600
 And she's like, "Yeah, that's exactly what it is, dude. You're smelling it."

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
 I have a super sensitive nose.

48
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
 And again, I'm not saying like I can smell it while I'm in the shower.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
 Like I can be walking through Macy's and be like,

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,600
 "Oh, okay, so it's on their period in here. It's like really strong."

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,400
 And I don't- not trying to make women feel uncomfortable or anything like that.

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,000
 It's super rare for people to have such a sensitive nose.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,200
 Super, super rare.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,000
 But on the flip side of that, there have been times where I've walked into houses.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
 I remember this happened not too long ago.

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,000
 I was with a friend. We went over to another friend's house.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,800
 As we were driving back home, I remember going, "Are they having marriage troubles? Are they having troubles there?"

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,600
 And friends like, "I don't know. Like, I think everything's okay."

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,400
 And I'm like, "I think they're fighting a lot."

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,000
 And she goes, "How do you know?" And I'm like, "I just have a feeling."

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Because you walk into people's houses.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,400
 I can do this too. I can walk into someone's house and tell you how good your relationship is.

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,000
 Not because half the house is like full of video game stuff and the other house looks like it's out of better homes and garden.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Like, there's like a straight-up like schism in it.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,600
 I can go into your house and basically get a sense of how good your relationship is.

66
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,200
 Not through any sort of trickery, not through any sort of magic.

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
 I never really figured out how to do it until now.

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,000
 I think I found the mechanism behind it.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,400
 And this also plays a lot into ghosts and stuff like that as well.

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
 In 2015, they were in the Netherlands.

71
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
 There was a-- So we're going to the year 2015.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 We're in the Netherlands.

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,000
 And we are visiting Utrecht University, good old UU, home of the fighting boars.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,400
 And so Utrecht University did this study.

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,400
 And they go, "Hmm. I think as much as I crap on scientists, I think they'd actually kind of be kind of a funny job

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,400
 because you just come up with bizarre stuff and start running scenarios."

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
 They said, "Let's see what happens when we expose women to male sweat."

78
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
 But not just any male sweat, we're going to expose them to terror sweat.

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,400
 So they had-- They brought these guys in. They brought in 30 dudes and said,

80
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,400
 "Here, we're going to give you a clean shirt. Don't wear any deodorant. Nothing like that."

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
 Just come on over.

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,400
 Just something that serial killer does to prep his victims.

83
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
 But anyways, "I want you pure for the knife. I want you pure."

84
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,400
 But anyways, so these guys apparently have never seen hostile.

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
 They go to this place and they have to follow all the instructions.

86
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,400
 They're given a clean shirt and they're given little sweat pads underneath their armpits.

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
 And at that point, they're shown one of three videos.

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
 Either a scary video-- Well, I probably like the ring or something like that--

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
 The actual ring video and they're all dying. They're like,

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
 "Most of our participants died after seven days."

91
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
 They show them a happy video or they show them a neutral video.

92
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
 And through that little-- They put their sweat pads under there and it's not like them, they had them run a marathon.

93
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
 Just that little bit of sweat.

94
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
 They took each swab out, whether or not they were watching one of those three videos,

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 put it in a vial.

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
 A couple days later, they had these women show up and they had their heads resting.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
 Again, it's basically serial killer university.

98
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,400
 They had their heads locked into this little brace.

99
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
 So they couldn't move their heads.

100
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
 People are very trusting in the Netherlands.

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 And they brought-- They opened these vials up in front of the women.

102
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
 So they could get a whiff of this sweat.

103
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
 Now, some of the sweat smelled gross. Some of the sweat was a little B.O.-ish.

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
 Some of the sweat smelled kind of good.

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
 The guy had a good fruity flavor to them.

106
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
 And some of the sweat, you couldn't really sweat. You couldn't really smell it.

107
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
 But that's not what the scientists were looking for.

108
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,400
 They were looking and videotaping directly at the woman's face.

109
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,400
 And at the moment they got the first whiff of the vial,

110
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,400
 they recorded the subconscious facial reactions of the women.

111
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
 And this is what they found.

112
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,400
 Regardless of whether or not the B.O. was super stank or not,

113
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
 regardless of the actual smell.

114
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,400
 And this was a small sample size, but regardless of the actual smell,

115
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,400
 the women who were exposed to the neutral sweat had no real facial reaction.

116
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
 None of that subconscious facial reaction.

117
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,400
 But the women who were exposed to the fear sweat for a brief second,

118
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
 their face showed fear.

119
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
 I don't think their eyes went super wide like loony tunes,

120
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
 but for a brief second they looked like they were scared.

121
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
 And the women who were exposed to the happy smell,

122
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,400
 for a brief second, their face showed delight.

123
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
 And again, regardless of how stinky it was,

124
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
 they're like, "Oh my God, what does this guy eat? Asparagus every day?

125
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
 This is horrible!"

126
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,400
 But in that brief first second, they'd be like, "Puppies!"

127
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
 And so this is the thing.

128
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,400
 If your sweat can leave behind that sort of neurochemical trail,

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
 if you go into this house where there's domestic violence,

130
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
 where people are just beating each other up,

131
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,400
 they're leaving that fear and anger chemical in the air.

132
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
 And when you walk over, they're all dressed up,

133
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,400
 and they got dinner ready, and the television's showing Peppa Pig or whatever.

134
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
 Now these women also were more sensitive smellers,

135
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 so they were selected because they have a high sense of smell.

136
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
 So I think someone with a high sense of smell, like myself,

137
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
 could walk into a house and be like,

138
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
 "There's something really serious going on here."

139
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
 Someone's getting the shit kicked out of them here.

140
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,400
 And I can't put it in words, I just walk into the house and I'm like,

141
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
 "This house feels oppressive."

142
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
 It was probably how I would express it.

143
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
 I probably want to know in detail, but I'd walk in,

144
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,400
 and I would get that whiff of that terror scent.

145
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
 You walk into a house and everything's super lovey-dovey,

146
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
 you walk in and you're like, "This house feels like a home."

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,400
 This house feels like everyone inside loves each other.

148
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
 And this is why I think this is interesting.

149
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
 I always poo-poo on mediums.

150
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
 I think the idea of--

151
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 And we actually talked about this yesterday, too.

152
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
 This is kind of a callback to that.

153
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,400
 Imagine mediums don't have any sort of psychic powers,

154
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
 but they're just really sensitive smellers.

155
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
 So they can go into a house where oppressive acts have happened

156
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
 and they're like, "There is a dark foreboding in this house."

157
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
 But they don't know why they're having that feeling.

158
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
 And then yesterday I talked about the ghost of Wong

159
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
 and how I feel there may actually be a ghost there,

160
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
 but someone created a story about that.

161
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
 I think it's more likely that mediums have no magical powers,

162
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,400
 but they might just be super sensitive smellers.

163
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
 And they walk into a house and they're like,

164
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,400
 "Their first reaction is something wrong is here."

165
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,400
 And then they make up a story to explain why it's wrong.

166
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
 It's a completely natural reaction.

167
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,400
 You walk into a house and you're like, "This house feels troubled."

168
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
 Maybe an old-timey guy here chopped the head off his wife,

169
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,400
 and his wife is still floating around the basement,

170
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
 because they're trying to explain that initial feeling they have.

171
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 But I would also argue that I think most people--

172
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
 They got the sensitive smellers for this one,

173
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
 most people, whether or not you know it,

174
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
 pick up on the smells of other humans.

175
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
 I think the sense of smell is completely underrated.

176
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
 So when you meet a person and they seem creepy,

177
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
 or they seem--

178
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
 and you haven't really talked to them, you're drawn to them,

179
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
 or you want to stay away from them,

180
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,400
 it's most likely their sense.

181
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,400
 It's most likely you aren't necessarily being attracted to them

182
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,400
 or being warned away from them because of anything you can really explain.

183
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,400
 It's probably the chemical that they're putting out,

184
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
 that you're picking up slightly,

185
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,400
 and your body's either saying, "This guy's into some weirdo stuff."

186
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,400
 Stay away from him, you're going to end up in his murder basement,

187
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,400
 with your head locked into a brace having you smell sweat

188
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
 until he cuts your organs out, or--

189
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
 or he's giving off happy chemicals.

190
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
 You're like, "Oh, this guy-- I think I could--

191
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 I think I could chill with this dude, he's pretty cool."

192
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
 I think the nose is completely underrated.

193
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
 I think this study proves that.

194
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,400
 And I think it may also help disprove or debunk

195
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,400
 the idea of walking into a house and sensing ghosts.

196
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
 Now we're leaving the Netherlands.

197
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
 By Netherlands, we wave, and they're all waving,

198
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
 they got huge pit stains underneath their shirts,

199
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
 because they just can't stop running these tests.

200
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
 We're coming to America.

201
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,400
 Most specifically, we're coming to the states bordering Lake Michigan.

202
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
 And some of them-- my geography's not all that good,

203
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 but we're in that general area, so you might be like,

204
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
 "That state's not near Lake Michigan, we're in that general area,

205
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
 just go with me on this."

206
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
 Because this creature doesn't really care about boundaries,

207
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
 doesn't really care about state lines.

208
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
 And I think it's interesting,

209
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
 because a lot of times we talk about cryptids in the forest,

210
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
 a lot of times we talk about cryptids in the jungle,

211
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,400
 cryptids in the desert, but what about a cryptid in the air?

212
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
 Not a lot of them.

213
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
 Find them fascinating.

214
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
 1969.

215
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
 We're in the town of Rowling Prairie,

216
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
 which is an oxymoron, Rowling Prairie, Indiana.

217
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
 There's a family living in a trailer.

218
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
 Unnamed family, by the way.

219
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
 Actually, it might be named. I might not just wrote it down.

220
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,400
 But anyways, this family's living in a trailer.

221
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,400
 A recent storm ripped a hole in the roof of the trailer.

222
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,400
 So it's-- I don't know why people live--

223
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 I don't mind people living in trailers, I think it's totally fine.

224
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,400
 But I don't understand why you live in a trailer in Tornado Alley,

225
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
 or anywhere where there's any sort of high wind.

226
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
 But anyways, so these people are living in a trailer,

227
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,400
 in a place where wind can rip the roof off your house at any moment.

228
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
 And they haven't gotten it fixed yet.

229
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
 Probably never will.

230
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
 So they put a blue tarp over the hole.

231
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
 And now this is a sizable hole.

232
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
 It's not like a little, like, "Oh, look it, I can see the sunlight."

233
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 It's like, "Oh, look, I can see the entire sun,

234
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
 and the flames shooting off the side of it."

235
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
 From my living room.

236
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
 So anyways, there's this giant hole in their roof.

237
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
 They cover it up with a blue tarp.

238
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
 Which would be-- how do you sleep with that?

239
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
 Every night, it'd be like, "Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft."

240
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
 Plus the bugs.

241
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
 But anyways, they're sleeping in their trailer.

242
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
 Blue tarp, covered up the hole.

243
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
 Mom, Dad, Grandma,

244
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
 little boy, little girl, all living in this trailer.

245
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 I'm sure it was a double white.

246
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
 One night, the boy's sleeping.

247
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,400
 [snoring]

248
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
 The can't sleep because the tarp keeps hitting the top,

249
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
 the wind's just driving him nuts.

250
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
 Little boy.

251
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
 Parents are asleep, baby sisters asleep,

252
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
 Grandma's asleep.

253
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,400
 So the little boy's sharing a bedroom with his baby sister.

254
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
 So her crib's in the bedroom, he's laying in bed.

255
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,400
 [snoring]

256
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
 Here's the tarp.

257
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
 [snoring]

258
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
 Doesn't hear the tarp anymore.

259
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,400
 Just laying in bed, wide awake.

260
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,400
 The sound that was keeping him awake is now absent,

261
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
 and he finds it a little more terrifying.

262
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,400
 And then he smells something.

263
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,400
 Not terror sweat, not happy sweat,

264
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
 something beast-like,

265
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
 something old and wet and inhuman.

266
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,400
 He rolls over in his bed, looking towards his sister's crib.

267
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,400
 And that's when he sees it, standing in the darkness.

268
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
 He described it as seven to eight feet tall,

269
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
 covered everywhere in hair.

270
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,400
 Huge, leathery wings.

271
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
 [exhaling]

272
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
 And then he's touched to its back.

273
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,400
 Massive arms and legs, skinny little torso.

274
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,400
 Kind of looked like a moth would if he was hitting the gym.

275
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
 He described this as I thought was,

276
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
 so that description in and of itself,

277
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
 you're like, it's kind of like a big old bat,

278
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
 like a muscular bat.

279
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
 Bat who doesn't skip leg day,

280
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
 but when he discovered a tiny little torso.

281
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
 And the way he describes it, I thought was chilling,

282
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
 he says, "It looked like a hum-

283
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,400
 the torso in the head looked like a human skeleton

284
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
 with sharp teeth,

285
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 but the sound it made

286
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,400
 [exhaling]

287
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
 I don't know if that's the actual sound it made,

288
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
 but he described it as a low garbled sound.

289
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
 He's in this room, he immediately begins screaming,

290
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
 and his grandma runs into the room.

291
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
 The creature then turns to the boy,

292
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
 picks him up in these huge powerful arms,

293
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,400
 and starts running through the trailer

294
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
 and shoots out the top of the roof.

295
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
 Shoots out through the hole.

296
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
 Grandma's screaming.

297
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
 Parents?

298
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
 Dead asleep.

299
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,400
 What's weird is that there's a gap in the story at this point,

300
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
 where the boy says,

301
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
 he survived to tell the tale,

302
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
 he says, "The next thing I know,

303
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
 I was on the roof of the trailer,

304
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
 out in the cold."

305
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
 The parent said,

306
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 "We woke up because we heard something loud

307
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
 hit the roof of the trailer."

308
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
 They jumped up and they found their son

309
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
 on the top of the trailer, unconscious.

310
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
 The grandma said,

311
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
 "A giant bat just flew out of here.

312
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
 Like, just picked up your son, my grandson."

313
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
 Which obviously, but

314
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
 grabbed the kid, ran, and took off.

315
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
 And the boy was up there.

316
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
 So you had two witnesses.

317
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,400
 You had the grandma and the boy who both saw this creature.

318
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
 Now, they didn't call the cops,

319
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
 which is a little suspicious,

320
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
 but I'm wondering if there was something else going on

321
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
 in that trailer, drinking or something like that,

322
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
 or drug use.

323
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
 You're going to call the cops!

324
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,400
 If a giant bat tries to steal your kid,

325
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
 you're going to call the cops

326
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
 if a tiny bat tries to steal your kid.

327
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
 But they didn't call the cops.

328
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
 This story only came to light

329
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
 years and years later when he told this story.

330
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
 So there's a little bit of a suspect to it.

331
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
 He could just be making it up and saying,

332
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
 "Oh yeah, my grandma saw it."

333
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
 And they're like, "Okay, we interview her."

334
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 And they're like, "Nah, she's dead."

335
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
 But he tells the story later.

336
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,400
 Now, this is what I thought was funny.

337
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,400
 Other than the child abduction by a giant man bat.

338
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
 He had this horrible experience as a kid.

339
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
 He didn't forget about it.

340
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
 He remembered it all his life.

341
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
 And then the movie The Mothman Chronicles came out,

342
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,400
 starring Richard Geer, came out like in the late 2000s.

343
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
 And he goes to see it!

344
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
 Now, generally, if you get mugged,

345
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
 you're not going to go watch Menace the Society

346
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
 when it comes out.

347
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
 You're going to be like, "Nah, I'm good.

348
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
 I don't need to see that."

349
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
 But he goes to see it.

350
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
 He gets abducted by a man bat.

351
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
 And then he goes to watch The Mothman Chronicles.

352
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,400
 And he ran out of the theater.

353
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
 He got totally scared.

354
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
 And then they have this quote in this article.

355
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
 "He literally had to leave during the scene

356
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,400
 where the Mothman caused the automobile crash and death.

357
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
 He has not attempted to watch the film since then."

358
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
 No, duh!

359
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,400
 Really, dude, why does this article have to add that last sentence?

360
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
 Of course he doesn't want to watch it again!

361
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,400
 He got abducted by a Mothman type creature.

362
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
 But anyways, they felt the need to include that quote

363
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
 like he has not watched the film since.

364
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
 Of course he hasn't.

365
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
 Of course he hasn't.

366
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
 Again, you go through a traumatic event.

367
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
 You're not going to be like, "Hey, what do you want to watch?"

368
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
 I don't know.

369
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
 Let's watch Irreversible.

370
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
 Like, you're just going to stay away from movies

371
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
 that replicate the crime that you are part of,

372
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
 that you are a victim of.

373
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
 So anyways, that's not really notable,

374
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
 but they wanted to notate on this website.

375
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,400
 So, I read that story and I was like,

376
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
 "That's probably not true."

377
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
 I've been in a lot of trailers in my life.

378
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,400
 I've never found one that an 8-foot-tall creature

379
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
 could walk through naturally.

380
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,400
 I've never found one that really anyone over 6 feet tall

381
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
 could walk through naturally.

382
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
 I've never...

383
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
 I don't think they could support the weight of a creature

384
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 that was 8 feet tall running around.

385
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
 I think the fact that he...

386
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
 they dropped him on the roof was bizarre.

387
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
 Like, there was a lot of stuff...

388
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
 The parents not waking up.

389
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,400
 The theory was that the creature hypnotized them.

390
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
 Then why wasn't the grandma hypnotized?

391
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
 Why wasn't he hypnotized?

392
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
 So the story didn't really...

393
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
 I was like, I read it and I was kind of like,

394
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
 "I don't think it's true."

395
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
 Then I decided to look up some more stuff.

396
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,400
 In the Lake Michigan area.

397
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,400
 In that whole general area of the United States.

398
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
 What are those states called?

399
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,400
 We have the West Coast and the South and the East Coast.

400
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
 And then we have the Northwest.

401
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
 Then we have Central America.

402
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
 Wait, no, no, that's a different place.

403
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
 But you know what I mean?

404
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
 Like, the Great Lakes area?

405
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,400
 Like, anyway, so that whole area up there,

406
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,400
 there's been a lot of sightings of a man-bat creature.

407
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,400
 Or sometimes it's described as a giant insect-like creature.

408
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
 Which I think this one, even though he was giant and furry,

409
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
 I think the tiny body makes it does seem kind of insectoid.

410
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
 But I start looking through these different incidents

411
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
 and I was like, "Oh, these people see it flying through here."

412
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
 And I was like, "Oh, that could probably be explained.

413
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
 It could probably just be a big old bug."

414
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
 And I keep looking and I was like, "Oh, at a certain point,

415
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,400
 I'm trying to find nothing."

416
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,400
 Because I had already made my mind up that this story was fake.

417
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
 And I still...

418
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
 I'm not 100% on it.

419
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
 But I kept finding,

420
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
 sighting after sighting after sighting after sighting

421
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,400
 of these creatures to the point in 2017,

422
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
 in 2017 alone in the city,

423
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
 in just the city of Chicago,

424
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 29 sightings of a man-bat creature.

425
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 By dozens of witnesses.

426
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,400
 Police officers, news reporters,

427
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
 people just walking down the street.

428
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
 They saw one jumping off of the Sears Tower,

429
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
 like doing a swan dive and then fly through the city.

430
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400
 People had seen them on the outskirts of Chicago.

431
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
 People have seen them within the streets of Chicago

432
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
 flying around.

433
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
 Reports of them shape-shifting,

434
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
 of seeing humans all of a sudden growing wings

435
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,400
 and taking off and flying off into the city.

436
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
 Report after report after report.

437
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
 And at a certain point,

438
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,400
 there have been times where a bigfoot has been sighted in an area

439
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
 and then all of a sudden there's a ton of bigfoot sightings.

440
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
 And you have to go, those are probably fake.

441
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 Like either that original person was the first person to see bigfoot in the area

442
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
 or everyone else now is mistaking everything for bigfoot.

443
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
 But these man-bat sightings aren't super publicized.

444
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
 It's not like one person sees the man-bat and is all over the news.

445
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,400
 This 1969 story is way too far back for it to be a viral sensation.

446
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,400
 People, ordinary people, are seen just in the city of Chicago 29 times.

447
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,400
 A giant, bigger than a human flying creature going through the city.

448
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
 Absolutely bizarre.

449
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,400
 And I think it's interesting because when we think of cryptids,

450
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
 they're hidden.

451
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
 They're, like I was saying in my intro, they're deep in remote areas.

452
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,400
 Very rarely do you have, almost never do you have cryptids in super inhabited areas.

453
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
 Could be fake.

454
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
 Could just be a lot of people thinking that they're seeing a giant flying guy.

455
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:17,400
 But if it's real, if this is a real cryptid, what's interesting about this story is that,

456
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,400
 you know how we build houses and we start to encroach on the natural habitat of mountain lions.

457
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,400
 Then mountain to lion start walking, we had a mountain lion walking through the city of Hood River a couple months ago.

458
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
 Or cougar, whatever, whatever the difference was.

459
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
 I think it was mountain lion.

460
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
 But anyways, it was walking by an elementary school.

461
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,400
 Because humanity keeps encroaching on their territory and they're like, well, screw it.

462
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,400
 If I can't find food out here, I'm going to go into your neighborhood and find some food.

463
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
 What if the same thing is going to happen with cryptids?

464
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,400
 What if as we spread out and start knocking down their natural habitat,

465
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
 they start coming to where we're at?

466
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 We cut down enough forest and eventually bigfoot's like, this sucks.

467
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,400
 Can't find any more fish, can't eat any more deer.

468
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
 I'm just going to go into this neighborhood.

469
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
 What happens when we start building apartment buildings where the melon heads live?

470
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,400
 And they're just like, ah, they're trying to apply for a loan.

471
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,400
 They all just stack up on each other wearing a trench coat, filling out paperwork.

472
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,400
 That's one scenario.

473
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
 That's one scenario.

474
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,400
 That we're basically cutting into their environments and we're going to be seeing more and more cryptids in the cities and in the suburbs.

475
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
 But there's another theory as well.

476
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,400
 What if the man bat, if it exists, let's assume that it exists for a second.

477
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,400
 What if the man bat says, hmm,

478
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 "My species have always lived in the wilderness and we've always hunted lone stragglers.

479
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,400
 People lost in the woods that disappear.

480
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,400
 Hitchhikers on a dark stretch of night looking for a ride, they disappear.

481
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
 Small family picnicking.

482
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
 One kid goes running off, never find the kid again.

483
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,400
 And that has satiated my species for a long time.

484
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,400
 But now is the time to no longer just eat.

485
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
 Now is the time to feast.

486
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:18,400
 Now is the time to hunt humans, where I know there's a lot of them.

487
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,400
 And you have this creature patrolling the skies of Chicago, looking for its next male.

488
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,400
 A hiker goes missing in the middle of the woods.

489
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
 People are going to go looking for him.

490
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,400
 A young prostitute disappears in the streets of Chicago.

491
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
 They're going to look for her.

492
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,400
 But at a certain point, they're just going to figure the city swallowed her up.

493
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:49,400
 It's far easier to feed on prey in a city where people easily just disappear.
