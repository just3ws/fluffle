 Can you smell terror?

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.400
 That's terror, like spooky stuff.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.600
 Damn my speech impediment.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.800
 And then we take a look at a hideous winged cryptid.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.600
 No one has the man-bat.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.000
 Is this winged cryptid currently stalking the city of Chicago today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 I don't know, I'm a walkie-talkie.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Actually, I'm a walkie-talkie.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.400
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.400
 We're gonna go ahead and just jump on into this again.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 I got no news to talk about.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.000
 Everything's going pretty good.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.400
 I got a mouthful of nicotine lozenges.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 And I'm feeling great.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.200
 So, let's go ahead and get started with the first story.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.600
 The first story is interesting because I've had this, I have a super super sensitive nose.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.800
 To the point that this might discuss some of you guys, but it's natural.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 It's totally natural.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 I remember I've always been able to do this, but I never was able to tell what the smell was.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 As I got older and learned more about human biology, I started to figure it out.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 But especially when I was in high school, it happened a lot.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.000
 And especially in college, it happened a lot.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.600
 I would smell wet pennies every so often.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.000
 I would smell iron-o-

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 It smelled like iron oxide or wet pennies would be another way to describe it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And I can smell when a woman's on her period.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 I can smell the blood.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.800
 And it was something that I kind of figured out, but I never wanted to be like,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800
 "Hey, you on the rag?"

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.600
 Like, I didn't want to really like say-

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.800
 So I never really had any confirmation until I was like maybe like 19 or 20.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.400
 I did end up discussing it with a woman.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.400
 I said, "Yeah, I can smell when a woman's on her period."

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 And she's like, "Really?"

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
 I was like, "Yeah, it smells like pennies."

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.600
 And she's like, "Yeah, that's exactly what it is, dude. You're smelling it."

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 I have a super sensitive nose.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 And again, I'm not saying like I can smell it while I'm in the shower.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 Like I can be walking through Macy's and be like,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.600
 "Oh, okay, so it's on their period in here. It's like really strong."

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.400
 And I don't- not trying to make women feel uncomfortable or anything like that.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.000
 It's super rare for people to have such a sensitive nose.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.200
 Super, super rare.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.000
 But on the flip side of that, there have been times where I've walked into houses.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.800
 I remember this happened not too long ago.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.000
 I was with a friend. We went over to another friend's house.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 As we were driving back home, I remember going, "Are they having marriage troubles? Are they having troubles there?"

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.600
 And friends like, "I don't know. Like, I think everything's okay."

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.400
 And I'm like, "I think they're fighting a lot."

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.000
 And she goes, "How do you know?" And I'm like, "I just have a feeling."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Because you walk into people's houses.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.400
 I can do this too. I can walk into someone's house and tell you how good your relationship is.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.000
 Not because half the house is like full of video game stuff and the other house looks like it's out of better homes and garden.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Like, there's like a straight-up like schism in it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.600
 I can go into your house and basically get a sense of how good your relationship is.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.200
 Not through any sort of trickery, not through any sort of magic.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.400
 I never really figured out how to do it until now.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.000
 I think I found the mechanism behind it.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.400
 And this also plays a lot into ghosts and stuff like that as well.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.400
 In 2015, they were in the Netherlands.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400
 There was a-- So we're going to the year 2015.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.400
 We're in the Netherlands.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.000
 And we are visiting Utrecht University, good old UU, home of the fighting boars.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.400
 And so Utrecht University did this study.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.400
 And they go, "Hmm. I think as much as I crap on scientists, I think they'd actually kind of be kind of a funny job

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.400
 because you just come up with bizarre stuff and start running scenarios."

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.400
 They said, "Let's see what happens when we expose women to male sweat."

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 But not just any male sweat, we're going to expose them to terror sweat.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.400
 So they had-- They brought these guys in. They brought in 30 dudes and said,

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 "Here, we're going to give you a clean shirt. Don't wear any deodorant. Nothing like that."

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400
 Just come on over.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.400
 Just something that serial killer does to prep his victims.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 But anyways, "I want you pure for the knife. I want you pure."

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 But anyways, so these guys apparently have never seen hostile.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.400
 They go to this place and they have to follow all the instructions.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 They're given a clean shirt and they're given little sweat pads underneath their armpits.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 And at that point, they're shown one of three videos.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.400
 Either a scary video-- Well, I probably like the ring or something like that--

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.400
 The actual ring video and they're all dying. They're like,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.400
 "Most of our participants died after seven days."

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.400
 They show them a happy video or they show them a neutral video.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.400
 And through that little-- They put their sweat pads under there and it's not like them, they had them run a marathon.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.400
 Just that little bit of sweat.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400
 They took each swab out, whether or not they were watching one of those three videos,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 put it in a vial.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.400
 A couple days later, they had these women show up and they had their heads resting.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 Again, it's basically serial killer university.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.400
 They had their heads locked into this little brace.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.400
 So they couldn't move their heads.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 People are very trusting in the Netherlands.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.400
 And they brought-- They opened these vials up in front of the women.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.400
 So they could get a whiff of this sweat.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.400
 Now, some of the sweat smelled gross. Some of the sweat was a little B.O.-ish.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.400
 Some of the sweat smelled kind of good.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.400
 The guy had a good fruity flavor to them.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 And some of the sweat, you couldn't really sweat. You couldn't really smell it.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400
 But that's not what the scientists were looking for.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.400
 They were looking and videotaping directly at the woman's face.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.400
 And at the moment they got the first whiff of the vial,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.400
 they recorded the subconscious facial reactions of the women.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.400
 And this is what they found.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.400
 Regardless of whether or not the B.O. was super stank or not,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.400
 regardless of the actual smell.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.400
 And this was a small sample size, but regardless of the actual smell,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.400
 the women who were exposed to the neutral sweat had no real facial reaction.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.400
 None of that subconscious facial reaction.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.400
 But the women who were exposed to the fear sweat for a brief second,

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.400
 their face showed fear.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 I don't think their eyes went super wide like loony tunes,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.400
 but for a brief second they looked like they were scared.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.400
 And the women who were exposed to the happy smell,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.400
 for a brief second, their face showed delight.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.400
 And again, regardless of how stinky it was,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.400
 they're like, "Oh my God, what does this guy eat? Asparagus every day?

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.400
 This is horrible!"

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.400
 But in that brief first second, they'd be like, "Puppies!"

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.400
 And so this is the thing.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.400
 If your sweat can leave behind that sort of neurochemical trail,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.400
 if you go into this house where there's domestic violence,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.400
 where people are just beating each other up,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.400
 they're leaving that fear and anger chemical in the air.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.400
 And when you walk over, they're all dressed up,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.400
 and they got dinner ready, and the television's showing Peppa Pig or whatever.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.400
 Now these women also were more sensitive smellers,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.400
 so they were selected because they have a high sense of smell.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.400
 So I think someone with a high sense of smell, like myself,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.400
 could walk into a house and be like,

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.400
 "There's something really serious going on here."

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.400
 Someone's getting the shit kicked out of them here.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.400
 And I can't put it in words, I just walk into the house and I'm like,

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.400
 "This house feels oppressive."

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.400
 It was probably how I would express it.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.400
 I probably want to know in detail, but I'd walk in,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.400
 and I would get that whiff of that terror scent.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.400
 You walk into a house and everything's super lovey-dovey,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.400
 you walk in and you're like, "This house feels like a home."

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.400
 This house feels like everyone inside loves each other.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.400
 And this is why I think this is interesting.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.400
 I always poo-poo on mediums.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400
 I think the idea of--

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.400
 And we actually talked about this yesterday, too.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400
 This is kind of a callback to that.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.400
 Imagine mediums don't have any sort of psychic powers,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.400
 but they're just really sensitive smellers.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.400
 So they can go into a house where oppressive acts have happened

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.400
 and they're like, "There is a dark foreboding in this house."

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.400
 But they don't know why they're having that feeling.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.400
 And then yesterday I talked about the ghost of Wong

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.400
 and how I feel there may actually be a ghost there,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.400
 but someone created a story about that.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.400
 I think it's more likely that mediums have no magical powers,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.400
 but they might just be super sensitive smellers.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.400
 And they walk into a house and they're like,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.400
 "Their first reaction is something wrong is here."

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.400
 And then they make up a story to explain why it's wrong.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.400
 It's a completely natural reaction.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.400
 You walk into a house and you're like, "This house feels troubled."

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.400
 Maybe an old-timey guy here chopped the head off his wife,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.400
 and his wife is still floating around the basement,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.400
 because they're trying to explain that initial feeling they have.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.400
 But I would also argue that I think most people--

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.400
 They got the sensitive smellers for this one,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.400
 most people, whether or not you know it,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.400
 pick up on the smells of other humans.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.400
 I think the sense of smell is completely underrated.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.400
 So when you meet a person and they seem creepy,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400
 or they seem--

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.400
 and you haven't really talked to them, you're drawn to them,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.400
 or you want to stay away from them,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.400
 it's most likely their sense.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.400
 It's most likely you aren't necessarily being attracted to them

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.400
 or being warned away from them because of anything you can really explain.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.400
 It's probably the chemical that they're putting out,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.400
 that you're picking up slightly,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.400
 and your body's either saying, "This guy's into some weirdo stuff."

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.400
 Stay away from him, you're going to end up in his murder basement,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.400
 with your head locked into a brace having you smell sweat

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.400
 until he cuts your organs out, or--

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.400
 or he's giving off happy chemicals.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.400
 You're like, "Oh, this guy-- I think I could--

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.400
 I think I could chill with this dude, he's pretty cool."

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.400
 I think the nose is completely underrated.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.400
 I think this study proves that.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.400
 And I think it may also help disprove or debunk

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.400
 the idea of walking into a house and sensing ghosts.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.400
 Now we're leaving the Netherlands.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.400
 By Netherlands, we wave, and they're all waving,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.400
 they got huge pit stains underneath their shirts,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.400
 because they just can't stop running these tests.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.400
 We're coming to America.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.400
 Most specifically, we're coming to the states bordering Lake Michigan.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.400
 And some of them-- my geography's not all that good,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.400
 but we're in that general area, so you might be like,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.400
 "That state's not near Lake Michigan, we're in that general area,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.400
 just go with me on this."

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.400
 Because this creature doesn't really care about boundaries,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.400
 doesn't really care about state lines.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.400
 And I think it's interesting,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.400
 because a lot of times we talk about cryptids in the forest,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.400
 a lot of times we talk about cryptids in the jungle,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.400
 cryptids in the desert, but what about a cryptid in the air?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.400
 Not a lot of them.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400
 Find them fascinating.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.400
 1969.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.400
 We're in the town of Rowling Prairie,

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.400
 which is an oxymoron, Rowling Prairie, Indiana.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.400
 There's a family living in a trailer.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.400
 Unnamed family, by the way.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.400
 Actually, it might be named. I might not just wrote it down.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.400
 But anyways, this family's living in a trailer.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.400
 A recent storm ripped a hole in the roof of the trailer.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.400
 So it's-- I don't know why people live--

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400
 I don't mind people living in trailers, I think it's totally fine.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.400
 But I don't understand why you live in a trailer in Tornado Alley,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.400
 or anywhere where there's any sort of high wind.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400
 But anyways, so these people are living in a trailer,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.400
 in a place where wind can rip the roof off your house at any moment.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.400
 And they haven't gotten it fixed yet.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.400
 Probably never will.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.400
 So they put a blue tarp over the hole.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.400
 And now this is a sizable hole.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.400
 It's not like a little, like, "Oh, look it, I can see the sunlight."

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.400
 It's like, "Oh, look, I can see the entire sun,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.400
 and the flames shooting off the side of it."

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.400
 From my living room.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.400
 So anyways, there's this giant hole in their roof.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.400
 They cover it up with a blue tarp.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.400
 Which would be-- how do you sleep with that?

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.400
 Every night, it'd be like, "Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft."

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.400
 Plus the bugs.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.400
 But anyways, they're sleeping in their trailer.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.400
 Blue tarp, covered up the hole.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.400
 Mom, Dad, Grandma,

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.400
 little boy, little girl, all living in this trailer.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.400
 I'm sure it was a double white.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.400
 One night, the boy's sleeping.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.400
 [snoring]

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.400
 The can't sleep because the tarp keeps hitting the top,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.400
 the wind's just driving him nuts.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400
 Little boy.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.400
 Parents are asleep, baby sisters asleep,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.400
 Grandma's asleep.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.400
 So the little boy's sharing a bedroom with his baby sister.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.400
 So her crib's in the bedroom, he's laying in bed.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.400
 [snoring]

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.400
 Here's the tarp.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.400
 [snoring]

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.400
 Doesn't hear the tarp anymore.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.400
 Just laying in bed, wide awake.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.400
 The sound that was keeping him awake is now absent,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.400
 and he finds it a little more terrifying.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.400
 And then he smells something.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.400
 Not terror sweat, not happy sweat,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.400
 something beast-like,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.400
 something old and wet and inhuman.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.400
 He rolls over in his bed, looking towards his sister's crib.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.400
 And that's when he sees it, standing in the darkness.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.400
 He described it as seven to eight feet tall,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.400
 covered everywhere in hair.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.400
 Huge, leathery wings.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.400
 [exhaling]

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.400
 And then he's touched to its back.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.400
 Massive arms and legs, skinny little torso.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.400
 Kind of looked like a moth would if he was hitting the gym.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.400
 He described this as I thought was,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.400
 so that description in and of itself,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.400
 you're like, it's kind of like a big old bat,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.400
 like a muscular bat.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.400
 Bat who doesn't skip leg day,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.400
 but when he discovered a tiny little torso.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.400
 And the way he describes it, I thought was chilling,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.400
 he says, "It looked like a hum-

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.400
 the torso in the head looked like a human skeleton

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.400
 with sharp teeth,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.400
 but the sound it made

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.400
 [exhaling]

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.400
 I don't know if that's the actual sound it made,

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.400
 but he described it as a low garbled sound.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.400
 He's in this room, he immediately begins screaming,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.400
 and his grandma runs into the room.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.400
 The creature then turns to the boy,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.400
 picks him up in these huge powerful arms,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.400
 and starts running through the trailer

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.400
 and shoots out the top of the roof.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.400
 Shoots out through the hole.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.400
 Grandma's screaming.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.400
 Parents?

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.400
 Dead asleep.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.400
 What's weird is that there's a gap in the story at this point,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.400
 where the boy says,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.400
 he survived to tell the tale,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.400
 he says, "The next thing I know,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.400
 I was on the roof of the trailer,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.400
 out in the cold."

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.400
 The parent said,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.400
 "We woke up because we heard something loud

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.400
 hit the roof of the trailer."

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.400
 They jumped up and they found their son

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.400
 on the top of the trailer, unconscious.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.400
 The grandma said,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.400
 "A giant bat just flew out of here.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.400
 Like, just picked up your son, my grandson."

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.400
 Which obviously, but

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.400
 grabbed the kid, ran, and took off.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.400
 And the boy was up there.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.400
 So you had two witnesses.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.400
 You had the grandma and the boy who both saw this creature.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.400
 Now, they didn't call the cops,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.400
 which is a little suspicious,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.400
 but I'm wondering if there was something else going on

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.400
 in that trailer, drinking or something like that,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400
 or drug use.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.400
 You're going to call the cops!

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.400
 If a giant bat tries to steal your kid,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.400
 you're going to call the cops

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.400
 if a tiny bat tries to steal your kid.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400
 But they didn't call the cops.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.400
 This story only came to light

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.400
 years and years later when he told this story.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.400
 So there's a little bit of a suspect to it.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.400
 He could just be making it up and saying,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400
 "Oh yeah, my grandma saw it."

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400
 And they're like, "Okay, we interview her."

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400
 And they're like, "Nah, she's dead."

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.400
 But he tells the story later.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.400
 Now, this is what I thought was funny.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.400
 Other than the child abduction by a giant man bat.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.400
 He had this horrible experience as a kid.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.400
 He didn't forget about it.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.400
 He remembered it all his life.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.400
 And then the movie The Mothman Chronicles came out,

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.400
 starring Richard Geer, came out like in the late 2000s.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.400
 And he goes to see it!

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.400
 Now, generally, if you get mugged,

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.400
 you're not going to go watch Menace the Society

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400
 when it comes out.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.400
 You're going to be like, "Nah, I'm good.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.400
 I don't need to see that."

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.400
 But he goes to see it.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.400
 He gets abducted by a man bat.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.400
 And then he goes to watch The Mothman Chronicles.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.400
 And he ran out of the theater.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.400
 He got totally scared.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.400
 And then they have this quote in this article.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.400
 "He literally had to leave during the scene

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.400
 where the Mothman caused the automobile crash and death.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.400
 He has not attempted to watch the film since then."

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400
 No, duh!

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.400
 Really, dude, why does this article have to add that last sentence?

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.400
 Of course he doesn't want to watch it again!

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.400
 He got abducted by a Mothman type creature.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.400
 But anyways, they felt the need to include that quote

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.400
 like he has not watched the film since.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.400
 Of course he hasn't.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.400
 Of course he hasn't.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.400
 Again, you go through a traumatic event.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.400
 You're not going to be like, "Hey, what do you want to watch?"

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400
 I don't know.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400
 Let's watch Irreversible.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.400
 Like, you're just going to stay away from movies

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.400
 that replicate the crime that you are part of,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.400
 that you are a victim of.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.400
 So anyways, that's not really notable,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.400
 but they wanted to notate on this website.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.400
 So, I read that story and I was like,

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.400
 "That's probably not true."

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.400
 I've been in a lot of trailers in my life.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.400
 I've never found one that an 8-foot-tall creature

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.400
 could walk through naturally.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.400
 I've never found one that really anyone over 6 feet tall

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.400
 could walk through naturally.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400
 I've never...

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.400
 I don't think they could support the weight of a creature

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.400
 that was 8 feet tall running around.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.400
 I think the fact that he...

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.400
 they dropped him on the roof was bizarre.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400
 Like, there was a lot of stuff...

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.400
 The parents not waking up.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.400
 The theory was that the creature hypnotized them.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.400
 Then why wasn't the grandma hypnotized?

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400
 Why wasn't he hypnotized?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.400
 So the story didn't really...

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.400
 I was like, I read it and I was kind of like,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.400
 "I don't think it's true."

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.400
 Then I decided to look up some more stuff.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.400
 In the Lake Michigan area.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.400
 In that whole general area of the United States.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400
 What are those states called?

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.400
 We have the West Coast and the South and the East Coast.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.400
 And then we have the Northwest.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.400
 Then we have Central America.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.400
 Wait, no, no, that's a different place.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400
 But you know what I mean?

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.400
 Like, the Great Lakes area?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.400
 Like, anyway, so that whole area up there,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.400
 there's been a lot of sightings of a man-bat creature.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.400
 Or sometimes it's described as a giant insect-like creature.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.400
 Which I think this one, even though he was giant and furry,

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.400
 I think the tiny body makes it does seem kind of insectoid.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.400
 But I start looking through these different incidents

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.400
 and I was like, "Oh, these people see it flying through here."

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.400
 And I was like, "Oh, that could probably be explained.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400
 It could probably just be a big old bug."

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.400
 And I keep looking and I was like, "Oh, at a certain point,

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.400
 I'm trying to find nothing."

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.400
 Because I had already made my mind up that this story was fake.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400
 And I still...

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.400
 I'm not 100% on it.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.400
 But I kept finding,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.400
 sighting after sighting after sighting after sighting

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.400
 of these creatures to the point in 2017,

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.400
 in 2017 alone in the city,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.400
 in just the city of Chicago,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.400
 29 sightings of a man-bat creature.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.400
 By dozens of witnesses.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.400
 Police officers, news reporters,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400
 people just walking down the street.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.400
 They saw one jumping off of the Sears Tower,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.400
 like doing a swan dive and then fly through the city.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.400
 People had seen them on the outskirts of Chicago.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.400
 People have seen them within the streets of Chicago

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.400
 flying around.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.400
 Reports of them shape-shifting,

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.400
 of seeing humans all of a sudden growing wings

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.400
 and taking off and flying off into the city.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.400
 Report after report after report.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.400
 And at a certain point,

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.400
 there have been times where a bigfoot has been sighted in an area

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.400
 and then all of a sudden there's a ton of bigfoot sightings.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.400
 And you have to go, those are probably fake.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.400
 Like either that original person was the first person to see bigfoot in the area

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.400
 or everyone else now is mistaking everything for bigfoot.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.400
 But these man-bat sightings aren't super publicized.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.400
 It's not like one person sees the man-bat and is all over the news.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.400
 This 1969 story is way too far back for it to be a viral sensation.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:41.400
 People, ordinary people, are seen just in the city of Chicago 29 times.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:47.400
 A giant, bigger than a human flying creature going through the city.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.400
 Absolutely bizarre.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.400
 And I think it's interesting because when we think of cryptids,

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.400
 they're hidden.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.400
 They're, like I was saying in my intro, they're deep in remote areas.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:04.400
 Very rarely do you have, almost never do you have cryptids in super inhabited areas.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.400
 Could be fake.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.400
 Could just be a lot of people thinking that they're seeing a giant flying guy.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:17.400
 But if it's real, if this is a real cryptid, what's interesting about this story is that,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:23.400
 you know how we build houses and we start to encroach on the natural habitat of mountain lions.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.400
 Then mountain to lion start walking, we had a mountain lion walking through the city of Hood River a couple months ago.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.400
 Or cougar, whatever, whatever the difference was.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.400
 I think it was mountain lion.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.400
 But anyways, it was walking by an elementary school.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.400
 Because humanity keeps encroaching on their territory and they're like, well, screw it.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.400
 If I can't find food out here, I'm going to go into your neighborhood and find some food.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.400
 What if the same thing is going to happen with cryptids?

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.400
 What if as we spread out and start knocking down their natural habitat,

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.400
 they start coming to where we're at?

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.400
 We cut down enough forest and eventually bigfoot's like, this sucks.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.400
 Can't find any more fish, can't eat any more deer.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.400
 I'm just going to go into this neighborhood.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.400
 What happens when we start building apartment buildings where the melon heads live?

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.400
 And they're just like, ah, they're trying to apply for a loan.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.400
 They all just stack up on each other wearing a trench coat, filling out paperwork.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.400
 That's one scenario.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.400
 That's one scenario.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:23.400
 That we're basically cutting into their environments and we're going to be seeing more and more cryptids in the cities and in the suburbs.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.400
 But there's another theory as well.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.400
 What if the man bat, if it exists, let's assume that it exists for a second.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.400
 What if the man bat says, hmm,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:41.400
 "My species have always lived in the wilderness and we've always hunted lone stragglers.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.400
 People lost in the woods that disappear.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.400
 Hitchhikers on a dark stretch of night looking for a ride, they disappear.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.400
 Small family picnicking.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.400
 One kid goes running off, never find the kid again.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.400
 And that has satiated my species for a long time.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:06.400
 But now is the time to no longer just eat.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.400
 Now is the time to feast.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:18.400
 Now is the time to hunt humans, where I know there's a lot of them.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:24.400
 And you have this creature patrolling the skies of Chicago, looking for its next male.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.400
 A hiker goes missing in the middle of the woods.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.400
 People are going to go looking for him.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.400
 A young prostitute disappears in the streets of Chicago.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.400
 They're going to look for her.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.400
 But at a certain point, they're just going to figure the city swallowed her up.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:49.400
 It's far easier to feed on prey in a city where people easily just disappear.
