 The movie "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" features a man who tries to have his

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.120
 memory erased via a sci-fi contraption.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.920
 But you can actually do it at home!

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 And then we take a look at an urban legend that has spread around all over the world.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.760
 But the origins of it are frighteningly real.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:00.640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.200
 I'm having a great day and I hope you're having a great day too.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.480
 Don't have a lot of time to record this episode.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.240
 I actually have to go do some grocery shopping for one of my jobs.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.280
 Have to run out, go do grocery shopping, then run off to another job and then come back

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 to this other job.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.040
 It is the plight of someone who works three part-time jobs.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.600
 But what are you going to do?

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 And I got to put out a daily podcast so you just kind of got to bite down.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.080
 It didn't help that I spent the last half hour listening to Kimbra songs.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.000
 I've never really listened to her before.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.400
 I've always thought she was pretty cute.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.560
 She was in that Goatier song.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.840
 And I was like, oh, she actually has some pretty good music.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 So I'm getting all that.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.120
 I walk a lot so I need as much music as I can.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.640
 So I was listening to a bunch of her songs and downloading them and all that.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.840
 But anyways, so for the rest of the day I'll be listening to Kimbra and walking around

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.280
 doing grocery shopping, running errands and so on and so forth.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.200
 But before I do all that, I've got to cover two stories for you guys.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.120
 So the first story we're going to look at, I said in the intro, so there is that movie

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.000
 called Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.800
 And I think Frodo was in it too.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.600
 But I didn't like that movie.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.120
 I wasn't a huge fan of it.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.360
 I heard a lot of hype about it.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.760
 It was really, I think you can almost like that movie was proto hipster movie.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.160
 I think it kind of preceded the hipster movement.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.480
 But I ended up watching it and I shut it off halfway through.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.040
 I just wasn't that entertained by it.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.480
 And I appreciate Jim Carrey's early stuff.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.040
 And he has done anything.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.600
 I'll see him in the Sonic movie.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 I'll watch that.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.480
 I mean, he's a little weird in real life, but his movies are decent, good to decent

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.480
 movies.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.480
 He hasn't made anything really terrible.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.480
 I never saw him number 23.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.920
 I actually should watch that because that really is kind of the conspiracy type movie

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.400
 and it's kind of what the show's about.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.200
 But maybe I'll give it a shot.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.920
 So it had Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who's super hot and then Frodo Backins was in it.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.120
 He was looking for the ring and he didn't find it in that movie, but he found it in

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120
 another movie.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.760
 So the concept is this.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.960
 This guy has a horrible breakup with a girl and there's this device that allows your memory.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.600
 I think there's a musical number in it.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 Maybe I'm getting a confused.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.880
 There was some other hot chicken in it.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.680
 Who's Mary Jane from Spiderman?

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.520
 She was also a cheerleader and bring it on.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.520
 My depth of movie knowledge is what the actors have been in before.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.560
 So I'm like, oh, it's the movie starring the mask and Rose from Titanic.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.800
 They meet Frodo and Mary Jane Watson and they go on this crazy adventure and if you're

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.760
 mind erased, this machine allows you to erase your mind.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.560
 One of the interesting things, the only interesting thing about the movie is that would you want

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.240
 to have memories erased?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.000
 Would you want bad memories to be erased?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.720
 You know, one of the weird things, I know I'm digressing here, but one of the weird things

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.200
 about like dying and going to heaven I've always felt is that you're supposed to go

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.160
 to heaven and you're a total peace and joy, but part of what's informed me, part of what's

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.920
 created me as a human is my bad memories, is the sorrow I've gone through.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.160
 And I feel like that is baked into the cake that is Jason Carpenter.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.440
 So can you take out the bad memories and still be the same person?

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.040
 Or would you want to take out the bad memories knowing that you wouldn't even remember the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.040
 good stuff?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.800
 As much as that is a sci-fi/philosophical argument, you can actually do it at home.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.000
 Here's a disclaimer, don't do this, don't do this, but it's possible, but don't do it,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.920
 because it's actually quite dangerous.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.640
 I came across this article recently and what it is, is this man in China posted on the net.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.880
 So right there, it's super vague, we don't have a lot of resources, but other scientists,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.640
 other doctors have chimed in on this.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.600
 A man on the internet in China said his mom was really constipated for like two weeks,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.560
 going to go to the bathroom at all.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.600
 And then one time she went into the bathroom and she was in there for a long time and she

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.680
 finally had a bowel movement, and when she came out of the bathroom, she didn't remember

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.720
 the past 10 years of her life.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.520
 They couldn't figure out what was going on.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.560
 She had no idea what happened the past 10 years of her life.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.400
 She's like, "Hey, you want to go to the World Trade Center?"

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.080
 They're like, "Mom, mom, sit down, we have something to tell you."

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.640
 Actually, that would have been farther back than 10 years.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.800
 But anyways, the family had to sit her down and tell her, like, what's going on?

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.360
 And she's like, "No, no, I got all this money invested in Enron.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.080
 We're rich, we're millionaires!"

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.120
 And they're like, "Mom, mom, we think we need to go to the doctor."

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.200
 So they took her to the doctor and what happened was the doctor diagnosed her with amnesia,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.120
 but it only lasted for eight hours.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.280
 So for eight hours, she couldn't remember the past 10 years of her life.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.240
 Now, this was reported in the media and the news article in China, there's two versions

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240
 of this article.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.840
 One is from the China Times, it's a that in a second.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.800
 And then one is in this website called The Week of Buzz, which seemed really clickbaity.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.080
 So I had to go to the China Times to find out if it was actually published or true or

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080
 anything like that.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.320
 And in the China Times, they quoted this neurosurgeon who says, "Yes, it is possible,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.880
 because when you're having a big bowel movement, you can actually start to cut off blood flow

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.880
 to your jugular vein, which will interfere with your brain, which you're not getting

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.480
 enough blood flow to your brain, so it will begin to wipe out memories if the bowel movement

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480
 is big enough."

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.840
 So yes, it is possible and it does happen.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.720
 It's not incredibly common, but it does happen.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.800
 I had a cousin one day who one day her husband came home and she was laying on the floor

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.560
 and she thought she was still in high school.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.680
 She didn't remember anything.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.800
 And they never could and after about a year or two, she regained her memories, but she

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800
 ended up going to the doctor.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.480
 The doctor's like, "We don't know what it is."

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.000
 But she appears to have lost her memory.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.520
 Now, there were people in the family who thought she was faking it.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.120
 I actually ran into her shortly after this happened and I remember looking at her and

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.400
 she looked different.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.400
 There was something about her eyes.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.640
 I go, "I don't think she's faking it, because just by looking at her eyes, you could tell

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.920
 there was something different about her."

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.120
 Now, she might have just suffered mild brain damage.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.240
 She may have made the whole thing up, but I think she probably did suffer some mild

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.480
 brain damage and she actually did lose her memory.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.840
 But I don't know if she was super constipated before that.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.320
 They just found her on the floor.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.960
 So let's go to the...

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.440
 So it is a legit thing.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.480
 It actually can happen to people.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.040
 But now, this next segment you might think is a little culturally insensitive, but the

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.680
 next story we're going to cover is quite grim.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.240
 So I figured let's pack as many as funny moments into this next couple of minutes, because

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.820
 what we're going to get into is pretty dark.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.240
 So I go to the China Times.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.480
 Now I have to run the translate option, obviously, because I don't speak Chinese.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.120
 Now, I actually do have a lot of Chinese members of my family.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.920
 A lot of members of my family, my stepmom, and my stepbrothers and sisters, and stuff

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.800
 like that, are Chinese.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.960
 Step grandpa, all that stuff.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.560
 You know, aren't there such a thing as a step grandpa at a certain point, you just go,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560
 "Ah, that's my grandpa."

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.040
 But anyways, I have a lot of family members who are from China.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.120
 So I don't speak Chinese myself.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.120
 They probably could.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.160
 But the translation errors when I'm running this translate, and I don't get these a lot

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.760
 when I'm running translation from English to like on Spanish websites, which I have

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760
 to go to a lot.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.200
 There's some great gems here.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.080
 Again, you might go, "Jason, that's kind of rude, but we're going to get into some dark

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.080
 stuff."

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.120
 The headline of the China Times article, so for comparison, this is the headline of the

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.520
 World Buzz article.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.160
 Woman loses 10 years of memories after she pooped with excessive force.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.200
 I'm like, "Oh, it's very clicky, very clickbaity."

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.960
 And I was like, "Oh, it's an interesting story for the podcast."

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.960
 Go to China Times.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960
 Here's the headline.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960
 Constipation.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.240
 The toilet came out and lost 10 years of memory.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.800
 Now other than it grammatically being incorrect, the toilet didn't lose memory and the toilet

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800
 didn't come out.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.500
 Quite an odd phrasing for it.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.040
 You poop and another toilet comes out and then you poop into that toilet and another smaller

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.400
 toilet comes out.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.720
 It's a, I forgot what that name was.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.480
 We covered our past episode, but when people keep looking into mirrors, they see multiple

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.640
 versions of themselves.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.400
 It's that, but just toilets coming out of your butthole.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.400
 And then they had these other great headlines here.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.560
 "Keeper folding 103 times as big as the universe."

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560
 What?

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.520
 What does that even mean?

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.400
 He hasn't cut his hair for 50 years.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.920
 He took his headgear like a giant clam.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.280
 Oh man, that guy's such a good dude.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.840
 He took it like a giant clam.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.480
 I'm assuming, now I clicked on that one because I was like, "What does that even mean?"

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.920
 And apparently he hadn't cut his hair in 50 years and they just cut it and apparently

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.080
 look like a giant clam.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080
 It didn't.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.720
 It looked like a giant pile of hair on the ground.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.040
 But this headline actually had to click on because I was like, "What in the world?"

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.480
 I understand the paper folding thing.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.640
 It's probably saying you can't fold a piece of paper 103 times.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.080
 I've heard that before, but you can't fold a piece of paper in half so many times or

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.080
 whatever.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.320
 But this next headline I had to click on, do some research on, "Under the flashlight,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.880
 the white light is actually suffering from this disease."

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.080
 What could that even possibly mean?

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.800
 So I guess this article is a girl, a mother, took a photo of her son and when the white

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.160
 light flashed his eyes looked really weird under the flash and he actually suffered from

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.800
 some sort of eye cancer and they caught it very early and were able to treat it.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.840
 But yeah, so that's what that headline means.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.320
 Under the flashlight, the white light is actually suffering from this disease.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.640
 Again, the white light's not suffering from anything.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.120
 The toilet is not losing 10 years of memory and the toilet doesn't come out of anything.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.040
 It's there, it's in place.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.640
 So thank you, China Times and thank you Google Translate for these great headlines.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.440
 And again, I don't recommend giving yourself constipation so you interfere with the blood

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440
 flow to your brain.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.280
 I highly don't recommend that because you could probably just give yourself a stroke.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:30.400
 But it's still just an odd thing how balanced our bodies are and how easily it is to interfere

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400
 with them.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.480
 This is obviously a temporary thing, even if you did have a bad breakup within the past

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.840
 10 years, you'll only buy yourself about 8 hours of solace but then you're like, "Now

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.400
 I just have to make myself constipated all the time."

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400
 Yeah, don't do that.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400
 Don't do that at all.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.680
 I actually don't even know how an eternal sunshine ended.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.680
 I don't know if he decided to remember her or not.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.240
 I just gave up halfway through the movie.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.600
 I'm pretty sure there's a musical number though.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.480
 I'm almost pretty sure there's a musical number with Kirsten Dunst.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480
 That was it.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.640
 But if you want to watch a great movie, Mellon Collie.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.600
 I know there's a lot of people who aren't big fans of Lars von Trier, but that movie's

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600
 great.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.240
 And I know why people aren't good fans of his because he made all those Nazi jokes during

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.720
 a press conference and he's just cracking these jokes about Hitler and Kirsten Dunst,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.320
 star of Bring It On and the Spider-Man franchise, is sitting next to him and she's like, "Oh

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.320
 my God."

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.160
 And he's cracking jokes about Hitler and Nazi's in front of a bunch of posh film critics.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.640
 But Lars von Trier, Mellon Collie.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.880
 Mellon Collie, that was the name of the movie.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.880
 The first half of the movie is an examination of a young woman's descent into depression.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.160
 Kirsten Dunst has a nude scene in it as well, if you're not into the depression angle.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:51.080
 The second half of the movie is one of the best end of the world sci-fi films ever.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080
 Top five.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.400
 I would honestly say ever because it just shows the futility of mankind in the face

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.000
 of the entire universe.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.920
 And I remember reading an article about Mellon Collie and Lars von Trier, that's one of

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.320
 my least favorite movies.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.520
 One of my least favorite movies.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.280
 One, because I was going through terrible depression while I was watching it, hence the point

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.280
 of the movie.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.560
 And he goes, "Two, it's too good."

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.000
 He goes, "I like my movies to have lots of flaws in them.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.760
 I like my movies to have mistakes in them."

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.280
 He goes, "And I used a lot of tripods in this film and I just don't like the way it came

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.280
 out."

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.280
 Beautiful movie.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.280
 Very, very tragic film.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.920
 And I would tell, I've told people too, just skip the first hour.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.840
 If you're not into the examination of depression and loss, I don't even think she loses anything.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.800
 I think she's just going through a chemical depression.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.760
 Yeah, I go, "If you're not into that, the first hour is pretty slow."

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.320
 I loved it, but I love all of his stuff.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.320
 And this is my last thing I'm going to talk about.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.280
 Lars von Trier is great because he is a very...

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.480
 He's like an art house movie maker who takes schlocky genres.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.480
 He's done that with his past...

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.800
 I wouldn't say past two movies, but Melancholia and Antichrist are both...

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.560
 Antichrist is a Cabin in the Woods horror movie made by an artistic genius.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.280
 A lot of people don't like the way he portrays women either, and I totally get that.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:18.600
 But it is a art house take on a straight to DVD horror movie.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600
 It's brilliant.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.480
 It's a man and a woman and a cabin in the woods.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.840
 Absolutely terrifying film.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.840
 Very, very grotesque.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.160
 William Defoe was in that one.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.480
 I love that movie.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:33.400
 And then Melancholia is basically Armageddon made by an amazing filmmaker.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.600
 Not whoever made Armageddon.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.120
 I think it might have been Michael Bay or Jerry Breckheimer.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.360
 But he does these...

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:47.920
 He picks these genres that normally aren't touched by the artsy community and makes these

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.360
 crazy films.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.480
 I would love to see him do an action film.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.680
 I would love to see him get Scott Atkins and Jean-Claude Van Damme and do an artistic

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.080
 take on an action film.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.000
 Actually, his last movie was the House that Jack built, which I haven't seen yet, but

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.760
 it is a serial killer film done in an art house.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:11.200
 I've seen clips from it and it's quite ridiculous, but it's that same type of thing.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.520
 Hats off to you, Lars Von Triehr and hats off to my audience.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.520
 Half of my audience that left because they absolutely hate that person.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.520
 But I like them.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.520
 Dogville.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.520
 Great movie.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.520
 So anyways, let's go ahead and move on.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520
 Dogville is amazing, actually.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.880
 But let's go ahead and move on.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.080
 I never saw the sequel.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.160
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.400
 So there is this old urban legend.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.640
 It's probably one of the biggest urban legends, really.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.560
 You have Bloody Mary, which is probably the top one.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.720
 But the second urban legend is the babysitter in the house.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.720
 And the story is this.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.880
 She's at home babysitting the kid.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.640
 There's a lot of versions of this, but really the main one that I always heard was there's

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.080
 a babysitter at home babysitting two kids.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.080
 A kid, whatever.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.080
 It doesn't matter how many kids there are.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.680
 They're basically cannon fodder for this story.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:04.520
 This babysitter is in this house and she's getting crank calls to her phone and then

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.560
 she calls up the police and she says, "Can you track the phone call?"

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.560
 And then the cops call her back and say, "We tracked the phone call.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.880
 The phone call is coming from within the house."

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.120
 And then the version I heard was then she went, "This totally disturbed me as a kid."

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.520
 I think I first heard this when I was like eight or nine.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.200
 The babysitter then goes upstairs and the kids are all chopped up.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.640
 And I remember being specifically told their faces looked like spaghettios.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.160
 And that really disturbed me because I loved spaghettios.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.200
 It really creeped me out because it took something that I enjoyed eating.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.200
 And for the longest time when I looked at a bowl of spaghettios I just would see chopped

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.200
 up people.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.720
 Because spaghettios, not just spaghettios, spaghettios with hot dogs in them is very

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720
 specific.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.360
 Now of course you could not ever chop up a human body and make it look like spaghettios

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.720
 with hot dogs in them, but totally creeped me out.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.800
 Now that version of the story where the cops are tracing the phone call back and it's inside

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.160
 the house, we've heard all sorts of versions of that.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.240
 But basically the idea is the killer is in the house with the babysitter.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.520
 We don't always get the traced phone call, but that's a common thing.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.480
 Now the story we're going to cover is actually something I had never heard of until about

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.400
 two or three weeks ago.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.200
 And it's very, very chilling.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.040
 Very chilling story.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.440
 So we're going back in time.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.720
 We're going back to the year, 1950.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.280
 We're in the city of Columbia, Missouri and it's March 18th.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.160
 There is a young babysitter.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.080
 This is a 100% true story.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.120
 There's a young babysitter named Janet Christman and she's 13 years old.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.280
 She turns 14 in three days.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.880
 So you guys can already kind of know where this is going.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.760
 You guys want to tune in tomorrow.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.040
 It's totally fine.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.080
 Janet is 13.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.400
 She turns 14 in three days.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.480
 She's trying to save up money to get a new dress for Easter.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.560
 And she generally babysits for two different families.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.560
 She babysits for the Romax and she babysits for the Mollars.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.440
 So this particular night, the Mollars and the Romax and a couple other families are

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.000
 going to go hang out and play cards.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.880
 And Janet picks the job to go to the Romax house and the Mollars have to find another

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.360
 babysitter.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.520
 And she's at the Romax house and they said, "Okay, listen, here's the thing.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.560
 We have this little three-year-old boy named Gregory.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.560
 Want you to take care of him?"

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.160
 And she's like, "I know how to do my job, guys.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.960
 They're like, "No, we're just adding details.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.360
 We're adding details for the story."

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.320
 And she's like, "That's weird.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.440
 Details for who?"

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.880
 So they say our little son, Gregory, is three years old.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.160
 The house is kind of in the middle of nowhere.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.120
 But let me show you some stuff.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:36.360
 So Ed Romac, the dad of the Romax, says, "Here's my shotgun.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.960
 Again, this is 1950s, so you would have no problem handing a shotgun to a 13-year-old

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960
 girl.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.040
 He showed her how to load it, unload it, and said, "Keep it by the door."

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.320
 If anyone knocks on the door, anyone at all, you lock the door, you turn on the porch light.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.800
 Do not open the door for anybody.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.640
 Puts the shotgun by the door, pats her on the head, says goodbye to his son.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.520
 The Romax leaves.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:07.440
 That night, a massive rainstorm hits the area.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.120
 Mid-20 degrees.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.480
 So it's just ice and sleet everywhere.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.880
 And Janet is just sitting at home, doing her babysitting thing.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.640
 Now at 1035, the police station in Columbia gets a phone call.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.640
 Phone rings.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.640
 Columbia Police.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.840
 And they just hear a young girl go, "Come quick!"

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.920
 And the phone line goes dead.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:38.880
 Cop's sitting there, looking out the window, seeing the rain and the ice, the wind, whip

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.360
 across the street outside the police station.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.600
 And the officer just sits there waiting for another phone call.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.240
 They can't trace the phone call.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.400
 I don't even know if they had the ability to trace phone calls back then, but the phone

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:58.080
 call was so short, with no information, they just had a hope they'd get another phone call.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:04.360
 Now while the Romax and the Mollers are out having this big party, Ann Romac, the wife,

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.120
 calls home to see how everything's going.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.200
 But it's really early in the morning.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.000
 It's like around midnight.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.840
 She calls home, no answer.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.160
 So she goes, "Baby sitter must be asleep.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.080
 Gregory's probably asleep.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.400
 Probably no big deal."

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.120
 At 1.35, the Romax pull up to their house.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.040
 Rain still just pouring down.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.760
 They see in their headlights as their cars pulling up, they see that the porch light

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.760
 is on.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.640
 They don't really think anything of it.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.400
 Maybe she turned it on because she was scared, because it was dark and it was stormy.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.400
 Maybe not.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.600
 But when Ed walks up to the house and he goes to unlock the door, the door is unlocked.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.600
 And right when they walk into the house, they see the body of Janet on the ground.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.640
 The carpet is soaked with her blood.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.440
 They see, just in the brief time that they're looking before they start totally freaking

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.160
 out, she's obviously dead.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.040
 She's suffered some major head wounds and she's been stabbed multiple times.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.840
 Ann sees that and she freaks out and then immediately runs upstairs to check on her

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.240
 son, totally safe asleep.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.160
 Not even aware of what was going on downstairs.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.320
 Ed then goes to call the police and the phone is off the hook.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.040
 He picks the phone up, dials the police.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.240
 We need someone out here right away.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.360
 Massive police presence shows up.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.360
 They all show up.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.480
 You just can't believe that this would happen anywhere, but it's happening in their town.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480
 The police show up.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.200
 Now, part of the problem is that their house is kind of in the middle of nowhere.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.200
 It's almost on the border of two different police jurisdictions.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:44.000
 And so, the Columbia police get involved and the police in the neighboring area get involved

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.480
 and they start vying for control over who gets to control this crime scene, who's in charge

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.480
 of this murder.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.160
 You have a bunch of cops walking around.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.800
 You have conflicting orders between the police.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.800
 All sorts of stuff.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.640
 And that is kind of indicative of what's going to happen with this.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.600
 This is what they start to put together.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.740
 She seemed to have been stabbed with a mechanical pencil.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.280
 She was strangled with a power cord from an iron.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.760
 That's what eventually did her in.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.220
 When she was pummeled in the head, she was stabbed multiple times with what appears to

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.680
 be a mechanical pencil, which weren't super common back then.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.840
 They're not even super common now.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.160
 They actually quite suck.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.320
 I've never seen the advantage of a mechanical pencil.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.880
 But she suffered head wounds.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.160
 She suffered stab wounds.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.520
 Unfortunately, she had been sexually assaulted as well.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.680
 The police are fighting over control of the crime scene.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.800
 They're fighting for control of the case.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.600
 And they're looking into this and they don't have any immediate leads.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.520
 There is a back window that is busted open.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.880
 And there's some mud by the back kitchen door.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.480
 And so some cops are saying someone must have busted their way into the house.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.440
 Got in, assaulted, or killed her.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.600
 Other people are saying the fact that the porch light is on makes us think that someone came

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.600
 to the front door.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.400
 And since the door was unlocked, it was probably somebody she knew.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.400
 But in the midst of all this, is there a try and to work this crime scene, trying to work

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.560
 this case?

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:12.200
 Eventually, one of the officers turns to someone else and says, "Do you think this is related

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.440
 to the Mary Lou Jenkins case?"

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:21.400
 Four years earlier, February 5th, 1946, Mary Lou Jenkins, 20 years old.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.640
 She was staying at home alone.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.360
 Her father was out of town and her mother was down the street, taking care of an elderly

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.360
 couple.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.840
 This is in the same town.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:35.080
 The mom says, "Listen, if you run into any problems, open the shades, turn the light

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.480
 on and call me."

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.480
 Later that night, the mom looks out the window, she's in the house with the elderly people,

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.400
 she looks out the window, she looks down the street and she sees her house with the blinds

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.840
 open and the light on, but she didn't receive a phone call, so she thinks everything is

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840
 fine.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:54.360
 That seems like a weird warning system if you only, of all three things, have to happen.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.280
 Blinds have to be open, lights on, and a phone call.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.240
 Like, you figure just two or three would work, but she doesn't think anything's wrong.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:05.120
 When she goes home later that night, she sees that her daughter was raped and strangled with

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.800
 an extension cord.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:12.560
 There was a guy who, around the same time, murdered his own wife and during a rather

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:18.120
 brutal police interrogation, he confessed to the rape and murder of Mary Lou Jenkins.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.600
 So he was executed for that.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.080
 He was executed for the murder of his wife and on the date of his execution, he says,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.880
 "Listen, I murdered my wife, but I didn't murder Mary Lou Jenkins and no one believes

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.880
 him."

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.720
 Because he's a murderer and he's about to die, so you know, it's not like he has the

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.320
 best credibility ever.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.480
 But there were issues in this town.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.480
 There were creepers.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.120
 Now, she was killed in 1946, but there was kind of this underlying current of odd activity

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.120
 in this town.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:49.160
 Now, three years after Mary Lou Jenkins' murder, there was a spate of peeping Tom activity

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.160
 in the town.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.160
 Now, that makes me think, the fact that the mom was so paranoid saying, "If anything went

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.120
 wrong, do these things," it makes me think that people were already a little on edge.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.640
 Maybe they hadn't bubbled to the surface.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.400
 Maybe people weren't aware of it.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:07.600
 But in 1949, they had a bunch of peeping Tom activity that actually escalated into

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600
 rape.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:14.960
 A few days before Halloween in 1949, a 16-year-old girl was raped by a man wearing a white mask.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.680
 Almost a month later, on November 29th, there was an attempted rape.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:26.680
 And then the next day, a man, with a white mask, finds a couple in a car, robs the man,

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.880
 rapes the girl.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.080
 So then a couple days later, on November 4th, a man was caught peeping outside of a house.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:39.920
 He was subject to a rather brutal police interrogation, and he confesses to the rape and the attempted

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.920
 rape.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.560
 Doesn't confess to the rape of the couple, but confesses to the rape and the attempted

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.040
 rape that happened just a couple months earlier.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.880
 So the police in this town were kind of known for using extrajudicial interrogation methods.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.680
 They weren't doing stuff by the book, and that would come to bite them in the butt in

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.920
 the end.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.800
 So at this point, they have solved all these other crimes they believe.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.440
 The police believe that they know who's done these other crimes.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.040
 So in 1950, though, they're looking at the body of Janet on the autopsy table.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.440
 It appears she's been stabbed with a mechanical pencil several times.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.400
 And so then the police are discussing it, and they go, "Do you know anyone who uses

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.320
 a mechanical pencil?"

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.840
 And the answer is yes.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840
 Yes.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.840
 I do know someone who's using a mechanical pencil.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.360
 Not only do I know someone who often uses a mechanical pencil, they know Janet.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.880
 In fact, Janet is one of their babysitters.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.480
 Robert Mueller, which is a bizarre name that this hasn't popped up more often, because

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.720
 Robert Mueller is now such a famous name, but Robert Mueller was a tailor in town, a

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.000
 very, very successful man.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.280
 He was always known to carry a mechanical pencil.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.080
 Now, that's not enough to make you a suspect.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.680
 But he was also known to have lewd conversations about young girls.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:26:00.760
 And Romak said that Robert Mueller was a type of guy who used his hands, not his words,

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.760
 when dealing with women.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.320
 A very, very gropey type of guy.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.600
 Ed Romak said, "Not only had he made lewd comments about young women, he would make

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.920
 comments about wanting to take a young girl's virginity, and he would make comments about

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.080
 how curvy Janet was becoming.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.280
 The kind of comments that we're making Ed a little nervous.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.720
 Which makes me think that when Ed was saying, "Don't open the door for anyone," and

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.840
 here's where the shotgun is, almost makes me think he is saying, "Don't even open

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.200
 it for Robert Mueller.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.560
 Just leave the door locked.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.120
 Even if you know him, just leave it locked during the porch light on."

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.680
 But they're all out at a card game together.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.000
 So Robert Mueller has a perfect alibi, right?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 As the cops started looking into him and started questioning, once he became the focus of this

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.160
 investigation, they interviewed the people at the party.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.360
 The people at the party say, "Yes, Robert Mueller was at the party for us, except for

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360
 a few hours."

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.360
 And the cops were like, "What?"

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.880
 And they're like, "Yeah, he was gone for a few hours."

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.520
 He said he had a doctor's appointment or something.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.520
 And they're like, "Really?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.520
 Late at night?"

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.520
 And they're like, "Yeah."

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.520
 During a rainstorm, he had a doctor's appointment.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.640
 They're like, "Yeah, we didn't really think anything of it now.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.800
 But now that you're mentioning him, it is a little suspicious, isn't it?"

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.000
 And the cops are like, "Yes, you could have told us that weeks ago."

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.760
 So they contacted Robert Mueller's doctor and the doctor goes, "I never saw him that

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.760
 time.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.760
 He never stopped by."

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.680
 Now, his alibi starts falling apart.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:24.400
 Not only that, the police are putting together that this guy's fairly creepy, and at one

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.520
 point he's talking to Ed and he goes, "You know, I don't know who killed Janet, but

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.920
 I know how I would have done it.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.920
 I would have just walked up to the front door and said, 'Hey, Ed sent me here to pick up

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.000
 some poker chips and she would have let me right inside.'"

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.440
 And Ed's like, "What the hell are you talking about?"

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:44.280
 So there actually was an interrogation, but again, not by the book.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.320
 They took him out of the city jurisdiction.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.440
 They take Robert Mueller to this abandoned barn out of police jurisdiction and interview

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.680
 him for hours.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.680
 Doesn't break.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.360
 Doesn't break at all.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.080
 He offers to take a polygraph.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.440
 He takes a polygraph.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.960
 He passes the polygraph.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.280
 So at that point the cops are like, "Well, he didn't do it."

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.400
 Now we know now that polygraph technology isn't 100%.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.240
 They're like, "Hey man, he passed the polygraph and he didn't break during our basic torture

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.200
 session so he's most likely innocent."

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.040
 But a judge disagreed and said, "You know what?

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.760
 I don't agree with that decision police.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.200
 I'm going to convene a grand jury.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.760
 We're going to look at all the evidence and we're going to see if we can indict this guy."

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.200
 Goes to a grand jury.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.600
 But when all the police evidence is presented to the grand jury, they say, "Too much problem

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.480
 with these different police forces trying to investigate this.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.680
 We have all this different stuff because one police force straight up says it was a stranger

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.480
 who broke in the back window and then you have this other police force saying no with

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.640
 someone she knew.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:56.120
 So despite all of the weirdness with his alibi and his statements and his creepy behavior,

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.960
 he's never prosecuted.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:05.640
 He ends up leaving, dies at the age of 83 in Arizona.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.760
 The Romacs and the Mollers go about their business.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.120
 Janet had a little sister who ended up going off into college and just kind of moving on

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.120
 with her life.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.160
 The parents, obviously when I say moving on with their life, obviously they mourned the

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.920
 loss of their daughter and sister, but things just kind of faded away.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:29.080
 To this day, no one has ever been successfully prosecuted in any way for the death of Janet

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.080
 Christman.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:37.800
 Just a 13-year-old girl, 3 days shy of her 14th birthday, raped and murdered on a cold,

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.880
 rainy Missouri night.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:50.840
 It doesn't have all of the extra creepy details that the urban legend has, but the idea of

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.440
 a lone babysitter, a young woman trapped in a house, being confronted with the ultimate

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.840
 evil, is creepy enough.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.840
 Whoever did this got away with it.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:08.280
 Whoever did this most likely was responsible for the other crimes.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:13.080
 And because of the way the police were interacting with these suspects in the past, people were

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.720
 confessing most likely to crimes they did not commit.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.640
 The guy who was convicted of Mary Lou Jenkins was a murderer.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.960
 The guy who was peeping outside the window was a peeping Tom.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.800
 But was he a rapist?

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.200
 Were all of these crimes connected?

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.400
 Nobody knows.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.320
 And I don't really know if anyone really cares.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.160
 You think this story would still be floating around out there as one of the big unsolved

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.160
 cases.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.160
 But it's not.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:47.280
 It's been swept away into a sea of unsolved mysteries.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.040
 What really happened that cold, rainy night?

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:57.520
 Was she confronted by a man she knew who had always lusted after her, who had a friendly

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.840
 demeanor and walked through the front door before committing the ultimate evil?

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:09.640
 Or was it a stranger skulking about the house who saw a young girl alone and decided to

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.480
 do something truly despicable?

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.560
 Either way, that person went on with their lives.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:27.080
 And truly evil continued to live, function, and walk among the rest of the world.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:48.680
 And that is scarier than any urban legend.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.260
 (upbeat music)

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.840
 (upbeat music)

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.420
 (upbeat music)

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.000
 (upbeat music)

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.580
 (upbeat music)

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.640
