00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.520
 When a massive tornado hits the city of Joplin, Missouri, people run for their lives and cling

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.840
 to their loved ones.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.480
 It looks like nothing can save them.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.000
 But then they showed up.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.720
 And then we take a look at a story about a young couple.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.360
 Everything seems to be going fine in their relationship, until she notices that her boyfriend

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.200
 all of a sudden, loves to cook her food.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.960
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, and I'm having a great day.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.480
 I hope you guys are having a lot of fun out there doing whatever you're doing.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.560
 First off, riding in the Dead Rabbit Command right now on his own personal pet, Velasa

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.560
 Raptor.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 Kyler Warp Man.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 That's not him.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.560
 That's not him.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 That's not him.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 That's not him.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.560
 That's not him.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 That's not him.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.560
 That's not him.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 That's not him.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 That's not him.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 That's not him.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 That's not him.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 That's not him.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 That's not him.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 That's the Velasa Raptor.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 That's not him.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.840
 Velociraptor. I'm gonna toss you the oars for the dead rabbit rowboat. We're gonna go ahead and leave

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.360
 behind dead rabbit command. We are.... Okay, technically, we're going to Missouri so we could

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.880
 have taken any vehicle, but it's been a long time since we've taken the rowboat. So we're gonna

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.320
 take a nice leisurely trip down the streams and rivers of the United States. We're leaving

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.280
 behind dead rabbit command. We're headed out to Joplin, Missouri. Splish, splash... Splish,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.240
 splash. That's the sound oars make? You didn't know? You're not a nautical man like myself?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.560
 We are in Joplin, Missouri. It's May 22nd, 2011. Now, if you know any... If you're from Joplin or

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.320
 if you live anywhere in Missouri, you know that is probably the one day in the entire history of the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:46.360
 city of Joplin. You don't want to be there. May 22nd, 2011. That's the day the tornado hit. Now,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:55.720
 not a tornado. The tornado. To be fair, before this, there had only been two tornadoes since 1971

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.560
 that hit the city of Joplin and really it was just kind of the area of Joplin. So at 5, 10 p.m.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.640
 when they start sending off tornado sirens in the city of Joplin, people are like, "Ah, you know,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.960
 it's been almost 40 years since a tornado has actually hit Joplin. Maybe you'll see a little like

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.240
 cow flying up in the air in a little barn. That'll be it. And hopefully it's not your cow and your

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.800
 barn. You can go back to work." So when the tornado sirens start going off in the city, some people

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.920
 paid attention to them, but other people just figured, "Ah, you know, those meteorologists,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.720
 they just like their loud sounds." But here we are at 5, 10 p.m. It's just a normal afternoon.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.600
 This tornado hits Joplin. It's rolling down the street.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.040
 [Motorcycle sounds]

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.600
 So I've never been in a tornado, but I'm vaguely aware. I saw this documentary called

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.240
 Wizard of Oz once. I'm vaguely aware of what they do. I mean, obviously, you're super destructive.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:03.240
 They'll destroy houses. They'll knock stuff over. But I guess I didn't really understand the extent

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.720
 of it. This tornado was actually considered one of the deadliest tornadoes in human history,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:15.400
 this tornado that hit Joplin. You had cars thrown into houses. Steel was rolled like paper.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.960
 Manhole covers flying through the air. I mean, just not like you could pick any two of those.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.840
 You're still having a bad day, right? The manhole covers are terrifying. This tornado got into excess

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.920
 of 200 miles per hour. It hit a hospital. This is the thing. People were expecting it to hit the

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.120
 area, maybe. But this thing rolled through downtown. It hit a hospital. Shut off the power.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.000
 Backup generators didn't work. People on ventilators died. This tornado did such damage to the hospital.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.560
 It deformed the foundation. It warped the earth under it. They had to end up tearing the hospital

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.760
 down. It hit a nursing home. It's like this thing was looking for the weakest people to pick on.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.080
 It's like, "Where's the daycare center?" It hit a nursing home. Nursing home collapsed, killing a

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.960
 bunch of elderly residents. It flattened both a Walmart and a Home Depot. You kind of need those

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.360
 to rebuild. That was the one thing that everyone was thinking like, "Oh, this sucks. You're watching

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.040
 your house float away. You're in the basement. You get house." But they're like, "I'll go to Walmart

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.840
 later. I'll go to Walmart. Grab some wood. Build a new house." The Walmart was destroyed. The Home

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.960
 Depot was destroyed. We're talking big buildings. Again, these aren't little anti-M houses. These

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.720
 are actual buildings. At one point, a Pepsi distribution plant. Nothing but concrete and steel

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:43.080
 gets completely leveled. This tornado just tears through the city. People weren't expecting that.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.960
 Again, with the tornado sirens, they're not thinking it's going to take a leisurely stroll

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.080
 through the center of town. There's one terrifying story I'm going to tell you. There was a Pizza Hut

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.960
 manager named Christopher Lucas. They're in their Pizza Hut and you hear the sirens. You don't really

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.160
 think anything of it. Then you see this tornado that got to be a mile wide. It led a path of

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.560
 destruction 22 miles long, but the tornado itself was a mile wide. People were trying to outdrive

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.680
 it. They couldn't. Nothing that big. You're pretty much screwed at that point. Christopher sees this

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.480
 tornado coming down the street. He orders all of his employees into the walk-in freezer. Any

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.080
 port in a storm. They go to close it. A lot of walk-in freezers, I used to work at Godfather's

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.480
 Pizza. They're usually kind of jury-rigged a bit. They're not the most sanitary,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.160
 but you're not constantly unlocking it. There's usually some kind of thing you can do to make

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.400
 it easier to open and close, basically. It seems like in this case, they had a bungee cord.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.320
 They have it rigged up that way. They run into the walk-in freezer and he goes to shut the door,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.560
 but at this point, the wind pressure is so much that he can't even get the door shut. Now he's

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.840
 trying to hold the door shut of the walk-in freezer. There's a bungee cord that is used in

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.040
 the operation. That's not how a walk-in freezer is supposed to be used. There's a bungee cord that

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.560
 this place used for whatever way to kind of rig it to make it easier to use. He has the bungee cord

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.840
 wrapped around his arm. He's holding the door shut. He has 15 employees behind him huddled in

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.440
 the walk-in freezer and he's holding it. He's holding it. The tornado reaches the pizza hut and

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:34.120
 the force of the wind opens the walk-in freezer door. Because his arm is strapped to the door,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.640
 he flies out with it. The bungee cord snaps and this pizza hut manager gets sucked up into the

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:46.840
 tornado. Now I gotta say this. I was thinking when I thought of that, I go, "That's actually a pretty

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:56.040
 awesome way to go." I'm not being joking either. Christopher, quick thinking, saved 15 people.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:03.000
 But if I had to choose between falling off of a mile high building or getting sucked into a mile

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.360
 wide tornado tornado any day, that'd be way cooler than drowning. I mean, you figure you're

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.480
 going to spin around a lot and you're going to yell. I'm sorry if someone from his family

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:20.600
 is listening to this. I'm not again making light of this. But I think that's dope. I think that he

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:28.920
 probably went out having a good time. Because it's a once in a lifetime experience. Again,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.720
 not many people can say they died in a tornado. When he's walking around in heaven and he's like,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.680
 "Hey dude, how'd you die? That's what they do in heaven. That's how they greet each other."

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.720
 Hey, how'd you die? And some guys are like, "Oh, heart attack. Talking to all these people."

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.880
 How many people can say they died in a tornado? And you're flying around. It's probably super loud.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:51.400
 I don't think it's probably super loud. It is super loud. But then as you're flying around,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:58.040
 I'm assuming what kills you is you bumping into other things, like cows and couches and other

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:04.120
 things that start with CO, cobwebs. You're bumping and all this stuff. And that probably kills you.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.560
 Like SUVs flying around. You hit it. You get in the SUV and you're like, "Woo!" And you lean back

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.800
 in the seat and the SUVs flying around. Or you just get thrown out of the tornado to a certain

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.520
 point. Or it just spins you around so much that you just kind of give up. You're like, "I'm dead."

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.920
 I'm not joking. I've thought about that. I would rather die jumping in a volcano.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.160
 And I didn't think about how cool it would be to die in a tornado until I read that story. But

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.920
 jumping in a volcano would be dope. Dying in a tornado would be pretty cool. Hurricane would

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.240
 be kind of lame because that's just like you standing on one location and then you're somewhere

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.200
 else. And dead. Because you know, like the wind blows you super hard or like it blows a tree down

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.960
 and falls on you. Blah. Lame. That gets a zero on the Jason Deto meter. But tornado would be dope

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:55.480
 because you just kind of spin around. Falling would suck. Drowning would suck. Burning would suck.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.040
 But see the volcano, you just like are kind of dope. How many people get to say they died in a

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.120
 volcano? There'd be a bunch of virgins down there. And be like, "Hey girls, what's going on?"

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:14.360
 Where? Oh yeah. So this is Mon Jason's death death-o-meter podcast. I got I got a little

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:22.120
 distracted there. Anyway, so this tornado hits and totally levels the town. 6900 houses were destroyed.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.440
 2000 buildings were destroyed. It really, really demolished Joplin. And some estimates say 25%

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:37.960
 of the city was destroyed during this. 161 people were killed. 1150 people were injured. Here's two

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.080
 weird tidbits before we get into the weirdest part of the story. The Piccadilly Circus was

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.840
 traveling through town and they were doing a vote count. They were going to recount the votes of

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:53.960
 the past election. And the Piccadilly Circus showed up. And while the Piccadilly Circus was in

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.320
 Joplin, this tornado hit so they can't perform obviously. They were like, "Look at our death-defying

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.280
 stunts!" And everyone's like, "Boring, boring. We just survived one of the worst tornadoes in human

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.800
 history." But because the Piccadilly Circus was there, they actually had elephants that they used

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.720
 to help move debris so first responders could get through. So basically that would be, I would be out

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.000
 there like just clapping and saluting an elephant as they're like pushing trees around. The guys

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.120
 are like, "Get out of the way! I'm trying to clear the road. I'm just standing in the middle of the

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.600
 road saluting them. Throwing peanuts to them. They're like, " quit distracting the elephants!"

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.720
 Ambulances are waiting. I'm like, "Make them dance! Make them dance!" This is probably the most

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:40.840
 like-hearted podcast you'll ever hear about the Joplin tornado. Here's another odd one. The day after

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.440
 the tornado, so the elephants have moved all the debris around. There's a police officer helping

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:52.440
 with the recovery efforts. You get struck by lightning and killed. Could you imagine that?

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:59.000
 That would suck. On the death- on the death-ometer, lightning would be kind of cool, but imagine

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.760
 you're like working with your buddy, you're working with your partner, and you're trying to like move

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:10.280
 debris around to save someone, and you hear a "Ka-Ka!" And you look over and your coworker is smoldering.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:18.680
 Not like he is smoldering gonna look, not like he's sexy, but he's dead and smoky and stuff.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.360
 That would be- oh my- and you'd be like, "What next? What could possibly go wrong?"

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.000
 Well, that's a good segue for where we're headed. Kyler, let's go ahead and hop in the

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.640
 Jason Jalopy. We're gonna take a little tour through the town of Joplin. You're like, "Jason,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:41.480
 are you gonna keep cracking jokes and raiding their deaths?" No! I'm not gonna do that. Kyler,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.960
 why would you think- why would you think such a thing? The velocity wrapped in the back seats,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.440
 shaking its head, it's like, "Ugh." I got a lot of this information we're gonna talk about from

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.960
 an article in the- this journalist is like, "Please, please don't reference me." There's an article

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:02.280
 written by Todd C. Frankel for the St. Louis Dispatch. So 25% of the city was destroyed by

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:08.920
 some estimates. You had entire families wiped out. Devastating natural disaster, but then you

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:14.600
 started hearing the stories of survival. People who were huddled in a bathtub, the house gripped

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.960
 apart all around them. One family, they got underneath a mattress and the mom held onto it

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.760
 as tightly as she could and the house was just being torn to shreds all around them. You have a

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.200
 story of a three-year-old girl and her mom. They're trying to outrun the tornado in their car. They

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.240
 can't. It's just too massive. There's a house and they figure, "Let's jump out of the car. Let's try

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:41.080
 to get into that house. Hopefully someone will open the door. We're out of options." And so the mom

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.560
 and her daughter jump out of the car and they're running and the tornado is right on top of them.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:51.560
 The mother throws the daughter into a ditch and jumps on top of her daughter and that tornado passes

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:58.760
 over them. It picks up their car and the car begins to roll towards the ditch. And the mom is just

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:06.200
 holding on to her daughter, praying for a miracle. And the car doesn't crush them. The tornado doesn't

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:12.360
 whip them out of the hole. It simply passes them over. After the danger has passed, the little girl

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:19.400
 turns to her mom and says, "Did you see them, mommy? Did you see them?" The mom's like, "What?"

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:25.960
 She's wiping splinters out of her eye. She's like, "I can't see anything. Did you see them, mommy? They

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:33.880
 saved us." The mom's like, "Who? Who saved us?" The little girl goes, "The butterfly people. They

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:40.440
 use their wings to make the debris." She knows the word debris. She's three years old. "The debris,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:48.520
 all of the stuff in the tornado, they protected us." As people are digging out of the rubble, as people

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:55.560
 are kind of walking around this destroyed landscape, they start hearing the same story over and over

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:03.000
 again. Children were saying that they had seen the butterfly people. Now, all the stories had a few

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.480
 things in common. One, these things could only be seen by kids. Two, they showed up in a way to protect

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:17.080
 people. A lot of times they used their wings. And three, I shouldn't say all the stories shared this,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:24.040
 but you saw this a lot. A lot of the stories weren't firsthand. People were saying, "I heard that Mollie

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:30.200
 down the street was protected by a butterfly person." Or, "Did you hear the story about the story that I

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.640
 told you is a popular one? This happened a little, but no one can say that they were the girl in the

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.920
 ditch. They were the mom on top of the girl." Anything like that. It was always a third-hand story. Some

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.520
 kids, though, said, "Oh, no, no, no, I saw them. I did see the butterfly people, and they used their

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:52.040
 wings to protect us from debris." And some of the kids said, "Not only do they see the butterfly

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.960
 people protect them, they saw the butterfly people flying around in the tornado and grabbing people

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.760
 who had been trapped in the tornado and flying them off into the sky." It's an interesting

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:08.920
 observation because we have a town here that was hit by this tornado 22 miles of destruction.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:15.640
 I think I said 20 earlier. 22 miles of destruction. 161 people killed, 1150 people injured. The

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:24.280
 population of the town was over 50,000 people. 2,000 buildings leveled, 6,900 homes destroyed,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:31.160
 50,000 people. You only had a casualty count of 161 people. This town is also located squarely in the

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:37.080
 what's known as the Bible Belt, so it's a fairly religious area. The idea of these children seeing

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.360
 angel-like figures, part of it could be their religious upbringing, part of it could be people

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:49.400
 overall trying to make sense over how could you lose so little lives? In a town with 50,000 people

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.160
 it's such massive destruction. There must have been somebody looking out for us. Now obviously,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:17:00.120
 the other counterpoint is why don't these angelic beings, why didn't they save everybody? That's

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.080
 always a question when we look at natural disasters. That's a philosophical question.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:12.040
 But it is interesting to note that in this story only the children could see the butterfly people

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.480
 as how they described them. I did a story a while back about a guy who walked into a school with his

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:23.400
 wife. They took the school hostage and he had built this bomb and he was going to blow up the kids

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.080
 if he didn't get his money. It's actually a really good episode. I'll put it in the show notes.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:32.840
 It's one of my favorites. And in that story, angels showed up in the classroom, but only the kids

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.000
 could see them. You guys remember that? The angels showed up in the classroom and they were calming

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.640
 the children down and telling them what to do and getting it before the events were playing out,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.040
 the angels were kind of like giving them advice. And it was something only the children could see

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.680
 and it wasn't until afterwards when the children were being interviewed they talked about the angels.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:55.960
 So it's an interesting connection to that. These children who are in danger. And even

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.760
 we did the story about the blue lady in Miami. That's another great episode, Myths Over Miami.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:07.240
 I'll put that in the show notes where it's only the children who are seeing these angelic figures

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.120
 that are interacting in their daily lives. Was there actually any butterfly people there?

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.240
 Were they figments of the imagination? Were they actually angels? Were they something else?

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:23.880
 Who knows, right? It's an interesting story nonetheless. It's either mass hysteria to explain

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:30.600
 why so few people died in such a massive event or it's an actual phenomenon that there is some

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.640
 external force trying to save people or it's somewhere in between. Maybe it's tulpas, maybe it's

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:44.040
 people, children creating these images that become real because they want so badly to be saved from

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.840
 the evils of the world around them. But whatever the reason, it truly is a miracle that more people

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.560
 didn't die during such a massive disaster. Kyler, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys of

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.360
 the carboner copter. We have helped them rebuild. I now have a pet elephant. I'm feeding it all the

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.640
 peanuts at once. We're going to put the elephant onto the carboner copter. Let's leave behind

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:15.400
 Joplin, Missouri. We are headed out to small town USA. In small town USA, there's a 22-year-old woman.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:21.400
 We don't know her name. We're going to call her Becca. And her 24-year-old boyfriend, we'll call

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:28.520
 him Robert. They've been dating for four years. Everything has been going great. But in the past

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:35.240
 six weeks, Becca's noticed that Robert's been acting a little weird. Just something seems off.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.280
 "Bye honey, I have to go to work," Becca says as she opens the front door.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:48.600
 She looks out and in her garden, she sees a fresh piece of fruit. Now that's normally not,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.960
 that normally means you have a successful garden. But this was a fresh piece of fruit that was chopped

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.720
 up. Just laying there. Store-bought fruit. And so she asks Robert, "Hey, do you know why there's

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:08.680
 some fruit in the garden?" And Robert goes, "Oh yeah, I'm sorry." Becca, I don't know how to say this,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.120
 but there's a little family of mice in the shed. And I don't know. They look so cute. You know,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:20.520
 like the mama and the daddy and all the 300 babies. I wanted to feed them. So I was chopping up little

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.360
 pieces of fruit and leaving out in the garden. And then at night, the little mice come out,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.720
 eat it. And Becca goes, "That's kind of sweet actually. That's kind of cute." Becca herself

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:35.400
 is into exotic pets. I don't know if a mouse can't an exotic pet. A wild mouse in your shed is exotic.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:42.440
 But Becca herself has exotic pets. She actually has giant African land snails that walk around

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.960
 this terrarium. Blah, blah, blah, blah, doing snail stuff. So she's like, "Oh, that's really cute."

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.360
 Right? A couple weeks later, Robert starts this new hobby. He begins to cook for her.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:58.280
 "I just love, I'm struck with a passion for cooking. I was out late at one night. A chef bit me. Now,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:03.480
 every full moon I am forced to cook. He's cooking all the time. It's just this weird sudden change

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.320
 for him. He's making these meals. He's baking cakes, making pies, all this stuff. And she loves it.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:14.680
 What woman doesn't want her man to be a great cook?" So she's totally down with it. But after a while,

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:20.680
 she starts to realize that maybe, maybe not all men are meant to be cooked. Sometimes when she

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.640
 eats the food, she gets sick afterwards. But she doesn't make the connections. She just goes, "Maybe.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:32.200
 I'm just tired." Right? And she's throwing up. She's like, "Bleh." You know what they say? If you throw

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:38.440
 up twice, time for a nap. Bleh." So she figures maybe it's just like hormones or that she's tired

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.560
 or something like she doesn't not really thinking about it. But one day she's at work. She works at

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.920
 a coffee shop and her boyfriend's friend will call him Jerry, walks into the coffee shop and goes,

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.160
 "Hey, Becca. Can I talk to you?" And she's like, "Yeah. My break's coming up right now. Let's go ahead."

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.360
 And Jerry goes, "Listen, Becca. I don't really know how to tell you this. So I'm just going to come out

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:05.400
 and say it." He starts laughing. He starts laughing like me, like I would. He goes, "You know how

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.280
 Robert's been making you a lot of food lately?" And she's like, "Yeah. Yeah. He's been making me

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:16.600
 tons of stuff. Cakes and pies and pasta and Jerry's like, "Please stop. Please stop. Don't go on any

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:23.160
 further." Jerry goes, "Listen, Robert thinks this is hilarious, but I don't. That's why I'm telling you

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:30.920
 this. He's been taking fresh pieces of fruit and leaving it out in the garden to attract slugs.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:39.400
 And then he takes the slugs and he chops them up and he puts them in your food."

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:46.920
 She goes, "What are you talking about?" And he goes, "Because I don't want to repeat it, right?

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.840
 I don't want to repeat it. Because now when I think of apple pie, I just think of slugs with

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.760
 cinnamon on them. Because that's what apple pie looks like anyways, because I don't want to repeat

00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:02.040
 it." She doesn't believe him and he goes, "I figured you wouldn't." He shows her photos of a jar of

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:12.360
 slugs and then slugs in a blender. We're halfway through this. Slugs in a blender is the halfway

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:19.800
 point. So she's obviously disgusted. She's also deeply in love with this man. She's 22-year-old

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.680
 woman. She's in love with this man. She's not really thinking. So this post first showed up on

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.920
 like an advice board or something like that where she's asking this question. She goes,

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:35.240
 "I don't know what to do. I confronted my boyfriend about feeding me slugs. She didn't

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.600
 rat out that the friend told her. So he said, because she said I saw photos of it and he goes,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.760
 'Have you been sneaking around? My messages are in my face,' which is kind of bearing the lead.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:50.040
 If you're feeding somebody slugs and even if they did hack your account, you can't get all

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.760
 indignant about it and be like, 'What? You violated my privacy.' And you'd be like, 'Yeah, you're poisoning

00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:00.760
 me with slugs.' Anyway, she ends up with going, 'He's mad at me because I'm mad at him for feeding

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.800
 me slugs and I don't know how to deal with this. Please give me advice.' People were like,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:12.600
 there is no advice. Just leave him. Just absolutely leave him. She does post an update later

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:19.400
 where she had to go to urgent care because she had gotten really sick. It turns out she had a high

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:28.200
 level of metaldehyde in her system, which is a pesticide that is often used to kill slugs and

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:34.600
 snails. So the slugs and snails that she was eating were already poisoned themselves. She goes to

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.480
 urgent care, she's feeling sick, she has ulcers, they test her for that. The police are called by

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.880
 the medical authorities. She doesn't call the police apparently. The urgent care people do,

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.840
 because they will do that. And Robert refuses to talk to the cops. She doesn't seem to press charges

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.480
 as far as we can tell in this narrative, but he refuses to talk to the cops. He's basically like,

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.520
 'I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not feeding anyone slugs.' They're like,

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.160
 'Why would that even...?' The cops are looking at each other like, 'Seriously? We're on the slug

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.040
 beat now. We're investigating slug crimes.' Because she doesn't really press charges and

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.360
 he doesn't fess up to anything. They can't do much. But so Robert says, 'Okay, listen, we'll

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:16.920
 forget the whole law enforcement thing, Becca. Let's sit down and we will talk this through.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:23.240
 I'll bring the snacks. I will bring delicious, delicious snacks.' They have this meeting,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.800
 so it's him and Becca and then Robert's friend, who I don't know if it's the same guy ratting

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.160
 him out. It just says Robert's friend and then Becca brings a friend as well. So they have this

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:37.320
 little pal well. And Robert confesses everything. He goes, 'Listen, I want to be honest with you.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.200
 I don't know why I'm doing this stuff. I have a compulsion to do it. It's kind of like an OCD

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.720
 type of thing. I just have to do it.' And Becca's like, 'I can understand that.' She actually does

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:53.960
 say that. I can understand that because she also has some issues emotionally. She understands the

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.800
 need to do things. He goes, 'I don't know why I do this. I love you, baby. I love you so much.'

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:04.920
 And she goes, 'No, I understand. Maybe I know people have a compulsion to feed other people slugs.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.320
 I'm sure that somebody's fetish.' And he goes, 'Well, I've done more than that.'

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:18.440
 It started off before the slugs when she wasn't looking. He's like, 'Look over there, a bird.'

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.160
 And she turns, he would spit on her toast. That was the first thing he started doing.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.600
 When she wasn't around and she made toast, he would spit on it. Now that's gross, but that's not

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:35.080
 too bad, right? I mean, I think at this point, all of us have eaten food with someone spitting it,

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.880
 either intentionally or unintentionally. You're rude to a waiter. They're spitting in your food.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.360
 Or they're just talking a lot. They're spitting in your food. That's gross, but it's not into the

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:50.520
 world gross. He also then admits to replacing her beta blockers, which is medication to regulate

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:57.480
 the beat of your heart with salt. With salt, the one thing that if you get too much of actually

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.480
 affects the rhythm of your heart, well, it's not the one thing, but it's one of the things

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.840
 you got to be careful of. So he was replacing her beta blockers, her heart medication with salt.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.240
 You just wanted to see what would happen. We then moved to this level. She's a vegetarian

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:17.240
 and he begins to replace her vegetarian products with meat products. She's like, oh my god,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.600
 this is so delicious. This is the best vegetarian meal I've ever eaten. He goes, you mean you've ever

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:29.800
 meatin'. She's like, what? That's not even a word. She had vegetarian sausage. He replaced that with

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.760
 real sausage. Same with chicken nuggets. She's like, oh my god, these are so good. These are the

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:41.320
 most delicious vegetarian foods on the planet. Then he made her curry. Makes her delicious curry.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.400
 And this is when she said that he started to get weird. This is one of the warning signs.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.600
 He made curry and she's eating it and whenever she would go to take a bite of it, he would start

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:58.920
 laughing. She's like, what? She go to take a bite of it. She puts the spoon down. He's like,

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:06.760
 go see eat it again. He's the grip keeper all of a sudden. And it starts to make her paranoid.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.080
 She can't figure out why he starts to laugh every time she goes to eat curry. So she's like,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.160
 I don't want to eat curry and she leaves the kitchen. She goes into the bedroom and they have

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.200
 this fight and he goes, come on, just try the curry and she takes a bite and is super spicy.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:25.320
 And he starts laughing. He goes, yeah, I put so much chili powder in there. Oh, I'm so sorry,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.080
 but I thought it'd be a funny joke to like make it super spicy. That's why he was laughing every

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:36.040
 time she went to take a bite. You think, you know what? That's just a prank. That's not even close

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.320
 to spitting on someone's toast or feeding them delicious meat. Well, that's what he told her

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:47.560
 back then. Now he's given her the whole story. Remember her giant African land snails? One of

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.440
 them had run away. We've gone hard for a giant snail. One of them though had gotten out of the

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:58.600
 box and she can never find it. Well, it turns out that he said he came home one day and it was dead.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:06.520
 So he took it out of the terrarium, chopped it up and put it in the curry. That was the very

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:14.600
 first time he fed her. Molesk was her own pet. Let's be honest, he probably didn't come home

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:22.120
 and it was dead. He probably killed it. So he tried feeding her her own pet

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:28.040
 and couldn't contain his laughter as she was about to eat it. And she goes, I think he put

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:33.560
 on so much chili to kind of get rid of the taste. She's like, I know my Molesk. I could taste the

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.360
 snail from a mile away. She thinks he put the chili on to disguise the taste of the snail.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:44.520
 He said at one point he took her tooth. You're like, Jason, please stop. He stopped. At one point

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:51.560
 he took her toothbrush and rubbed it on the toilet. But he said he felt bad about that and washed it

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:58.520
 off, which I'd call shenanigans on that one because one, just by a toothbrush, right? Like if

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.920
 someone took your toothbrush and you saw them rubbing on the toilet and they go, sorry, and they

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:09.000
 just ran it underneath the water for a bit, it's not clean. Right? You got to get rid of the toothbrush.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.960
 There's no amount of cleaning you can do to get rid of that. And he probably didn't do that. I'm

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:19.320
 imagining he read the room on that one. I'm imagining he said that and the look of horror

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.240
 in the other three people's faces. He goes, oh no, no, no, no, but I washed that one off.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:29.800
 But you would have to boil it to get rid of all of that. He says he doesn't know why he does it.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:37.320
 It's a compulsion. He loves her. He hopes that they can work it out. He'll make a delicious meal

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:42.280
 for everyone at the party. He goes, guys, let's have lasagna or beef stroganoff or anything

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:48.680
 else. I can hide disgusting things and everyone's like, no. Later on in another post, she does reveal

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:58.040
 that she left him. But now she has a intense fear of slugs. She's afraid of leaving food out. She

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.080
 has to eat the food that's in front of her. She can't get up and get a phone call or start making

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.520
 a meal and leave. Not like that happens all the time, but think about it. How many times do you

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:12.040
 have the day like, I make my meal in stages? I'll be cooking it. It's not really stages. I'll be

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.960
 cooking it and then I'll go and I'll lift weights and then I'll go and I'll get, but imagine while

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.760
 I'm lifting those weights, a slug crawls across my food. That's what she's afraid of. She's afraid

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:27.960
 of slugs crawling across her food. She says that slug, this is the weird part. This is the weird

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:34.760
 part. She has a problem with slugs invading her house. She goes, I find them everywhere. She goes,

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.520
 I see them coming into the house all the time. She goes, I've had to seal all the gaps. She has

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.480
 an intense fear of it. Now some of it may be just every so often a snail comes through or a slug

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:51.560
 comes through and she's blowing it up in her mind or she thinks that nature itself is coming after

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:59.000
 her. That slugs are being drawn to her presence. That's a little creepy. That's little tails from

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.520
 the dark side ending for you, right? She ate so many slugs that now they're always inching towards

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:11.880
 her. It's like it follows, but it's called it swallows and it ends with her swallowing slugs.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:18.760
 She's laying in bed one night and it's just 1300 slugs crawling into her gullet. She can't even

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:28.200
 chew them up. They're so in her mouth she can't even close her jaws. But I mean that's an imaginary

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:34.120
 scenario. Super disgusting imaginary scenario. She's suffocated by all the slugs. But this is where

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:40.040
 it gets even creepier than my imaginary. Every slug in the world will eventually crawl in her body.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.640
 After she breaks up with her boyfriend it had been a while. She broke up with her boyfriend.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.080
 He moved out of the house. She's living alone. She's afraid of these slugs coming in.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:53.960
 One day she's doing some cleaning in the kitchen. She finds a jar. She's posted a photograph of this.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:33:02.760
 It's a jar of four dead slugs. She goes, "He must have left these here. He must have caught these

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:09.720
 and these were slugs he never fed me. They look old. They look dead. He must have left them here."

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.440
 And it's interesting because it's almost like she's trying to convince herself

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:22.440
 that somehow her boyfriend didn't recently sneak into her house while she was gone

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:33.000
 and leave four dead slugs hidden in her kitchen. Who's to say that when she's not at home

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:40.040
 he's somehow getting into the house and planting slugs all over the place.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:45.240
 Now this story could obviously be made up. It could be some sort of internet myth.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:53.080
 The username on these posts are blanked out for the woman's privacy. But even if they weren't

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.920
 it could be a lark. It could be made up. But we know well enough that there's a bunch of sickos out there.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:07.400
 So this story doesn't break the bounds of the imagination. So if it is true, this guy is still

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:16.680
 out there. This guy is somebody's boyfriend. This guy is somebody's coworker. This guy is somebody

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:30.040
 you may know. Someone who gets off on chopping up slugs and putting them in food. Possibly your food

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:39.800
 right? You may know this guy or someone like him. Someone who seems totally normal but just

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:47.640
 wants to run a few tests, pull a few pranks, have a secret laugh at your expense. They could be your

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:54.520
 neighbor. They could be your minister. They could be the cook at your favorite restaurant.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:01.160
 So somewhere out there is a man with a gleam in his eye, smile on his face,

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:10.360
 a pocket full of slugs, and a chef's hat. You may think you're about to sit down and enjoy

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:16.920
 a delicious meal and maybe you will. Maybe you'll find out that for you the most delicious food on
