WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Could we soon be facing a crime wave of cuddly criminals?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.560
 And then we travel to Connecticut to meet five teenagers with attitude

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.520
 out practicing their martial arts late one night.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.920
 They thought they were just gonna have some fun throwing kicks in the air.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.400
 Instead they go toe to toe with the demonic force today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:34.200
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.560
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.680
 We got a lot of stuff to cover here so we're gonna get started. We got some

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.880
 breaking news coming but first off I want to give a shout out to our latest

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.000
 Tommy let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable. We're

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.160
 gonna take a little flight. This is a breaking story. I didn't plan on doing

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.320
 this but it just popped up today. Let's go ahead and fly on over to Rochester,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.080
 Indiana. That's the Durgable flying over. We're not gonna be here long so

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.440
 you know take your tourist pictures now. If there's anything to see in Rochester,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.760
 Indiana I'm not for sure but we're here because these two num schools,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.800
 John L. Schultz the fourth. That means there was three preceding this guy. The

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.200
 three stooge isn't in this guy and then Donald V. Robin Jr. Allegedly, allegedly

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.480
 these two guys decided to shoot up two schools. These two idiots thought it

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.680
 would be a great idea to go shoot up two schools just as the school year

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.760
 starting and things like that. Somebody, they were telling friends because they're

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.320
 so cool and they're like bragging about it and stuff and then one of their

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.480
 friends who was a who wasn't an idiot alerted authorities and both these

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.240
 people got arrested. Yes it is all alleged so they're allegedly num schools. I do

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.560
 think it's funny though that they went and bought trench coats because they

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.720
 wanted to be like the Columbine dudes. They even have tattoos of Columbine

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.400
 quotes on their arms. Allegedly I mean I guess that's provable right? I'm like hey

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 dude show me your arm and he's like I will allegedly lift up my sleeve. I'm

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.760
 like whatever just show me your arm. Anyways these two guys are in jail. They

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.080
 had trench coats. They had that's not all. They actually had more stuff. It's just like

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.240
 there's a bunch of guys who don't like the rain and the cops are like oh boy oh

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.280
 wait and they're resting them. Guys were bragging they had access to guns and all

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.640
 that stuff so the cops made a move and they have arrested them so far and then

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.520
 the county prosecutor goes listen it could be a case of free speech. It was

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.480
 an interesting thing. The prosecutor's like it's really the prosecutor goes

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.200
 basically when you're talking about like Columbine and worshiping. Let me read you

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.640
 the actual quote because it's such a bizarre quote. This is from Fulton

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.120
 County prosecutor Michael Mars. He said so I mean anytime anyone's obsessed with

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.520
 Columbine yes it's a fine line between free speech and when you cross the line

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.600
 but I think in this case clearly what they had done was going to interfere with

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.600
 the occupancy of a school. So even the prosecutors like yeah I get it they

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.880
 could just be larping. They actually probably see a lot of that in law

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.560
 enforcement. People have been like oh I'm gonna make them pay. I'm gonna make them all pay and

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.680
 then the cops investigated and it's just like an edgy blog on Tumblr right. And

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.120
 the prosecutor again yeah they must come across this a lot. That's a very weird

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.240
 quote from a county prosecutor. He's like yeah you know when it comes to

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.360
 Columbine sometimes people just really like Columbine but this was more than

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.560
 that. So the way that this is going to anyways that is the numbskull of the week

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.240
 that's my new segment. That's my new segment. It starts and ends today. If you

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.680
 want to know more about these guys and their trench coat purchasing history

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.800
 it'll be in the show notes. Okay let's go ahead and move to the actual first

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.520
 story. Tommy or flying that dead rabbit dirgeable away from Indiana we are headed

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.680
 out to Sri Lanka. This is a story that popped up the other day. The ramification

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.320
 the story itself is kind of cute. The ramifications of it can be terrifying.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.160
 Dirgeable going all the way to Sri Lanka. We're gonna go to Aruna Sri Lanka

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.760
 specifically in Aruna. There is the Wellicotta prison. It's high security

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.720
 prison. It's where they put all their big bad guys in Sri Lanka. It's July 2020.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.000
 This just happened last month. Normal day at a prison at a high security prison.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.800
 As normal as a day you can have in a high security prison. A cat breaks into the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.400
 perimeter. Not a big deal right? Cats and rats and stuff like that are always

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.440
 hanging out at prisons. A lot of people adopt them as friends or a little extra

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.520
 snack on the side. You know a tasty black rat to supplement your top ramen and

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.600
 cheese and crackers. But this cat was no ordinary cat. This cat was a heroin

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.280
 smuggler. Now when I first read that I thought that's dope right? And then when

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.280
 I kept reading the article I go that's even doper than I originally thought.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.880
 Because not only was this cat this cat just wasn't just didn't have it some

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.320
 heroin on him and happened into the prison. He knew exactly what cell block to

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.720
 go to. There is a cartel that has been smuggling contraband into the prison.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.200
 Specifically this cat had two grams of heroin, some sim cards, and a microchip.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.960
 Apparently so a Dr. Mindbender could finish building some sort of device to

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.400
 help Cobra Commander escape. When's the last time you've even heard the term

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.120
 microchip? But anyways this cat is smuggling in a microchip, a couple sim

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.920
 cards, and two grams of heroin. You know like the guy who got the heroin was

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.160
 like oh this is so awesome. And then the other guy who gets the sim cards he's

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.400
 like ah this is okay but I have some heroin. And then the guy who gets the

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.360
 microchip is like the total nerd of the prison. Everyone's like boo throwing stuff

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.480
 at him. He drops his microchip he's like oh no I'll never find it now. Anyways this

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.280
 cat gets arrested for smuggling this stuff in. The question is how many times

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.600
 did this cat actually successfully smuggle stuff in? And the authorities are

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.680
 like okay here's the plan. We're not actually gonna press charges against the

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.920
 cat because that's foolish but we can follow the cat back to its hideout and

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.800
 then we'll arrest the people who trained the cat. Good plan right? But before they

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.800
 could do that guards at a high security prison mind you this is the level of

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.840
 the level of the employees at this high security prison guards going to feed the

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.060
 cat opened the door and the cat ran out. So I don't know how many prisoners

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.920
 escaped from this prison on any day right? The guards are like lunchtime

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.880
 people are just scattering in every direction they're like oh no anyways and

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.840
 the authorities they go ah the cat's gone we can't really track it but this is

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.160
 what makes this story even more bizarre. They know the cartel that trained the

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.040
 cat because they know where it was going and dropping the stuff off and no joke.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.520
 In this article I'm reading this article this same cartel previously before

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.320
 using the cat had trained an eagle to fly over the prison and drop stuff into

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.280
 the yard. Now in America we've been having an issue with drones flying over

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.960
 prisons and dropping off contraband that's cool because it's kind of like

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.640
 futuristic but I'd much rather have an eagle dropping me stuff off.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.120
 Your clout in prison would be so high if you're just like standing out there

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.640
 playing a little basketball in here and everyone looks up and they're like oh

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.200
 yeah Johnny's getting a delivery today and then a little baggy you just hold

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.480
 your hand out. A baggy falls in your hand. You might not want to be that obvious about it

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.480
 because then the guards are like they hear the eagle screeching they're like

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.720
 oh get ready to arrest Johnny he's gonna have a handful of microchips. It's so

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.800
 funny because I read that and I was like dude that's super dope. They did end up

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.720
 catching the eagle. They caught the eagle. They went to like they had found the

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.000
 eagle before they'd seen the eagle flying around and they did a raid on the

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.800
 cartel and there was just like an eagle in a cage and they're like hey we

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.100
 recognize you. Eagles like gulp. Then I go I wonder if there are other like

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.440
 criminal animals and stuff so I went to this article about it's like nine

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.880
 wacky animal criminals. That's exactly what it sounds like when you read the

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.720
 article in your head and it was like this alligator. I was like oh this is dope dude.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.760
 What does alligator do? It's all this alligator is a home invader. It broke into

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:40.480
 a dood house. I'm like that's not a crime. That's not a crime. I mean it is. I can't do that.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.960
 That's just an alligator. It doesn't know what a house is. It's just breaking in.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.440
 They had a, here's a better one. They had a bird who would sit outside of this

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.200
 gas station like this Aldi's in England or something like that.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.200
 Do you like my notes? Do you like my notes for this segment? There's this bird who

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.000
 would sit on the sidewalk and the doors would open and close automatically and

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.920
 he would just sit there and then once he like had a moment he'd fly into the

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.080
 store grab a bag of chips and then fly out and eat them. There okay that's kind

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.400
 of more what I'm talking about but I started to think remember back in the

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.160
 day you don't because we're not a hundred years old but remember like hearing

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.360
 about like the monkey grinders was that there were monkey grinders. They were the

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.000
 organ grinders that had monkeys. The monkey grinders is something totally

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.120
 different. Pay me a dime and I'll grind this monkey right in front of you lad.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.320
 You know what I'm talking about like not that but you give the old man a dime and

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:45.940
 And he plays the box thing goes do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do He's like cranking it and then the little monkey dances for you

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:51.700
 You're like, no Jason. I was not born in the year 1890. I don't remember that

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:58.180
 I've seen it on movies and read about it in books. Those little monkey men we're trained to like pick pockets

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.300
 They're like taking money out of your pocket according to a rinsed to a rintent in comic I saw so

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.360
 There my here's my thing with this whole thing. Yes, I am going somewhere with this

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:14.980
 We have animals that just do animal things like a bear is not a criminal if it breaks into your car and steals all your food

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.340
 It's just being a bear and then you can actually train an animal to be a criminal

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:25.440
 Where is the limit to that? You know the US military has trained

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:31.320
 I always thought this was one of the funniest stories the military the US military had bred these super smart dolphins and

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.360
 they would help detect mines like underwater mines and

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.760
 To be funny or like that's just you know like a dog can do that a swimming dog

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.940
 but these these

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:53.140
 Dolphins would were also trained so when Russian frogmen Soviet Union frogmen were like trying to spy at US military bases and stuff like that Navy

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:58.580
 Bases they would let these dolphins kind of just float around in the water and they would see a

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.240
 Frogman they would see like an underwater spy and they would crush their ribs

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.740
 They would poke them super hard in the ribs and you can't swim with broken ribs and you die now that might not be very funny

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:16.780
 You're like Jason that's terrible. That's how my uncle died. He was a frog man. I apologize

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:21.020
 But I always thought that was hilarious, but that's not even the funniest part of that story

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:26.180
 That's not even the funniest part of that story Tommy. Let's take this dead rabbit dirgeable out to New Orleans

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:35.020
 We're going to New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. That is where they actually had a training facility for these super smart

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.800
 Dolphins who was in New Orleans and it was connected to the sea

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.220
 But there was these giant walls because you know the military is like listen these things are hyper smart

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.540
 We've trained these things to kill people

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:54.380
 Whatever you do don't let them go and everyone's like yeah, of course, of course, we're not gonna let these genetically

00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:01.260
 I don't know if they're genetically modified. Okay wink wink nudge nudge. I'm pretty sure they were but they were quote-unquote trained

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.660
 Trained at the genetic level maybe but anyways super smart dolphins

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:12.100
 They were in this enclosure and everyone's like, okay, this has worked for like 20 years

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.800
 We've been able to keep these contained and then Hurricane Katrina showed up and everyone's like, ah, they're running away

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.460
 I remember reading about this at the time. It was a sparkle of joy during that time a horrible misery

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.100
 That was a horrible natural disaster

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:31.540
 But I remember laughing out loud when I came across this article as like the researchers and the people who worked the laboratory like oh

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:37.780
 No, what are we gonna do this this huge hurricanes coming and then it started flooding and then the floodwaters

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:43.040
 Started to get as tall as the wall of the dolphin holding pin

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:50.060
 And then it got taller and all the dolphins escaped all of these super smart dolphins

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.700
 escaped into the sea and I remember reading an article at the time and

00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:00.140
 The basically I'll see if I can try to find the article off definitely find an article on it

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:06.780
 But at the time I remember the military is like there's no way we're not gonna be able to catch these things

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:14.460
 They're super intelligent dolphins that were trained to like look for explosives and kill people

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.060
 You don't want those out there, right? And they just swam away

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.940
 Selectively bred and trained wink wink trained at a molecular level so they're out there

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.660
 So you I my thing is this is like you can train certain animals to commit crimes

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.300
 The cat doesn't know he's smuggling heroin right the eagle knows something's up

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.820
 He's a little fishy, but because he eats little fishies. Uh-uh you like that joke you don't but

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.780
 Anyways, I want to keep it in you haven't you can teach an animal to commit a crime

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.300
 They probably don't know what a crime is those dolphins know that they're murdering

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:54.620
 Russians like they they totally are aware of that could you get to the point where week you could train a rhino to smash open a bank vault

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.700
 You can actually train a rhino

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.620
 I think would be your first question

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.020
 But like you could have hippos and stuff because they're like bulletproof for the most part

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.260
 I mean cops aren't walking around with elephant guns

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.380
 You just like unleash hippos into a city and they're just like smashing cop cars and stuff like that

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.340
 And then you go in and you're just like robin banks and stuff like that

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:19.980
 Like could we get to a point where if the military is I've always said this I always say this is the first thing

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.980
 I say when I meet somebody

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:28.220
 Generally technology works like this first it works as a military application and then it works as a criminal application

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.140
 bulletproof vests

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.140
 Invented for the military and now

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:37.500
 You know 50 cent can wear one in a music video, but I mean you know like originally it's a military component

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.940
 And then it becomes a quote-unquote civilian thing

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.700
 Which can be used to protect civilians or to aid in a crime Tommy guns weren't invented for the army

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:52.140
 And then yeah people were writing their names on walls. I heart dick tracy just a couple years later

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:58.220
 If they're training these dolphins and now we see criminals also training the house pets basically

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.700
 To do these things will we reach a level where criminals are just like

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.340
 genetically modifying animals

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.060
 To commit crimes not just unleashing a cat with heroin on it, but like

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.620
 unleashing a cat

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.300
 It successfully delivers the heroin and as it's sneaking out of the prison it's all

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:22.460
 And the cat had a bunch of geckos sitting on the cat. So it was completely

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:28.700
 Camouflaged you can never see it although I guess at that point you probably just genetically modify a giant gecko

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.940
 But yeah, you could have a suit made of geckos and you're just walking around and no one can see you

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.220
 Everyone doesn't wonder what you have a thousand eyeballs

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.780
 Thousand little eyeballs on you, but you know it's modern art and you're just walking around it from perfectly blended in

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.980
 No one would know no one would know if it wasn't for that handful of microchips that you're holding

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.780
 Let's go ahead Tommy Davidson. We're gonna stop giving the criminal underworld ideas

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.580
 Let's hop in that carbonar copter. We are headed off to Manchester, Connecticut

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:05.420
 We're leaving behind a bunch of octopi they've taken over the city one of them is standing in the mayor's office

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.060
 The mayor's lay in motionless covered in ink

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.860
 A brave new world my friends a brave new world

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:18.380
 We're flying away. We're going to Manchester, Connecticut. It's november 6 1999

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:25.020
 It's 2 a.m. There's a man. He's sleeping at home. He's the reverend david w bowser senior

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.180
 He's sleeping at home with his wife and then

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.460
 reverend

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.460
 reverend reverend open up

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.220
 what

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:40.380
 He gets up and he walks through his house. He looks at the people and he sees two young men standing outside of his door

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:45.660
 It's 2 a.m. He thinks he recognizes one of them, but both of them are dressed in all black

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.260
 And he can see in the road is a car

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.900
 That contains three more men

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.460
 also dressed in all black and it seems that they have some sort of

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.580
 Is that a sword?

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.620
 Reverend open up. We need your help. Let's skip to a couple hours earlier

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.220
 It's the devil's hop yard state park in east hadam

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:14.460
 There's five young men there in the park. It's late at night one of them swinging a baseball bat

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.780
 Through the air the other one has a sword

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.340
 The guy with the baseball bat's like oh man. I can't wait till I get my allowance. I can buy a sword

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.980
 Guy with the swords practicing his sword moves

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:34.380
 One of the guys is hiding behind a tree. Can you see me yet? Yeah, I can kind of see you move move a little bit more behind the tree

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.100
 Can you see me now? No, I can't see you. Perfect. Perfect

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.940
 These five men are martial arts enthusiasts

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.660
 They just got done with a rigorous martial arts workout back in town

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.060
 But they said you know what if we really want to perfect our ninja moves

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.220
 We have to go to devil's hop yard state park

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.100
 This is something they did this wasn't like a spur of the moment thing

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.180
 They're like, what should we do dinnies or pretend we're ninjas tonight and they're like, hmm

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.900
 Well, we've never done the ninja thing. They've done this before

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.300
 I don't know if they've done it this specific location, but these five guys

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.100
 They were all 18 or older by the way

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.300
 Like to pretend they were ninjas they were training themselves in the martial arts to be fair

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.740
 But they also just like to pretend to be ninjas. So they would

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.260
 They're swinging the baseball bats. They would do that to build muscle

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.860
 Swing a baseball bat over and over and over again. You get big

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.340
 They saw their heroes mark maguire and josecan seiko get totally strong

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.020
 Just by swinging a baseball bat sammy sosa totally natural

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:42.540
 We actually believed that in 1999. I don't think they'd been exposed at that time, but

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:48.140
 Swinging them baseball bats now one of the guys there his name is paul punnitowski

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.260
 He's practicing his ninja moves having a good time with his friends

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.700
 Even if they're not going to be able to take on a roko sake anytime soon

00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:00.060
 It's still just a fun night with your friends. But while he's practicing his ninja moves he hears

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.780
 paul

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.700
 Here's his voice clearly call out from the darkness paul

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:11.500
 Leave now or you'll join us forever

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.460
 paul kind of pauses for a second looks around into the darkness

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.540
 But he's not the only one who hears it. Paul paul

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.500
 Leave now or you'll join us forever

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:31.020
 He stops him in his tracks and he asked whoa, did you say that what other friend goes no

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.380
 I I heard it too dude. I heard it too at that point

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.460
 Playtime's over right it you may not be the master of your ninja game

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.660
 But you can practice you can practice that at a ymca. It's time to leave a place called devil's hop yard

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.220
 They decide to leave todd silber. He's the oldest one of the group. He's 23 years old

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.620
 So get in his stuff together and he hears

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.020
 Oh

00:19:53.020 --> 00:20:01.100
 Joseph Robinson 18 years old he looks over it where there's a fence line

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.820
 And there's something sitting on it watching them

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.940
 He described it as beast like it definitely wasn't human

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:14.300
 More monster than man, but the one word he really used to describe it was

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.260
 a demon sitting on the fence

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.580
 Watching them everyone seems to be having their own

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.460
 little encounter with this

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:30.380
 element that's out there because when joseph goes hey guys guys guys guys guys guys

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:37.180
 I know you guys really want to pack. I really want to pack too, but what is that when paul looks over and sees

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:43.500
 What joseph is pointing at he says he sees a shadow with a jagged edge

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.940
 At this point they're on their way out right they're not gonna have arguments over whether or not

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:52.860
 It's a jagged shadow or a demon sitting on the fence. They're leaving at this point todd silber as he's getting up

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:58.140
 He actually gets attacked by this thing. He is picked up and throwing

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.180
 Through the air and crashes into a tree

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.180
 Whoa

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.100
 Okay guys, we really should have left. I know we really should have left when I heard that laughing

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.020
 I don't know why we stood around for that to happen todd silber looks down and there's

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:16.540
 Four claw marks on his pants. No. Oh man. My mom's totally gonna kill me

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.660
 She's bought me these the other day these ninja pants now

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.900
 They all get in the car and they're leaving behind devils hop yard. They all understand something supernatural happened there

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.060
 Sean sear. He was one of the kids in the car. He's 18 years old

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:34.700
 He's sitting there and he goes we need to go to my pastor's house. We need to go to my pastor's house

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.420
 And they're like what and he's like we need to go to my pastor's house

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:44.300
 We can't go home. You just can't go home something what we experienced. We need to be

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.340
 Blessed now. Everyone's like, why are you talking about what did you see Sean?

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.060
 Sean said

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.660
 nothing

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:59.740
 Sean said he would not he not that he couldn't that he would not describe what he saw

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:05.340
 Had devil's hop yard. He wouldn't he flat out refused. He goes but we are not going home

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:10.780
 You're not driving around at five driven houses and dropping us off and you can go home and play nintendo 64

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.900
 But you are taking us to my minister's house reverend bowser because

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.820
 This isn't over

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.740
 2 a.m. They show up at the house the two men outside the house is todd silver

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:28.860
 And Sean sear the other three guys are sitting in the car reverend bowser opens up the door and these two guys start blabbering about demons

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.740
 Again picked up. Oh my god. Look at my pants. Oh, dude. You won't believe what happened

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.220
 Sean sears like you got it. You I think it's still with us. I think this demon's still with us

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:43.660
 You got to take care of us and reverend bowser basically does the only thing someone can do when he's confronted by two ninjas and three more in the car

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.820
 He goes. Yeah. Yeah. Um wait right here. I'm gonna go

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.860
 Get my blessing tools. I'm gonna go give you my blessing stuff. He shuts the door

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.580
 calls the cops and says

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.020
 Hey, man, it's too. I got these kids outside

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.900
 They're not wearing masks, but everything else about them is ninja related

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.540
 And one of them has some ripped pants, which is kind of bizarre, but they're talking about demons and stuff like that

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.620
 Cops roll up

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:17.420
 And the dudes in the car did have swords. This was their inventory. They had a 38 inch samurai sword three knives a club

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.820
 four bats

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.820
 dark colored clothing and masks

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.060
 The cops are talking to the guys in the car

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.020
 Sean and totter out the door the minister comes back and he's like listen

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:31.340
 You guys just need to calm down. This is super weird. So I did call the cops

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:37.580
 But everything's fine and at that point the cop comes up to talk to todd and shon at the door with the minister

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:43.340
 Cop goes. Hey, I need to see your guys ID. That's standard procedure, right? I've been pulled over a hundred times

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.860
 I've had my ID popped a hundred times. It's just a standard procedure

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.940
 Sean

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.780
 starts to shake

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.780
 and then starts to resist

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.420
 the officers commands

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.500
 Now I don't know if they both took a position and then it was ninja versus cop training

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.700
 It was something dope like that. It was probably just two people kind of pushing each other, but

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:10.060
 There was definitely a scuffle todd's trying to break shon and the police officer up guys guys

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.220
 What are you doing? What are you doing? No, he's doing a flying jump kick. Why is it super dramatic?

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.980
 We'll just pretend it was right

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:22.220
 But it doesn't matter whether or not it was on the level of enter the dragon or it was just a guy getting pushed and then

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.220
 push another person because

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.620
 Sean ends up collapsing

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.540
 Everyone gets arrested right even Sean is just like laying there. Sean is having a

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:38.220
 Diabetic fit like low blood sugar or something like that. That's why he began shaking in the beginning

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.300
 And maybe maybe diabetics like fighting with police. I don't know

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.780
 But he had it had it was complications due to diabetes is what it was called

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.420
 He's treated for that

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.100
 cops arrest everyone

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:57.020
 Todd and Sean are charged with interfering with the police and all the friends were charged with breach of peace and carrying dangerous

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:02.780
 Weapon now like I said this happened back in 1999. It was in the newspaper. It was in the current

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.820
 Which is a newspaper out in Connecticut. It's all in the show notes

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.500
 So I don't know. I don't think these guys actually did any hard time for it

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.660
 I don't know if these guys are still in jail right now just waiting for their cat delivered heroine

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:19.180
 Probably not of these charges most likely probably got dropped on some level or another

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.660
 I don't know if Sean's been cured of his diabetes or if it's still something has to deal with but

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.540
 There's an interesting footnote to this whole story

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.060
 Sean starts scuffling with the cop. Let's go back to that part

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.660
 Sean shaking he starts scuffling with the cop. He collapses

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.260
 and that's all kind of chalked up to him having an issue with

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:42.300
 Um low blood sugar and shaking and all that stuff fighting with the cop again

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.380
 Maybe that's a normal diabetes symptom

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.380
 But afterwards his friends were like Sean why in the world?

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.580
 Did you think it would be a good idea to take on that cop?

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.500
 Why in the world after everything that had happened everything? We're just going to check our IDs

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.500
 Why'd you start fighting with the cops?

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.500
 And Sean looks over at him and goes

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.060
 That's what I saw

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.220
 They're like what he's like

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.580
 When we were at devil's hop yard remember I didn't tell anyone what I saw

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.140
 I saw this

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.700
 saw this thing

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:17.900
 And when the officer approached us at the doorstep he became that thing

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.100
 That wasn't a cop

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.100
 That came to that doorstep

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.260
 That was a demon

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:30.620
 It's possible that Sean was starting to have some sort of complications due to low blood sugar

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.460
 And hallucinating I don't know if that's a symptom of diabetes

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.260
 But a skeptic could say he was a low blood sugar high

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.260
 Adrenaline event

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.260
 All this stuff he's seen stuff

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.940
 Goes up on this cop

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.780
 But here's another more chilling way and we'll end it like this

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:51.260
 Sean was insistent that it wasn't over yet that they had to get blessed

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.340
 By the minister

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.980
 Couldn't just drop him off at home. This thing was loose

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:01.580
 They had to get blessed by the minister. So when they go to the minister's house, what doesn't happen?

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.260
 They don't get blessed

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.420
 What if Sean

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.700
 Was right and this thing did follow them out of the park

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:16.140
 Leave now or you'll join us forever is what the voice said at the park

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.780
 What would be the point of taking over an 18 year old pretend ninja?

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.060
 The minister himself would have protections from such possessions

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:29.660
 But if a patrol unit a cop car coming about to do his duty now that

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.580
 Is someone that a demon could have a lot of fun possessing

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.100
 By the time the police officer walks up to Sean and Todd

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.740
 It's already almost in full possession

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.860
 This demon is now free and in the body of a law enforcement officer

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.740
 And the only one who knows

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.900
 is Sean

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.900
 and his four friends

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:58.540
 They were training to be ninjas, but instead they found themselves on the front line of a supernatural invasion

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.340
 So the next time you're driving through town

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:06.220
 You see those red and blue lights behind you. You know, you haven't broken any traffic laws

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:13.500
 But you pull over it's weird because the cop car behind you looks older. It doesn't even look like one from this

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.060
 decade

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:21.100
 But the lights keep flashing and the officer walks up to the driver's side of the car flashlight blinding you

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:27.260
 You can't really see who it is. You can't see that the uniform is older. You can't see that the badge

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.940
 Is from a different state, but as that officer

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.900
 Asked you for your driver's license

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.460
 You have to wonder

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:42.060
 Is he pulling you over because he thought you were speeding or is he pulling you over because he's looking for a fresh body

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.180
 For one of his demonic friends

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:53.500
