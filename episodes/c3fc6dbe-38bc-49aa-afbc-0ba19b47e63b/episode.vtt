00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520
 A humorous story takes a dark turn as disgusting criminals lurk in the darkness all around

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.520
 us.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.400
 And then we take a trip to the University of California, Irvine.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.520
 Is it possible that this college is infused with such dark energy?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.000
 It has become a perpetual suicide machine today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.680
 I'm your host, Zazen Garminer, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.840
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.640
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.640
 Everyone give it up for Cobalt.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 Woo!

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 Yeah!

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 Come on in Cobalt!

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 Yeah, yeah!

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.640
 Cobalt, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.720
 Sorry, I didn't really give you high five.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.600
 Cobalt, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.680
 This episode, if you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you don't want to get sorry,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 that's fine too.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.840
 Just helps read the word about the show.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 That really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 Give me a hug, Cobalt.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.920
 Sorry, sorry that I took you like that.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.040
 Cobalt, let's go ahead and dig.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.040
 I have a bowl of keys.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.000
 Like it's a 1970s swinger party here.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.680
 I'm gonna reach into the bowl of keys at random, and I'm gonna pull out the keys to the Dead

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 Rabbit Durgeable Cobalt, or leave me behind Dead Rabbit Command, take the controls.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.520
 We're flying all the way out to a house in a suburban neighborhood.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:40.720
 A long time ago, I did an episode about what I thought was a haunted website.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.120
 I had never found such a website that when you go into it, you just feel so gross.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.160
 I'm not even talking about stuff like Best Gore or Rotten.com, stuff like that.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.160
 It was on Reddit.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.760
 Of course, Reddit is a cesspool.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.920
 I can't stand Reddit.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.560
 I have to use it all the time for the show, but before that, I never used it.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 Reddit.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.640
 I hate Reddit.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 Reddit allows the most disgusting people to congregate and to hang out for untold amounts

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.140
 of time.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.560
 You can find the grossest things on Reddit.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.280
 I talked about a haunted website that I thought I'd come across because you feel so gross

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.800
 when you're hanging out in it.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 It is the subreddit called Sex Offender Support.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.960
 Sex Offender Support.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.560
 This is a place where people who are convicted of sex crimes can communicate with each other.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.480
 So you can imagine how gross this is.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.240
 And I remember saying at the end of this episode, I'm never going back to it.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.160
 This place is so disgusting.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.800
 I don't ever want to go back to it.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.160
 However, we're talking about it again.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.840
 Cobalt's turning the Dead Rabbit Durgable around.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840
 No, no, no, no.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.200
 We're talking about it again because, listen, man, just like the Mafia, you think you're

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.680
 out and they pull you back in, this stuff is so insane that I, of course, I was going

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.680
 to go back, right?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.520
 Of course, I was eventually going to find my way back here.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.680
 And this story starts off quite hilarious.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.480
 This funny story can be about this topic.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.120
 I think this setup is funny, right?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.240
 I think this setup is funny.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.240
 So on Sex Offender Support, and I will say this, it's so interesting.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.560
 I'm all over the internet.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.520
 I've been reading stuff, not just on the internet, but published and comments and everything,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
 right?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520
 You read all sorts of stuff.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.920
 The people on Sex Offender subreddit are the dumbest of the dumb.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.320
 And I'm not just talking about their belief system.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.480
 I'm talking about the way they write.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.320
 Grammatically, it's really bad.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.480
 It's so interesting.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.360
 These people are truly idiots.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.040
 Regardless of whatever crime they've done, which is just disgusting, they're idiots.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.440
 They're stupid.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.440
 They actually have terrible grammar.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.240
 Like, "Jayce, really?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.520
 That's your first takeaway from a Sex Offender Support subreddit?"

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.520
 What?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.440
 They didn't use a period in that sentence.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.920
 Anyways, they're all morons.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.600
 And this guy posted this on his Sex Offender subreddit.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.680
 This guy goes by the name "Ancient Answer 159."

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.680
 He's deleted his account now, but I archive a bunch of this stuff.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:13.120
 For the show note, "Sex Offender Support, Ancient Answer 159, got arrested for a sex crime case."

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.000
 They're always really cagey about what they're talking about.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.360
 He's currently under house arrest.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.400
 He's waiting for his trial to happen.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.920
 He's under something called "Level One House Arrest."

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.120
 It's all different by state.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.000
 I couldn't figure out, like, we obviously don't know where this guy is, but I couldn't

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.600
 figure out, like, how bad that was.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.160
 I'm assuming it's pretty bad because he can't leave his house at all.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.120
 He has the ankle monitor on and he can't leave his house at all.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.520
 He can't leave his house to go to work.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.000
 He can't leave his house to thank God.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.720
 Obviously, you're like, "Oh, where's Barry then?"

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.880
 He's been gone the past three months, man.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.720
 All this paperwork's been backing up.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.520
 And the boss is like, "Please quit asking where Barry is.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.600
 Trust me, you don't want to know.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.160
 You'll kill the dude."

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.440
 This guy, we'll just call him Barry.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.520
 I don't know if that's his real name, but Barry is under house arrest, "Level One House

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.080
 Arrest," and he has a roommate.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.840
 And Barry is starving to death.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.120
 He posts on this subreddit.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.040
 He goes, "I'm under house arrest and my roommate refuses to buy me food.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.280
 My roommate is refusing to do my shopping.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.560
 And I'm stuck in this house."

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.600
 He goes, "It's been months since I've eaten anything," which I think is a little bit of

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.200
 an exaggeration, obviously, or maybe he was a gamer and had a bunch of, like, G Fuel laying

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200
 around.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.200
 That's a great ad for them.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.200
 Had a bunch of Doritos and he's been munching on those for the last couple of months.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.120
 But he goes, "I'm starving to death.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.560
 I keep asking my roommate to buy me food and my roommate goes, 'No, that's hilarious,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.440
 because you know that this roommate's probably like, 'I can't kick him out.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.000
 He's under house arrest,' which basically means that I'm under house arrest.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.360
 This guy's committed some disgusting crime.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.840
 The very least I can do is my civic duty and slowly starve this man to death.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.560
 He's not buying any food."

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.400
 Imagine this guy's been catching stray cockroaches, berries, and building little traps, trying

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.520
 to attract birds with a cheeto on a string.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.680
 He's starving to death.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680
 He can't eat anything.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.360
 His roommate's got to imagine his roommate's like, "Yummy, yummy, yummy.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.080
 I ordered one of everything from McDonald's menu."

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.160
 And he's like, "What am I going to have now?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.680
 The roommate's put on like 300 pounds just taunting this guy.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680
 He's eating all this food."

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.120
 He's like, "It's worth it.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.200
 It's worth my cholesterol going up just to taunt this sicko."

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.880
 And he says, "I don't know what to do.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.800
 Like I can't get any food.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.360
 I feel like I'm losing muscle like at this point.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.880
 It's not just that I'm losing weight.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.840
 I'm actually getting weaker, physically weaker, because my roommate will not buy me food."

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.760
 Now listen, he's not eating anything.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.760
 It's funny, right?

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.760
 I was laughing about that.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.760
 I thought it was hilarious.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.080
 And then of course, because Reddit is the way that it is, I scroll down a bit and I

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.720
 start reading the comments.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.680
 And again, we're in the sex offender support subreddit.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.440
 And people then begin to give him advice.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.040
 And it would be one of the things if they said, "Set up a Venmo.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.280
 I'll send you some money.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.640
 A sicko's got to stick together."

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.380
 It was something like that, fine.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:21.160
 If it was something like, "Yeah, I feel for you, dude, but call your parole agent or call

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.720
 the court and say that you need an emergency thing to be able to go get some food or something."

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720
 They don't do that.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.120
 They don't do that.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:36.040
 They give him tips on how to beat the charges.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.880
 This is the problem with this subreddit, right?

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.460
 They're giving this guy tips on how to not only get a delicious cheeseburger, but also

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.460
 how to beat the charges.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.420
 So you have a guy named NoResort7214.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.060
 So listen, what you should do is you should check yourself into a psychiatric hospital

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.460
 because you'll get food there.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.500
 They'll feed you.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.380
 And that can actually help with your sentencing.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.460
 Because remember, he hasn't had his trial yet.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.100
 All of this stuff is pending or he may be halfway through the trial.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.520
 But he definitely hasn't been sentenced.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.440
 This is all part of the legal process.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.520
 He goes, "It actually will help with your sentencing when I had to go to court.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:22.060
 I had checked myself into a psychiatric hospital and my lawyer said, 'Look, he's working on

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.780
 improving his mental fitness.'

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.420
 And the judge, Jerry, goes, 'Yeah, he seems to be an upstanding guy.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.720
 He's not doing anything to us right now in the courtroom.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.200
 Plus, we have this lawyer saying this and this doctor saying this.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.040
 Ah, you know, let's give him a little bit of a break on the sentencing.'

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040
 Gross, right?

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.180
 I'm giving him tips on how to beat the system.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.980
 Again, it's not saying you need mental help.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.980
 You need mental help.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.940
 It's like, hey, this is a way to kind of skirt the law a bit.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.420
 Probably not a good thing to talk about skirts around sex offenders.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.260
 I don't want them popping a bone or anything.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:57.060
 But then we have puzzled ear 531.9.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.460
 And this one, this one like legit made me mad.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.780
 So I'm sharing it with you.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.700
 I'm sharing it with you.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.980
 Puzzled ear 531.9 goes, "Yeah, do check yourself into a mental hospital."

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.180
 Now, again, not because you're mentally disturbed, not because you're a sex criminal.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:19.060
 He said, listen, right after I got arrested, I checked myself into a mental hospital.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.220
 And I'm sure the stress level was super high, but again, it didn't seem like, oh, me, oh,

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.620
 my, I'm a sick pervert.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.620
 I need mental help.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.500
 It was like, oh, no, I actually got caught doing the things that I do.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.020
 I'm stressed out.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.500
 He went to the mental hospital.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.020
 Normally, did he have a bunch of delicious food?

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.540
 Apparently, it's right next to a Chipotle.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.220
 He says the doctors at the mental hospital said that he had some brain issues.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:48.140
 His brain had a hard time developing, or obviously, he needed to check himself in a mental hospital

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.140
 for that one.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.100
 His brain had a hard time developing.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.700
 It caused him to make poor decisions.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.260
 He didn't have it all up here.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.180
 It wasn't his fault that he did those crimes.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.500
 It was his brain.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.740
 And the judge actually agreed.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.540
 He served no jail time.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.100
 His lawyer used that as an excuse.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.580
 He got no jail time.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.820
 All he got was three and a half years probation and three years as part of a sex offender

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.820
 group.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.740
 But then he includes this quote, quote, "The DA, district attorney, wanted to send me

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:28.740
 away for 50 years because of my eight victims."

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:35.020
 Eight victims facing 50 years in prison, but because he checked himself in a mental hospital

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.100
 and the doctor diagnosed them like that, three and a half years probation, just three years

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.780
 as part of this sex offender support group.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:47.500
 Not the subreddit, not the subreddit, like a in-person talking to other sex offenders.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:53.260
 So basically, six years in total, eight victims because he went to the mental hospital and

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.740
 got this doctor to write this up.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.380
 This is why I hate this subreddit.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.740
 This is why I hate this subreddit.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.360
 This is why I hate Reddit in whole because this information is just slowly collecting

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.740
 over time and now people can go and access all this stuff.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.020
 If you're accused of one of these things, you're going to find this group and you're

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.580
 going to go, "Oh, that's a pretty good idea."

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.580
 I'll just go to a mental hospital.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.580
 Maybe I'll look out.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.500
 And that's what they're saying publicly.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.820
 Who knows what they're saying in their DMs?

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.100
 Gross.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.860
 This gross subreddit tends to collect the worst of the worst.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.860
 This subreddit's up.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.380
 I've gone in conversations on the Patreon Discord.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.700
 We've talked about it a couple of times about free speech and all that stuff.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.740
 I am a free speech advocate, but when you're trading tips with other pedophiles, rapists,

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:48.540
 channel listers, whatever, on how to beat charges, you have to have a limit.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.260
 I'll have that discussion though about free speech.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.020
 I'm not saying I'm the arbiter of it all, but that's disgusting, right?

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.020
 Sorry, I'm sorry.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.260
 This guy's slowly starving to death.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.460
 And then it turns out they're giving him tips on how to beat his charges.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.620
 Now he deleted his account.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.900
 We don't know what his crime was or if he beat the charges or anything like that, but

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.780
 this other dude did eight victims.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.020
 Three and a half years probation.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.500
 Gross.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.300
 Gross.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:21.540
 Cobalt actually had a new Patreon supporter that I was going to have drive us around

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.940
 this episode, but when episodes get this gross, when episodes get that rough, I was going

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.980
 to, I like to use the legacy Patreon because you never know how people are going to react.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.900
 DJ Blue, I'm going to give you your shout out tomorrow, but Cobalt, let's go ahead and

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:36.900
 touch the keys of the car.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.300
 I'm going to touch on those, bro.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.060
 We're leaving behind this disgusting house.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:51.260
 We're headed all the way out to University of California in Irvine, California.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.220
 Since last season, I've been on a ghost binge.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.460
 It was the stories that I thought I would honestly talk about the most when I started

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.620
 doing this show.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.820
 And they're actually interesting ghost stories are really hard to find.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.780
 They're really hard to find.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.780
 So we do a lot of UFOs, which I love UFOs.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.660
 We do a lot of Bigfoot, which I've learned to love Bigfoot since I moved up to the Pacific

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.660
 Northwest.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.900
 I mean, it wasn't a big thing, but I thought we'd do more ghost stuff.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:19.140
 So I've kind of been on a ghost binge lately, but when you research these, I like to just

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.020
 like look into the legend.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.380
 Is there anything behind this?

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.700
 I always like doing the additional information, finding that stuff out.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:32.820
 And this is a story where it evolves past spooky, icky ghosts walking along an abandoned

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.820
 road.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.140
 That's how the story starts, but it's one of the stories that just gets really weird

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.140
 as it goes on.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:43.260
 We're at University of California, Irvine, and like any place where you have people congregating,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.580
 legends and ghost stories are going to form.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.740
 The first one we're going to look at is if you drive down campus drive by yourself.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.340
 I apparently this, I don't think this is like the main thoroughfare.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.060
 I don't think this is where the buses go.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:01.300
 It's kind of like, I'm assuming a road kind of removed from campus because otherwise this

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.060
 story would be easily disprovable.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.340
 You'd have people be like, dude, I walk down the road all the time to get to my econ class.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.860
 It's not haunted, but apparently if you're driving down campus drive late at night, are

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.860
 you doing that?

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.860
 Econ nerds?

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.660
 Quick trying to dispute my story that I found online.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:22.860
 As you're driving down campus drive alone, your car will stop automatically.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.860
 And a woman shows up.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.880
 This is where detail.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.540
 She talks to you, but she doesn't move her mouth.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.540
 That's super odd.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.540
 That's usually related to aliens.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.020
 Very rarely do you hear ghost telepathically talking to people, especially if you can see

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:41.980
 it, but she talks to you in your head and she asks you to help her find her missing

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.980
 daughter.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.660
 Like, can I get in your car?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.180
 Can you help me?

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.100
 And you may be a little scared because you're in the middle of nowhere, maybe, or maybe

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.500
 you're right next to the women's dormitory.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.300
 But definitely whether or not that humans move their mouths when they talk unless you're

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.300
 talking to like Jeff Dunham.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.820
 It's not Jeff Dunham.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.820
 She doesn't move her mouth.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.820
 She asks you this.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.780
 If you let her in your car, then you'll drive down the road and you'll have this woman in

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780
 your car.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.780
 No one's that stupid.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.460
 No one's going to actually open the door for her.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.460
 So she teleports into your car.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.460
 She teleports.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.220
 This woman just teleports into your car.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.220
 So you're in a choice.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.100
 Now you're driving on a road with a woman.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.100
 Would Jeff Dunham?

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.100
 Would Jeff Dunham?

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.100
 I kill you.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.620
 He has all these puppets in here.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.620
 It's truly hell.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.900
 You're driving down the road.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.900
 He's doing all these voices.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.980
 You're like, oh my God.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.500
 And she makes you just drive down the road.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.140
 Now the car's working again.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.340
 And then eventually she disappears out of the car, thankfully.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:43.180
 And then you turn around and there's a Jeff Dunham puppet of you sitting in the back seat

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.180
 going, I kill you.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.780
 He's like, do Jason have that joke from like 2004?

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:50.780
 How old is that?

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.780
 Anyways, no, that's not what happens.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.780
 That would actually be pretty cool.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.780
 What happened?

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.780
 I think about it.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.780
 That would be pretty cool.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.420
 A Dunham doll of you.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.220
 He's collecting all these spirits around the world.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.980
 She disappears.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.660
 And so the story goes like this.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.420
 Apparently back in the day, there was a woman who had a daughter and her daughter in the

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.380
 campus drive area was raped and killed.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:15.060
 And the mom was looking for her daughter, looking for her daughter to save.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.420
 And she had gone mad with grief.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.420
 Everyone knew that the daughter had already been found.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.780
 Her body had already been found by the mother still wandering down the street.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.780
 Where's my daughter?

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.780
 Where's my daughter?

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.500
 We're like, oh, not this lady again.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.780
 Doesn't she know that her daughter's already dead?

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.260
 She's in the crematory, moron.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.220
 She's walking around the streets filled with grief.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:40.220
 And then she walked down into this goalie, like this ditch on the site of campus drive.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.980
 And the mom never came out.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.980
 That was when she was still alive.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.020
 That wasn't even part of the ghost story.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.100
 That's like the origin, which is creepy.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.020
 We've talked about ditches and their relationship to paranormal phenomenon before.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.500
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.420
 And it also has a parallel.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.420
 We covered a long time ago the story of the three-legged lady road, which is kind of

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.420
 the same setup.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.500
 A mother is looking for her daughter's body.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.580
 Same thing, the daughter was raped and killed by some sane worshipers.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.180
 And then this ghost was walking around, like chopping off people's legs and wearing them

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.340
 or something like that.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.340
 I'm not for sure.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.340
 It's gross.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.340
 I don't remember the details.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.340
 I remember it being quite gruesome.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.340
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.100
 Interesting story, ghost story.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.380
 But let's take a look at another ghost story in the area.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.100
 We're now on campus.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.500
 There is Mesa Court Residence Hall.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.340
 This is where all the students are hanging out.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.660
 We're going back to the 1970s.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.740
 So listening to disco music, doing three- I have three legs.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.740
 I'm dancing.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.940
 They're like, dude, how are you doing those moves?

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.380
 I got three-legged bell bottoms.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.380
 We're dancing around.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.500
 And we're going to meet a young girl who dancing wasn't just an enjoyable pastime.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.500
 It was her passion.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.540
 It was actually why she was enrolled in college.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.740
 There was this young college student.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.800
 We'll call her Nancy.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.300
 She was preparing for the big dance audition.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.020
 It was the role of a lifetime.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.940
 And she was stressed out.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.580
 She was stressed out, will she get this?

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.580
 She has to get it.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.060
 She has to, has to get this role.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.900
 She would practice all day and all night.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.980
 Like, aren't you going to go to your other classes?

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:10.980
 She's like, nope.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.980
 She's not learning, reading, writing, arithmetic.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.100
 She's learning rhythm.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.540
 She's dancing all the time.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.180
 And she had her room.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.180
 She was lucky enough when she got her dorm.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.280
 It was just a single occupant dorm.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.040
 Other people had roommates and stuff like that.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.840
 Other people are starving out their roommates.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.280
 They're like, take that, sicko.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.720
 But while that's going on, Nancy is dancing.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.320
 You'd always see her dancing.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.360
 Sometimes you'd see her dancing in the window.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.400
 Sometimes you'd have the blinds drawn and you would just see her silhouette boogieing

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.600
 down.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.200
 One night, someone looks over and they go, up, there's dancing Nancy.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.720
 She's dancing in her room.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.480
 She's actually like spinning around like a ballerina.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.220
 [HUMMING]

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:58.180
 She's spinning around doing the little things you see Nancy Kerrigan do.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.420
 You know, she's now, hold, are you?

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.660
 You're making Jeff Dunham references and talking about Nancy Kerrigan.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:09.460
 She's spinning around like an ice skater, Kristy Yamaguchi style.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.700
 People are like, man, Nancy's got some cool moves.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.980
 If that audition requires you to spin in place for 30 minutes straight, she's going to get

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.980
 it.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:23.120
 She's going to be spinning around in her room and they're like, you go Nancy, spin, spin

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.120
 till the world ends.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.760
 Let me start thinking about it and they're like, it's kind of weird that she hasn't vomited

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.760
 at all.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.760
 That's a lot of spins.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.720
 It's also kind of weird she's been doing that for close to three hours now.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.120
 So eventually someone knocks on her door, hey Nancy, are you okay?

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.720
 Are you trying to create the large Hadron Collider in there right now?

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.640
 She's spinning around so fast.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:51.100
 And so they eventually have a dorm, an RA open the door and it turns out that Nancy could

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.900
 not take the stress of the audition.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:00.460
 So she decided to hang herself from the ceiling fan.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.260
 Save your questions until the end of this ghost story/urban legend.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:11.020
 She decided to hang herself from the ceiling fan which was on and she wasn't spinning around

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.620
 like a figure skater.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:21.200
 It was her body going whoa, attached to the fan spinning around for hours at a time.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.200
 Okay, here's the thing.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.680
 If you attached, don't try this at home, don't try this at home, you're like hey little brother

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.680
 come here.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.040
 If you hung a body from a ceiling fan, you wouldn't spin in place.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.240
 Like it would be flying all over the place.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.840
 It'd be like if you grabbed the rope and was swinging it around the body would be going

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.840
 whoa.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.420
 It'd be one thing to be like whoa you have really cool dance moves.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.780
 It'd be another thing to say you're clearly defying the laws of gravity.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.460
 Also ceiling fans can't support body weight.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:57.900
 I mean she might have been really slender because she's a dancer but and for this to

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:03.980
 make any sense she would have had to hang herself while the fan was on which I have

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:08.820
 never hung myself but I imagine that would just make things even more difficult.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.440
 She hung herself from the fan why would it turn on automatically, why would it spin around.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.080
 Doesn't make sense.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.760
 Interesting ghost story but again both of those ghost stories in and of themselves, they might

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.360
 be something I mentioned in passing.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.520
 Why am I spending the last half of an episode talking about these ghost stories?

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.440
 Because as I was looking into these ghost stories I found a far darker phenomenon and

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.000
 this is being reported by the mainstream media.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.060
 Specifically I found this in a newspaper called the OC Weekly which is an Orange County newspaper

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.060
 and this article is written by Charles Lamb.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:54.660
 It's entitled "Why do so many students commit suicide at UC Irvine's Social Science Plaza?"

00:21:54.660 --> 00:22:02.020
 Whoa okay this isn't what I was expecting as I was typing in because I'm trying to verify

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.600
 any of this stuff.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.800
 Suicide ghost, UC Irvine and here we go.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:13.960
 UC Irvine was built back in the late 60s, early 70s and it was designed as this very

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.800
 elegant place, very balanced in its construction.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:29.200
 It was set up to be this just symmetrical perfectly designed location where it was just

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:36.860
 supposed to give you a sense of being, a sense of purpose, a sense of your place in the universe

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.580
 and it's just laid out in this very conscious way.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:48.340
 But added far later, this was added in the 1990s, is the Social Science Plaza.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:55.020
 It's a collection of five story buildings and it's in this asymmetrical shape, it actually

00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:00.640
 kind of throws off the entire area that it's in because you had all of this thought and

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.560
 planning put into the original construction of UC Irvine.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.440
 But then you have this, it's like counterclockwise.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.480
 The buildings themselves are asymmetrical and counterclockwise to how it should be laid

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.760
 out if you look at the rest of the school and they go it's really weird, the college

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.000
 you're kind of wandering around, you're going to these different classes and it's this very

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.240
 open floor plan.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.380
 But when you go into the Social Sciences Plaza, it's claustrophobic, even outdoors, there's

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.300
 something about it that makes you feel kind of hemmed in.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.780
 They said once you get into the building, it's just very soulless, very just row after

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.500
 row after row of these classrooms.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:45.300
 And most people, even if you're not a Social Sciences major because the way that everything

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:50.820
 is planned out, almost every student who attends UC Irvine has at least one class in the Social

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:55.360
 Sciences Plaza, just for your general ed requirements.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.800
 It's not a pleasant place to be, but you got to be there.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:07.120
 It offsets the natural design, the very symmetrical nature of the campus.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:13.360
 You have this building complex and if you're taking the stairs, they have like a staircase

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.440
 on the outside of the buildings.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:24.240
 On each floor, there is a sign that says, "We can help."

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:30.940
 And then it gives you the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:37.020
 According to this article by Charles Lamb, there's been five suicides off of Social

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:42.120
 Sciences Plaza, people climbing up to the highest point of the staircase and falling

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.180
 around 50 feet.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.440
 I think it's more than five, not just because I'm a conspiracy theorist, but Charles Lamb,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.800
 which is an excellent article, Charles Lamb details some of the events of these five suicides

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.640
 that we know of and only one of them was really recognized around campus.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.480
 He was a very popular kid, apparently, who killed himself and they started having like

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.680
 these workshops and things like that.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:11.040
 The article also talks about a young man known as Maxwell Chorak, he's 25 years old, who

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.980
 on June 10th, 2014 climbed up to the highest stairwell and each time you have to pass one

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.580
 of those signs saying, "We can help."

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:25.060
 And he dove off and Charles Lamb says, "There was no memorial for this guy."

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:29.420
 Like pretty much like people were shocked, they called authorities, rescue crews got

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.860
 there, he was already dead and then the day kind of goes on.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.180
 Like counseling was available and then the life went on at the college.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.740
 If there was only five suicides over the course of 30 years, would you really be bolting up

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.740
 those signs?

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.520
 I bet you there's more or more attempted suicides.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.920
 Colleges cover this stuff up.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.720
 When I was at American River College, I was a journalist for the school newspaper, we

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.320
 had an issue with perverts masturbating in the library.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.320
 Have you ever heard of that?

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.920
 It happens at every college.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.520
 I had a friend whose wife worked at UC Davis in the library, she goes, "We actually had

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.360
 code names for the different types of masturbators."

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.620
 There were so many of them.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.780
 There's so many of them you could actually catalog.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:18.860
 You could put them in the dewy decimal system or the gooey decimal system.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.500
 Okay, but anyways.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.660
 So colleges cover stuff like that up because it's bad, right?

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.260
 You're trying to, a college is a business.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.940
 You're trying to get people to come to the college, pay money, pay a ton of money to

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.940
 go there.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.940
 So they're always going to cover up.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.860
 And if they're going to cover up sex crimes, they're going to cover up suicides.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.060
 If they can, what they can cover up, they will.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.200
 It was a huge expose.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.720
 I did, no pun intended, at American River College for the newspaper, the school newspaper

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.960
 there.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.600
 But here's my theory.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.160
 Here's my theory.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.920
 I think there is a force pulling people towards these buildings.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:27:02.120
 A dark energy that is attracting people who already have suicidal ideation.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:08.380
 And that is why this has become a suicide tourist destination.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:15.880
 Case in point, Maxwell, he wasn't even a student at the college.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.340
 Maxwell had no connection.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.340
 He didn't work there.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.460
 He wasn't a student.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.260
 He took a bus there.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.660
 He took a bus from a hospital to get there.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:33.520
 Just three hours before he committed suicide, he had gotten out of an 11-day forced medical

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.760
 hold because he was listed as a danger to himself or others.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.200
 It was 5150 in California, police parlance.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.600
 5150.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.000
 And on June 14th, the doctors allowed him to leave the hospital.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.640
 His 11 days are over.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.840
 And they gave him a bus voucher to go anywhere in town.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.400
 Well, he went to UC Irvine, which he had no connection to.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:03.140
 When he went to the social sciences plaza, climbed up the tallest staircase, killed himself.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:10.500
 Is this school actually emanating this negative, life-stealing energy?

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:19.540
 UC Irvine, the campus itself, was built as the result of a suicide.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.340
 My Ford Irvine.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.260
 His family owned a ton of land in Irvine, California.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.200
 In 1959, he shot himself.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.880
 And his niece inherited a good chunk of his fortune and of his land.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:41.640
 And she donated the land where UC Irvine would be established.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:46.000
 And that's where the school is where it's at.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.440
 The school wouldn't have existed in the first place had he not killed himself.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:01.860
 So is the entire area infused with this dark energy?

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:08.780
 Is the fact that you have this magnificently designed and perfectly balanced layout?

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:15.500
 And then you have this gross asymmetrical structure of buildings that juts out from inside of

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.500
 it.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:23.140
 Isn't that almost an allegory for depression itself, for hopelessness itself?

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:30.280
 We see the beauty of the world around us, but we feel ugly and useless and that we don't

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.280
 fit in.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.560
 And I listen, I'm not trying to say that there's the only reasons why people commit

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560
 suicide, right?

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.000
 But that is one of the reasons why people get horribly depressed.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.120
 There's chemical depression.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.720
 And then there's just like, I am alone.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.320
 I don't fit in.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.640
 I have nowhere to belong.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:51.600
 And that's what the social sciences, ironically, the social sciences buildings represent.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.140
 You're walking around this opulent open campus.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.220
 And then once you get to these buildings, it feels claustrophobic.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.820
 Just the way the trees are laid out and the way the buildings are there, you instantly

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:07.780
 feel the oppression because it is not right.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.820
 It doesn't belong there.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.620
 But that's where it was put.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:20.380
 Counterclockwise, asymmetrical, strangulating and ominous.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.980
 It feels like it doesn't belong.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.340
 And yet there it is.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:32.080
 And no matter who you are or what your major is, you have to attend a class there because

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.440
 that's part of the general ed.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.560
 So almost like you're forced to go there.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:45.020
 You're forced to walk through this gauntlet of negative energy.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:49.240
 What dark energy does this school possibly hold?

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:56.860
 What type of siren song echoes out from the social science plaza?

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.060
 Attracting the desperate.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.820
 Attracting the lonely.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:07.580
 Attracting those who feel like they have nothing to lose.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:13.540
 A place born from a suicide.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:38.240
 Just being more people to join it and making that ultimate mistake.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.820
 (upbeat music)

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.400
 (upbeat music)

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.980
 (upbeat music)

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.560
 (upbeat music)

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.140
 (upbeat music)

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.720
 (upbeat music)

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.300
 (upbeat music)

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.880
 (upbeat music)

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.460
 (upbeat music)

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.820
