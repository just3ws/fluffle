1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 They truly are like family to us.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,560
 The exorcist Ronnie from the Philippines

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,840
 is on the case once again.

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,960
 This time he tracks Lucifer, Lord of Hell,

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,120
 to a local middle school.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,600
 And then we take a look at a true crime story

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,880
 that at this very moment, I'm still debating whether or not

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,680
 I actually want to tell you,

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,100
 but it's Cursed Episodes Week, so it must be done.

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,160
 It's a true crime story with no moral, no lesson,

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,360
 no happy ending.

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,840
 It's just the story of two men, one woman,

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,520
 and a mobile home full of blood.

26
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

27
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,100
 (upbeat music)

28
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,080
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,320
 I'm having a great day.

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,640
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,120
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,200
 You guys are like, no, no, no, do a longer intro.

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,040
 Do a longer intro.

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,640
 I don't want you to get to that last story.

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,480
 I'm gonna tell you guys right now.

38
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,780
 I don't really do much gore on this podcast.

39
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,960
 I actually censor a lot of stuff, not this episode.

40
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,640
 So the first story's fine.

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,800
 The first story's a nice little jump back to the Philippines,

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,400
 but the second story's pretty bloody.

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,760
 So let's welcome in one of our legacy Patreons here.

44
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,480
 I'm gonna have to make it up to him again.

45
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,920
 He's all like, just, damn it.

46
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,320
 He's kind of being ushered in by the Dead Rabbit goons.

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,720
 It's Reverend Samuel.

48
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,080
 Everyone give a round of applause to Reverend Samuel.

49
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,240
 One of our many resident musicians.

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,480
 I'll put his music video on the show notes.

51
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,280
 The Corona Queen, I think, what it was called.

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,240
 It's kind of a jaunty little tune.

53
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,020
 I've used the word jaunty twice so far this podcast.

54
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,880
 Come on in, Reverend.

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,680
 He is being strapped down to a gurney,

56
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,920
 but then there's like colorful balloons all around him

57
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,960
 to keep his mood high.

58
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
 He's like, man, this episode,

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
 I'll make it up to you, Reverend.

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,360
 Reverend Samuel, you're gonna be our captain,

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,440
 our pilot this episode.

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,840
 If you guys can't support the Patreon

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,840
 or if you don't wanna listen to this episode,

64
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,120
 that's fine too.

65
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,480
 Just helps her out the word about the show.

66
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,720
 Really, really helps out a lot.

67
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 You know what, actually, let's use Reverend Samuel's

68
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,920
 custom vehicle, the Corona Queen, from his music video.

69
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,800
 We'll get on all in board.

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
 We all have the Corona virus now.

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
 We are leaving behind.

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
 He left, he took the hair hang glider.

73
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,520
 He's going his own way.

74
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,200
 We are taking the Corona Queen.

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,200
 We are headed out to the Philippines.

76
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,360
 (singing)

77
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,760
 That's exactly how his song sounds.

78
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,400
 I did a perfect rendition of this song.

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,440
 No, check out their music video.

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,280
 It's really cool.

81
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,880
 He made it himself because of our last 90 day challenge.

82
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,840
 Yesterday, I ran out of time.

83
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,600
 I wanted to go more into the adventures

84
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,440
 of the exorcist in the Philippines, Ronnie,

85
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,760
 Ronnie E. Ablong, but I ran out of time.

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,560
 So I saved this one.

87
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,360
 This will be our opening story for today.

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,600
 I find this really fascinating.

89
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,280
 We take the Corona Queen to the Philippines.

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,480
 We spent two weeks in quarantine

91
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,400
 'cause we told them the name of our boat.

92
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,880
 Reverend Samuel rescues us in the end, a daring raid.

93
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,320
 We're now walking around the Philippines

94
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,240
 and we are going to meet Ronnie E. Ablong.

95
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,400
 Specifically, we're going to spy on him.

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,440
 So we're hiding in the bushes

97
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,560
 and we're looking through a window

98
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,600
 and he's sitting there with his log book

99
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,200
 and he's writing stuff down.

100
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,000
 Very noisy pen, very, very noisy pen.

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
 Shh, he wrote this.

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,440
 He didn't need a log book.

103
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,440
 He actually posted this on Facebook.

104
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
 I just like spying in bushes.

105
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,960
 Like Jason, you weirdo.

106
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,160
 You can just go to his Facebook page and read this post.

107
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,240
 I'm going to read it to you.

108
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,160
 This might be one of the most, if this story is true,

109
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,200
 big asterisks to this one, right?

110
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
 If this story is true,

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,860
 it could have implications for us all.

112
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,760
 Here we go, case number one.

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
 I don't know if this is actually his first case

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
 or the first case he put on Facebook.

115
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,960
 If this was his first case,

116
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,840
 he did list it as case number one,

117
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,400
 then he has an amazing career in front of him.

118
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
 This is the first thing he,

119
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,040
 he's like, oh, I'm a brand new exorcist.

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,120
 What's on the talk of the day?

121
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,960
 This?

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,440
 Oh dude, he's plucked.

123
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
 He's basically Sam and Dean rolled into one.

124
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,960
 Here we go, case one.

125
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,400
 I'm going to read right from his case file.

126
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,260
 A female junior high school student.

127
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,400
 She came once or twice a month for exorcism session.

128
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,720
 I didn't know, I bet you didn't know.

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,680
 It was that casual.

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
 That was shocking to me.

131
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,640
 I didn't know, it was like,

132
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,280
 you possessed by a bunch of demons.

133
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,600
 They're like, so how many times

134
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
 would you like to see me this week?

135
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,520
 I don't know, once or twice a month?

136
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,440
 Oh yeah, I'm sure the demons in charge of your body

137
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,960
 will be totally fine with that lackadaisical schedule.

138
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,200
 I thought they strapped you down to a bed

139
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,320
 and just like yelled at you for a couple hours.

140
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,720
 Not, so does Thursday work for you?

141
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,480
 No, no, no, I'm going to be perverting mankind.

142
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,720
 Oh, okay, how about Saturday?

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
 A female junior high school student.

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,180
 She came once or twice a month for exorcism session.

145
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,360
 She was possessed by Lucifer.

146
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,200
 You definitely need more than one or two,

147
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,440
 one or two sessions a month.

148
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,360
 And it's Lucifer.

149
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,920
 It's the Lord of Hell.

150
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,760
 Let me continue.

151
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,240
 Once during the duration of her case,

152
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,040
 she didn't return for almost three months.

153
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,280
 I thought the case was over, but one day she returned.

154
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,120
 So, Lucifer, Lucifer has possessed the young girl.

155
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,540
 And Ronnie is seen here once or twice a month.

156
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,580
 And loses track of Lucifer for three months

157
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,620
 and goes, "Oh, I guess she's cured."

158
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,380
 You don't think that Lucifer is actually

159
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,500
 just not going to the appointments anymore?

160
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,300
 The Lord of Lies isn't just really good

161
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,860
 at making up excuses?

162
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,740
 If you knew someone in your neighborhood,

163
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,820
 no, no, scratch that.

164
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,340
 If you knew someone that you had a responsibility towards

165
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,100
 was possessed by Lucifer and you just stopped seeing them,

166
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,540
 you don't know where they're at,

167
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,540
 you are going to assume they are wrecking vengeance

168
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,020
 across the planet.

169
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,860
 You're not going to, I guess she's cured?

170
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,460
 I guess everything's totally fine.

171
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,780
 But one day she returned.

172
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,060
 Upon inquiry of what happened,

173
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,100
 she told me that after our last session,

174
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,540
 she no longer felt the presence of Lucifer or his minion.

175
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,020
 So actually, I'm wrong.

176
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,900
 I should have kept reading it, but I read it this.

177
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,900
 "So he did cure her, all it takes to get Lucifer,

178
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,460
 "a mortal enemy of the Almighty God,

179
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,140
 "out of a junior high school girl,

180
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,260
 "once, twice a month."

181
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,860
 That's basically the movie the exorcist lied to us.

182
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,020
 They should have just stopped by the house

183
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,220
 and go, "That was like Pazuzu.

184
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,460
 "That wasn't even like a top level demon.

185
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,460
 "I was talking about Lucifer here, the light bringer.

186
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,660
 "Once, twice a month."

187
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,780
 That's crazy.

188
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,020
 If you were currently seeing a therapist,

189
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,420
 next time you see that therapist go,

190
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,500
 "You know what, I'm changing this

191
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,220
 "to once, twice a month."

192
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,460
 'Cause that's all it took for Lucifer.

193
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,420
 And they're like, "Sir, sir, this is a court order therapist.

194
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,100
 "You can't just change your woman to top for now.

195
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,620
 "See you in three months."

196
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,700
 Don't actually do that.

197
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,620
 But my point is that apparently Lucifer,

198
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,140
 once or twice a month, totally fine.

199
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,420
 So why is she back?

200
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,260
 Why is she back?

201
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,780
 Well, let me keep reading here.

202
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,140
 But one evening, her parents quarreled.

203
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,340
 At the height of their arguments,

204
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,140
 her father shouted, "Oh, devil."

205
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,740
 So if you didn't listen to yesterday's episode,

206
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,140
 Ronnie E. believes that just by stating the names of demons,

207
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,460
 you can bring them into your life.

208
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,300
 That's it.

209
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,540
 And some of you guys probably didn't listen to it

210
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,620
 'cause I said, "At the end of this episode,

211
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,780
 "I'm gonna be sure to say demon names

212
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,300
 "cause I have to tell the story."

213
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,380
 And it's a cursed episode.

214
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,420
 All the episodes this week are cursed.

215
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,700
 So he believes that just by saying, "Oh, devil."

216
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,100
 The devil will show up.

217
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,780
 Now, I grew up in the church.

218
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,420
 My dad was a Southern Baptist minister

219
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,700
 when I was growing up.

220
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,980
 We weren't super, like, I was,

221
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,100
 I was about to say we weren't super religious.

222
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,580
 My dad was a minister.

223
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,380
 But my dad, I think I've told this story before,

224
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,340
 my dad, when he joined the ministry,

225
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,780
 he bought a painting of an owl

226
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,700
 and he'd hang it up as an in his house.

227
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,060
 It was a really nice painting of an owl.

228
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,300
 I actually have a painting of an owl in my house as well.

229
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
 You guys see it on my Patreon live streams.

230
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,400
 But the reason why he actually did that for a purpose,

231
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,300
 he goes, a lot of times, fundamentalist Christians,

232
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,620
 Southern Baptist tend to be very superstitious.

233
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,540
 And they see the owl as a symbol of evil

234
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,740
 and demonic activity.

235
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,540
 So he bought that picture as he's growing horns

236
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,980
 and his eyes turn into slits.

237
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,280
 (imitates owl noises)

238
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,940
 No, he goes, because that's stupid.

239
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,460
 It's a picture of an owl.

240
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,940
 And owls are God's creatures.

241
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,660
 Who cares?

242
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,500
 It's dumb.

243
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,600
 It's stupid to be afraid of an owl.

244
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,820
 So I'm gonna buy an owl and put it in my pot.

245
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,900
 In actual, there's owls flying everywhere.

246
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,020
 (imitates owl noises)

247
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,980
 I had a very, very crazy childhood.

248
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,100
 That's why.

249
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,940
 Where was I going?

250
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,460
 What's this episode even about?

251
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,860
 Oh, oh, yeah, oh, devil.

252
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,340
 So I remember though, hearing stuff like,

253
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,820
 don't have, don't call them deviled eggs.

254
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,740
 You'll meet a Southern Baptist, a fundamentalist

255
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,740
 that will call them angel eggs.

256
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,180
 People won't use the term devil's food cake.

257
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,020
 I remember that.

258
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,660
 Like, my dad just be like, I was so stupid.

259
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,300
 He'd go, fly my owls and the owls would come in the pot.

260
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
 Like, and attack everyone.

261
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,580
 Ah, ah, ah, they're deviled eggs.

262
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,820
 They're deviled eggs, okay?

263
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,780
 So I'm used to that.

264
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,180
 Like, I grew up, again, my family wasn't like that,

265
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,420
 but growing up into churches like that,

266
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,460
 where you didn't use terms like deviled eggs, or.

267
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,460
 So I get that.

268
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,580
 I totally get it.

269
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,780
 I think it's dumb.

270
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,900
 I don't believe it, because people use the term.

271
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,020
 I mean, if this was the case,

272
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,520
 everyone who owned a PS2 would have been possessed.

273
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,340
 'Cause you couldn't own a PS2 without

274
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,580
 at least one saying devil may cry.

275
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,100
 But these terms are used in video games

276
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,180
 and food, obviously, and then other stuff.

277
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,820
 But people use that term all the time.

278
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,700
 So, but Ronnie E. Believe is just by saying these names,

279
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,420
 these people, these spirits will show up.

280
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,620
 So, how did she get possessed by Lucifer again, really?

281
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,300
 That long segue about outpaintings and PS2 video games.

282
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,140
 Let me go back to this.

283
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,100
 But one evening, her parents quarreled

284
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,740
 at the height of their arguments.

285
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,460
 Her father shouted, "Oh, devil!"

286
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,180
 And the devil came.

287
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,780
 And according to these notes,

288
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,420
 according to case file number one,

289
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,980
 and the devil came and said,

290
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,580
 "Pah, anything I can do for you?"

291
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,400
 Which is awesome.

292
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,700
 The fact that he's not like this sneaky spirit,

293
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
 like possessing their daughter,

294
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
 he actually showed up with a bunch of smoke,

295
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,060
 and I imagine a top hat and he tips it,

296
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,580
 "Anything I can do for you?"

297
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,820
 And he sounds like a demonic urkel.

298
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,980
 The case file continues,

299
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,700
 and she was possessed again after that,

300
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,940
 just 'cause her dad said, "Oh, devil!"

301
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,700
 And Lucifer appears, "Anything I can do for you?"

302
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,300
 So that's that, (laughs)

303
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,300
 that's that story that happened, apparently.

304
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,900
 She's possessed for another two years,

305
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,180
 but look on the bright side,

306
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,040
 that's only 24 to 48 visits.

307
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,420
 You'll be fine.

308
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,860
 You'll be totally fine, young lady.

309
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,220
 Why would devil wanna possess?

310
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,100
 That would seem like be the most inefficient person

311
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,820
 of a zest, a junior high school student.

312
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
 He's just taking tests like a baby.

313
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,060
 What do you do in junior high?

314
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,260
 I mean, you can get in a little bit of trouble.

315
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,500
 You can ruin her life,

316
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,860
 but I mean, she's just like a junior high school student.

317
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,900
 We talked about this yesterday.

318
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,100
 The rest of the time,

319
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,780
 maybe she's like making her smoke

320
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,020
 or like play hooky and things like that,

321
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,820
 but the time that she's not doing that,

322
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,100
 she's like taking, devil's like,

323
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,500
 "Oh man, I know this one.

324
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,340
 I know this one.

325
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,380
 I have infinite knowledge,

326
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,740
 but this isn't the way I was taught how to do math."

327
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,740
 Why, why?

328
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,780
 I do wanna say this though,

329
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,620
 I'm just killing time before we get to the next story.

330
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,820
 This would be an amazing sitcom,

331
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,460
 saved by the hell.

332
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,300
 Okay.

333
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,100
 (laughs)

334
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,180
 Saved by the hell.

335
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,060
 Here's my pitch.

336
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,280
 Satan is in high school.

337
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,900
 The principle is God.

338
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,260
 And that's all I got.

339
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,900
 That's literally all I got.

340
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,300
 I've been thinking about this for like two days.

341
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,140
 That's all I got.

342
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,700
 'Cause I don't wanna get super sacrilegious

343
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,140
 and start like making jokes about religious figures.

344
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,100
 I can make jokes about God and Satan.

345
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,940
 They can take it.

346
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,100
 They can totally take it.

347
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,180
 You have God as principle,

348
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,220
 you have Satan as a student,

349
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,420
 and they're just constantly pulling pranks on each other.

350
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,780
 God's like immortal misery and Satan's like,

351
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,420
 "I'll get you next time, God."

352
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,260
 No, you won't.

353
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,540
 I'm far more powerful than you.

354
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,740
 And it goes on and on for about seven season

355
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,660
 and then there's a movie.

356
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,340
 Not only the first three seasons are good,

357
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,060
 but saved by the hell.

358
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,020
 Okay.

359
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,100
 We can no longer put this off anymore.

360
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,580
 Reverend Samuel, trusted man of the cloth.

361
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,460
 Are you ready to call in that carpenter copter?

362
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,780
 We're leaving behind the Philippines.

363
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,500
 We are headed out to Bell, Florida.

364
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,540
 (imitates car engine revving)

365
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,500
 I remember back when I was in college,

366
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,820
 I had a friend, we're gonna call him Michael.

367
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,380
 I was in college, I just graduated high school.

368
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,540
 I was working at Mervins.

369
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,300
 They don't exist anymore, but it was a clothing store.

370
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,900
 I was hanging out with a couple of the people

371
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,180
 who work security at Mervins.

372
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,940
 And they would beat the crap out of shoplifters.

373
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,740
 They'd get in full on fights there.

374
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,820
 'Cause Mervins did not put up with shoplifting.

375
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,340
 This was in Rancho Cordova in California,

376
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,460
 which is relatively rough area.

377
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
 Anyways, I'm talking to this guy

378
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,540
 and he tells me one time that he got in fight

379
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,580
 with this dude at a bar,

380
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,460
 like this started off as an argument in the bar.

381
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,420
 They went outside, argument turned into fist fight,

382
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,100
 fist fight turns into grappling, they're fighting.

383
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,580
 He goes, "I'll tell you what, we're going at it.

384
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,300
 And the next thing I know, I pop a thumb in

385
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,460
 and I pull his eyeball out."

386
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,740
 And he goes, "I'm standing there, Jason.

387
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,060
 And I'm looking at this dude.

388
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,180
 I don't know who this guy is, this big guy.

389
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,060
 And he's standing there and I'm standing there.

390
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,460
 And in the palm of my hand is his eyeball.

391
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,020
 It's still attached to this dude."

392
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,860
 He's not like running away.

393
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,500
 He realized, "Hey, why's my hand wet?

394
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,260
 Whoa, he has his hand cupped

395
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,780
 and he's holding this man's eyeball."

396
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,780
 And he goes, "I knew that I could just close my hand

397
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,740
 and pop it."

398
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,100
 And I go, "What'd you do?"

399
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,860
 And he goes, "Well, I didn't do that."

400
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,420
 He goes, "I just kind of gave it back to him."

401
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,180
 He goes, "I just kind of like let it kind of sit in my palm."

402
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,660
 And he goes, "The fight was over.

403
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,900
 The fight was over.

404
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,580
 It was a very, very serious fight,

405
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,620
 but his eyeball came out.

406
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,140
 That's kind of the end of it, right?

407
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,500
 My friend Michael didn't want to kill the guy.

408
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,540
 But he goes for a moment.

409
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,660
 The fight was so brutal.

410
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,740
 I'm holding that eyeball in the palm of my hand

411
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,740
 that I thought that I could just close my hand.

412
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,740
 But he didn't do that.

413
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,940
 The guy goes to the hospital and gets his eyeball fixed.

414
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,020
 Like it was fine.

415
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,660
 We probably didn't look great for a while.

416
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,300
 He probably joined the black eye club.

417
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,660
 Mitt Romney's like, "You are now one of us.

418
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,020
 Here's your Illuminati membership."

419
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,540
 But you know, the thing with like bar community,

420
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,820
 everyone kind of knows each other.

421
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,660
 You go to the same bar, bartender knows you,

422
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,820
 all that stuff.

423
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,500
 Michael tells me he goes, "So a while later,

424
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,080
 maybe like a week or two later."

425
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,380
 He goes, "The guy wanted to make it up to me."

426
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,020
 Because he realized that he was in the wrong

427
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,260
 to start the fight.

428
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,100
 He was in the wrong to try to pick,

429
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,300
 because he was a bigger guy.

430
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,460
 Michael was a smaller guy.

431
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,420
 Probably just thought he could beat him up.

432
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,340
 He goes, "So he invited me over to his house.

433
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,740
 He wanted to have like a party.

434
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,460
 He wanted to make it up to me."

435
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,740
 And I go, "Oh, it's kind of cool.

436
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,020
 At least you know he's the bigger man and stuff like that."

437
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,260
 And Michael looks at me and he goes,

438
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,020
 "I didn't go."

439
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,300
 And I go, "Why not?"

440
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,340
 He goes, "I'll never forget this."

441
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,260
 He goes, "Never go to a man's house

442
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,260
 after you've held his eyeball in your hand."

443
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,880
 (silence)

444
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,220
 And you might think that's a super specific.

445
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,900
 How often are you actually going to do that?

446
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,300
 You're like, "Well, I did hold his severed arm,

447
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,420
 but I didn't hold his eyeball.

448
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,260
 I'll come over."

449
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,340
 The fact of the matter was when you beat somebody so brutally,

450
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,780
 they can never be your friend.

451
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,060
 You always have to watch your back.

452
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,060
 I remembered that lesson.

453
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,960
 I remember that lesson.

454
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,260
 I heard that story when I just graduated high school.

455
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,660
 I must have been like, I graduated early.

456
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,540
 So I was like 17, 18 years old.

457
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,300
 Very, very important lesson.

458
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,260
 When you savagely beat another human,

459
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,580
 they will never be your friend again.

460
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,580
 And you could even argue emotionally as well.

461
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,700
 Like when you just completely collapse somebody emotionally,

462
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,820
 and then they're like, "Hey, come over.

463
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,660
 I'll make it up to you."

464
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,940
 Because he figured that this was a trap.

465
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,220
 He was gonna go over to this guy's house.

466
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
 A bunch of the dude's buddies were gonna be there.

467
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,540
 And he may lose more than an eyeball.

468
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,300
 It's May 2019.

469
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,780
 We're in the town of Belle, Florida.

470
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,420
 Specifically, we're at a mobile home park.

471
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,020
 Now, these mobile homes aren't parked

472
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,340
 right next to each other.

473
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,340
 It's Florida, so they seem to have pretty good space,

474
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,060
 at least on the photos that I saw.

475
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,380
 So in this motor home yard,

476
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,100
 we're gonna meet Alex Bonilla, 51-year-old man,

477
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,620
 married to a 35-year-old woman.

478
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,580
 They have three kids together.

479
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,340
 The next store, Mobile Home,

480
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,500
 which there's still a good amount of space there,

481
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,320
 has Jimmy and his wife.

482
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,780
 They've been neighbors for around four years at this point.

483
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,540
 And they have kids of the same age.

484
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,140
 So their kids play with each other.

485
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,420
 And Jimmy, that's not his real name,

486
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,560
 Jimmy approaches Alex and his wife and says,

487
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,700
 "Hey, you know, I'm working.

488
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,540
 My wife's working.

489
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,700
 Our kids are around the same age.

490
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,460
 Would you mind babysitting my kids?"

491
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,300
 And Alex's wife goes,

492
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,100
 "Oh yeah, sure, I'll totally babysit your kids."

493
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,260
 You know, the kids just play together anyways.

494
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,340
 But one day, Alex comes home from work early

495
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,280
 and he sees Jimmy and his wife having sex.

496
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,200
 Alex, of course, is heartbroken.

497
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,720
 He's enraged.

498
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,220
 He's been betrayed by both his best friend and his wife.

499
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,320
 He tells Alex he needs to stay away from his wife.

500
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,400
 No more babysitting.

501
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
 That's obvious, right?

502
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,840
 Stay away from my wife.

503
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,400
 But she can still come over on Tuesdays to watch the kids.

504
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,080
 We're gonna have nothing to do with you.

505
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,880
 Alex and his wife fight for a while,

506
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,480
 but they decide to reconcile.

507
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,040
 They decided that the love they have

508
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,620
 and the children they have

509
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,380
 are more important than one indiscretion.

510
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,940
 That happened in May of 2019.

511
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,940
 June 14th, 2019.

512
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,940
 Alex comes home early from work and sees Jimmy

513
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,980
 staring at his house.

514
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,620
 Alex is looking across the field

515
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,740
 and just sees Jimmy standing there, staring.

516
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,740
 He figures Jimmy is trying to see if his wife is home

517
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,620
 so they can have sex again.

518
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,880
 Alex isn't gonna put up with that.

519
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,440
 He walks over to Jimmy's house and he says,

520
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,000
 "You need to stay away from my wife.

521
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 "You need to leave her alone."

522
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,040
 Jimmy gets mad.

523
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,960
 No one tells Jimmy what to do.

524
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,080
 Jimmy speaks to the third person.

525
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,920
 "If Jimmy wants to watch, Jimmy wants to watch."

526
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,640
 The arguing turns into a fight.

527
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,400
 Alex says, "You're gonna pay for what you did."

528
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,880
 Right now, you're gonna pay for what you did.

529
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,460
 The next thing Alex knows, he's at work.

530
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,340
 When the police show up to his place of business,

531
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,600
 they ask, "What's going on?"

532
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,900
 And he tells the story I just told.

533
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,520
 Came home, saw Jimmy staring,

534
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,980
 gotten an argument, gotten a fist fight.

535
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,860
 The next thing he knew, he was at work.

536
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,260
 He quote unquote, blacked out.

537
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,820
 But the police already know what happened.

538
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,060
 They've been to Jimmy's house.

539
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,000
 Jimmy said he was doing some gardening on June 14th, 2019.

540
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,040
 He was doing some gardening.

541
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,160
 He was making breakfast for the girls.

542
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,720
 Dad stuff, right?

543
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
 Just dad stuff.

544
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,640
 He sees Alex staring at him from across the field.

545
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,480
 What?

546
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,920
 I don't know, that weirdo.

547
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,320
 Alex walks up to Jimmy's house

548
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,080
 and is standing at the doorway.

549
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,600
 Now, Jimmy can tell just from the way Alex is standing,

550
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,520
 he's hiding something, not emotionally.

551
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,980
 Not, I don't want him to know my secret crush.

552
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,380
 The fact that it looks like he has something

553
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,220
 tucked under his arm.

554
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,460
 His arms are crossed and it looks like

555
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,460
 he's kind of concealing something.

556
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,780
 But the door's open and Alex can just walk in.

557
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
 And as he steps inside, Jimmy looks

558
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,780
 and he can tell what Alex is concealing is a pistol.

559
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,660
 Jimmy's daughter sees Alex, Uncle Alex.

560
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,700
 These people have known each other for four years.

561
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,500
 Their kids play together.

562
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,180
 Jimmy's oldest daughter goes running towards Alex

563
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,260
 to give him a hug.

564
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,000
 And Alex just pushes her away,

565
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 pulls out the gun and puts it right to Jimmy's head.

566
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,260
 He forces Jimmy into the bedroom of the mobile home

567
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,600
 and he shuts the bedroom door.

568
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,600
 Alex tells Jimmy, quote, "I hate that you have a good life

569
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,760
 "and I don't."

570
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,760
 He then pulls out a two foot long metal pipe

571
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,960
 he had hidden in his pants.

572
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,840
 How did this guy walk in like a gingerbread man?

573
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,500
 I have no idea how he moved with a two foot long,

574
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,280
 my legs are two feet long, maybe longer.

575
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,740
 But the point is, my knees aren't.

576
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,280
 I couldn't be able to move my knees.

577
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,380
 He pulls out a two foot long metal pipe

578
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,560
 and says, "I'm going to ask you a series of questions

579
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,320
 "and every time you lie,

580
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,240
 "I'm going to break a bone."

581
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,680
 Jimmy knows what's coming

582
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,320
 and he knows that he's going to start questioning him

583
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,400
 about whether or not he's still been sleeping with his wife,

584
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,480
 how many times they slept together, all of this stuff.

585
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,480
 And he's begging Alex, "Listen, just leave, just leave,

586
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,680
 "just leave, I won't call the cops, just leave.

587
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,720
 "I've never slept with your wife again.

588
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,500
 "Please, please just leave."

589
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,360
 For whatever reason, Alex then just drops the metal pipe.

590
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,080
 He's no longer going to do that gimmick.

591
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,800
 He's no longer going to play that game.

592
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,760
 He decides to move to phase two.

593
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,020
 He has Jimmy stand up and get his hands tied behind his back.

594
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,480
 Bad move.

595
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,760
 Never get in the car, never get tied up.

596
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,520
 And it's funny because I can say that

597
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,200
 and I can tell you that, and you guys,

598
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,760
 if you're ever faced with this,

599
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,520
 it's better to get shot in the head than to get tied up.

600
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,560
 Because once you're tied up,

601
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,760
 who knows what's going to happen to you.

602
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,880
 It could become three days of horrible, horrible events.

603
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,160
 Never get in the car, it's better to get shot

604
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,720
 in the street corner where everyone sees it

605
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,920
 than be taken out in the desert.

606
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,080
 And again, stuff could go on for days and days and days.

607
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,880
 There's a little asterisk to that though,

608
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,720
 which I don't really think about

609
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,880
 because I'm not in this situation.

610
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,060
 But if there are kids involved,

611
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,760
 you may decide to get tied up.

612
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,920
 His daughter is in the mobile home.

613
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,520
 As far as he knows, it's still in the mobile home.

614
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,560
 If she was in the mobile home,

615
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,800
 she got pushed aside when the gun pulled out.

616
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,480
 She could have ran off to get help,

617
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,040
 but they don't say her age,

618
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,920
 but I'm imagining she's fairly young in the story.

619
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,240
 Seven or eight or something like that.

620
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,400
 Normally like 16 year old girls don't run up

621
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,800
 and hug uncle Alex, right?

622
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,480
 I think she's young enough and they needed a babysitter.

623
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,240
 So that'll also make me think they're probably like

624
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,340
 nine or 10 or younger.

625
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,480
 So Jimmy decides to let his hands get tied up.

626
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,920
 Alex then forces Jimmy to be on his feet.

627
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,100
 So hands are firmly tied behind his back.

628
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,120
 Jimmy's now standing up.

629
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,320
 I'm starting to, I don't know why,

630
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,640
 why I didn't think about this before.

631
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,400
 I'm starting to second guess the name I gave him

632
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,120
 that was not intentional.

633
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,040
 I just came up with a fake name.

634
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,900
 Jimmy is not his real name.

635
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,920
 Alex pulls down Jimmy's pants.

636
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,800
 We have two quotes,

637
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,160
 all of this information is from the police report.

638
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,800
 And all of the quotes are paraphrases

639
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,080
 of what is actually being said.

640
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,080
 So unless I do this, when I say quote,

641
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,020
 you are not going to die, Alex says,

642
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,100
 which you are going to have something to remember this

643
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,880
 for your whole life.

644
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,540
 This is normal.

645
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,740
 You will not die today.

646
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,100
 Unquote.

647
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,580
 Alex at this point pulls out gloves and a rubber band.

648
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,020
 Oddly prepared for this.

649
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,220
 I don't know what the pipe was.

650
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,460
 I don't know if the pipe,

651
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,100
 'cause it doesn't sound like he wanted to do that at all.

652
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,300
 It might have just been a way to control the situation

653
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,780
 with violence.

654
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,620
 If the gun to the head didn't work,

655
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,920
 I mean, you figured that would be it.

656
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,320
 Why would you need a two foot pipe

657
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,600
 that would make it hard for you to walk?

658
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,120
 This was his plan all along.

659
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,100
 He puts on gloves, he grabs a rubber band,

660
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:05,240
 and he begins to put the rubber band onto Jimmy's dick

661
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,560
 and then wraps it around again and again and again,

662
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,740
 cutting off circulation.

663
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,240
 Then Alex pulls out a pair of scissors.

664
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,480
 (laughs)

665
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,320
 I want you to go to,

666
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,360
 I want you to pause the air if you're still listening

667
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,760
 to this right now.

668
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,520
 I want you to go somewhere in your house,

669
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,320
 not somewhere in your house to cry.

670
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,200
 I want you to go in your house.

671
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,060
 I want you to find the sharpest pair of scissors

672
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,640
 in your house right now.

673
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,740
 Spoiler alert, they're not that sharp.

674
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,320
 They're pointy, but they're not that sharp.

675
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,080
 Now, unless you're like a medical student

676
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,240
 and you're constantly cutting clothes off of crash victims,

677
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,080
 I don't know why medical students do that

678
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,000
 and not the EMTs.

679
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,320
 Or you're like a chef with those special like scissors

680
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,580
 that cut carrots or whatever, maybe.

681
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,280
 But like the scissors I use to like cut paper, uh-uh.

682
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,840
 No way are those sharp enough to do

683
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,240
 what Alex is going to try to do.

684
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,420
 He begins to try to cut off Jimmy's dick

685
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,640
 with a pair of scissors that you would find in your household.

686
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,640
 And Jimmy is jumping from side to side,

687
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,640
 hands bound as the scissors sips, sips,

688
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,400
 moving through the air and closing, sssh.

689
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,340
 Right before they cut it on his dick.

690
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,320
 It might get a little bit of a pinch,

691
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,620
 a little bit of a nick,

692
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,280
 but Alex is getting frustrated

693
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,280
 that he can't get them to cut into Jimmy's penis.

694
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:56,860
 Listen to this, this passage in the police report

695
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,820
 boggles my mind.

696
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,360
 Because I'm not this strong.

697
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,060
 I don't think I've ever thought I was this strong

698
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,140
 as Jimmy was.

699
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,340
 Listen to this.

700
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,940
 This is from the police report.

701
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,520
 The victim stated that he tried to move to get away

702
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,680
 and to not scream because of his children in the house.

703
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,120
 Could you imagine that?

704
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,320
 A madman is trying to chop off your dick

705
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,520
 and you're thinking of your kids.

706
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,320
 You don't wanna terrify your kids.

707
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,280
 You don't wanna be screaming the fear and the terror

708
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,640
 you feel in your body

709
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,600
 'cause you don't wanna traumatize your children.

710
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,520
 I'm not that strong.

711
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,080
 I wouldn't be the loudest man on the planet.

712
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,640
 They would write songs about me a thousand years from now.

713
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,360
 The voice heard around the world.

714
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,280
 Had I been in this situation, I'm not that strong

715
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,980
 to think of kids.

716
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,980
 I don't wanna have kids, right?

717
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,960
 To me, it might be different,

718
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,200
 but I've just boggles my mind.

719
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,020
 He was trying to be stoic.

720
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,220
 He's almost accepted what's going to happen.

721
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,600
 Alex throws Jimmy to the ground,

722
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,640
 places his knee on Jimmy's chest.

723
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,320
 The game's over.

724
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,000
 He's flat on his back.

725
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,220
 He can't move.

726
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,400
 Jimmy takes the scissors

727
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,600
 and starts cutting off Jimmy's dick.

728
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,320
 Now you might have thought I was exaggerating

729
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,080
 when I said that the scissors were dull,

730
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,440
 that they were just household scissors.

731
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,400
 You're like, Jason, how do you know

732
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,920
 where they're photos of the scissors?

733
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,420
 The police report states that it was taking

734
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,460
 a very long time to cut off his dick.

735
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,460
 He was having to force each cut

736
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,360
 to make its way through the muscle and the fat.

737
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,300
 To the point where Alex was getting frustrated,

738
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,980
 there was blood everywhere.

739
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,100
 Alex could not believe that it took this long

740
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,260
 to cut off human genitalia.

741
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,180
 He's getting frustrated that this isn't already over.

742
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,680
 It was taking so long that at times Alex would stop cutting

743
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,600
 and then put the gun to Jimmy's head once again

744
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,760
 and just hold it there.

745
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,320
 I can only imagine it was because your hand was cramping.

746
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,200
 It was actually getting sore trying to do this.

747
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,800
 So while he was trying to recover from the cramped hand,

748
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,760
 he still needed to inflict terror on Jimmy.

749
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,200
 He'd put the gun to his head

750
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,440
 and then he would go back to cutting.

751
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,580
 (imitates cutting)

752
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,740
 Finally, after a few minutes,

753
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,780
 Alex is able to sever two thirds of Jimmy's penis.

754
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,200
 Jimmy was laying there on the ground.

755
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,620
 His body is shaking.

756
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,860
 He's going into shock and he's looking down

757
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,940
 and he sees what's happened.

758
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,940
 He's trying not to vomit

759
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,780
 as Alex picks up the dick

760
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,820
 and is holding it in his hand and says, quote,

761
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,200
 "Don't act this way.

762
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,720
 "This is not, not like saying I'm a bad example.

763
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,880
 "Not like saying, oh no, don't act like me."

764
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,120
 He's saying, "Don't cheat, don't cheat."

765
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,920
 He goes, "Don't act this way.

766
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,040
 "This is normal."

767
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,360
 He keeps talking about how what he's doing is normal.

768
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,260
 It's all normal.

769
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,560
 He then says, "And if you try to call the police,

770
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,800
 "I will be out in two months

771
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,800
 "and I will come back and finish this."

772
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,440
 This might be the most heartbreaking part

773
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,880
 of the police report.

774
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,000
 Alex is standing there with the penis severed.

775
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,680
 He's holding it in his hand.

776
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,040
 Jimmy is laying on the floor.

777
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
 He's losing a lot of blood.

778
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,360
 He's going into shock.

779
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
 He can't believe this actually happened.

780
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,960
 This is the end of the police report, quote,

781
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,920
 "The victim stated at this point, the defendant left.

782
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,260
 "He stated when the defendant opened the bedroom door,

783
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,520
 "his oldest daughter was laying on the ground

784
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,480
 "by the bottom of the door, watching through the crack."

785
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
 (sighs)

786
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,120
 Dude.

787
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,940
 Could you imagine that?

788
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,200
 I mean, that's just so much to mentally unpack.

789
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,720
 One, Jimmy, who was trying to be stoic this whole time.

790
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,600
 As that bedroom door opens,

791
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,360
 he sees his oldest daughter curled up on the ground.

792
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,560
 She was watching the whole thing

793
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,680
 through that little crack in the door.

794
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,840
 The parts that she couldn't see,

795
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,280
 her imagination was filling in.

796
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,480
 And him just looking at her and the heartbreak,

797
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,280
 he must have gone through for her to have seen that.

798
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,680
 And then that poor girl, like, how,

799
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:43,400
 how would you even process that level of violence?

800
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:49,360
 At any age, prolonged torture, at any age,

801
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,640
 let alone eight, nine, or younger?

802
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,200
 I mean, I'm guessing that door opened

803
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,600
 and he saw his daughter was watching it.

804
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,880
 Isn't that awful, man?

805
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,400
 They never found the penis.

806
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,920
 It's gone.

807
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,680
 They did arrest Alex.

808
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,280
 He goes, "Ah, it's normal, man, it's normal.

809
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,120
 "What are you guys talking about?

810
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,440
 "I blacked out."

811
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,720
 He just recently got sentenced 20 years in prison

812
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,560
 with, I think, 10 years of parole after that.

813
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,160
 He's in his 50s.

814
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,280
 Technically, he shouldn't get out until he's 70,

815
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,720
 but the way that the justice system works sometimes,

816
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,120
 he could be out in five, who knows?

817
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,320
 But hopefully not, right?

818
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,160
 Hopefully not.

819
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,920
 This sounds very premeditated.

820
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,280
 The fact that 20 years actually doesn't seem like that long

821
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,760
 at all considering how premeditated it was.

822
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,760
 He brought in the gloves.

823
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,040
 Just the fact that he's bringing the gloves

824
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,880
 and the rubber bands in.

825
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,800
 It's not like they got into a fight

826
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,280
 and he grabbed a pair of scissors

827
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,440
 and started just trying to snip at it.

828
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,520
 They never found the penis though.

829
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,200
 They could never reattach it.

830
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,320
 Jimmy, again, we don't know his real name,

831
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,160
 he said that, you know, 'cause he was married.

832
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,000
 He was married.

833
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,960
 He was cheating on his wife as well,

834
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,560
 but he goes, "I can't have sex with my wife anymore."

835
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,880
 The doctor says you'll never have any sensation down there.

836
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,520
 He has trouble urinating.

837
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,680
 He can't really have sex in any traditional way.

838
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:18,120
 It's just a story of brutal violence

839
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,340
 on a sunny Florida afternoon.

840
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,920
 One man slept with another man's wife

841
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,040
 and he got his dick chopped off by a jealous husband.

842
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,000
 The smart move would have been not to sleep

843
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,160
 with the woman in the first place.

844
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,440
 But barring that, when you hurt somebody

845
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,320
 physically or emotionally,

846
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,880
 you have to be on the lookout for retribution.

847
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,760
 If you've done someone wrong no matter how much

848
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
 you liked them before,

849
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,280
 or no matter how much you like them afterwards,

850
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,240
 if you've done somebody wrong,

851
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,080
 you have to be aware that at any point

852
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,040
 they can strike against you.

853
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,000
 They could be hiding that rage under a perfect smile.

854
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,040
 When you've hurt someone, you cannot trust them.

855
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,400
 Or as my friend put it,

856
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,400
 never go to someone's house

857
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,400
 after you've held their eyeball in your hand.

858
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,200
 (gentle music)

859
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,800

 conspiracy and true crime podcast.

 You don't have to listen to it every day.

865
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,040
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

866
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
 Have a great one, guys.

867
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,620
 (gentle music)

868
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,200
 (upbeat music)

869
00:34:41,200 --> 00:35:05,620
 - This is the story of a home of family game nights

870
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,340
 and living room dance recitals.

871
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,140
 The winds are dying down now.

872
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,580
 - Wow, that was some storm.

873
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,060
 - It's also the story of an insurance company

874
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,740
 that offered information and advice

875
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,180
 to help prepare that home for the worst.

876
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,460
 If it matters to you,

877
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,020
 traveler's insurance will help protect it.

878
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,540
 Travelers, it's better under the umbrella.

879
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,140
 Speak to an independent agent today.
