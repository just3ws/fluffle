 The mechanical death traps that lay all around us.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.580
 And then we cover a story that reminded me of why

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.560
 I love doing this show so much.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.480
 Get your backpacks on.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.680
 We're headed into the ravine today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.160
 Hey, everyone.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.440
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.560
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.360
 I'm having a great day.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.760
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.960
 Hope you guys had a great weekend.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.640
 It was pretty chill out here.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.840
 The weather's been pretty nice.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 I was doing some research, and I found a fascinating story.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.640
 We're going to do that second.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.480
 Also, while I was researching that,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.480
 I found a series of stories that were gruesome and scarily

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.880
 mundane, scarily weird, scarily a word.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.640
 Anyways, OK, they were scary.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.400
 So we're going to start off with that.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.640
 Now, I was trapped in an elevator when I was a little boy.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.880
 I had to have been.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.760
 It was probably back in like 1982, 1983.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.440
 So I would have been about six or seven years old.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.800
 And this was when my dad was still in college,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.440
 and we lived on campus.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.640
 And it was funny.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.480
 A bunch of crazy stuff happened at that campus.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.760
 Some dude robbed a comic book store,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.680
 and he was selling all the comics for like 25 cents, 50

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 cents each.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.080
 And I got Daredevil issue two through maybe 28

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.800
 for a couple bucks, which back then, to be fair, a quarter.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.000
 You could go to the movies by popcorn and a six pack of beer.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.800
 Like back in the 80s, money went much further.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.160
 That's why Daredevil is actually one of my favorite heroes.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.160
 It was the first comic book.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.880
 I read all those stolen comics from the local comic book

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.160
 store.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.440
 But anyways, California Baptist College and Riverside,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.560
 California, I was trapped in an elevator

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.600
 with my older brother and two hot co-eds.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.440
 Now, I didn't know they were hot at the time.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.880
 I kind of had a feeling that they were hot, but I was like seven.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.120
 You know, I wasn't really that into girls,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.440
 plus they were brunettes.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.360
 So, you know, but it sucked.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.240
 It totally sucked.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 We were in there for a couple hours,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.360
 and I was crying the whole time, and I wanted to pee my pants.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.320
 And my older brother was like, if you weren't there, man,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.480
 I would have gotten their phone numbers.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.360
 He was like 12 at the time.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.240
 Anyways, so they spent the time.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.240
 But maybe I was pretending to cry because I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.800
 wanted to get some motherly love from these hot--

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.240
 most likely I actually was crying and peeing my pants.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.160
 Anyways, even through that whole experience,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.200
 I never became afraid of elevators.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.320
 Never developed an elevator fetish, either,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.320
 which is kind of odd now that I think about it.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.560
 But I wonder if people do have elevators--

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.440
 that's a stupid question.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.840
 Of course, people have elevator fetishes.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.240
 Looking at-- what I'm trying to say

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.880
 is I've never had a fear of elevators.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.960
 But when you really kind of step back and think about it,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.760
 it's one of the most bizarre modes of transportation

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.520
 that we use.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.360
 Because most of the other ones we have,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.840
 other than submarines, you can look out of.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.920
 Or armored car, you're being transported because the Joker

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.720
 is trying to kill you.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.400
 Like, for the most part, transportation

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.880
 are designed as a level of comfort and visibility.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.000
 People do not like being trapped in places with no windows.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.200
 And you get into this box that closes.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.560
 And then for a certain amount of time,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.160
 it moves in one direction or another, like elevators--

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.600
 you know how elevators work.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.200
 But when that door reopens, you have no idea what's

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.800
 on the other side of that door.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.560
 You can get in an elevator, the door closed,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.040
 it goes up five levels, door open, fire,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.040
 door open, zombie apocalypse.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.720
 Door opens-- any possibility, because you can't see out of it.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.920
 Now, of course, now that I'm saying that,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.880
 I realize there are different types of elevators.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.840
 And some of them are like cargo elevators,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.880
 where you can visibly see they're not

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.360
 worried about zombies stumbling in.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.120
 But consumer level elevators are quite scary, in a sense.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.000
 So that whole segue goes into this.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.800
 I think people are always afraid of elevators

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.600
 like plummeting, like you're in an elevator,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.880
 and you think, if this falls down,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.920
 have they been falling up?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.960
 If you die in an elevator, could you jump the last moment?

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.400
 Apparently, you're supposed to lay down

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.800
 in the middle of an elevator.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.560
 So you have to be right in the middle of the elevator,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.120
 and you make your body as wide as possible.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.640
 That will help absorb the impact.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.560
 So you don't die.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.560
 But the problem is, when's the last time

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.920
 you've been on an elevator by yourself?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.920
 So don't tell anyone else that tip.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.040
 So if you're ever in an elevator with someone else,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.120
 and it starts to fall, you get down on the ground,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.200
 spread out in the middle, and if someone's screaming,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.440
 what are you doing, what are you doing?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.480
 You say, I'm going to take the full blow

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.160
 of the impact for you, my love.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.880
 You will survive this impact.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.720
 I will die for you.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.480
 And then they get horribly mangled, and you're fine.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.800
 Well, I'm sure you have massive internal bleeding,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.680
 but you're probably gonna live.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.000
 Don't tell anyone else that tip,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.840
 'cause otherwise everyone's

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.360
 gonna be fighting for the middle spot.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.480
 Getting to the point of this story.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.040
 Getting to the point of the story.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.760
 There was a very famous incident of a man in New York

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.880
 who was trapped in an elevator.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.720
 I don't know why I forgot that word all of a sudden,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.920
 that's all I've been talking about.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.600
 Was trapped in an elevator for 41 hours,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.760
 and there's actually video footage of him

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.240
 and what he endured during that 41 hours.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.200
 Now, it's something I wouldn't have thought about at the time,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.320
 but I would think, well, cover this for another episode

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.520
 if I was trapped in an elevator by myself

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.440
 for a period of time,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.560
 I would most likely start masturbating at some point,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.680
 but I didn't realize what there would be

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.520
 video cameras in there.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.560
 And two, the lights are always on.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.120
 And now that doesn't mean that I have to masturbate

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.960
 into the dark.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.120
 What I mean is that you couldn't sleep,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.960
 'cause elevators tend to be fairly bright.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.200
 So that would suck.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.160
 Like you could see the guy trying to sleep,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.840
 but there's this giant light right over him.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.160
 You see him trying to do a bunch of stuff.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.400
 It's a fascinating video that's in the links.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.880
 It's in the show notes, but,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.480
 and you're like, oh, that's an interesting experience.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.640
 You can tell his grandkids about that.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.160
 So, except the masturbating part.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.680
 However, though, not all stories end as well.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.440
 We're going to the year 2016.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.680
 So very, very recent, very, very recent story here.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.160
 We're going to China and it's January.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.520
 Now, the reason why that's important is

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.200
 because it's Chinese New Year.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.560
 So generally for Chinese New Year, you get a week off,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.840
 but a lot of times workers will take days before off

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.920
 and days after off.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.400
 And there was this elevator that needed to be repaired.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.840
 And the repairmen were like, we'll get to it after Chinese.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.440
 I wonder if they call it Chinese New Year over there.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.720
 'Cause we don't call it American New Year over here.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.320
 I'm sure that it's some other name.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.480
 But anyway, so they're like,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.400
 after this holiday that we don't know

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.600
 what the name of it is, we'll come back.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.080
 And so they make the elevator go,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.440
 this is like an apartment complex.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.600
 They make the elevator go all the way down to the first floor.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.360
 They walk over to it and goes, anyone in there?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.320
 No one says anything.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.360
 So they go, no one must be in there.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.680
 And they leave.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.560
 A month later, after they're done partying,

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.840
 or whatever they do during Chinese New Year,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.640
 they come back and the maintenance men come back

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.300
 to the elevator and the apartment complex to work on it.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.200
 So for the whole month,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.760
 no one had been able to use this elevator.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.920
 Stairs, stairs all the way up.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.660
 They open up the elevator and there is a woman in there.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.440
 Her hands mangled from trying to claw open the doors.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.920
 She'd been in there for a month.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.000
 Dead, I guess I have to add to that part too.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.840
 She's dead.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.640
 Mangled hands, she's dead.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.360
 Now one of the maintenance workers was actually held

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.760
 for negligent homicide, who's actually charged for it.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.680
 What's interesting was that happened in 2016,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.840
 I wasn't able to find any follow-up articles

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.440
 as to whether or not this guy was actually convicted of it.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.920
 It's also weird that we don't really have a name

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.760
 for the woman.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.120
 It could be from a privacy thing,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.880
 but all we have is her surname, which is Wu.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.200
 And she was in her late 30s to early 40s.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.040
 That's all they inform me.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.000
 And so at this point I'm thinking,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.240
 this story actually might not be true.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.880
 We really don't have a lot of information on it.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.420
 And every article kind of says the exact same details.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.920
 This is her last name.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.400
 They don't know how old she is.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.320
 It was kind of weird.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.120
 And then people in the apartment complex for one,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.400
 and journalists overall were saying,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.960
 "How come no one noticed this woman

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.200
 "was missing for a month?"

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.280
 And then it kind of spun out into this thing.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.960
 I read an article saying that single women

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.120
 should have an app on their phone to alert.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.560
 They don't press the button every day.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.000
 Their loved ones come looking for them.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.840
 I'm thinking, "Isn't that what we do to like six year olds

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.560
 "or people who are like severely mentally disabled?"

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.200
 I can't believe someone suggested that.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.120
 Women should have an app where they have to check in every day.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.680
 But anyway, someone did.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.120
 There's one, and I read down, I was like,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.960
 "Well, that'd be gruesome."

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.880
 And the thing is people go,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.360
 "Oh, she was trapped in there for a month."

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.200
 Technically, no, she wasn't.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.400
 I mean, you can go between three days

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.440
 and a week without water.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.840
 So I mean, look on the bright side,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.960
 she was only trapped in there for a week most.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.520
 But dying of dehydration, I actually had a monoflareup

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.360
 a couple of years ago.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.880
 My throat swelled shut.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.720
 I didn't know what it was.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.000
 I didn't have insurance.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.520
 I was just sitting in my grandma's house

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.960
 getting worse and worse and worse,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.760
 waiting for whatever I had to break.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.880
 And I went three days without drinking anything.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.720
 It was too painful.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.600
 I could barely talk.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.160
 And going three days without any,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.240
 I think within three days,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.120
 I had one coffee cup full of water.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.640
 That's all I could get down.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.200
 It was painful, or I felt like,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.200
 that was the closest I ever came to dying a natural death.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.400
 I could feel my body like shutting down.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.600
 Finally, a friend came over,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.520
 Chelsea came over, took me to the ER.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.240
 They put an IV in me and I told the nurse

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.840
 when I got that first burst of liquid, I said,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.160
 "It's like taking a shower in sprites."

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.840
 It was the most refreshing feeling

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.000
 I'd ever had in my life.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.040
 I was that close to just dying

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.760
 and then all of a sudden, my body was full of liquid.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.800
 It was beautiful.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.720
 It was beautiful.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.520
 Anyways, to end that story on a less beautiful note,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.600
 as I'm reading about this elevator thing,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.360
 apparently China has a big problem over there.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.920
 They had one month where five people,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.560
 well actually nothing about it, yeah.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.000
 Five people died in one month

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.560
 in China due to elevator accidents,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.000
 but China also has a lot of people and it's quite big.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.160
 So I mean, you could just be statistical,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.240
 but they have a lot of industrial problems over there.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.080
 There's so many videos of people.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.360
 One of the videos is a guy is getting,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.360
 it's horrible that you can watch this online,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.520
 but there's a guy getting in an elevator

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.840
 and the elevator starts going up

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.920
 while he's halfway in, halfway out.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.920
 And then it goes up too fast and it compresses him,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.880
 not like in accordion.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.840
 He's not Tom and Jerry,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.240
 but he gets crushed in between the top of the elevator

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.560
 and the floor going up.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.520
 And so his knee is pressed up against his shoulder

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.800
 and his other leg is hanging out of the elevator.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.880
 And then it stops 'cause it's jammed and he suffocates.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.480
 So it's not even like he got chopped in half

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.400
 like final destination.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.240
 It wasn't a quick death.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.760
 He just kind of sat there and suffocated

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.640
 while his friends were watching.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.600
 Horrible.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.560
 But if you think that's bad,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.840
 I hope you don't have an escalator fetish

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.760
 because we're still in China for this one.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.920
 This story was, you're like,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.320
 "Jayson, why are you starting off

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.200
 "these industrial accident stories?"

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.400
 I just found this so interesting

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.520
 'cause these are things we use every single day

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.600
 for the most part.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.680
 I mean, I don't use escalators all the time,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.400
 but I use them occasionally.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.160
 I didn't even know this was a thing.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.120
 Once my shoelace got stuck in an escalator,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.120
 but I mean, that was fine.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.720
 I just pulled my foot.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.120
 Actually, my dad pulled my foot until the shoelace broke.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.120
 So in China, though, there was a one,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.840
 just fairly recent as well.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.080
 This happened before the elevator incident.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.280
 There's this video footage of two maintenance workers

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.120
 at a mall.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.200
 They're standing at the top of an escalator

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.640
 and they're discussing something, right?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.720
 And you see a woman and her son

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.340
 who appears to maybe be like six or seven

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.160
 coming up the escalator.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.200
 And the two guys are just kind of standing there.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.640
 And when the woman and her son

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.600
 get to the top of the escalator,

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.000
 she takes a step onto where you would assume

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.240
 it's supposed to be solid ground

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.160
 and know any sort of quick sandish type technology.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.000
 But when she steps off the escalator,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 she steps on a metal plate that then flips off.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.800
 It wasn't attached right.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.960
 She falls into the gears of the escalator

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.420
 and it eats her.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.760
 It just grinds her up.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.320
 And as she's getting horribly, horribly mangled,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.080
 she pushes her son to the workers,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.600
 clear of the machinery,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.060
 and she gets chewed up.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.480
 There's video of that too.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.460
 And I was like, I'm not watching that video.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.160
 I didn't watch the elevator video,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.360
 but they're like warning.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.260
 There may be gruesome footage in this video.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.440
 And then they just show you still photographs

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.960
 from the camera, like as I'm reading the article

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.400
 of one, a guy like stuck in an elevator.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.080
 And then the other one, half a woman in a machine

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.960
 pushing her son.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.520
 I'm like, if you're warning me that they've don't,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520
 not to watch the video,

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.600
 why are you showing me some of the photographs from?

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.920
 It's just as bad.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.280
 But anyways, apparently just chewed her up.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.360
 And the answer to all that,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.240
 the newspaper in China the next day

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.120
 ran an article telling you how to shut off an escalator.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.900
 Wasn't the escalators fault?

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.080
 Woman should have known how to hit that button.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.220
 So there we go.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.440
 Our escalator slash elevator,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.540
 or should we call them elevators?

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.120
 Those little simple things we use to,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.160
 I wanna say teleport,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.920
 those little simple things we use to transport around,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.240
 millions of people use them every day.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.300
 Some people get squished.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.140
 It's bizarre.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.500
 I mean, and to make it even worse,

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.680
 the escalator as the woman was getting chewed up

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.680
 and the maintenance guys were working there,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.480
 everyone else is just shopping.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.800
 The dad, the dad of the boy was on another floor,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.880
 shopping and then eventually he sees a commotion.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.600
 He goes down there, his wife's jelly.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.640
 Bizarre dude.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.920
 That would totally ruin your shopping experience.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.760
 That would totally,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.160
 I mean, you would just be bummed out forever.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.240
 So from that, let's go ahead and move on to the ravine.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.920
 Now, the ravine story is one of those things is,

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.480
 as I was researching it, I was like, hmm.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.440
 And I do that a lot,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.600
 but then when I get to the end of it, I'm like,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.240
 and I type up all my notes and I'm like,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.960
 okay, I kinda know what approach I'm taking with this,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.240
 but let's start off.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.000
 I will take you down the same path that I traveled.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.080
 The year 1970s, very, very vague thing.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.040
 So right here you think, hmm, this is most likely fake,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.920
 but 1970s.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.520
 I found this article about this event

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.520
 that supposedly took place in the 1970s.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.480
 It's in South America, I believe.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.880
 There was a college professor, an unnamed college professor.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.640
 We've done enough episodes where we again,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.800
 know where this story's going.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.840
 The year is, there's no specific year.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.280
 There's no specific name.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.360
 We do know that this college professor

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.200
 taught at a college called the University of the Andes.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.720
 He walks out of his office one day after school,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.840
 talks to a couple of his colleagues,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.200
 talks to a couple of students.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.640
 He's walking out to the parking lot,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.360
 generally just a liked guy.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.480
 People know who he is.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.520
 They don't say his name,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.720
 but we'll assume he was very popular before.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.240
 And once this unnamed college professor gets to his car,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.920
 someone says his name, he turns to him,

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.640
 he waves goodbye to him, gets into the car,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.680
 and then no one ever saw him again.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.640
 The car was still in the parking lot.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.200
 The last anyone saw was him getting in the car.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.180
 They never saw the car drive away.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.720
 He's been missing for 40 years.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.720
 Now, that supposedly was written up in the L timepo,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.040
 which is Venezuela's largest newspaper.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.320
 It was supposedly written up by a journalist

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.640
 known as Sugunda Pena.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.760
 You'll see article after article referring

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.640
 to this very vague event, and they'll say,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.480
 "Here's the article,"

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.640
 and you click on it, it says, "Page Not Found."

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.080
 So, it's possible the story never existed.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.720
 It started as an internet legend,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.280
 and they just linked it to a page that never was there.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.240
 It's possible that the story was published by that newspaper

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.440
 at some point, but I see that from time to time

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.240
 where older articles are no longer found on that website,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.760
 but they did exist at one point

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.240
 because I have them cached somewhere else.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.720
 Or it could be that it was in the newspaper,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.920
 and then they realized that this story is ridiculous,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.560
 and then they removed it from their website.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.200
 All three of those are possible,

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.960
 but I can't get any more information on that,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.280
 and there's just nothing specific about it.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.200
 So, who knows whether or not it's true

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.560
 in any way, shape, or form,

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.600
 but as I kept researching that,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.680
 I found this story.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.680
 This is the story of the girl of the pairs,

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.960
 or the pair girl,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.000
 and pair as in, (makes crunching noises)

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.040
 like a fruit that you eat,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.680
 not as like two of kind.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.200
 Let's hop into Dead Rabbit Durgible

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.680
 because we're gonna leave Venezuela.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.880
 We got across the Atlantic.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.080
 We're going to Spain.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.480
 Specifically, we're going to the island of Tenerife.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.840
 Tenerife, it's one of the,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.240
 it's the largest island in the Canary Islands.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.040
 So, we float over there on the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.560
 We're going back in time to the year 1910,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.680
 and we're in the year 1910,

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.960
 and there's a young girl there,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.640
 not named.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.640
 So again,

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.160
 a little suspicious.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
 Again, some people place this story not in 1910,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.400
 but 1905.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.960
 So, as I'm reading this, I'm thinking,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.400
 it's still fairly vague.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.280
 We have a girl who's not named.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.600
 Could, there's a five-year difference

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.840
 between when the story may have taken place.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.600
 And for the most part, it is considered a legend in the area.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.680
 This young girl is just chilling at her house,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.760
 and they're all eating lunch.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.200
 And the mom says, "Honey, will you go,"

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.040
 we'll just call her Honey,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.120
 "Honey, will you go to the pear farm?"

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.600
 The pear orchard, I guess is the right word.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.160
 "Your dad wants pears for dessert."

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.240
 And she's like, "Yes, mama, I will go get pears.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.520
 "That'll be a fun adventure.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.600
 "I'll go get my friends."

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.880
 And the mom's like, "Yeah, your friends."

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.160
 'Cause she knows she doesn't have any friends.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.000
 She's kind of a loser.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.960
 So, Honey goes out into the village

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.920
 and tries to round up some friends.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.720
 Says, "Hey, do you guys wanna go pick pears

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.560
 "for my dad?

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.400
 "He needs..."

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.160
 I imagine like you just don't need a pear for dessert.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.000
 I figure if that, you would just have pears

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.840
 on the dinner table.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.960
 They probably like covered them in honey

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.000
 or sugar or something like that.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.040
 But anyways, so she's like,

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.440
 "Hey, do you guys wanna go into the orchard with me

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.400
 "to go get pears?"

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.400
 And her friends, she actually did have friends.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.400
 Her mom just doesn't think very highly of her.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.520
 Her friends go, "Oh, no way, dude.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.480
 "Because we know where that pear orchard is."

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.120
 Now, this pear orchard was owned by the honey's family.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.120
 And it was in a place called Baranco de Chamoco.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.160
 And that area is littered with caves.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.680
 And going far, far back, the people living there

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.240
 believe that the caves are inhabited by spirits.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.760
 It's not a place you wanna go.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.240
 It's definitely not a place you wanna go as a child.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.000
 The whole place is just generally spooky.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.960
 It's basically Elm Street but a ravine full of caves

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.200
 and people disappear.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.380
 So she can't get any of her friends to go with her.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.920
 She goes, "Well, I gotta go get the pears.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.120
 "Like, I have to go."

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.360
 So she goes off into the ravine

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.020
 and she starts picking pears.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.200
 And when she's in the ravine,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.800
 she starts to feel just the heat of the sun on her.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.160
 She's like, "Oh my God, it's so hot.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.200
 "I wish my dad didn't eat pears.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.560
 "I wish my dad was allergic to pears

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.320
 "and I can give him one and he just swells up and die.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.520
 "I hate my dad so much.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.000
 "I hate him so much."

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.840
 But as she's having these horrible thoughts,

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.960
 just the sun's beaten down on her.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.360
 And she begins to notice a very cool mist in the area

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.800
 and she's thinking, "That's not normal."

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.800
 And she's watching this mist kind of roll through the ravine.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.240
 And it's enveloping her skin

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.680
 and she just immediately feels a cool relief

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.440
 from the hot, hot sun.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.520
 She's almost lost in the mist at this point.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.680
 And that's when a tall figure,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.120
 dressed in all white, appears out of the mist

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.440
 and leads her down what she described

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.760
 as an impossibly long corridor.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.120
 And she goes, "At first I was scared, obviously,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.040
 "because this is something completely out of the ordinary.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.360
 "But I felt compelled to keep walking

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.280
 "and the creature or the person or whatever it was

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.680
 "kept making hand signals.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.320
 "That's the only way it could communicate with honey

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.640
 "was by making hand signals to her

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.760
 "of where to go, how to follow her.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.640
 "And that was the only way the creature

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.960
 "could communicate with honey."

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.080
 So they walk all the way down this passage

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.880
 and eventually she said it opened up

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.520
 into a beautiful orchard.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.400
 Like they were on this little precipice

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.480
 and she looked down, she saw this orchard going

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.960
 as far as the eye could see.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.040
 She said, "Every type of fruit,

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.280
 "every type of tree you can imagine was there."

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.520
 And the valley was littered with people

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.840
 just like the stranger who let her down the cave.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.560
 She said, "It looked like a watercolor painting in motion."

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.320
 She's the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.280
 She immediately felt this just sense of peace

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.520
 and joy come over her.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.880
 Now, when I'm reading this, I'm thinking at this point,

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.160
 what she inhaled was most likely some sort of noxious

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.440
 or toxic gas since she had a near-death experience.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.800
 We have the tunnel of light,

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.760
 we have the beat overcome with a sense of joy and wonder.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.800
 We have a guardian angel type figure.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.720
 And I'm like, "Okay, she walked out there,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.120
 "the earth farted, she started to pass out

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.160
 "because of some sort of carbon dioxide overdose."

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.080
 And then she woke up.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.480
 But as I'm continuing to read this story,

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.280
 she's in the cave and eventually her guide,

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.680
 the tall being, began to motion her away

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.280
 and motioned her back down with his hand saying,

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.000
 "Hey, come here, come here, you can do it,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.480
 "you're a good girl, good girl."

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.040
 Motioning her, that's the only way they could communicate

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.040
 back down the corridor.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.600
 And then she finds herself back in the pair orchard.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.000
 But the first thing she notices, the cool mist is gone

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 and it is 10, 15 degrees hotter than when she left.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.040
 And she's thinking, "There is no way

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.960
 "it could be this hot all of a sudden."

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.960
 And now she's getting scared again

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.960
 because now she's back in our world

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.400
 and she's experiencing something

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.880
 that she shouldn't experience.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.560
 So anyway, she gets to Paris

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.520
 'cause she still has to do her job

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.160
 and she's just figuring, "I'll tell them about the

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.880
 "monster people in the valley and all that stuff."

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.960
 It'll be a cool story while we're eating Paris.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.560
 She makes her way out of the ravine

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.040
 and she notices a road that wasn't there

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.080
 when she went into the ravine.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.640
 She's like, "Uh-oh, is this something?"

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.120
 Okay, okay.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.960
 And as she's walking down the road,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.760
 she begins to see cars driving on the road,

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.680
 which she described as futuristic looking cars.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.800
 But she is finally able to make her way home

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.800
 and there her mother, her now middle-aged mother greets her.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.080
 It's the year 1940, 30 years past

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.360
 while she was in the ravine.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.440
 And the mother calls out and says,

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.960
 "It's my girl, it's my girl."

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.080
 Her name was, her name became, or the story is,

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.160
 "La Nina de Las Paris."

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.760
 Paras or the Paragirl is how it's kind of known.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.640
 So it's a local legend in that area

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.360
 about this girl who went looking for Paris

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.400
 in this ravine that everyone knows is haunted

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.200
 and then came back 30 years later.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.720
 So interesting story,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.760
 possible proof of a time slip,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.340
 most likely a local legend of a spooky place.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.140
 And again, a lot of these legends have a core moral value.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.980
 This one would be kids don't go there alone.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.820
 You go there alone, something bad may happen.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.660
 Stay out of there.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.140
 You know, that's how these urban legends are created.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.160
 But as I'm reading that article, I go,

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.500
 "This sounds familiar.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.980
 This sounds really familiar."

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.700
 You know, when I watched "Buffet of Empire Slayer"

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.880
 it's funny because my favorite character on that show

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.240
 was Giles.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.040
 Love that, love that character.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.040
 I always loved the idea of like researching books

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.840
 and like having like five books out on the table

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.740
 and going through it and trying to like solve this mystery.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.080
 He was always my favorite character.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.160
 I always felt more like,

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.940
 I always felt he was the most relatable one

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.600
 'cause that's kind of the way that I approached stuff.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.720
 Not like I ever fought demons, well actually I did.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.020
 But the point is is that I always liked that ideal

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.420
 and even that visual,

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.020
 aesthetic, whatever, that thing that you look at

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.540
 and you go, "I like that."

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.220
 So I'm reading this article in the coffee shop.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.800
 It was getting ready to just be another weird disappearing

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.700
 thing I was gonna do about the guy in the car

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.740
 and then go, "Oh, here's a local legend I found too."

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.140
 But as I'm reading it, I said, "I've heard this story."

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.980
 And not only have I heard it,

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.020
 I heard it almost 2000 miles away.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.700
 We're going to Moscow.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.860
 So outside of Moscow, there is a place known as

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.540
 Golosov Ravine.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.660
 In the year 1621, a detachment of Tatar horsemen,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.100
 we've covered them before in the Great Mud Flood thing,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.820
 the empire that's pretty much been erased

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.100
 from the history books.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.540
 In 1621, a detachment of Tatar horsemen show up

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.140
 at the Tsarist Palace and are immediately taken prisoner

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.740
 'cause they shouldn't be there at all.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.140
 And when they're being questioned, they go,

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.180
 "What are you doing here?

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.100
 "Why are you, why did a bunch of like Caldremen

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.820
 "show up here in the middle of the day?"

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.500
 And they go, "We have some questions."

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.900
 Yes, to be fair, we did try invading you guys,

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.060
 but something's wrong, something's off.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.460
 And as they're basically being questioned

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.700
 by the Russian forces,

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.940
 'cause the Tatar empire and the Russians

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.780
 did not like each other.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.620
 I guess if you didn't listen to that episode,

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.260
 they hated each other actually.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.820
 But anyways, as the Russians were trying to figure out

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.500
 why these guys showed up in the middle of nowhere,

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.020
 they start to notice something.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.020
 One, they appeared out of the middle of nowhere,

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.620
 but two, their armor was old

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.500
 and not like old and rusted and busted and stuff like that.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.020
 It was an old style armor.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.740
 It was an armor that the Tatar empire had not used

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.900
 since 1570, 50 years earlier.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:47.460
 And what the Tatar soldiers were saying was,

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.660
 "Listen, when we were there at the Battle of Moscow,

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.820
 "you guys started with an R-Butt.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.260
 "You guys are far more better prepared

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.380
 "than we gave you credit for."

00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:00.220
 So we, us group of guys took off and we hid,

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.820
 and the investigators going,

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.940
 "Let me guess, let me guess,

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.820
 "you hid in Golosov, Ravine."

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.420
 Tatar soldiers like, "Yeah, how'd you know?"

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.780
 And the Russians go, "You know, that place is haunted.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.940
 "We don't, it's not a place that we go.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.260
 "It's just this weird placement,

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.740
 "a lot of disappearances and stuff like that there."

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.420
 And this may be the cause of a why.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.900
 And the Tatar soldiers said, "Yes, we went,

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.900
 "we hid in the Ravine and a mist rolled through the Ravine."

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.180
 Next thing we knew, we came out of the Ravine.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.020
 We noticed things weren't right.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.100
 None of our other soldiers were here.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.820
 Couldn't get a hold of anybody.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.660
 Lost and with nothing else to do,

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.500
 we came back to Moscow thinking,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.140
 "Hey, maybe we won the battle."

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.020
 Or maybe we could just get some answers.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.140
 But that's not it.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.180
 That's not what I was reminded of

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.260
 when I read the story of the Paragirl.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.660
 Golosov Ravine, 1832.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.740
 Two local peasants get drunk.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.980
 They're having a good time, just hanging out.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.820
 Just chilling, throwing their arms around each other,

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.140
 tickling each other.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.220
 And these two peasants say, "You know what?

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:13.420
 "Let's take a shortcut home through Golosov Ravine."

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.980
 I'm like, "Okay, why'd you pronounce it differently

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.460
 "that time than you did every other time?"

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.100
 He's like, "I don't know, I'm drunk."

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.060
 So these two peasants go into the Ravine,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.060
 a mist rolls through.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.340
 They come out of the Ravine, 20 years had passed.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.300
 When they get home, their wives don't recognize them.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.020
 But they had a bit of a different twist on their story.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.580
 They said, when the two peasants said,

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.620
 "When we went into the Ravine,

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.180
 "the mist rolled through

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.180
 "and a giant corridor appeared out of nowhere."

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:45.540
 Out of that corridor, a tall, hairy person walked

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:50.180
 and communicated with us only using their hands.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.580
 And led us back out of the corridor.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:59.380
 The Tatar story and the two peasants' story,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.500
 supposedly, were both investigated by the government.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.980
 The Tatar story was apparently like that,

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.060
 was an official report was filed with the Russian government

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.660
 over why these soldiers showed up out of nowhere.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.140
 And again, reportedly, the peasants' story

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.380
 was an official police transcript.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.140
 And when the police went out to the Ravine

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.460
 to investigate whether or not their story was true,

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.940
 one of the officers disappeared.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.940
 Those particular details, I can't verify.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.020
 I found articles talking about it,

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.220
 but I couldn't find actually a police report from 1832.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.620
 Those may or may not exist.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:40.700
 What I find fascinating is these two stories,

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.700
 one in Golosov Ravine and one in the Canary Islands.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.300
 Separated by decades and thousands of miles,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.020
 have similarities.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.800
 Now, normally, if the story is completely made up,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.960
 they will say this is similar to what happened

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.740
 at Golosov Ravine.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.300
 Or Golosov Ravine's story,

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.900
 if they took the idea from the Paragirl,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.180
 they'll say, you know, there's precedence for this,

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.740
 something else like this happened in the Canary Islands.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.940
 As far as I can tell, these two stories

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.860
 have never, ever been connected.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.900
 And all of my research, I have never found

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.300
 one referencing the other.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.380
 The resources on Golosov Ravine are almost all in Russian.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.460
 There's like a short Wikipedia article

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.220
 and a couple articles in English,

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.420
 and all of the sourced material is in Russian.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.900
 I added translation stuff.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.240
 The Canary story, again,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.020
 like I had to go to websites and translate from Spanish.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.620
 These two stories, as far as I can tell,

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.580
 have never been connected.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.340
 And they both, even if certain details are wrong,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.380
 like the 1905s to the 1910,

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.660
 the details of a ravine,

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.120
 full of mist, a long tunnel,

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.960
 a tall person, one of them they're hairy

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.860
 and one of them they're just tall.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.140
 They don't say how much hair they have.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.260
 They could be like a smooth otter body.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.060
 Could be a full on bear, we don't know.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:06.340
 But you have the ravine,

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.020
 you have the mist,

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.340
 you have the tunnel,

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.340
 you have something tall,

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.580
 only communicating with their hands

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.980
 and most importantly of all, time jumps.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.860
 Totally blew my mind when I was reading it and I go.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.460
 And I thought this sounds familiar.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.460
 And I remember when I was pulling back up my Golisov ravine,

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.940
 which I was gonna do as a separate story,

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.540
 just a small story.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.620
 As I was pulling that up, I said,

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.900
 "I know it has to do with mist and ravine,

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.620
 "but I'm pretty sure they also said something

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.340
 "about only using their hands to communicate."

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.460
 And I pulled it up and that was the case.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.860
 This makes me think that this is very, very real.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:50.860
 This makes me think that this not only has happened,

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.580
 but more interesting enough can happen again.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.220
 But what's weird is you wouldn't have proof of it

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.980
 for decades.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.700
 Is there a limit to how long you're in that tunnel

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.380
 to how long it takes for you to get out?

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.060
 Even if some sort of parapsychologist

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.340
 wanted to replicate this,

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.060
 he's gonna be like, "Okay, seeing in 60 years,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.620
 "like, is there any way to test something like that?"

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.500
 I honestly think, I could be wrong on this,

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.660
 but I honestly think that this is the first time

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.460
 those two events have been connected.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.420
 And if that's the case,

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.500
 this stuff has not been researched at all.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.060
 Because generally, the one in the Canary Islands

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.660
 is considered a local legend.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.780
 It would basically be like if a scientist wanted

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.980
 to investigate whether or not there were real witches

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.860
 in Salem.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.020
 Like you'd be like, "Of course there are not.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:38.940
 "Like we have all of the,

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.020
 "it was just a legend people made up to like,

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.780
 "persecute single women and stuff like that.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.180
 "I think these ravines are real.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.580
 "I think the mist can send you forward in time."

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.260
 I think this story gets added to the list of conspiracies

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.060
 or things I believe in.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.180
 Because either someone made up these stories

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.780
 decades ago and never connected them

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.660
 and just thought it'd be funny if someday someone

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.460
 stumbled across both of them.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.820
 Or in two parts of the world,

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.220
 in two similar circumstances,

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.100
 people traveled into the future in the same way.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:21.100
 If this is true, it's groundbreaking.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.660
 If you can warp time like that on Earth,

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.740
 if we have a natural time machine

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.820
 that shoots people forward in time,

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.620
 do you understand?

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.060
 I mean, really that would change so much.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.940
 But are they real?

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.340
 We'd have to test them.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:43.420
 And then wait and wait and wait for the answer.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:50.020
 Or we just step into the mists ourselves.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:56.700
