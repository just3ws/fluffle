9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,520
 The mechanical death traps that lay all around us.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,580
 And then we cover a story that reminded me of why

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,560
 I love doing this show so much.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,480
 Get your backpacks on.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,680
 We're headed into the ravine today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:40,640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,160
 Hey, everyone.

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,440
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,560
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,360
 I'm having a great day.

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,960
 Hope you guys had a great weekend.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,640
 It was pretty chill out here.

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,840
 The weather's been pretty nice.

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,280
 I was doing some research, and I found a fascinating story.

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,640
 We're going to do that second.

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,480
 Also, while I was researching that,

26
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:07,480
 I found a series of stories that were gruesome and scarily

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,880
 mundane, scarily weird, scarily a word.

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,640
 Anyways, OK, they were scary.

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,400
 So we're going to start off with that.

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,640
 Now, I was trapped in an elevator when I was a little boy.

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,880
 I had to have been.

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,760
 It was probably back in like 1982, 1983.

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,440
 So I would have been about six or seven years old.

34
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,800
 And this was when my dad was still in college,

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,440
 and we lived on campus.

36
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,640
 And it was funny.

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,480
 A bunch of crazy stuff happened at that campus.

38
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,760
 Some dude robbed a comic book store,

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,680
 and he was selling all the comics for like 25 cents, 50

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
 cents each.

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,080
 And I got Daredevil issue two through maybe 28

42
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,800
 for a couple bucks, which back then, to be fair, a quarter.

43
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
 You could go to the movies by popcorn and a six pack of beer.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,800
 Like back in the 80s, money went much further.

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,160
 That's why Daredevil is actually one of my favorite heroes.

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
 It was the first comic book.

47
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,880
 I read all those stolen comics from the local comic book

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,160
 store.

49
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,440
 But anyways, California Baptist College and Riverside,

50
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,560
 California, I was trapped in an elevator

51
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,600
 with my older brother and two hot co-eds.

52
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,440
 Now, I didn't know they were hot at the time.

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,880
 I kind of had a feeling that they were hot, but I was like seven.

54
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,120
 You know, I wasn't really that into girls,

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,440
 plus they were brunettes.

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,360
 So, you know, but it sucked.

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,240
 It totally sucked.

58
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
 We were in there for a couple hours,

59
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,360
 and I was crying the whole time, and I wanted to pee my pants.

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,320
 And my older brother was like, if you weren't there, man,

61
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,480
 I would have gotten their phone numbers.

62
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,360
 He was like 12 at the time.

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,240
 Anyways, so they spent the time.

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
 But maybe I was pretending to cry because I

65
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,800
 wanted to get some motherly love from these hot--

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,240
 most likely I actually was crying and peeing my pants.

67
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,160
 Anyways, even through that whole experience,

68
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,200
 I never became afraid of elevators.

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,320
 Never developed an elevator fetish, either,

70
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
 which is kind of odd now that I think about it.

71
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,560
 But I wonder if people do have elevators--

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,440
 that's a stupid question.

73
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,840
 Of course, people have elevator fetishes.

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,240
 Looking at-- what I'm trying to say

75
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,880
 is I've never had a fear of elevators.

76
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,960
 But when you really kind of step back and think about it,

77
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,760
 it's one of the most bizarre modes of transportation

78
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,520
 that we use.

79
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,360
 Because most of the other ones we have,

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,840
 other than submarines, you can look out of.

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,920
 Or armored car, you're being transported because the Joker

82
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,720
 is trying to kill you.

83
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,400
 Like, for the most part, transportation

84
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,880
 are designed as a level of comfort and visibility.

85
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,000
 People do not like being trapped in places with no windows.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,200
 And you get into this box that closes.

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,560
 And then for a certain amount of time,

88
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,160
 it moves in one direction or another, like elevators--

89
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,600
 you know how elevators work.

90
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,200
 But when that door reopens, you have no idea what's

91
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
 on the other side of that door.

92
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,560
 You can get in an elevator, the door closed,

93
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,040
 it goes up five levels, door open, fire,

94
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
 door open, zombie apocalypse.

95
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,720
 Door opens-- any possibility, because you can't see out of it.

96
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,920
 Now, of course, now that I'm saying that,

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,880
 I realize there are different types of elevators.

98
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,840
 And some of them are like cargo elevators,

99
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,880
 where you can visibly see they're not

100
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,360
 worried about zombies stumbling in.

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
 But consumer level elevators are quite scary, in a sense.

102
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,000
 So that whole segue goes into this.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,800
 I think people are always afraid of elevators

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,600
 like plummeting, like you're in an elevator,

105
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,880
 and you think, if this falls down,

106
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,920
 have they been falling up?

107
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,960
 If you die in an elevator, could you jump the last moment?

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,400
 Apparently, you're supposed to lay down

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
 in the middle of an elevator.

110
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,560
 So you have to be right in the middle of the elevator,

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,120
 and you make your body as wide as possible.

112
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,640
 That will help absorb the impact.

113
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,560
 So you don't die.

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
 But the problem is, when's the last time

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,920
 you've been on an elevator by yourself?

116
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 So don't tell anyone else that tip.

117
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,040
 So if you're ever in an elevator with someone else,

118
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,120
 and it starts to fall, you get down on the ground,

119
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,200
 spread out in the middle, and if someone's screaming,

120
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,440
 what are you doing, what are you doing?

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,480
 You say, I'm going to take the full blow

122
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,160
 of the impact for you, my love.

123
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,880
 You will survive this impact.

124
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
 I will die for you.

125
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,480
 And then they get horribly mangled, and you're fine.

126
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,800
 Well, I'm sure you have massive internal bleeding,

127
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,680
 but you're probably gonna live.

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,000
 Don't tell anyone else that tip,

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,840
 'cause otherwise everyone's

130
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,360
 gonna be fighting for the middle spot.

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,480
 Getting to the point of this story.

132
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,040
 Getting to the point of the story.

133
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,760
 There was a very famous incident of a man in New York

134
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,880
 who was trapped in an elevator.

135
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,720
 I don't know why I forgot that word all of a sudden,

136
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
 that's all I've been talking about.

137
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,600
 Was trapped in an elevator for 41 hours,

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,760
 and there's actually video footage of him

139
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,240
 and what he endured during that 41 hours.

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,200
 Now, it's something I wouldn't have thought about at the time,

141
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,320
 but I would think, well, cover this for another episode

142
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,520
 if I was trapped in an elevator by myself

143
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,440
 for a period of time,

144
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,560
 I would most likely start masturbating at some point,

145
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,680
 but I didn't realize what there would be

146
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,520
 video cameras in there.

147
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,560
 And two, the lights are always on.

148
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,120
 And now that doesn't mean that I have to masturbate

149
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
 into the dark.

150
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,120
 What I mean is that you couldn't sleep,

151
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,960
 'cause elevators tend to be fairly bright.

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,200
 So that would suck.

153
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,160
 Like you could see the guy trying to sleep,

154
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
 but there's this giant light right over him.

155
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,160
 You see him trying to do a bunch of stuff.

156
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,400
 It's a fascinating video that's in the links.

157
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,880
 It's in the show notes, but,

158
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,480
 and you're like, oh, that's an interesting experience.

159
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,640
 You can tell his grandkids about that.

160
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,160
 So, except the masturbating part.

161
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,680
 However, though, not all stories end as well.

162
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
 We're going to the year 2016.

163
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,680
 So very, very recent, very, very recent story here.

164
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,160
 We're going to China and it's January.

165
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
 Now, the reason why that's important is

166
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,200
 because it's Chinese New Year.

167
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,560
 So generally for Chinese New Year, you get a week off,

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
 but a lot of times workers will take days before off

169
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,920
 and days after off.

170
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,400
 And there was this elevator that needed to be repaired.

171
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,840
 And the repairmen were like, we'll get to it after Chinese.

172
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,440
 I wonder if they call it Chinese New Year over there.

173
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,720
 'Cause we don't call it American New Year over here.

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,320
 I'm sure that it's some other name.

175
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,480
 But anyway, so they're like,

176
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,400
 after this holiday that we don't know

177
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,600
 what the name of it is, we'll come back.

178
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,080
 And so they make the elevator go,

179
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,440
 this is like an apartment complex.

180
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,600
 They make the elevator go all the way down to the first floor.

181
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,360
 They walk over to it and goes, anyone in there?

182
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,320
 No one says anything.

183
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,360
 So they go, no one must be in there.

184
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
 And they leave.

185
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,560
 A month later, after they're done partying,

186
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,840
 or whatever they do during Chinese New Year,

187
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,640
 they come back and the maintenance men come back

188
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,300
 to the elevator and the apartment complex to work on it.

189
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,200
 So for the whole month,

190
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,760
 no one had been able to use this elevator.

191
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,920
 Stairs, stairs all the way up.

192
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,660
 They open up the elevator and there is a woman in there.

193
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,440
 Her hands mangled from trying to claw open the doors.

194
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,920
 She'd been in there for a month.

195
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,000
 Dead, I guess I have to add to that part too.

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
 She's dead.

197
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,640
 Mangled hands, she's dead.

198
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,360
 Now one of the maintenance workers was actually held

199
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,760
 for negligent homicide, who's actually charged for it.

200
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,680
 What's interesting was that happened in 2016,

201
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,840
 I wasn't able to find any follow-up articles

202
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
 as to whether or not this guy was actually convicted of it.

203
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,920
 It's also weird that we don't really have a name

204
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,760
 for the woman.

205
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,120
 It could be from a privacy thing,

206
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,880
 but all we have is her surname, which is Wu.

207
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,200
 And she was in her late 30s to early 40s.

208
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,040
 That's all they inform me.

209
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,000
 And so at this point I'm thinking,

210
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,240
 this story actually might not be true.

211
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,880
 We really don't have a lot of information on it.

212
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,420
 And every article kind of says the exact same details.

213
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,920
 This is her last name.

214
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,400
 They don't know how old she is.

215
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,320
 It was kind of weird.

216
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,120
 And then people in the apartment complex for one,

217
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,400
 and journalists overall were saying,

218
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,960
 "How come no one noticed this woman

219
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,200
 "was missing for a month?"

220
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,280
 And then it kind of spun out into this thing.

221
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,960
 I read an article saying that single women

222
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,120
 should have an app on their phone to alert.

223
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,560
 They don't press the button every day.

224
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,000
 Their loved ones come looking for them.

225
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,840
 I'm thinking, "Isn't that what we do to like six year olds

226
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,560
 "or people who are like severely mentally disabled?"

227
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,200
 I can't believe someone suggested that.

228
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,120
 Women should have an app where they have to check in every day.

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,680
 But anyway, someone did.

230
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,120
 There's one, and I read down, I was like,

231
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,960
 "Well, that'd be gruesome."

232
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,880
 And the thing is people go,

233
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,360
 "Oh, she was trapped in there for a month."

234
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,200
 Technically, no, she wasn't.

235
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,400
 I mean, you can go between three days

236
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,440
 and a week without water.

237
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,840
 So I mean, look on the bright side,

238
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,960
 she was only trapped in there for a week most.

239
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,520
 But dying of dehydration, I actually had a monoflareup

240
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,360
 a couple of years ago.

241
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,880
 My throat swelled shut.

242
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,720
 I didn't know what it was.

243
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,000
 I didn't have insurance.

244
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,520
 I was just sitting in my grandma's house

245
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,960
 getting worse and worse and worse,

246
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,760
 waiting for whatever I had to break.

247
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,880
 And I went three days without drinking anything.

248
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
 It was too painful.

249
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,600
 I could barely talk.

250
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,160
 And going three days without any,

251
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,240
 I think within three days,

252
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,120
 I had one coffee cup full of water.

253
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,640
 That's all I could get down.

254
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,200
 It was painful, or I felt like,

255
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,200
 that was the closest I ever came to dying a natural death.

256
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,400
 I could feel my body like shutting down.

257
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,600
 Finally, a friend came over,

258
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,520
 Chelsea came over, took me to the ER.

259
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,240
 They put an IV in me and I told the nurse

260
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,840
 when I got that first burst of liquid, I said,

261
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,160
 "It's like taking a shower in sprites."

262
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,840
 It was the most refreshing feeling

263
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,000
 I'd ever had in my life.

264
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,040
 I was that close to just dying

265
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,760
 and then all of a sudden, my body was full of liquid.

266
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,800
 It was beautiful.

267
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,720
 It was beautiful.

268
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,520
 Anyways, to end that story on a less beautiful note,

269
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,600
 as I'm reading about this elevator thing,

270
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,360
 apparently China has a big problem over there.

271
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,920
 They had one month where five people,

272
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,560
 well actually nothing about it, yeah.

273
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,000
 Five people died in one month

274
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,560
 in China due to elevator accidents,

275
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,000
 but China also has a lot of people and it's quite big.

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,160
 So I mean, you could just be statistical,

277
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,240
 but they have a lot of industrial problems over there.

278
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,080
 There's so many videos of people.

279
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,360
 One of the videos is a guy is getting,

280
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 it's horrible that you can watch this online,

281
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,520
 but there's a guy getting in an elevator

282
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,840
 and the elevator starts going up

283
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,920
 while he's halfway in, halfway out.

284
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,920
 And then it goes up too fast and it compresses him,

285
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,880
 not like in accordion.

286
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,840
 He's not Tom and Jerry,

287
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,240
 but he gets crushed in between the top of the elevator

288
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,560
 and the floor going up.

289
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,520
 And so his knee is pressed up against his shoulder

290
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,800
 and his other leg is hanging out of the elevator.

291
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,880
 And then it stops 'cause it's jammed and he suffocates.

292
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
 So it's not even like he got chopped in half

293
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,400
 like final destination.

294
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,240
 It wasn't a quick death.

295
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
 He just kind of sat there and suffocated

296
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,640
 while his friends were watching.

297
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,600
 Horrible.

298
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,560
 But if you think that's bad,

299
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,840
 I hope you don't have an escalator fetish

300
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,760
 because we're still in China for this one.

301
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,920
 This story was, you're like,

302
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,320
 "Jayson, why are you starting off

303
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,200
 "these industrial accident stories?"

304
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,400
 I just found this so interesting

305
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,520
 'cause these are things we use every single day

306
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,600
 for the most part.

307
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,680
 I mean, I don't use escalators all the time,

308
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,400
 but I use them occasionally.

309
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,160
 I didn't even know this was a thing.

310
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,120
 Once my shoelace got stuck in an escalator,

311
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
 but I mean, that was fine.

312
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,720
 I just pulled my foot.

313
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,120
 Actually, my dad pulled my foot until the shoelace broke.

314
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
 So in China, though, there was a one,

315
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,840
 just fairly recent as well.

316
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,080
 This happened before the elevator incident.

317
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,280
 There's this video footage of two maintenance workers

318
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,120
 at a mall.

319
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,200
 They're standing at the top of an escalator

320
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,640
 and they're discussing something, right?

321
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,720
 And you see a woman and her son

322
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,340
 who appears to maybe be like six or seven

323
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,160
 coming up the escalator.

324
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,200
 And the two guys are just kind of standing there.

325
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,640
 And when the woman and her son

326
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,600
 get to the top of the escalator,

327
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,000
 she takes a step onto where you would assume

328
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,240
 it's supposed to be solid ground

329
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,160
 and know any sort of quick sandish type technology.

330
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,000
 But when she steps off the escalator,

331
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 she steps on a metal plate that then flips off.

332
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,800
 It wasn't attached right.

333
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,960
 She falls into the gears of the escalator

334
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,420
 and it eats her.

335
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,760
 It just grinds her up.

336
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,320
 And as she's getting horribly, horribly mangled,

337
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,080
 she pushes her son to the workers,

338
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,600
 clear of the machinery,

339
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,060
 and she gets chewed up.

340
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,480
 There's video of that too.

341
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,460
 And I was like, I'm not watching that video.

342
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,160
 I didn't watch the elevator video,

343
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,360
 but they're like warning.

344
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,260
 There may be gruesome footage in this video.

345
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,440
 And then they just show you still photographs

346
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,960
 from the camera, like as I'm reading the article

347
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,400
 of one, a guy like stuck in an elevator.

348
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,080
 And then the other one, half a woman in a machine

349
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,960
 pushing her son.

350
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,520
 I'm like, if you're warning me that they've don't,

351
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
 not to watch the video,

352
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,600
 why are you showing me some of the photographs from?

353
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,920
 It's just as bad.

354
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,280
 But anyways, apparently just chewed her up.

355
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,360
 And the answer to all that,

356
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,240
 the newspaper in China the next day

357
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,120
 ran an article telling you how to shut off an escalator.

358
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,900
 Wasn't the escalators fault?

359
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,080
 Woman should have known how to hit that button.

360
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,220
 So there we go.

361
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,440
 Our escalator slash elevator,

362
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,540
 or should we call them elevators?

363
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,120
 Those little simple things we use to,

364
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,160
 I wanna say teleport,

365
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,920
 those little simple things we use to transport around,

366
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
 millions of people use them every day.

367
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,300
 Some people get squished.

368
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,140
 It's bizarre.

369
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,500
 I mean, and to make it even worse,

370
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,680
 the escalator as the woman was getting chewed up

371
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
 and the maintenance guys were working there,

372
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,480
 everyone else is just shopping.

373
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,800
 The dad, the dad of the boy was on another floor,

374
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,880
 shopping and then eventually he sees a commotion.

375
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,600
 He goes down there, his wife's jelly.

376
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,640
 Bizarre dude.

377
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,920
 That would totally ruin your shopping experience.

378
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,760
 That would totally,

379
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,160
 I mean, you would just be bummed out forever.

380
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,240
 So from that, let's go ahead and move on to the ravine.

381
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,920
 Now, the ravine story is one of those things is,

382
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,480
 as I was researching it, I was like, hmm.

383
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,440
 And I do that a lot,

384
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,600
 but then when I get to the end of it, I'm like,

385
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,240
 and I type up all my notes and I'm like,

386
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,960
 okay, I kinda know what approach I'm taking with this,

387
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,240
 but let's start off.

388
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,000
 I will take you down the same path that I traveled.

389
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,080
 The year 1970s, very, very vague thing.

390
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,040
 So right here you think, hmm, this is most likely fake,

391
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,920
 but 1970s.

392
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,520
 I found this article about this event

393
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
 that supposedly took place in the 1970s.

394
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,480
 It's in South America, I believe.

395
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,880
 There was a college professor, an unnamed college professor.

396
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,640
 We've done enough episodes where we again,

397
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,800
 know where this story's going.

398
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,840
 The year is, there's no specific year.

399
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,280
 There's no specific name.

400
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,360
 We do know that this college professor

401
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,200
 taught at a college called the University of the Andes.

402
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,720
 He walks out of his office one day after school,

403
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,840
 talks to a couple of his colleagues,

404
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,200
 talks to a couple of students.

405
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,640
 He's walking out to the parking lot,

406
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,360
 generally just a liked guy.

407
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
 People know who he is.

408
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,520
 They don't say his name,

409
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,720
 but we'll assume he was very popular before.

410
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
 And once this unnamed college professor gets to his car,

411
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
 someone says his name, he turns to him,

412
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,640
 he waves goodbye to him, gets into the car,

413
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,680
 and then no one ever saw him again.

414
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,640
 The car was still in the parking lot.

415
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,200
 The last anyone saw was him getting in the car.

416
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,180
 They never saw the car drive away.

417
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,720
 He's been missing for 40 years.

418
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,720
 Now, that supposedly was written up in the L timepo,

419
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,040
 which is Venezuela's largest newspaper.

420
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,320
 It was supposedly written up by a journalist

421
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,640
 known as Sugunda Pena.

422
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,760
 You'll see article after article referring

423
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,640
 to this very vague event, and they'll say,

424
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,480
 "Here's the article,"

425
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,640
 and you click on it, it says, "Page Not Found."

426
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,080
 So, it's possible the story never existed.

427
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,720
 It started as an internet legend,

428
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,280
 and they just linked it to a page that never was there.

429
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,240
 It's possible that the story was published by that newspaper

430
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,440
 at some point, but I see that from time to time

431
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,240
 where older articles are no longer found on that website,

432
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,760
 but they did exist at one point

433
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,240
 because I have them cached somewhere else.

434
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,720
 Or it could be that it was in the newspaper,

435
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,920
 and then they realized that this story is ridiculous,

436
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,560
 and then they removed it from their website.

437
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,200
 All three of those are possible,

438
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,960
 but I can't get any more information on that,

439
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,280
 and there's just nothing specific about it.

440
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,200
 So, who knows whether or not it's true

441
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,560
 in any way, shape, or form,

442
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,600
 but as I kept researching that,

443
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,680
 I found this story.

444
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,680
 This is the story of the girl of the pairs,

445
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,960
 or the pair girl,

446
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,000
 and pair as in, (makes crunching noises)

447
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,040
 like a fruit that you eat,

448
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
 not as like two of kind.

449
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,200
 Let's hop into Dead Rabbit Durgible

450
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,680
 because we're gonna leave Venezuela.

451
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,880
 We got across the Atlantic.

452
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,080
 We're going to Spain.

453
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,480
 Specifically, we're going to the island of Tenerife.

454
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,840
 Tenerife, it's one of the,

455
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,240
 it's the largest island in the Canary Islands.

456
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,040
 So, we float over there on the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

457
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,560
 We're going back in time to the year 1910,

458
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,680
 and we're in the year 1910,

459
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,960
 and there's a young girl there,

460
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,640
 not named.

461
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
 So again,

462
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,160
 a little suspicious.

463
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,160
 Again, some people place this story not in 1910,

464
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,400
 but 1905.

465
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,960
 So, as I'm reading this, I'm thinking,

466
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,400
 it's still fairly vague.

467
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,280
 We have a girl who's not named.

468
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,600
 Could, there's a five-year difference

469
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,840
 between when the story may have taken place.

470
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,600
 And for the most part, it is considered a legend in the area.

471
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,680
 This young girl is just chilling at her house,

472
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,760
 and they're all eating lunch.

473
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,200
 And the mom says, "Honey, will you go,"

474
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,040
 we'll just call her Honey,

475
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,120
 "Honey, will you go to the pear farm?"

476
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,600
 The pear orchard, I guess is the right word.

477
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
 "Your dad wants pears for dessert."

478
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,240
 And she's like, "Yes, mama, I will go get pears.

479
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,520
 "That'll be a fun adventure.

480
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,600
 "I'll go get my friends."

481
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,880
 And the mom's like, "Yeah, your friends."

482
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
 'Cause she knows she doesn't have any friends.

483
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,000
 She's kind of a loser.

484
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,960
 So, Honey goes out into the village

485
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,920
 and tries to round up some friends.

486
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,720
 Says, "Hey, do you guys wanna go pick pears

487
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,560
 "for my dad?

488
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,400
 "He needs..."

489
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,160
 I imagine like you just don't need a pear for dessert.

490
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,000
 I figure if that, you would just have pears

491
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,840
 on the dinner table.

492
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,960
 They probably like covered them in honey

493
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,000
 or sugar or something like that.

494
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,040
 But anyways, so she's like,

495
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,440
 "Hey, do you guys wanna go into the orchard with me

496
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,400
 "to go get pears?"

497
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
 And her friends, she actually did have friends.

498
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
 Her mom just doesn't think very highly of her.

499
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,520
 Her friends go, "Oh, no way, dude.

500
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,480
 "Because we know where that pear orchard is."

501
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,120
 Now, this pear orchard was owned by the honey's family.

502
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,120
 And it was in a place called Baranco de Chamoco.

503
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,160
 And that area is littered with caves.

504
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,680
 And going far, far back, the people living there

505
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,240
 believe that the caves are inhabited by spirits.

506
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,760
 It's not a place you wanna go.

507
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,240
 It's definitely not a place you wanna go as a child.

508
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,000
 The whole place is just generally spooky.

509
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,960
 It's basically Elm Street but a ravine full of caves

510
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,200
 and people disappear.

511
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,380
 So she can't get any of her friends to go with her.

512
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,920
 She goes, "Well, I gotta go get the pears.

513
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,120
 "Like, I have to go."

514
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,360
 So she goes off into the ravine

515
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,020
 and she starts picking pears.

516
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,200
 And when she's in the ravine,

517
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,800
 she starts to feel just the heat of the sun on her.

518
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,160
 She's like, "Oh my God, it's so hot.

519
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,200
 "I wish my dad didn't eat pears.

520
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,560
 "I wish my dad was allergic to pears

521
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,320
 "and I can give him one and he just swells up and die.

522
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,520
 "I hate my dad so much.

523
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,000
 "I hate him so much."

524
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,840
 But as she's having these horrible thoughts,

525
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,960
 just the sun's beaten down on her.

526
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,360
 And she begins to notice a very cool mist in the area

527
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,800
 and she's thinking, "That's not normal."

528
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
 And she's watching this mist kind of roll through the ravine.

529
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,240
 And it's enveloping her skin

530
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,680
 and she just immediately feels a cool relief

531
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,440
 from the hot, hot sun.

532
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,520
 She's almost lost in the mist at this point.

533
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,680
 And that's when a tall figure,

534
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,120
 dressed in all white, appears out of the mist

535
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,440
 and leads her down what she described

536
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,760
 as an impossibly long corridor.

537
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,120
 And she goes, "At first I was scared, obviously,

538
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,040
 "because this is something completely out of the ordinary.

539
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,360
 "But I felt compelled to keep walking

540
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,280
 "and the creature or the person or whatever it was

541
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,680
 "kept making hand signals.

542
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,320
 "That's the only way it could communicate with honey

543
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
 "was by making hand signals to her

544
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,760
 "of where to go, how to follow her.

545
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,640
 "And that was the only way the creature

546
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,960
 "could communicate with honey."

547
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,080
 So they walk all the way down this passage

548
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,880
 and eventually she said it opened up

549
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,520
 into a beautiful orchard.

550
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,400
 Like they were on this little precipice

551
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,480
 and she looked down, she saw this orchard going

552
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,960
 as far as the eye could see.

553
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,040
 She said, "Every type of fruit,

554
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,280
 "every type of tree you can imagine was there."

555
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,520
 And the valley was littered with people

556
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,840
 just like the stranger who let her down the cave.

557
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,560
 She said, "It looked like a watercolor painting in motion."

558
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,320
 She's the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen.

559
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,280
 She immediately felt this just sense of peace

560
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,520
 and joy come over her.

561
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,880
 Now, when I'm reading this, I'm thinking at this point,

562
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,160
 what she inhaled was most likely some sort of noxious

563
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,440
 or toxic gas since she had a near-death experience.

564
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,800
 We have the tunnel of light,

565
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,760
 we have the beat overcome with a sense of joy and wonder.

566
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,800
 We have a guardian angel type figure.

567
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,720
 And I'm like, "Okay, she walked out there,

568
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,120
 "the earth farted, she started to pass out

569
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,160
 "because of some sort of carbon dioxide overdose."

570
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,080
 And then she woke up.

571
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,480
 But as I'm continuing to read this story,

572
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,280
 she's in the cave and eventually her guide,

573
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,680
 the tall being, began to motion her away

574
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,280
 and motioned her back down with his hand saying,

575
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,000
 "Hey, come here, come here, you can do it,

576
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,480
 "you're a good girl, good girl."

577
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,040
 Motioning her, that's the only way they could communicate

578
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
 back down the corridor.

579
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,600
 And then she finds herself back in the pair orchard.

580
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,000
 But the first thing she notices, the cool mist is gone

581
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 and it is 10, 15 degrees hotter than when she left.

582
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,040
 And she's thinking, "There is no way

583
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,960
 "it could be this hot all of a sudden."

584
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
 And now she's getting scared again

585
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,960
 because now she's back in our world

586
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
 and she's experiencing something

587
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,880
 that she shouldn't experience.

588
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,560
 So anyway, she gets to Paris

589
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,520
 'cause she still has to do her job

590
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,160
 and she's just figuring, "I'll tell them about the

591
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,880
 "monster people in the valley and all that stuff."

592
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,960
 It'll be a cool story while we're eating Paris.

593
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,560
 She makes her way out of the ravine

594
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,040
 and she notices a road that wasn't there

595
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,080
 when she went into the ravine.

596
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,640
 She's like, "Uh-oh, is this something?"

597
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,120
 Okay, okay.

598
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,960
 And as she's walking down the road,

599
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,760
 she begins to see cars driving on the road,

600
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,680
 which she described as futuristic looking cars.

601
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,800
 But she is finally able to make her way home

602
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 and there her mother, her now middle-aged mother greets her.

603
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,080
 It's the year 1940, 30 years past

604
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,360
 while she was in the ravine.

605
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
 And the mother calls out and says,

606
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,960
 "It's my girl, it's my girl."

607
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,080
 Her name was, her name became, or the story is,

608
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,160
 "La Nina de Las Paris."

609
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,760
 Paras or the Paragirl is how it's kind of known.

610
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,640
 So it's a local legend in that area

611
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,360
 about this girl who went looking for Paris

612
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,400
 in this ravine that everyone knows is haunted

613
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,200
 and then came back 30 years later.

614
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,720
 So interesting story,

615
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,760
 possible proof of a time slip,

616
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,340
 most likely a local legend of a spooky place.

617
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,140
 And again, a lot of these legends have a core moral value.

618
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,980
 This one would be kids don't go there alone.

619
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,820
 You go there alone, something bad may happen.

620
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,660
 Stay out of there.

621
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,140
 You know, that's how these urban legends are created.

622
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,160
 But as I'm reading that article, I go,

623
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,500
 "This sounds familiar.

624
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,980
 This sounds really familiar."

625
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,700
 You know, when I watched "Buffet of Empire Slayer"

626
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,880
 it's funny because my favorite character on that show

627
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,240
 was Giles.

628
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,040
 Love that, love that character.

629
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
 I always loved the idea of like researching books

630
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,840
 and like having like five books out on the table

631
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,740
 and going through it and trying to like solve this mystery.

632
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,080
 He was always my favorite character.

633
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,160
 I always felt more like,

634
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,940
 I always felt he was the most relatable one

635
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,600
 'cause that's kind of the way that I approached stuff.

636
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,720
 Not like I ever fought demons, well actually I did.

637
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,020
 But the point is is that I always liked that ideal

638
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,420
 and even that visual,

639
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,020
 aesthetic, whatever, that thing that you look at

640
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,540
 and you go, "I like that."

641
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,220
 So I'm reading this article in the coffee shop.

642
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,800
 It was getting ready to just be another weird disappearing

643
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,700
 thing I was gonna do about the guy in the car

644
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,740
 and then go, "Oh, here's a local legend I found too."

645
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,140
 But as I'm reading it, I said, "I've heard this story."

646
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,980
 And not only have I heard it,

647
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,020
 I heard it almost 2000 miles away.

648
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,700
 We're going to Moscow.

649
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,860
 So outside of Moscow, there is a place known as

650
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,540
 Golosov Ravine.

651
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,660
 In the year 1621, a detachment of Tatar horsemen,

652
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,100
 we've covered them before in the Great Mud Flood thing,

653
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,820
 the empire that's pretty much been erased

654
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,100
 from the history books.

655
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,540
 In 1621, a detachment of Tatar horsemen show up

656
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,140
 at the Tsarist Palace and are immediately taken prisoner

657
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,740
 'cause they shouldn't be there at all.

658
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,140
 And when they're being questioned, they go,

659
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,180
 "What are you doing here?

660
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,100
 "Why are you, why did a bunch of like Caldremen

661
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,820
 "show up here in the middle of the day?"

662
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,500
 And they go, "We have some questions."

663
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,900
 Yes, to be fair, we did try invading you guys,

664
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,060
 but something's wrong, something's off.

665
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,460
 And as they're basically being questioned

666
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,700
 by the Russian forces,

667
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,940
 'cause the Tatar empire and the Russians

668
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,780
 did not like each other.

669
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,620
 I guess if you didn't listen to that episode,

670
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,260
 they hated each other actually.

671
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,820
 But anyways, as the Russians were trying to figure out

672
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,500
 why these guys showed up in the middle of nowhere,

673
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,020
 they start to notice something.

674
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,020
 One, they appeared out of the middle of nowhere,

675
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,620
 but two, their armor was old

676
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,500
 and not like old and rusted and busted and stuff like that.

677
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,020
 It was an old style armor.

678
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,740
 It was an armor that the Tatar empire had not used

679
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,900
 since 1570, 50 years earlier.

680
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,460
 And what the Tatar soldiers were saying was,

681
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,660
 "Listen, when we were there at the Battle of Moscow,

682
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,820
 "you guys started with an R-Butt.

683
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,260
 "You guys are far more better prepared

684
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,380
 "than we gave you credit for."

685
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,220
 So we, us group of guys took off and we hid,

686
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,820
 and the investigators going,

687
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,940
 "Let me guess, let me guess,

688
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,820
 "you hid in Golosov, Ravine."

689
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,420
 Tatar soldiers like, "Yeah, how'd you know?"

690
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,780
 And the Russians go, "You know, that place is haunted.

691
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,940
 "We don't, it's not a place that we go.

692
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,260
 "It's just this weird placement,

693
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,740
 "a lot of disappearances and stuff like that there."

694
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,420
 And this may be the cause of a why.

695
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,900
 And the Tatar soldiers said, "Yes, we went,

696
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,900
 "we hid in the Ravine and a mist rolled through the Ravine."

697
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,180
 Next thing we knew, we came out of the Ravine.

698
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,020
 We noticed things weren't right.

699
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,100
 None of our other soldiers were here.

700
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,820
 Couldn't get a hold of anybody.

701
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,660
 Lost and with nothing else to do,

702
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,500
 we came back to Moscow thinking,

703
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,140
 "Hey, maybe we won the battle."

704
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,020
 Or maybe we could just get some answers.

705
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,140
 But that's not it.

706
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,180
 That's not what I was reminded of

707
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,260
 when I read the story of the Paragirl.

708
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,660
 Golosov Ravine, 1832.

709
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,740
 Two local peasants get drunk.

710
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,980
 They're having a good time, just hanging out.

711
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,820
 Just chilling, throwing their arms around each other,

712
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,140
 tickling each other.

713
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,220
 And these two peasants say, "You know what?

714
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,420
 "Let's take a shortcut home through Golosov Ravine."

715
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,980
 I'm like, "Okay, why'd you pronounce it differently

716
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,460
 "that time than you did every other time?"

717
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,100
 He's like, "I don't know, I'm drunk."

718
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,060
 So these two peasants go into the Ravine,

719
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,060
 a mist rolls through.

720
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,340
 They come out of the Ravine, 20 years had passed.

721
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,300
 When they get home, their wives don't recognize them.

722
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,020
 But they had a bit of a different twist on their story.

723
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,580
 They said, when the two peasants said,

724
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,620
 "When we went into the Ravine,

725
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,180
 "the mist rolled through

726
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,180
 "and a giant corridor appeared out of nowhere."

727
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,540
 Out of that corridor, a tall, hairy person walked

728
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,180
 and communicated with us only using their hands.

729
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,580
 And led us back out of the corridor.

730
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,380
 The Tatar story and the two peasants' story,

731
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,500
 supposedly, were both investigated by the government.

732
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,980
 The Tatar story was apparently like that,

733
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,060
 was an official report was filed with the Russian government

734
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,660
 over why these soldiers showed up out of nowhere.

735
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,140
 And again, reportedly, the peasants' story

736
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,380
 was an official police transcript.

737
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,140
 And when the police went out to the Ravine

738
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,460
 to investigate whether or not their story was true,

739
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,940
 one of the officers disappeared.

740
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,940
 Those particular details, I can't verify.

741
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,020
 I found articles talking about it,

742
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,220
 but I couldn't find actually a police report from 1832.

743
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,620
 Those may or may not exist.

744
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,700
 What I find fascinating is these two stories,

745
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,700
 one in Golosov Ravine and one in the Canary Islands.

746
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,300
 Separated by decades and thousands of miles,

747
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,020
 have similarities.

748
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,800
 Now, normally, if the story is completely made up,

749
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,960
 they will say this is similar to what happened

750
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,740
 at Golosov Ravine.

751
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,300
 Or Golosov Ravine's story,

752
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,900
 if they took the idea from the Paragirl,

753
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,180
 they'll say, you know, there's precedence for this,

754
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,740
 something else like this happened in the Canary Islands.

755
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,940
 As far as I can tell, these two stories

756
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,860
 have never, ever been connected.

757
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,900
 And all of my research, I have never found

758
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,300
 one referencing the other.

759
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,380
 The resources on Golosov Ravine are almost all in Russian.

760
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,460
 There's like a short Wikipedia article

761
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,220
 and a couple articles in English,

762
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,420
 and all of the sourced material is in Russian.

763
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,900
 I added translation stuff.

764
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,240
 The Canary story, again,

765
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,020
 like I had to go to websites and translate from Spanish.

766
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,620
 These two stories, as far as I can tell,

767
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,580
 have never been connected.

768
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,340
 And they both, even if certain details are wrong,

769
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,380
 like the 1905s to the 1910,

770
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,660
 the details of a ravine,

771
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,120
 full of mist, a long tunnel,

772
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,960
 a tall person, one of them they're hairy

773
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,860
 and one of them they're just tall.

774
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,140
 They don't say how much hair they have.

775
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,260
 They could be like a smooth otter body.

776
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,060
 Could be a full on bear, we don't know.

777
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,340
 But you have the ravine,

778
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,020
 you have the mist,

779
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,340
 you have the tunnel,

780
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
 you have something tall,

781
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,580
 only communicating with their hands

782
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,980
 and most importantly of all, time jumps.

783
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,860
 Totally blew my mind when I was reading it and I go.

784
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,460
 And I thought this sounds familiar.

785
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,460
 And I remember when I was pulling back up my Golisov ravine,

786
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,940
 which I was gonna do as a separate story,

787
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,540
 just a small story.

788
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,620
 As I was pulling that up, I said,

789
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,900
 "I know it has to do with mist and ravine,

790
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,620
 "but I'm pretty sure they also said something

791
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,340
 "about only using their hands to communicate."

792
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,460
 And I pulled it up and that was the case.

793
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,860
 This makes me think that this is very, very real.

794
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,860
 This makes me think that this not only has happened,

795
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,580
 but more interesting enough can happen again.

796
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,220
 But what's weird is you wouldn't have proof of it

797
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,980
 for decades.

798
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,700
 Is there a limit to how long you're in that tunnel

799
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,380
 to how long it takes for you to get out?

800
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,060
 Even if some sort of parapsychologist

801
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,340
 wanted to replicate this,

802
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,060
 he's gonna be like, "Okay, seeing in 60 years,

803
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,620
 "like, is there any way to test something like that?"

804
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,500
 I honestly think, I could be wrong on this,

805
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,660
 but I honestly think that this is the first time

806
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,460
 those two events have been connected.

807
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,420
 And if that's the case,

808
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,500
 this stuff has not been researched at all.

809
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,060
 Because generally, the one in the Canary Islands

810
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,660
 is considered a local legend.

811
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,780
 It would basically be like if a scientist wanted

812
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,980
 to investigate whether or not there were real witches

813
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,860
 in Salem.

814
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,020
 Like you'd be like, "Of course there are not.

815
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,940
 "Like we have all of the,

816
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,020
 "it was just a legend people made up to like,

817
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,780
 "persecute single women and stuff like that.

818
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,180
 "I think these ravines are real.

819
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,580
 "I think the mist can send you forward in time."

820
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,260
 I think this story gets added to the list of conspiracies

821
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,060
 or things I believe in.

822
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,180
 Because either someone made up these stories

823
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,780
 decades ago and never connected them

824
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,660
 and just thought it'd be funny if someday someone

825
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,460
 stumbled across both of them.

826
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,820
 Or in two parts of the world,

827
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,220
 in two similar circumstances,

828
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,100
 people traveled into the future in the same way.

829
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,100
 If this is true, it's groundbreaking.

830
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,660
 If you can warp time like that on Earth,

831
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,740
 if we have a natural time machine

832
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,820
 that shoots people forward in time,

833
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,620
 do you understand?

834
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,060
 I mean, really that would change so much.

835
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,940
 But are they real?

836
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,340
 We'd have to test them.

837
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:43,420
 And then wait and wait and wait for the answer.

838
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:50,020
 Or we just step into the mists ourselves.
