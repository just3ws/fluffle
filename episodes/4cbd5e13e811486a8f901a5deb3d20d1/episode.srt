00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,520
 Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

15
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,720
 - When you're riding in a car with your family down the road

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,960
 and you're the only one to see a massive UFO,

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,760
 no one believes you, but will they believe you

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,360
 when a gray breaks in to your house?

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,280
 And then we take a look at a winding convoluted theory.

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,600
 We may not even have time to get to the gray break-in,

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,800
 honestly.

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,640
 The Dogon tribe in Africa has long been connected

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,640
 to extraterrestrial contact.

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,160
 A lot of debate about it,

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,240
 and we're gonna go through the nitty gritty.

26
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,360
 But not only that, this conspiracy also says

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,040
 that when the aliens visited the Dogon tribe,

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,920
 they brought with them marijuana.

29
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,840
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,420
 (upbeat music)

31
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:20,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

32
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,160
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

33
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,120
 I'm having a great day.

35
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,720
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,560
 We're gonna start off with the Dogon story

37
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,160
 because I don't know if we'll have time for the story

38
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
 about the gray break-in into the house.

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,680
 If we don't, we'll save it to tomorrow

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,200
 because this first story is quite complicated

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,240
 and I haven't been able to figure out how long it's going

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,400
 to take for me to talk about it.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,440
 I find it very, very interesting.

44
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,040
 And just when you think,

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,080
 oh, Jason's going in this direction,

46
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,360
 the story starts to turn.

47
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,480
 I've been researching this for the past two days maybe.

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,080
 And it was quite the feat.

49
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,920
 It was quite the feat.

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,360
 I normally get all of my information quite easily,

51
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,280
 but this one I had to go all over the place.

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,320
 And now I present to you,

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,640
 not only the story of the Dogon mystery,

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,200
 but did the aliens introduce marijuana to the planet earth?

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,080
 Let's go ahead and start.

56
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,640
 Now this came about

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,080
 because I got a YouTube comment from James on YouTube.

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,960
 So I'm gonna read you part of his comment

59
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,800
 'cause I think he did a good job kind of breaking it down.

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,080
 And then we're gonna go through it and see what's true,

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,640
 what's not, we're gonna analyze it,

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,720
 come up with our own theory.

63
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,900
 It's a weird one.

64
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,120
 This is a weird one, guys.

65
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,480
 So James, and thanks James for the recommendation.

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,400
 So here is his statement,

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,600
 here's his comment regarding the Dogons.

68
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,080
 "Elegetedly when Westerners made contact with them,

69
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,200
 they had extensive knowledge of the Sirius star system

70
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,440
 that scientists at the time didn't even know.

71
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,120
 Like they knew it was a binary system, et cetera.

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
 Anyway, they asked these people how they knew this

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,240
 and the Dogons told them that fish like humanoids

74
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,800
 with gills had come from the Sirius system

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
 and gave them a bunch of knowledge

76
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,180
 about Sirius A and Sirius B,

77
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,920
 which are the two stars, and such and get this.

78
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,880
 They claimed that these people brought marijuana to earth

79
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,680
 and now the Dogons have a big festival every year

80
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,960
 where they get highest balls

81
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,280
 to celebrate the coming of the fish people.

82
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
 If that wasn't weird enough,

83
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,640
 cannabis translated from Greek is two dogs

84
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,800
 and Sirius A and B are known as the dog star.

85
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,440
 Might be a good story to cover.

86
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,200
 I read about it in some weed book back in high school.

87
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,120
 Now, when I saw that comment,

88
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,160
 I'm really familiar with the Dogon tribe.

89
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,180
 I've been researching this stuff since I was about 10.

90
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,140
 So I've been looking into paranormal and conspiracy stuff

91
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,460
 and aliens and goes for about 30 years now.

92
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,060
 And the Dogon tribe is something I was quite familiar with.

93
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,500
 It's something that you stumble across generally really early

94
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,020
 on when you're researching stuff.

95
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,580
 It's in the top tier of the iceberg as well.

96
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,500
 So I read it and I know the story,

97
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,860
 the answer to the Dogon mystery.

98
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,660
 I know the answer to the Dogon mystery for the most part.

99
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,140
 I know the official explanation for how they know that stuff.

100
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,040
 But James, that was a great overview for it,

101
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,960
 but let's go ahead and start going through it here

102
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,520
 and finding out which stuff we know as fact,

103
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,920
 which stuff we know as fiction.

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,280
 And the more important part is that where weed is from.

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,760
 Touched on a couple of interesting things

106
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 throughout that thing.

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
 Let's talk about the story of the Dogons first.

108
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,880
 In 1931, in West Africa, in Mali.

109
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,680
 So West Africa, the region of Africa,

110
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,860
 and then in the country of Mali, in 1931,

111
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,480
 these two French anthropologists named Marcel Garelli,

112
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,800
 I don't know, and Germain Dieterlin,

113
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,600
 these two French dudes start walking through Africa, right?

114
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
 And they're kind of bummed out.

115
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
 There's no bad guys, but they're on a mission

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,360
 to find the Dogon tribe.

117
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,000
 They wanna go talk to these dudes.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,400
 Now this area, before it became rife with warfare

119
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,280
 and all sorts of horrible things,

120
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,920
 Mali was known as a center of knowledge and art.

121
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,940
 So it was kind of like a cultural center for West Africa.

122
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,340
 But nowadays, and especially when the two French dudes

123
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,220
 showed up, it wasn't doing too good.

124
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,820
 And in this area, you had the Dogon tribe.

125
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,060
 Now, the anthropologists just go there

126
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,100
 to kind of say how are you guys living?

127
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,940
 Hey guys, what's up?

128
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,780
 How you doing?

129
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,580
 Tell us a little bit about your life.

130
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,860
 The tribe's like, well, just hang out with us for a bit.

131
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,420
 We will reveal the information as time goes on.

132
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,500
 So they did hang out, the two French dudes are hanging out

133
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,100
 with the Dogons for a while,

134
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,740
 and this is what they piece together.

135
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,060
 Well, they didn't just piece together.

136
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,980
 The people were willing to give this information.

137
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,740
 The Dogons were saying, our religion, we believe in Nomo.

138
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,360
 French dudes are like, oh, is that God?

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,820
 And they're like, yeah, it's a little more complicated

140
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,440
 than that, 'cause we have a creation God.

141
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,260
 We have a God who creates stuff.

142
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,840
 And one of the things that God created was Nomo.

143
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,080
 Well, there's eight of them.

144
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,060
 And then they're like, so there's eight Nomos.

145
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,620
 They're like, no, no, no, no, Nomo.

146
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,540
 No, don't get ahead of yourself, French guys.

147
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,960
 Nomo is both the singular and the plural.

148
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,300
 French dudes are like, oh, damn it.

149
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,860
 This is gonna be a brain teaser.

150
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,780
 I'm trying to figure out how to write it down.

151
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,620
 How to write the story down.

152
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,540
 They say, this is what happened.

153
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,240
 Nomo was created, and it's a hermaphroditic creature.

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,860
 It's like both sexes mixed together.

155
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,700
 It's also amphibious, and it's, well, amphibious

156
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,780
 in the sense that it can swim the water and be on land.

157
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,460
 You guys know what amphibian is,

158
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,000
 but they're generally described as having

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,140
 the upper body of a human and a fishtail body.

160
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,840
 So a mermaid, basically.

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,460
 And Nomo is then turned into four pairs of twins,

162
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,880
 known as Nomo.

163
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,180
 Not the Nomo, not Nomo, it's just Nomo.

164
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,920
 Just Nomo all around.

165
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,260
 So Nomo is now not just the one dude.

166
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,380
 It's four sets of twins.

167
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,820
 And one set of the Nomo went evil

168
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,940
 and declared war on Nomo.

169
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,440
 So it's Nomo on Nomo action across the universe.

170
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,220
 And Nomo, the evil Nomos, get ripped to pieces

171
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,720
 and their body parts are spread throughout existence.

172
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,120
 In the religion of the Dogon people,

173
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,000
 they believe that wherever a limb of Nomo landed,

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,440
 you have to build a shrine.

175
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,240
 You build these shrines called Bainu shrines.

176
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,760
 So you have these Bainu shrines,

177
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,000
 and that is where a body part landed,

178
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,200
 and that is where you can go to contact Nomo.

179
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,540
 You pray at these shrines,

180
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,240
 and what's interesting about these shrines,

181
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,800
 you go to these shrines and you pray.

182
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,840
 Now each family in the Dogon tribe

183
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,420
 has a spirit animal that was chosen for them

184
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,860
 by going to these shrines hundreds or thousands of years ago.

185
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,440
 You go to the shrine, a spirit animal is chosen for you.

186
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,580
 And then when you go to this shrine

187
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,740
 and you pray, your family spirit animal will appear

188
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,060
 to give you advice or to help you through life struggles

189
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,580
 or just to kind of pet,

190
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,020
 just 'cause you're not feeling, having a bad day,

191
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,780
 you wanna go pet a ghost panther, you can do that.

192
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,220
 So you go to the Bainu shrines

193
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,260
 to seek the advice of your spirit animal.

194
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,300
 The Nomo had other names.

195
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,820
 The Nomo, well, they were just the Nomo or just Nomo,

196
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,140
 but they were also known as Masters of the Water,

197
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,880
 which makes sense 'cause they're half fish.

198
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,100
 The monitors or the teachers.

199
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,880
 That story is completely verifiable.

200
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,720
 That story there is if you went to the Dogon tribe today,

201
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,900
 they would tell you that story.

202
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,600
 That is the story that you get

203
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,280
 from any reading on the Dogon people.

204
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,160
 The Dogon people are a real tribe.

205
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,000
 They're really visited.

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,360
 You can go visit them today.

207
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,600
 So the idea of them being called monitors or teachers

208
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,840
 does make, 'cause we're looking at it with an alien viewpoint,

209
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,840
 does give it a little air of an alien.

210
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,100
 Masters of the Water find,

211
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,680
 there's gods all over the world

212
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,440
 that are half human, half fish.

213
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,480
 Iconography and religions that are that as well.

214
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,520
 So that doesn't stick out.

215
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,480
 But the fact that God himself

216
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,580
 isn't technically known as a teacher,

217
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,000
 or I guess maybe a monitor,

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,480
 but he's more known as just this all powerful dude

219
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,440
 who just rampages and/or is absent from the universe.

220
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,560
 He either is responsible for the bad stuff

221
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,040
 or he just lets the dice go far where they may.

222
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,880
 And then some people believe

223
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,440
 that he intercedes and helps people as well,

224
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,560
 but his angels are sometimes known as monitors or teachers

225
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
 or demons are known as that,

226
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,200
 but God is very rarely known as a teacher.

227
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,880
 I could be wrong on that, but.

228
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,680
 So when they're God, and they're creation God,

229
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,860
 they're just kind of again kind of left.

230
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,500
 The no mo is what they actually contacted.

231
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,140
 So their God is also quite absent.

232
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,260
 So we have that.

233
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,740
 Now that's all there of high above.

234
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,980
 Where we start to get with dicey stuff

235
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,060
 is in the late 1940s.

236
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,340
 Those two French dudes were hanging out there the whole time.

237
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,620
 I'm sure they went back to France every once in a while

238
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,260
 to like bang someone at the Moulin Rouge,

239
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,740
 but they definitely kept coming back here.

240
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,540
 Maybe they were here for 14 years, I don't know,

241
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,780
 or 15 years or whatever it was.

242
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,320
 But anyways, it's the late 1940s.

243
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,240
 And this is where we start to get iffy.

244
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
 And so the doggons are like,

245
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,480
 "Shh, come here, hey, come here.

246
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,440
 Hey, so you wanna hear the real story of French guys?

247
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
 You guys have been here long enough.

248
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,600
 You've earned our trust.

249
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,120
 We're gonna tell you the straight dope.

250
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,880
 We're gonna tell you the real stuff."

251
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,880
 See, the story of the no mo is more literal than you think.

252
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,840
 No mo came down and visited us different outer space.

253
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,480
 The two French guys are like, "What?"

254
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,540
 Now this is in the late 1940s.

255
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,260
 So again, we're starting to hear about Roswell

256
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,400
 and things like that.

257
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,340
 Doggons are like, "Yes, yes, just like your Roswell events,

258
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,080
 just like your ancient aliens show

259
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,940
 that will premiere 50 years from now."

260
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,140
 No mo actually visited us.

261
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,620
 And this is what they looked like.

262
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,740
 They had gills, they had fish legs.

263
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,380
 So just like our God imagery of them,

264
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,420
 they could also tear parts of their body off.

265
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,820
 It wouldn't kill them and it nourished us.

266
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,680
 It gave us life.

267
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,880
 So the aliens came down and they were ripping parts

268
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,080
 of their body off and we were eating them.

269
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,460
 Then the word no mo in the doggon language actually means

270
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,800
 like forces to drink or makes one drink is what it means.

271
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,960
 And they're saying they were ripping parts of their body off

272
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,960
 and maybe we were forced to eat them.

273
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,840
 Maybe we were like, "No, this disgusting dude, stop it,

274
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,680
 stop it."

275
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
 But we felt compelled to eat them.

276
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,160
 That's why their name no mo.

277
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,920
 Or maybe they're just named no mo for other reasons.

278
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,720
 But they come down in their spaceship.

279
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,840
 And the first thing they did was they all jumped

280
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,960
 into a reservoir because they enjoy being in the water more.

281
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,000
 They can be on land because they're amphibious,

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
 but they enjoy being in the water more.

283
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,300
 They say, "Let's teach you some stuff."

284
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,120
 The no mo goes, "We are going to teach you

285
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
 doggon people some stuff."

286
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,400
 We are from a star called Sirius Star System.

287
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,440
 And it is a binary star system.

288
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,860
 There's a big star and then a little star orbiting around it.

289
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,920
 And the little star takes about 50 to 60 years roughly

290
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,800
 for it to orbit the big star.

291
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,880
 We'll tell you a little bit about that.

292
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,240
 We'll also tell you that Saturn has rings

293
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,520
 and Jupiter has four major moons to it.

294
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,880
 And the doggons are like, "What's Jupiter?

295
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,920
 What's Saturn?

296
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,760
 What's a ring?

297
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,600
 We don't know any of this."

298
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,880
 And the no mo goes, "Silence.

299
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,760
 You'll learn all of this stuff later.

300
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,800
 It'll shock French people thousands of years from now."

301
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,640
 Because this story supposedly took place

302
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,400
 thousands, thousands of years ago.

303
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,000
 So they teach them all this stuff.

304
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,680
 Now, in the doggon language, they do talk about

305
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,000
 the Sirius Star System.

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,840
 That's the dog star, which is,

307
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,320
 it's been known as the dog star all over the world.

308
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,760
 'Cause it looks like a dog in the shape of a dog.

309
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,280
 Not the star itself, but part of a constellation of a dog.

310
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,200
 Ancient Mesopotamians called it the dog star.

311
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,720
 So they were like, "Oh, that's cool, dude.

312
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,760
 Now, so you got a big star and you got a little star."

313
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,520
 And no mo starts rolling something.

314
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 He's like, "Yeah, man.

315
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,000
 We got all sorts of stars up there.

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,840
 He's rolling something.

317
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,680
 He's licking it."

318
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,920
 Doggons are like, "What's that?"

319
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,720
 And no mo's like, "Don't get ahead of yourself, bro.

320
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,600
 Don't get ahead of yourself."

321
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,600
 So in the doggon language, the name of the small star

322
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,760
 that orbits, they're Sirius A and Sirius B,

323
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,480
 like James would say.

324
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,480
 They call Sirius B Po-Tolo.

325
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,960
 Po-Tolo, tollo means star,

326
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,760
 and Po is the smallest seed known to them.

327
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,440
 So in their language, they have a name for a tiny, tiny star.

328
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
 No mo's rolling a joint.

329
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,640
 He's like, "It's pretty trippy, huh?"

330
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,800
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, man.

331
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,640
 What is that?

332
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,480
 Take a hit."

333
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,680
 And no mo's like, "Hold on, hold on."

334
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,180
 (blows air)

335
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,020
 (exhales)

336
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,720
 Yeah, dude, we're from like, the stars.

337
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,200
 We're from the tallows.

338
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,240
 Doggons like, "Dude, you gotta hit us up with that.

339
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,600
 What is that beautiful smelling stuff?"

340
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
 No mo looks at it, passes it around and goes,

341
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,840
 "That, my friends, is 100% pure alien kush.

342
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,280
 That is marijuana.

343
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
 Cannabis, the freaky leaf.

344
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,520
 Just keep hitting it.

345
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,560
 We'll keep talking.

346
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,800
 Let's have a good time."

347
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,520
 Now, the two dudes.

348
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,480
 Now, okay, now first off, I have to separate.

349
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,200
 The marijuana story is an addition

350
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,520
 that's gonna be added on later.

351
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,720
 But other than the point of no mo rolling the joint,

352
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,580
 everything else is what they told the French guys.

353
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,240
 They said, "Listen, the aliens came down

354
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,640
 and they're half fish and they jumped in the reservoir.

355
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
 They told us all this stuff.

356
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,360
 They told us that Sirius is a binary star system

357
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,880
 and that's where they're from."

358
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,120
 There's a third star also orbiting the main Sirius star.

359
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,600
 We call the little star Po Tolo

360
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,960
 because Po is the tiny.

361
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,400
 And the French guys, like, "Yeah, yeah, I get it.

362
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,520
 You don't have to go over everything."

363
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,360
 They're like, "Okay."

364
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,760
 They also told us Saturn has rings and that...

365
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,120
 He paused for a second.

366
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,200
 He's like, "Are you stoned right now?"

367
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,160
 He's like, "No, no, sorry.

368
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
 I forgot I was going."

369
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,600
 Saturn has rings and Jupiter has four moons.

370
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,480
 Now, remember, this is taking place in the 1940s

371
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,760
 is when they're telling the French anthropologists this.

372
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,720
 And the French dudes are like,

373
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
 "There is no way they could have known this information."

374
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,800
 Because in fact, in 1610,

375
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,600
 it was found out that Jupiter has four major moons.

376
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,360
 There's actually 79 moons.

377
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,480
 And again, this is where the alien story starts

378
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,400
 to fracture a bit.

379
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,240
 The alien should have been,

380
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,760
 "Dude, you want to blow some white dude's mind

381
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
 a thousand years from now?

382
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
 Tell them there's 79 moons.

383
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,880
 Jupiter, we counted them.

384
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,440
 We counted them all."

385
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,800
 But anyways, they said there was four...

386
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,800
 They knew there was four major moons around Jupiter.

387
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,440
 They knew that Saturn had rings.

388
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,960
 Both of those things were not discovered until the year 1610,

389
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,400
 which is obviously way before 1940.

390
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,520
 But these two French dudes are like,

391
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,560
 "How did this tribe in the middle of Africa

392
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,560
 or in the western side of Africa know any of this?"

393
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,000
 And we knew about Sirius.

394
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,080
 We knew about the dog star,

395
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,920
 but the thought that they had an other star rotating it

396
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,200
 wasn't theorized until 1844.

397
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,240
 And it wasn't verified by telescope until 1862.

398
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,080
 So the French dudes are going,

399
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,240
 "They must have gotten this information from somewhere."

400
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,360
 And they ended up writing a paper about it,

401
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
 and they basically said

402
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,160
 they must have gotten this information from somewhere.

403
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,960
 In 1976, a book came out called "The Sirius Mystery."

404
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,800
 And that book says they did get that information

405
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,960
 from somewhere, and it was aliens.

406
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,480
 This is where the story really started to become popular.

407
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,200
 This book was published in 1976,

408
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,840
 and 1977, a television episode of the show

409
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,280
 in search of hosted by Leonard Nimoy,

410
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,400
 talked about the Dogon tribe.

411
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,800
 How could they have known about the binary star?

412
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,400
 How could they know about the rings of Saturn?

413
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,200
 How could they know about Jupiter's moons?

414
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,160
 And they said they described the small star

415
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,600
 as super, super dense.

416
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,560
 It was made of this magical metal,

417
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,400
 which isn't true.

418
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,560
 Again, the aliens are giving them inaccurate information.

419
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,520
 Maybe they're just doing it to,

420
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,840
 they're like, "Dude, stars are made of metal, man.

421
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,160
 "That's so funny, dude.

422
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,320
 "These French dudes are gonna blow their minds."

423
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,080
 They're giving them inaccurate information,

424
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,040
 but they did describe the smaller star as more dense

425
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,520
 than the bigger star.

426
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,960
 So, and that's a fact.

427
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,480
 Serious B, it's a white dwarf,

428
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,960
 so it is more dense than Serious A.

429
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,880
 So the idea was that aliens must have come down

430
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,640
 to give them this information.

431
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,200
 That Nomo is an actual alien race

432
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,420
 that came down and delivered

433
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,520
 this astrological information to the Dogon tribe.

434
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,920
 The book came out, it was a hit.

435
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,240
 The television episode came out,

436
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,200
 it was a hit, people started talking about this.

437
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,680
 And so scientists go,

438
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,640
 there has to be a rational explanation behind this.

439
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,600
 To the point where Carl Sagan came out and said,

440
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 "This is most likely what happened."

441
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,040
 This was the general scientific consensus.

442
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,080
 Nobody's saying that these French guys

443
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,440
 completely made it up.

444
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,240
 That's not a theory.

445
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,200
 The theory is this, at some point,

446
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,880
 someone must have traveled from Europe to that tribe

447
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
 and told them this information.

448
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,680
 That is far more logical than aliens coming down

449
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,600
 and telling them this information.

450
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,640
 'Cause the information for the most part

451
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,400
 matched what the Western world knew

452
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,800
 at latest, the year 1862.

453
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
 So they're saying at some point,

454
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,400
 and other anthropologists must have come to this tribe

455
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,640
 and told them this stuff.

456
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,040
 Because this tribe, according to the French dudes,

457
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,600
 worshiped the Serious Star.

458
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,180
 They were so into it that if a traveler

459
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,080
 from another country came there

460
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,440
 and everyone's looking up at the star

461
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,920
 and they're like, "Oh yeah, the star's so awesome."

462
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
 Someone could have said, "You know what?

463
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,520
 That's funny, I know a bunch about that star."

464
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,520
 And then that dude left, and then 50, 70, 100 years later,

465
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,160
 two French dudes show up and the doggons are like,

466
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,080
 "Yes, we know about binary star systems

467
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,520
 and stuff like that."

468
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,880
 Now, they also said there was a third star.

469
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,840
 And for the longest time, people who believe in this story

470
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,800
 have been trying to find proof that there is a third star.

471
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,120
 'Cause as of now, there is no proof

472
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,000
 that there is a third star also orbiting Serious A.

473
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,520
 If it turned out that we discovered

474
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,040
 a third star orbiting Serious,

475
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,640
 that would be far more proof

476
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,480
 that the doggons had information that we don't have.

477
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
 100 times more proof.

478
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,600
 But we can't find any gravitational wobbles

479
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,520
 or anything like that.

480
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,800
 So the question is this.

481
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,680
 There's a lot of questions,

482
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,960
 but we're gonna keep moving on here.

483
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,760
 The question is this, what are the explanations?

484
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
 How could they get this information?

485
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,080
 One of them, fish aliens came down

486
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,400
 and told them this information.

487
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,760
 That is obviously a possibility.

488
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,320
 It's a very unlikely possibility,

489
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
 but it's one of them.

490
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,640
 Two, that some sort of Western element came in

491
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
 and did some cultural contamination

492
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,080
 and told them information about this star.

493
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,280
 Or three, this was a weird one.

494
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,320
 Because when we're talking about Africa,

495
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,680
 you get a lot of people who are...

496
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,080
 I'm trying to think of a word other than black supremacists,

497
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,360
 but that's really the only word that can come to mind.

498
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,000
 You have a group of people who believe

499
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,680
 that the black race is better than all of the races.

500
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,160
 And this is a theory that's been put out there

501
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,400
 that the Dogon tribes, because of the melanin

502
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,280
 in their system and in their eyes,

503
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,280
 they can actually see a white dwarf orbiting Syria.

504
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,400
 They basically can see like a telescope out in the space.

505
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,920
 So that's far less likely than fish aliens coming down,

506
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,400
 but you'll find websites, if you look into this, like I did.

507
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,120
 There are some people who believe that the Dogons,

508
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,760
 and I don't know maybe everyone in Africa has a superpower,

509
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,080
 but the Dogon tribe, that they weren't told this by white people,

510
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,160
 that they weren't told this by fish aliens,

511
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
 they can actually look up into the night sky

512
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,600
 and see a white dwarf orbit.

513
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,560
 Another star that wasn't visible by telescope until late 1800s.

514
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,920
 They also believe that they can look at Jupiter

515
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,240
 and see four moons and they can see Saturn's rings

516
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,080
 with the naked eye.

517
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,360
 So take from that what you will.

518
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,880
 That is just a hilarious footnote,

519
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,280
 because if that was the true,

520
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,080
 every world's armed forces would just be made up of Dogons.

521
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,420
 Anyways, but that's not, so that is completely unfeasible.

522
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,440
 I think out of the three Western contaminations,

523
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,680
 most likely, then fish aliens,

524
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,560
 I didn't think that would come in second,

525
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,440
 and then the Dogon tribe has the ability

526
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,420
 to perceive across the galaxy.

527
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,600
 They can see a tiny white dwarf.

528
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,340
 So that has been debunked over and over again.

529
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,360
 It's one of those things that when you first hear about it,

530
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,800
 they talk about it on ancient aliens.

531
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,640
 It's a really popular theory, it's super intriguing.

532
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,680
 I remember reading about it when I was like 12

533
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,880
 and thought, oh, this is so awesome.

534
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,200
 And then I revisited it a few years later.

535
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,080
 And then I looked at it skeptically

536
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,840
 and they're like, this is most likely what happened.

537
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,840
 And another little footnote to all of that,

538
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,040
 when another investigator went back,

539
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,720
 he goes, they didn't care anything

540
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,960
 about the Sirius star system.

541
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,320
 This other anthropologist went back

542
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,580
 in between the Sirius mystery book coming out

543
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,340
 and the original paper coming out from the French dude.

544
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,540
 He goes, nobody cared.

545
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,460
 I went down there and everyone was just kind of like,

546
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,260
 what, what, it's just a star, it's no big deal.

547
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,140
 And apparently when the two French dudes

548
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,700
 were told the story, the only two people

549
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,620
 who told them this story was the guy

550
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,340
 they were working closest with and the translator.

551
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,180
 Those are the, everyone else in the village

552
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,980
 didn't really mention the story

553
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,140
 or have anything to do with it or anything like that.

554
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,340
 So this guy, this Dogon dude could have been

555
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,800
 a budding science fiction writer.

556
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,280
 He could have made it all up.

557
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,420
 Could be true.

558
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,060
 We don't know, but in the society itself,

559
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,160
 it's not as white.

560
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,260
 It may be now because now it would become

561
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,140
 a tourist attraction, but when it was revisited back

562
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,260
 before the mystery really took off,

563
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,740
 the other anthropologist couldn't find any proof

564
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,380
 that this was a cultural belief

565
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,480
 that other people believe in this thing.

566
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,920
 But let's go ahead here and let's move on

567
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,660
 to the next subject because this is where we start

568
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,580
 to get back into unsproven conspiracy theory stuff.

569
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,340
 Cannabis, this is where, so the theory has become

570
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,180
 that Nomo brought down weed to these people.

571
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,860
 And cannabis means, canna is dog, like canine,

572
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,400
 and bi is two.

573
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,880
 So cannabis actually means two dog,

574
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,740
 and it is in reference to the two stars,

575
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,140
 the two dog stars.

576
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,540
 There is a rotational of the little star

577
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,900
 around the big star, maybe the big star

578
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,060
 around the little star, it doesn't really matter,

579
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,420
 but of every 50 to 60 years is the rotation.

580
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,820
 And supposedly in the Doughan tribe every 50 years,

581
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,860
 they have a year long party.

582
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,980
 James said it was every year,

583
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,000
 but that was that part's incorrect.

584
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,620
 It was a year long party every 50 years

585
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,060
 to celebrate a full rotation of the stars,

586
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,020
 where they get stoned out of their mind.

587
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,540
 Let's start looking into this stuff.

588
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,820
 First off, right off the bat,

589
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,540
 cannabis does not mean two dogs.

590
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,860
 Doesn't mean that at all.

591
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,780
 Canna, I hear, even if it did, let's just,

592
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,460
 even if it did, the Doughan tribe would not call,

593
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,940
 would not use a Greek word,

594
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,580
 because if they were using Greek,

595
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,720
 then there's so much cultural contamination in that area

596
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,180
 that you have to start writing off

597
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,780
 all of their legends whatsoever.

598
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,300
 So they weren't, even if cannabis didn't mean two dog,

599
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,080
 it wouldn't, they wouldn't use the Greek word for it.

600
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,180
 They would use their own word for it.

601
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,580
 Canna, the word cannabis comes, it's a Skythian word,

602
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,700
 and maybe even a Semitic word from Canbos,

603
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,620
 because people were smoking dank weed

604
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,900
 as far back as people have been around.

605
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,740
 It's actually one of the oldest crops.

606
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,180
 It's, we can source it back to about 12,000 years ago.

607
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,420
 It came out of Central Asia.

608
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,020
 So you're like, well, there's the myth it's blowing.

609
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,800
 It didn't show up in Africa.

610
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,460
 You're gonna talk about the gray breaking into the house.

611
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,460
 Well, it gets a little,

612
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,940
 this is where it starts to get really weird again.

613
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,620
 So Canbos, it's a Skythian, maybe even a Semitic word.

614
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,980
 In the Old Testament, there's a word known as Kyniboisin.

615
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,380
 So it kind of sounds like cannabis,

616
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,860
 and that means hemp blossom.

617
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,080
 So way preceding Greek, way preceding,

618
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,660
 Dogans even being established.

619
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,380
 People were using the word Canbos.

620
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,700
 So it's not, does cannabis does not,

621
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,180
 if you broke it down and you bastardized Greek,

622
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,860
 yes, you can make it mean two dog,

623
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,580
 but that's not where the word comes from.

624
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,500
 Most, they don't, they're not 100% sure,

625
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,420
 but they're most likely it comes from Canbos

626
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,740
 or Canbosin.

627
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,180
 So as that doesn't, we're gonna throw that out.

628
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,260
 So weed was being cultivated 12,000 years ago

629
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,780
 in Central Asia, in the Mongolian territory.

630
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,620
 The Dogan tribe was established in 3,500 BC.

631
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,220
 So not even, people had strains of Intica and Sativa

632
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,700
 long before the Dogans ever settled down in their area.

633
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,940
 Again, this is where it's gonna get weird.

634
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,540
 Apparently, and what's funny is I've done

635
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,620
 a ton of research on this, and a lot of people saying

636
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,020
 I've read this in a book, and I'm wondering

637
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,740
 if they're getting the same information from,

638
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,540
 I mean, I'm wondering if they're getting the same

639
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,660
 information from the quote unquote weed book

640
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,900
 that James said that he read, I think it was in high school.

641
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,540
 It's been a while since that introduction,

642
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,180
 but I wonder if they're all referring to this book,

643
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,980
 but apparently, so Herodotus, we talked about him before.

644
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,900
 People say his name is pronounced Herodotus.

645
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,540
 I don't believe that, I think it's Herodotus.

646
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,380
 Herodotus loved smoking weed.

647
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,100
 Apparently, I couldn't find any sources for this,

648
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,820
 so again, I think it's this book

649
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,780
 that people are reading in high school.

650
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,620
 Anyways, okay, fine, Herodotus, we'll call him that,

651
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,020
 but I think that's his real name.

652
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,140
 He'll always be Herodotus to me.

653
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,500
 Herodotus went and he did at one point smoke weed

654
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,300
 or hang around with a bunch of Scythians smoking weed,

655
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,900
 Scythians smoking weed.

656
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,660
 He tells his story where they're just throwing it

657
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,500
 into a bonfire and flipping out, dancing around.

658
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,660
 And Herodotus is like, oh, this is dope.

659
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,940
 I'm gonna be traveling all over the world

660
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,500
 smoking the dankest of the dank.

661
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,260
 So there's a story that Herodotus went to go,

662
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,980
 Herodotus was a world traveler,

663
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,020
 and he's actually the first Westerner

664
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,540
 to write down a reference to marijuana.

665
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,680
 So he ends up, there's a story that he went

666
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,180
 to the Dogon tribe and he actually showed up

667
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,100
 on the 50th year of this celebration,

668
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,460
 like on the celebration year,

669
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,860
 and got rippin' stoned with this tribe in Africa.

670
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,420
 And they just smoked a ton of weed.

671
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,980
 And then he slowly stumbled his way back to grace.

672
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,740
 He's like, oh man, it was awesome.

673
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,700
 The jungle started talking to me.

674
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,780
 It was dope.

675
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,420
 I rode a gorilla across the savannah.

676
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,780
 Weeds the best.

677
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,540
 And they're like, Herodotus, just write stuff,

678
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,340
 just be a historian, write stuff down.

679
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,460
 Quit smoking all the time.

680
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,300
 Such a slacker.

681
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,440
 And he's like, oh, I'll write it later.

682
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,420
 First I gotta play this Stone Age Nintendo.

683
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,500
 It's just, it's pong.

684
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,260
 It's just literally like rocks bouncing around in a box.

685
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,780
 So Herodotus, supposedly, I could not find any verification

686
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
 that Herodotus, he did go to Africa,

687
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,580
 but I couldn't find any verification

688
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,300
 that he visited the Dogon tribe or got high with them.

689
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,660
 Now that's because I've only been researching it

690
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,220
 for about two days.

691
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,740
 That source may be out there,

692
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,100
 but I couldn't find any reference

693
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,420
 to him actually meeting the Dogon tribe.

694
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,740
 So I think that part may have been added in later.

695
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,300
 But could he have smoked weed with the Dogon tribe?

696
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,000
 This is again, where we start getting interesting again.

697
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,140
 I think the whole thing's interesting,

698
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,260
 but I was looking at a map of how marijuana,

699
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,060
 how cannabis moved out of Central Asia across the world.

700
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,740
 And according to this flow chart, according to this map,

701
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,260
 it should not have reached Western Africa

702
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,260
 until the year 800 AD.

703
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,900
 But Herodotus was born in 484 BC.

704
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,540
 So there's, if that is true,

705
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,500
 there is no way he could have smoked weed

706
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,100
 with the Dogon tribe.

707
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,020
 So either the information is fake

708
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,100
 that he didn't smoke weed with the Dogon tribe,

709
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,500
 or weed was in that area

710
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,540
 long before we thought it could get there.

711
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,860
 And I'm going to make the claim that it was.

712
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,540
 This is where we get into conspiracy, but hear me out.

713
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,580
 I'm gonna make the claim that it was,

714
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,140
 and it may actually tie back to some alien encounters.

715
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,060
 Cannabis, like I said, known to come from Central Asia.

716
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,380
 It was growing on, how do you pronounce it?

717
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,220
 The steps.

718
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,580
 I know it looks like it's the steppes,

719
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,260
 but the steps of Mongolia, okay?

720
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,500
 So I started looking, again, I'm still going,

721
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,460
 I believe this stuff when I'm researching it,

722
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,080
 and then I'll present it as a skeptic,

723
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,060
 or if I found anything.

724
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,900
 This is, so I was researching this.

725
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,460
 I began looking through Mongolian religions,

726
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,460
 Mongolian gods, to see if anything matched Nomo.

727
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,700
 There is a mermaid goddess, but I disregarded that

728
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,820
 because there's mermaid goddesses everywhere,

729
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,660
 and she just kind of swam in the water and stuff like that.

730
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,020
 But there was a god of the steppes.

731
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,380
 A god of the steppes.

732
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,900
 No one has Ba's, Tengri.

733
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,380
 No information on him at all.

734
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,060
 They have a whole list on Wikipedia

735
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,660
 of all of these Mongolian gods.

736
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,420
 A lot of them have their own pages.

737
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,460
 Nothing on Ba's Tengri, the god of the steppes.

738
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,140
 Where cannabis originated from, nothing.

739
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,780
 Tengri was their main god in the Mongolian religion,

740
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,260
 and then everyone else had these signifiers.

741
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,060
 So he was Ba's Tengri and someone else

742
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,820
 was Fon's Tengri or whatever.

743
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,860
 But Tengri was their main god.

744
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,420
 I thought this was such a beautiful image.

745
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,900
 Tengri is seen as a pure white goose

746
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,820
 flying over an endless expanse of water.

747
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,900
 That is just a shockingly beautiful imagery.

748
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,300
 And in their religion, Tengri was lonely,

749
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,540
 so Tengri created another god.

750
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,020
 And that god became evil,

751
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,020
 and that god's purpose became to lead men down dark paths.

752
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,740
 Pretty typical stuff for religion.

753
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,900
 Tengri ended up saying, you know what?

754
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,140
 I'm going to retreat from the universe.

755
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,700
 I'm going to leave the universe up to how it goes.

756
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,020
 But I'm gonna give people a helping hand.

757
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,820
 I am going to let people contact me.

758
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,820
 I'm going to send people sacred animals to watch over them

759
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,820
 and they can converse with when they're having a bad day

760
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,060
 or when they're seeking advice

761
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,780
 or they just want something to pet.

762
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,300
 That was a super weird connection

763
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,680
 between Central Asia and the Dagon tribe,

764
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,020
 where you have the god pretty much hands off,

765
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,860
 but a spirit animal is your connection to that god.

766
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,780
 That is something that may play,

767
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,900
 I know other religions have spirit animals,

768
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,620
 but I think the two similarities are odd.

769
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,020
 The kind of hands off god,

770
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:45,020
 but will allow you to interact with a shard of that god

771
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,420
 in the form of a spirit animal.

772
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,260
 Very, very odd connection between those two.

773
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,260
 The Dagon tribe, nobody knows where they came from.

774
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,020
 They're actually not indigenous to Mali.

775
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,420
 They've been there for so long,

776
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,740
 they're considered indigenous.

777
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,780
 Just like someone who's Native American,

778
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,780
 you can say, well, yeah, but they came from Asia.

779
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,980
 They came from somewhere,

780
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,980
 but the Native Americans have been here for so long,

781
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,660
 they're considered indigenous people.

782
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,660
 Same thing with the Dogons,

783
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,300
 but the Dogons call themselves the Dogons.

784
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,740
 When they first arrived in Africa,

785
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,740
 it was so recent that the other tribes named them Habe,

786
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,060
 and Habe means stranger or pagan.

787
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,540
 So this tribe shows up in Africa around 3,500 BC,

788
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,620
 and the other tribes basically call them

789
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,180
 bunch of weirdos, a bunch of strangers, a bunch of pagans.

790
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,380
 They are out of place of all the other tribes.

791
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,660
 I'm going to suggest that the Dogon tribe

792
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,460
 migrated from Central Asia,

793
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,620
 and that is why we have that connection of that belief.

794
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,780
 And if they migrated from Central Asia,

795
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,300
 they may have brought cannabis with them

796
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,820
 in that geographical area.

797
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,580
 So when Herodotus was able to go there,

798
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,780
 they were cultivating weed in their area.

799
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,900
 The religions have a couple similarities.

800
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,460
 The cannabis story with Herodotus does not make sense

801
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,060
 if we look at the normal migration of cannabis.

802
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,500
 That story doesn't wash.

803
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,900
 And the fact that they were so recent

804
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,060
 that other tribes, other established tribes,

805
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,300
 recognized them as being out of towners,

806
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,860
 recognized them as being pagans,

807
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,180
 with most likely pagan beliefs.

808
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,420
 So it would make sense that their religion

809
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,420
 would be based, have a loose tie to a Central Asian religion.

810
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,300
 And now we go back to wrap it all up.

811
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,340
 You go, okay.

812
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,820
 So let's say that you did figure out

813
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,020
 that the Dogons migrated from Central Asia.

814
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,660
 I might have called them Dagon's a couple of times

815
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,260
 because that horror movie, but not saying they're...

816
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,420
 Oh, I just remembered.

817
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,740
 Dagon was a horror movie

818
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,940
 and the people were turning into fish.

819
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,100
 The HP Lovecraft.

820
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,620
 Anyways, that's not proof.

821
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,580
 That's not proof.

822
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,900
 So you're like, Jason, you're skeptical about it.

823
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,500
 You don't think aliens brought weed down to the planet.

824
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,620
 Da, da, da, da.

825
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,780
 I haven't completely put on my skeptic cap

826
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,740
 because let me reveal these two last pieces of information.

827
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,780
 First off, the reason why James sent me this story

828
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,380
 was because it was in reference,

829
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,940
 and I cut this out of his comment

830
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,140
 when I was reading it to you.

831
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,980
 It was in reference to the story

832
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,660
 of the Johnny Sands encounter.

833
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,820
 Happened in 1976, there was a country musician.

834
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,260
 Quick overview if you didn't hear the episode.

835
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,800
 1976, there was a country musician

836
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,420
 who says he was visited by pale aliens with gills.

837
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,540
 And through the course of the investigation,

838
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,980
 he found out, and a man in black told him this,

839
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,900
 that the pale aliens with gills

840
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,180
 came from the Sirius star system.

841
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,100
 They were amphibious, and they didn't have fish tails.

842
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,520
 They didn't have fish tails in his version,

843
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,060
 but he said they came from the Sirius star system,

844
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,300
 which that planet orbiting it is like half water, half land,

845
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,820
 and sometimes land gets too hot so they go in the water.

846
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,260
 So they can breathe in the air, but they also have gills.

847
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,260
 Johnny Sands experienced that event in January of 1976.

848
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,900
 He was telling people that story

849
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,340
 for the course of the year 1976.

850
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,660
 The book, The Sirius Mystery,

851
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,300
 which talks about the gill aliens from Sirius,

852
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,060
 came out in 1976.

853
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,700
 Now his encounter was in January of 1976.

854
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,100
 It's possible that that book came out right before it.

855
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,780
 He read it and he goes, aw shucks,

856
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,340
 I'm gonna make up a story about this.

857
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,700
 That's possible.

858
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,180
 But his encounter took place on January 29th.

859
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,700
 So unless that book came out in those first 28 days,

860
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,860
 it's unlikely.

861
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,380
 The thing that really set it off, the book was popular,

862
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,180
 but so was that television show in search of,

863
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,220
 like I said, that show didn't broadcast,

864
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,460
 start broadcasting until 1977.

865
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,500
 So even that is after Johnny Sands' story takes place.

866
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,500
 So unless Johnny Sands read a French anthropologist guidebook

867
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,900
 on the Dogon tribe, it was a bizarre coincidence.

868
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,780
 Absolutely bizarre coincidence.

869
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,100
 It could be he's retroactively changed his story

870
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,940
 because I haven't read the actual,

871
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,380
 the original news articles

872
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,660
 when he was doing press on this.

873
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,100
 That's possible to be part of the hype,

874
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,380
 but it's also possible that he met an alien

875
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,220
 with gills from the Sirius Star System.

876
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,260
 Odd coincidence.

877
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,980
 Now if his encounter was in the 80s,

878
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,620
 I would completely write it off

879
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,500
 to the fact that he would read this book

880
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,660
 and was making it up.

881
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,660
 But the fact that his encounter took place,

882
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,940
 at the very least, he may have added the part about the MIB,

883
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,260
 the Men in Black agent telling them from Sirius.

884
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
 He may have added that over the years,

885
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,820
 but his initial encounter of the pale-faced aliens

886
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,820
 with the gills was 100% being reported January 30th, 1976.

887
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,660
 So again, unless that book came out

888
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,540
 the first part of January,

889
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,400
 he's telling the truth.

890
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,340
 I mean, again, I don't know if aliens actually visited him,

891
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,620
 but he's not adding that to the mythos.

892
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,740
 So that's an interesting connection between this stuff.

893
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,700
 And to wrap it all up, let's look back at Bos Tengri.

894
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,180
 Tengri is basically the God, the main God name,

895
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,860
 and then all the other gods have Tengri

896
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,600
 and then a qualifier in front of it.

897
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,300
 So you have like water Tengri, fire Tengri,

898
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,420
 electric Tengri, whatever, they're Pokemon.

899
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,980
 But Bos Tengri, very, very little information.

900
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,260
 A lot of them have, like I said,

901
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,500
 very detailed descriptions of what they look like.

902
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,700
 Could not find anything.

903
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,700
 I finally had to find the definition of the word Bos in Mongolian.

904
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,300
 Bos means, according to Google,

905
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,540
 so some bunch of Mongolians don't come over here

906
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,660
 and like raid my house on horseback,

907
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,660
 but Bos means gray or the gray God.

908
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:44,340
 It might be a coincidence that the one color

909
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,180
 we almost always connect with alien life

910
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,180
 is the God of the area

911
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,740
 where cannabis first appeared on the planet.

912
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,180
 You have the gray God who was worshiped

913
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,340
 over the steppes of Mongolia

914
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,540
 where cannabis was first discovered.

915
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,620
 Not just cultivated, but first sprouted up out of the ground.

916
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,980
 The gray God ruled that area.

917
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,780
 I used to smoke, I used to smoke a lot,

918
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,280
 and I get the connection between people thinking

919
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,100
 that it is some sort of supernatural herb

920
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,020
 or that it is from another planet

921
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,700
 because the effects are so intense.

922
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,660
 There's also been conspiracies that magic mushrooms are alien.

923
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,020
 There's been conspiracies that, for whatever reason,

924
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,700
 cilantro is from another planet.

925
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,500
 But I don't get that one either.

926
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,340
 I don't get that one either.

927
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,100
 But I get why people who smoke weed

928
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,300
 or have interacted with weed

929
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,380
 can easily believe that it's not of this earth

930
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,740
 because the effects it has on the human brain

931
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,000
 are not of this earth.

932
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,360
 Cannabis may be from another planet.

933
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,880
 Cannabis may just be a plant

934
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
 that creates a special connection

935
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,080
 between the user and nature.

936
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,480
 It is like being an adult

937
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,720
 and viewing the world with the eyes of an infant.

938
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,160
 Everything seems new and special and bright and shiny.

939
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,320
 Everything seems important and funny and good.

940
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,240
 It may not be from another planet,

941
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,100
 but it makes you feel like an alien on your own planet.

942
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,940
 And because of that,

943
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,020
 I get why people respond to this conspiracy.

944
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:25,860
 There definitely seems like there's something unique

945
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:30,860
 about marijuana, something special, something alien.

946
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:37,180
 There may be no proof that it is from another star system,

947
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,100
 but that's not gonna stop people from lighting up

948
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,960
 and imagining that it is.

949
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,320
