7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:38,260
 Is there a way to give a woman an instant orgasm? Then we take a brief look at a

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,620
 political scandal that rocked South Korea and the ramifications it has for

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:51,980
 conspiracy theorists today, and then we end with a trip into the ocean. Or

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,660
 octopuses, actually from outer space. Scientists think they might be. Today on

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,660
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:10,420
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,940
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too,

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:21,380
 but am I having a great day? That's always the question. I'd say 99.9% of the time I

15
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,540
 am, but right now my most hated enemy has returned to this planet. Some people call

16
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,980
 it... I guess everyone calls it snow. Don't they say there's like 27... like

17
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,260
 Eskimos have 27 different words for snow, but I couldn't think of one extra word.

18
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,260
 Snow?

19
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,060
 Anyways, it's falling. It looks like it's going to be pretty slushy, so I'm not too

20
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,580
 worried about it. But anyways, let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

21
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:55,220
 Now, this first story we're going to look at is from that magical year of 2004. Yes,

22
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,180
 we're delving back into the new news folder, but this particular article is

23
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,260
 still happening today. Very, very interesting thing. Probably more

24
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,940
 interesting if you're a woman, and equally interesting if you're a man who likes

25
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,180
 watching women have orgasms. Just that was a weird way to put it. But anyway, so

26
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,900
 back in 2004 there was a doctor named Dr. Stuart Malloy. Now, he was a... like...

27
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,980
 so he was a pain specialist, and one of the things he used to treat pain was they

28
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,740
 would put electrodes in your back and you just eat, eat, you wouldn't make the

29
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,980
 noise, it would actually like electrocute you. Generally, most of the time that he

30
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,940
 did this, your back pain would go away. You're like, "Hey, thanks Doc. Take off."

31
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,580
 Back pain would be good for a bit. Little electrotherapy. But one time this woman

32
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,820
 was having a particular pain and a particular point in her spine, so he

33
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,180
 puts the electrodes in, turns it on, tell me when you feel something...

34
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,860
 and the woman starts hyperventilating. Maybe it wasn't that exaggerated, and I

35
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,900
 can't think you guys want to hear me simulate a woman's orgasm, but... or maybe you do.

36
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,420
 But anyway, so he's turning on the... he's upping the amputage or the voltage, whatever it is.

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,100
 He probably should know because he's ejecting into a woman's body.

38
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:17,940
 Sounds like a dying duck. But anyways, she starts hyperventilating, making all these

39
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,900
 noises, and the doctor's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's that?" He shuts it off, and he's like,

40
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:29,300
 "Are you okay?" And her response is, "Quote, you're gonna have to teach my husband how to do that."

41
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,940
 Because she straight up started having an orgasm, just like out of the blue. You're sitting in a

42
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,180
 doctor's office, one of the least sexy places, unless you have a fetish for that thing.

43
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,580
 She starts having an orgasm. What he realized was that at that point in the spine, if you put

44
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,740
 these electrodes in there, and you turn it on, for a woman, at least, you'll have an orgasm. Now,

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,620
 obviously, like you could imagine the doctor standing there and like little money signs,

46
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,980
 little dollar signs appearing in his eyeballs. He's like, "Djing!" He actually heard the sound

47
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,980
 effect. That was real. That was in the article. I heard a sound effect, and my eyes turned to

48
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,540
 two dollar signs. Because immediately he's like, "I'm sitting on a million dollars here with this

49
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,100
 piece of technology, with this piece of information. If I can go around and start giving women insin

50
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,860
 orgasms." Because women, this shouldn't come as a shock to most of you unless you live your life

51
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:24,180
 watching pornography. Women can have a harder time reaching climax than a man. A man can get his,

52
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,620
 you know, ding dong stuck in a donut. He's fine. Like any sort of friction. He's like, "Oh, this feels

53
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,220
 pleasurable." But for women, it can be a little more complicated. However, you can't start marketing

54
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,380
 a device that shoots electricity into people's bodies and just be like, "Ah, to help you get off."

55
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,060
 He had to package it as a medical device. And I can't believe I used the word ding dong. But

56
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,220
 anyways, so he had to package it as a medical device. And so he was marketing it towards women

57
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,740
 who couldn't have orgasms, either through some sort of injury or some sort of psychological issue.

58
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,660
 Women who can't have orgasms. This device will help you do that. It is a medical device. And

59
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,700
 he's tested it on women who have kind of fit that pattern where, you know, they just can't have,

60
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,820
 they've never had an orgasm or they physically or mentally can't have an orgasm because of some

61
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,660
 incident. So he does this like a small study. And I believe there was like 11 women involved. And 10

62
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,740
 of them had orgasms using that machine. And one of the women was sad when the study ended, because

63
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,260
 she's like, "Oh, I can't have orgasms. Normally, I really want this machine." Now it's controlled.

64
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,140
 You put the electrodes in your back and it's controlled by a remote control. And I'll tell

65
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,940
 you right now, do not lose that remote control because if someone else gets a hold of that thing,

66
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,300
 you're going to have a really fun but very, very sore afternoon. So you make sure like you,

67
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,940
 you'd have to keep that like on your key chain. And you're like, "Where's my car?" And you're trying

68
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,660
 to turn it on. You're like, "Ugh, in the parking lot." Which would be quite interesting to see.

69
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,100
 The problem is there are two problems. One, the device, because you have to have

70
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,100
 it implanted, you have to have the little electrode things plugged in your spine,

71
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:12,340
 that procedure costs $17,000. And the doctor's like, "Oh, I have no doubt in my mind that women

72
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,540
 will pay $17,000 to be able to give themselves instant orgasms with this machine." But the bigger

73
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,620
 problem is that we're in the year 2014 now. So 10 years later, he's still trying to get this

74
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:30,500
 made as a medical device. He has to do a full trial for the FDA. And to do that, you need a ton of

75
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,140
 people and you need a bunch of researchers and you need like, you need to buy like a thousand

76
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,420
 lab coats because I'm sure they're going to get dirty at some point. And the FDA required like

77
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,900
 for this study, the cost is $6 million to be able to run a full study so that the FDA can look at

78
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,420
 all your results and say, "Yeah, this works." And he can't, he's trying to raise the money, he can't.

79
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,900
 As of 2014, he wasn't able to raise the money. And that was kind of the latest information I'd seen

80
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,420
 on this. So if you happen to have $6 million sent around, don't know what to do with it, and you're

81
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,540
 like, "You know what, I have all this money, but zero orgasms. I'd rather have all these orgasms

82
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,460
 and zero money. You can donate it to this guy, get a little, you know, get the full trial run,

83
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,620
 make sure it's totally healthy, FDA stamps it. You'll be the first one with two little electrodes

84
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,780
 in your back and a little remote control in your hand. You're just walking down the street.

85
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,980
 That would be so weird. You're like sitting on the bus and you're just, you know, reading your book

86
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,820
 and you hear like a, because you'd have to learn how to stifle the vocals, but you hear like a,

87
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,300
 "Ugh." And you look over and you see a woman just completely tensed up and then go completely

88
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,500
 noodle, just completely relaxed. She's just sitting on the bus. You'd be like, "What?" And you'd start

89
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,580
 seeing that through the other day. You'd be at the office, you'd be a seat watching the secretary

90
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,780
 sitting there. She's talking and all of a sudden, "Huh?" And then just go noodle everywhere. Brave new

91
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,820
 world, my friends. Brave new world. So our next story is a request from two different listeners.

92
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:04,340
 We have on YouTube a Caesar Pizza 133 and then through email we have Jeremy. So both recommended

93
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:12,100
 this story. Now, the story itself is a corruption story and it's quite by the book, but when we look

94
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:18,660
 at the details and the ramifications going forward, it actually is a win for conspiracy theorists

95
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,900
 and I'm surprised they don't bring this up more often. So we're going to South Korea. We are going

96
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,860
 to take, we're not, we, the Dead Rabbit Durgeable, we'll leave that for a while, but let's go ahead

97
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,820
 and hop into the carpenter copter. I have a special buffer. I have like a special EMP around it, so

98
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,740
 your orgasm remote controls won't work. So I don't have to worry about you going all noodley in the

99
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:46,820
 back. Anyways, so we're going the long way, so don't fly over North Korea. We will be going there for

100
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:55,940
 future episodes, but laying, we get out South Korea. A little too close to the DMZ. We did catch some

101
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,340
 fire, but it's okay. It's okay. North Koreans missed us. I think they were just, I think they were

102
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:07,220
 just trying to get some attention, but so now we're in South Korea and the year is 2016. And this

103
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:14,980
 whole story broke on something super mundane. There's a private college, very, very wealthy

104
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,980
 kids are going there, and it's very competitive. And the other kids are telling their parents,

105
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:29,060
 "This girl, she never shows up, ever shows up to any of the lessons. She always passes. It's not

106
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,540
 fair. It's not fair." And so people using their, this went on for a while and people using their

107
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,140
 connections for like, "You know, you might want to look into this because we know that girl knows

108
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,460
 that her mother is a pretty important person. There might be something kind of corruption

109
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,260
 thing going on here." So reporters started looking into this daughter who attends this college,

110
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,420
 and they did find out that things were not on the up and up. Now, the daughter's mother is a woman

111
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:59,060
 named Choi Soon-sil, and she is the daughter herself, because that's how families work,

112
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:05,460
 of a cult leader. This cult was known as the Church of Eternal Life, very, very popular in South

113
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,460
 Korea, but still a cult. They weren't like this mainstream thing. It was a mix of Christianity,

114
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,980
 Buddhism, and Shamaism. So they believed a lot in the spiritual world, contacting the dead,

115
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,940
 things like that. So they're thinking, "Okay, maybe the cult's pulling some ties. Maybe

116
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,380
 they're talking to the college president." Because even powerful people, they want their kids to

117
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,460
 learn. They're not going to go that far off the reservation where they're like, "Oh, yeah, no,

118
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,820
 I don't care if my kid doesn't even show up. Just make sure they all get A's." So reporters are

119
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:41,620
 looking into this, and then they discover something deeply troubling. Choi Soon-sil

120
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:49,620
 is controlling elements of the leadership of the college through the president of South Korea.

121
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,940
 The president of South Korea at that time was Park Goon Hee, actually the first female president in

122
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,180
 South Korea history. Her father was previously president, and her mother was killed in an assassination

123
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,860
 attempt against her father. And then a few years later, her father was assassinated, successfully

124
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,180
 assassinated. So Park, I'll just call her Park, sorry, I don't know how to pronounce the other

125
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,380
 name, but Park is a total orphan at this point. Now she's a young kid at this point when her

126
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:24,180
 parents are killed, and she has no one. She was friends with the daughter of the cult, and she's

127
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,740
 just kind of brought into it. And over the years, they kind of orchestrated her return to power.

128
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,660
 Knowing full well that when she became president, they would rule the country. At this point,

129
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:43,620
 where we're at in 2016, Choi Soon-sil runs the cult. Her father has passed away as well. So you

130
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,540
 have Choi Soon-sil, and then you have Park as president, and together they pretty much ran the

131
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,100
 country. This was all discovered because her daughter wasn't attending classes. And when the news got

132
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:05,140
 out, massive protests. Protests of over one million people. It just was this insane thing. You have

133
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:11,940
 this president who was being controlled by the, she wasn't like a Jonestown level cult, but it would

134
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,020
 be the equivalent of say, a weirdo street preacher who just happens to have a bunch of followers.

135
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:25,780
 Like it wasn't an acceptable version of religion in South Korea. It was still a cult. And the

136
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,740
 South Korean people felt betrayed by the president, and they felt tricked by this cult leader.

137
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,740
 She was considered, Choi Soon-sil was considered a modern day Rasputin, the way she just kind of

138
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:43,620
 pulled strings. I remember reading one report that one time the president went up, President Park,

139
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,860
 went up to give a speech, and the reporters are like, why is she wearing those clothes? She looks

140
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,660
 kind of dumpy in that outfit. Like that's kind of a weird outfit for a president to wear doing

141
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,420
 a speech. Now she wasn't dressed in like rags. She was in a hobo with a spindle, you know,

142
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,900
 smoking a big corn cob pipe, but it was out of character for her and it was out of character

143
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,820
 for someone of that stature. The rumor was, was that she was being punished. And Choi Soon-sil

144
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,700
 said, you know what, you're not doing what we said or you're being disrespectful. Where are these

145
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,580
 hobo clothes? Where are these poor people clothes? These non-designer clothes the next time you give

146
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:24,100
 a speech. She was under that level of control from the cult. The cult's gone by the names also was

147
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,220
 Eight Goddesses. That's really Eight Goddesses scandal was kind of how it was known in western

148
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:36,900
 media. It's a very evocative term. But the end result was, protests happened, Choi gets sentenced

149
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,700
 to 20 years in prison for corruption, Park, the president gets sentenced to 24 years for corruption,

150
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,860
 and Choi Soon-sil had to pay $17 million in fines because she had all the money from her cult.

151
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:58,580
 Now, fairly basic corruption story with simply an added element of a shaman and a cult and this

152
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,940
 religious belief system and things like that. On its face, you're like, okay, you know, I've heard

153
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,140
 of politicians being corrupt. I've heard of people being bribed and things like that. So this one just

154
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,500
 has kind of an added supernatural element to it. But the reason why I think this is important

155
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:21,620
 as a story is that it's a conspiracy that is true. We can take that and this is why I'm surprised

156
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,860
 it's not bigger news in the West. You have that and it's provable. And so why don't more conspiracy

157
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,060
 theorists say, well, look at this happened in South Korea and we know it was happening. So who's to

158
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:39,460
 say that the same thing isn't happening here with this other group? Like it's a anytime you can find

159
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,180
 an actual provable conspiracy theory, especially something along these lines where it is a

160
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,580
 religious cult controlling the highest person in the country. Why isn't it used more in Western

161
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:58,260
 culture and Western conspiracy culture? This is my theory. It's too mundane. Western conspiracy

162
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,420
 culture and I don't want to go off on a rant here, but Western conspiracy culture has really gotten

163
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:10,420
 super bizarre recently. I think it's too mundane for them. They don't want to have one group controlling

164
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,980
 one person because they can take this evidence and go, hey, look at here we have this cult that

165
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,700
 was controlling the president. So maybe this cult was controlling Obama, but they don't want that.

166
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:29,700
 They want this huge overarching conspiracy where the Queen of England, George Soros, and Obama,

167
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:36,660
 and Hillary Clinton, and all these Katy Perry, is it in on it somehow? Katy Perry and Kevin Spacey

168
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:43,140
 are at the same level of Barack Obama and George Soros in this weird mind of theirs.

169
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:51,220
 It's this huge net that comes around the world. And so it's too ridiculous. If you want to tell a

170
00:15:51,220 --> 00:16:00,980
 good conspiracy theory, you keep it simple. To say that Henry Kissinger and Rihanna have meetings

171
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,420
 and they're like, you know what we need to do? We need to push more sexy young women on the people

172
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:13,300
 of the world. It doesn't make any sense. Petto would and the Hollywood elite and the reptilians

173
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:20,420
 and the demons and stuff like that. It's way too unwieldy. And they all end up like that. The reason

174
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:28,900
 why it gets so weird like that and so big, because it's mostly made up. It's mythology. It's really

175
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,420
 conspiracy theory is modern-day mythology. And just like myths of old, everyone kind of picks

176
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,500
 and chooses what they want and they deform the story and turn it into their vision. And then

177
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,660
 they put it out there and someone picks and chooses from what they want and it builds this

178
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:51,460
 mythology. Reality, I love a good myth and I love a great story, but reality like this story right

179
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,980
 here is more interesting because it happened. And that was it. And it's super bizarre that this

180
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,620
 doesn't get brought up more in conspiracy theory circles. Approvable conspiracy theory,

181
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,540
 the most powerful person in the country was under the thrall of a cult leader who believed

182
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,060
 she could talk to the dead. Dude, that should be a conspiracy theorist's wet dream. They wouldn't

183
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:21,060
 need the orgasmatron if they listened to this one. Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our last

184
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:32,580
 story. Out in the darkness of space, a planet explodes. Except there's no noise in space.

185
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,820
 So you just see a bunch of rocks fly away. I guess if you were on the planet when it exploded,

186
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:42,580
 it would be quite loud. And there's a frozen chunk of it, creaning through the darkness.

187
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:54,180
 Flying, who knows where, but we know where. Because millions of years later, this giant,

188
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:03,060
 frozen block of an alien planet crashes into Earth's oceans.

189
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:11,940
 All the single celled organisms are like, "What the hell was that? Oh no, we're evolving!

190
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:19,140
 I'm a dog! Hey, look at me, I'm a cat!" That's a little bit of a overview of it.

191
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,180
 Simplification, but what we're doing right now is we're looking at the conspiracy theory.

192
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,300
 It's a conspiracy theory that some scientists agree with,

193
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,460
 and others don't. And it's interesting because it's kind of set up on different levels.

194
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,660
 This one was actually requested on YouTube by Waffenbeer. If you wanted me to cover this one.

195
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,260
 So where life came from on Earth, what we can do is we can look back to the Cambian era,

196
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:51,380
 where we saw this massive explosion in advanced life. And most of the modern species that are here

197
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,180
 today, we can trace back to the Cambian era. Before that, it was just a bunch of little amoebas

198
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,740
 like dancing around on the planet, having a good time. It was like the movie Flubber,

199
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:06,980
 but it was just all just goo, goo hanging out. And at some point, something happened that

200
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:13,700
 caused life to just explode. Now, an idea of that is this thing called panspermia,

201
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,420
 which I think that's how you pronounce it, where life is seeded from other planets that somehow

202
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:24,980
 something came from another planet and helped advance life here. That's not super, the panspermia

203
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:33,540
 thing is a bit, I'm pretty sure I'm mispronouncing that, but the panspermia thing is kind of debatable,

204
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:39,140
 but science goes there was this big explosion of life at this certain point of time. Now,

205
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:47,460
 Waffenbeer, who suggested this, is looking at an actual article written by 33 science in particular,

206
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,620
 this was quite recently wrote this, they're saying yes. Oh, Cambrian, not Cambian, but anyways,

207
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:01,860
 the Cambrian explosion happened, that's all fine. But when we look at the octopus, when we look in

208
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:08,740
 its big eyes, I think it has two of them, and it's not Squirt and Eacadus, we're like, look out,

209
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,340
 there are lab coats are all covered in black now, but why don't they wear black lab coats,

210
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,780
 or like red lab coats or something like that and Star Trek, the doctors wear red,

211
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:24,260
 not their uniforms, but their medical, never mind, never mind. So anyways, the these 33 scientists

212
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,780
 recently released a report and it was in the progress in biophysics and molecular biology

213
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:35,860
 journal, peer reviewed article, by the way, saying that they had a different theory when it comes to

214
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,540
 the octopus. Well, I thought the polar ruler of octopus was octopi, but anyways, when you look at

215
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:49,780
 the octopus, you go, it has a bunch of evolutionary advantages that it's previous that nothing had

216
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:56,020
 previous to that, they had the ability to camouflage and change shape almost instantly to hide themselves.

217
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:04,020
 It was a brand new evolutionary advantage, large brains, also a huge advantage that was not seen

218
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:09,860
 previous to the octopus, sophisticated nervous system, camera like eyes, which I don't really

219
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,940
 know what that means, but I'm assuming it's some sort of eye that's just more advanced,

220
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,740
 rather than your lame-o eyes over there, dude, the octopus is looking at the squid and being like,

221
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,420
 dancing, dancing so fast, the squid's like, I don't know what's seeing what I'm looking at,

222
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:28,500
 I don't have camera like eyes, little GoPro eyes. So this is the theory that was put forth by these

223
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:36,340
 scientists in this journal. So what their idea is this, because the octopus showed up after the

224
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:43,780
 Cambrian explosion, according to these guys. So their theory is this, that a chunk from another

225
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:50,180
 planet was frozen with octopus eggs, that they are literally an alien species on this planet,

226
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:56,580
 they did not evolve on earth. And this chunk of octopus eggs crashed into the ocean and they

227
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,340
 hatched, and that's where the octopus comes from. Now, obviously there's debate about that. The

228
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,100
 interesting thing is the, the infer, like the debates I've seen, at least in the articles that I

229
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:14,100
 read, aren't the best. When the scientists who wrote the report, they said, you know, the,

230
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:22,180
 there's a huge, the octopus genome is very, very complex. And 33, this is weird, 33 shown up a

231
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:33,060
 lot in here. Ooh, conspiracy. Maybe the octopi are the Illuminati, the Illuma, the, the Illuma Inky,

232
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,980
 maybe. There was a long pause there. If I edited that down, I had to think about that one for a while.

233
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:46,660
 Octopus genome is very complex, was over 33,000 protein coding genes, which is more than is

234
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,340
 present in a, in a human. And a lot of the articles that are like, you know, like the debunking articles,

235
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,860
 they're like, you know, they say that it's complex, but you know, we've decoded the genome, so it

236
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:04,900
 can't be alien. But I'm thinking, why couldn't you decode an alien genome? Like, and every article

237
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,140
 that was debunking it kind of have that same phrase. And they're admitting, hey, we know what

238
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,500
 the genome is of this alien octopus. There's no argument about that. They're just saying it's

239
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,420
 more complex than human. And the pushback is like, what? We've decoded it. And they don't really go

240
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:25,060
 into detail. The, one of the best debunking articles I read said that if an octopus from

241
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:33,860
 another planet came here, it wouldn't be able to evolve from the squid unless there were also

242
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:42,740
 squids on the alien planet. So whether or not it was straight up like eggs coming in on the comet

243
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:52,100
 or asteroid, or that whatever came down somehow mutated existing squids, the pushback to that was

244
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,300
 you would have to have a squid on another planet, like the, like a descendant of a squid on another

245
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:03,700
 planet for it to be able to mutate or breed with the squids down here. That's fair. That's

246
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,780
 a fair pushback. But again, that's really not what the scientists are saying. They're straight

247
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:16,980
 up saying octopus eggs came from another planet. Now, I know this is getting messy because I keep

248
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,660
 going back and forth, but you know, they did this journal, it was an appear review journal.

249
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,580
 And so that gives them a bit of credibility. However, I can start a journal with my, I don't

250
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:34,340
 know the pedigree of the progress in biophysics and molecular biology journal. We'll assume it's

251
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,980
 decent. Oh, and another pushback was like, there was no zoologist in the 33 scientists. So we should

252
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:48,500
 just throw out the whole study. It's really bizarre that the disagreements with this paper are pretty,

253
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:54,260
 at least the ones that are being quoted in news articles are pretty weak, actually.

254
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:05,860
 What if what started the Cambrian explosion was panspermia? Was rocks of life flying from other

255
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:15,300
 planets to come here? But it was just like, I don't know, gene juice. It was just like little

256
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,900
 bits and pieces of alien dudes. Like they got blown up, their skin fell everywhere, and then

257
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,340
 their skin fall. I guess I should let you guys know now. I don't know what I'm talking about.

258
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:32,660
 So let's skip that part. Here's the thing. This is my pushback to this. The fact that an alien

259
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,460
 egg could be frozen on an asteroid and crashed on Earth, I really don't have any problem with

260
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,340
 that. I could see that happening. It would be one in a million that it would survive. I could be

261
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,020
 frozen at the right temperature and wouldn't melt too close as it got close to any sun as it was

262
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,940
 flying around and then crashing the water and survived the impact and all this stuff. But one

263
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,740
 in a million chances in a universe that's infinite and time that's infinite is going to happen.

264
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:02,180
 I would think it was weird that an alien, let's say the Cambrian life explosion was going on,

265
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,220
 and you started to have all these sea creatures evolve and land creatures evolve,

266
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:13,300
 and a creature shows up that is not only slightly related to other creatures that are currently there,

267
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:21,860
 but, dude, wait a second. Oh man, I just thought of something. This isn't in the article, so you'll

268
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:30,900
 have to forgive me if I go off the "science stock" for a second. What if it's true? What if it is an

269
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:43,700
 octopus is an alien life form? But it wasn't by chance that they look like they're like related to

270
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:52,020
 a squid. What if it's by choice? What if it's by some sort of design? Like what came down was the

271
00:26:52,020 --> 00:27:03,460
 matrix for some sort of life form, and it took the makeup of an existing creature in its environment,

272
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:10,660
 one of the best ones, which would be a giant squid, and then added in its own... Basically,

273
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:17,620
 what I'm basically trying to explain is some sort of shape-shifting alien, but more like it can

274
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:30,740
 adapt its... If that comet had landed on land, we may have had a four-legged creature, like a dog

275
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:36,180
 type of thing, but with more learning capability, it could instantly camouflage, it could change its

276
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,460
 shape, and things like that. Like what if... I mean, that's science fiction. Let's go back to the

277
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,940
 article just to reaffirm it real quick. Some scientists believe that an asteroid crashed in

278
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:53,860
 the earth, and it had octopus eggs on it, so octopi are an actual alien species. But we could

279
00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:00,420
 extrapolate that to say that it could have just not been an accident, where it landed determined

280
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,780
 what it would look like, and the advantages that it would have, because it landed in the ocean.

281
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,940
 Basically, I guess what I'm explaining is when an Autobot crash lands on earth,

282
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:17,700
 and they scan the nearest car, they can become that car. Because once we're in the realm of...

283
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:26,900
 Why not? Why not? What if the octopus is not an accidental hitchhiker, but an intentional

284
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:33,060
 resident? You know, the only reason why the octopus is not one of the most advanced

285
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,420
 species on the planet, because they're incredibly smart. They can learn things by watching people,

286
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,700
 and they're very, very smart. The only thing that limits them to not becoming a dominant life form

287
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:49,060
 on the planet is that they only live to be five years old. A lot of them die after mating. So if

288
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:56,580
 they lived longer, if they lived as long as a blue whale, they actually would be the dominant species

289
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:04,740
 of the ocean. And it's funny to think that there is a possibility in a world where the octopus

290
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,580
 lived longer, let's say 60, 70 years. I don't think humans would have control of the oceans.

291
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,540
 I think once we first started sailing out across the oceans, I think boats would just be disappearing

292
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:25,380
 all the time. Because that's their land, and we... It's totally inhospitable to humans. You can't

293
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:32,340
 drink the water. You'll drown in it. You gotta build something to go across it. But if... If just a

294
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:42,340
 little twist in the genome where the octopus lives as long as a human, there is a world where

295
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:51,460
 the continents are completely separated. Like other than the Bering land bridge,

296
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,820
 there would be nobody on the Americas. And everyone would just be where they're at. There'd be no

297
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,540
 international trade. Because every time you send a ship out, it would crash. And you would just be

298
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:08,580
 like, "Well, I guess there's monsters out there." And then as society did develop and we started to

299
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:14,260
 do science stuff... I mean, think about it. The Americas not being found until the invention of

300
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,660
 the plane is what would happen in a world where the octopus... Everything's the same. They just

301
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:27,460
 simply lived a little longer. This wouldn't be our planet. It would just... Parts of it would be.

302
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:34,340
 You'd have a totally different advanced species controlling two-thirds of the planet.

303
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:41,540
 You know, we talked about gray aliens and dolphins the other day. And there was a theory. But...

304
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:49,380
 But the idea that if octopuses just lived a little longer, they would basically... We would be the...

305
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:57,060
 We would be the ones... Dude, what if they... What if they fished for us? They'd outnumber us, probably.

306
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:04,980
 They'd control more of the world's surface. A world where octopi, eight arms are sneaking into your

307
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,580
 bedroom at night. "Mommy, I think there's a monster under my bed." When a kid said that, the parents

308
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,180
 would be like, "Oh my god, there's an octopus in here." Because you would have to believe it. Because

309
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:22,500
 octopi are constantly climbing into the surface, grabbing you, ripping your guts out. Whether or

310
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:32,500
 not the octopus is from another planet, we don't really know. Some scientists say yes, some scientists

311
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:42,580
 say no. But wherever they're from, with just a little switch, they could have been the dominant

312
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:49,780
 life form on this planet. We could have been the ones that were their food supply. They don't need...

313
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:58,660
 I mean, they can walk on land. We could have no coastal cities, no ports. Because at night, these

314
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:05,540
 eight armed creatures would come up and grab a little bite to eat. Maybe they would just do it

315
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:12,100
 for fun on the weekends. It's weird to think how the world works, like how science works,

316
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,460
 how those little things can make big differences. Is it possible that the octopus is actually an

317
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,620
 alien life form from another planet? It is possible. And I think the arguments that are being used

318
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:30,900
 against it are relatively weak, which makes me think we don't have to look to the stars to find

319
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:38,900
 alien life. The stars already came to us. DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address.
