 Is there a way to give a woman an instant orgasm? Then we take a brief look at a

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 political scandal that rocked South Korea and the ramifications it has for

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.980
 conspiracy theorists today, and then we end with a trip into the ocean. Or

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.660
 octopuses, actually from outer space. Scientists think they might be. Today on

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:10.420
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.940
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.380
 but am I having a great day? That's always the question. I'd say 99.9% of the time I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.540
 am, but right now my most hated enemy has returned to this planet. Some people call

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.980
 it... I guess everyone calls it snow. Don't they say there's like 27... like

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.260
 Eskimos have 27 different words for snow, but I couldn't think of one extra word.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
 Snow?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.060
 Anyways, it's falling. It looks like it's going to be pretty slushy, so I'm not too

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.580
 worried about it. But anyways, let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.220
 Now, this first story we're going to look at is from that magical year of 2004. Yes,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.180
 we're delving back into the new news folder, but this particular article is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.260
 still happening today. Very, very interesting thing. Probably more

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.940
 interesting if you're a woman, and equally interesting if you're a man who likes

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.180
 watching women have orgasms. Just that was a weird way to put it. But anyway, so

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 back in 2004 there was a doctor named Dr. Stuart Malloy. Now, he was a... like...

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.980
 so he was a pain specialist, and one of the things he used to treat pain was they

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.740
 would put electrodes in your back and you just eat, eat, you wouldn't make the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.980
 noise, it would actually like electrocute you. Generally, most of the time that he

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.940
 did this, your back pain would go away. You're like, "Hey, thanks Doc. Take off."

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.580
 Back pain would be good for a bit. Little electrotherapy. But one time this woman

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.820
 was having a particular pain and a particular point in her spine, so he

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.180
 puts the electrodes in, turns it on, tell me when you feel something...

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.860
 and the woman starts hyperventilating. Maybe it wasn't that exaggerated, and I

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.900
 can't think you guys want to hear me simulate a woman's orgasm, but... or maybe you do.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.420
 But anyway, so he's turning on the... he's upping the amputage or the voltage, whatever it is.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.100
 He probably should know because he's ejecting into a woman's body.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.940
 Sounds like a dying duck. But anyways, she starts hyperventilating, making all these

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.900
 noises, and the doctor's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's that?" He shuts it off, and he's like,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.300
 "Are you okay?" And her response is, "Quote, you're gonna have to teach my husband how to do that."

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.940
 Because she straight up started having an orgasm, just like out of the blue. You're sitting in a

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.180
 doctor's office, one of the least sexy places, unless you have a fetish for that thing.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.580
 She starts having an orgasm. What he realized was that at that point in the spine, if you put

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.740
 these electrodes in there, and you turn it on, for a woman, at least, you'll have an orgasm. Now,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.620
 obviously, like you could imagine the doctor standing there and like little money signs,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.980
 little dollar signs appearing in his eyeballs. He's like, "Djing!" He actually heard the sound

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.980
 effect. That was real. That was in the article. I heard a sound effect, and my eyes turned to

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.540
 two dollar signs. Because immediately he's like, "I'm sitting on a million dollars here with this

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.100
 piece of technology, with this piece of information. If I can go around and start giving women insin

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.860
 orgasms." Because women, this shouldn't come as a shock to most of you unless you live your life

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:24.180
 watching pornography. Women can have a harder time reaching climax than a man. A man can get his,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.620
 you know, ding dong stuck in a donut. He's fine. Like any sort of friction. He's like, "Oh, this feels

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.220
 pleasurable." But for women, it can be a little more complicated. However, you can't start marketing

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.380
 a device that shoots electricity into people's bodies and just be like, "Ah, to help you get off."

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.060
 He had to package it as a medical device. And I can't believe I used the word ding dong. But

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.220
 anyways, so he had to package it as a medical device. And so he was marketing it towards women

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.740
 who couldn't have orgasms, either through some sort of injury or some sort of psychological issue.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.660
 Women who can't have orgasms. This device will help you do that. It is a medical device. And

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.700
 he's tested it on women who have kind of fit that pattern where, you know, they just can't have,

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.820
 they've never had an orgasm or they physically or mentally can't have an orgasm because of some

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.660
 incident. So he does this like a small study. And I believe there was like 11 women involved. And 10

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.740
 of them had orgasms using that machine. And one of the women was sad when the study ended, because

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.260
 she's like, "Oh, I can't have orgasms. Normally, I really want this machine." Now it's controlled.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.140
 You put the electrodes in your back and it's controlled by a remote control. And I'll tell

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.940
 you right now, do not lose that remote control because if someone else gets a hold of that thing,

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.300
 you're going to have a really fun but very, very sore afternoon. So you make sure like you,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.940
 you'd have to keep that like on your key chain. And you're like, "Where's my car?" And you're trying

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.660
 to turn it on. You're like, "Ugh, in the parking lot." Which would be quite interesting to see.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.100
 The problem is there are two problems. One, the device, because you have to have

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.100
 it implanted, you have to have the little electrode things plugged in your spine,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.340
 that procedure costs $17,000. And the doctor's like, "Oh, I have no doubt in my mind that women

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.540
 will pay $17,000 to be able to give themselves instant orgasms with this machine." But the bigger

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.620
 problem is that we're in the year 2014 now. So 10 years later, he's still trying to get this

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.500
 made as a medical device. He has to do a full trial for the FDA. And to do that, you need a ton of

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.140
 people and you need a bunch of researchers and you need like, you need to buy like a thousand

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.420
 lab coats because I'm sure they're going to get dirty at some point. And the FDA required like

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.900
 for this study, the cost is $6 million to be able to run a full study so that the FDA can look at

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.420
 all your results and say, "Yeah, this works." And he can't, he's trying to raise the money, he can't.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.900
 As of 2014, he wasn't able to raise the money. And that was kind of the latest information I'd seen

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.420
 on this. So if you happen to have $6 million sent around, don't know what to do with it, and you're

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.540
 like, "You know what, I have all this money, but zero orgasms. I'd rather have all these orgasms

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.460
 and zero money. You can donate it to this guy, get a little, you know, get the full trial run,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.620
 make sure it's totally healthy, FDA stamps it. You'll be the first one with two little electrodes

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.780
 in your back and a little remote control in your hand. You're just walking down the street.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.980
 That would be so weird. You're like sitting on the bus and you're just, you know, reading your book

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.820
 and you hear like a, because you'd have to learn how to stifle the vocals, but you hear like a,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.300
 "Ugh." And you look over and you see a woman just completely tensed up and then go completely

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.500
 noodle, just completely relaxed. She's just sitting on the bus. You'd be like, "What?" And you'd start

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.580
 seeing that through the other day. You'd be at the office, you'd be a seat watching the secretary

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.780
 sitting there. She's talking and all of a sudden, "Huh?" And then just go noodle everywhere. Brave new

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.820
 world, my friends. Brave new world. So our next story is a request from two different listeners.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:04.340
 We have on YouTube a Caesar Pizza 133 and then through email we have Jeremy. So both recommended

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:12.100
 this story. Now, the story itself is a corruption story and it's quite by the book, but when we look

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:18.660
 at the details and the ramifications going forward, it actually is a win for conspiracy theorists

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.900
 and I'm surprised they don't bring this up more often. So we're going to South Korea. We are going

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.860
 to take, we're not, we, the Dead Rabbit Durgeable, we'll leave that for a while, but let's go ahead

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.820
 and hop into the carpenter copter. I have a special buffer. I have like a special EMP around it, so

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.740
 your orgasm remote controls won't work. So I don't have to worry about you going all noodley in the

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:46.820
 back. Anyways, so we're going the long way, so don't fly over North Korea. We will be going there for

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:55.940
 future episodes, but laying, we get out South Korea. A little too close to the DMZ. We did catch some

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.340
 fire, but it's okay. It's okay. North Koreans missed us. I think they were just, I think they were

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:07.220
 just trying to get some attention, but so now we're in South Korea and the year is 2016. And this

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:14.980
 whole story broke on something super mundane. There's a private college, very, very wealthy

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.980
 kids are going there, and it's very competitive. And the other kids are telling their parents,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:29.060
 "This girl, she never shows up, ever shows up to any of the lessons. She always passes. It's not

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.540
 fair. It's not fair." And so people using their, this went on for a while and people using their

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.140
 connections for like, "You know, you might want to look into this because we know that girl knows

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.460
 that her mother is a pretty important person. There might be something kind of corruption

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.260
 thing going on here." So reporters started looking into this daughter who attends this college,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:52.420
 and they did find out that things were not on the up and up. Now, the daughter's mother is a woman

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:59.060
 named Choi Soon-sil, and she is the daughter herself, because that's how families work,

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:05.460
 of a cult leader. This cult was known as the Church of Eternal Life, very, very popular in South

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:11.460
 Korea, but still a cult. They weren't like this mainstream thing. It was a mix of Christianity,

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.980
 Buddhism, and Shamaism. So they believed a lot in the spiritual world, contacting the dead,

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.940
 things like that. So they're thinking, "Okay, maybe the cult's pulling some ties. Maybe

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:27.380
 they're talking to the college president." Because even powerful people, they want their kids to

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.460
 learn. They're not going to go that far off the reservation where they're like, "Oh, yeah, no,

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.820
 I don't care if my kid doesn't even show up. Just make sure they all get A's." So reporters are

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:41.620
 looking into this, and then they discover something deeply troubling. Choi Soon-sil

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:49.620
 is controlling elements of the leadership of the college through the president of South Korea.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:55.940
 The president of South Korea at that time was Park Goon Hee, actually the first female president in

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:02.180
 South Korea history. Her father was previously president, and her mother was killed in an assassination

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.860
 attempt against her father. And then a few years later, her father was assassinated, successfully

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.180
 assassinated. So Park, I'll just call her Park, sorry, I don't know how to pronounce the other

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.380
 name, but Park is a total orphan at this point. Now she's a young kid at this point when her

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:24.180
 parents are killed, and she has no one. She was friends with the daughter of the cult, and she's

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:30.740
 just kind of brought into it. And over the years, they kind of orchestrated her return to power.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:36.660
 Knowing full well that when she became president, they would rule the country. At this point,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:43.620
 where we're at in 2016, Choi Soon-sil runs the cult. Her father has passed away as well. So you

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:49.540
 have Choi Soon-sil, and then you have Park as president, and together they pretty much ran the

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:56.100
 country. This was all discovered because her daughter wasn't attending classes. And when the news got

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:05.140
 out, massive protests. Protests of over one million people. It just was this insane thing. You have

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:11.940
 this president who was being controlled by the, she wasn't like a Jonestown level cult, but it would

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:18.020
 be the equivalent of say, a weirdo street preacher who just happens to have a bunch of followers.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:25.780
 Like it wasn't an acceptable version of religion in South Korea. It was still a cult. And the

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.740
 South Korean people felt betrayed by the president, and they felt tricked by this cult leader.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:36.740
 She was considered, Choi Soon-sil was considered a modern day Rasputin, the way she just kind of

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:43.620
 pulled strings. I remember reading one report that one time the president went up, President Park,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:49.860
 went up to give a speech, and the reporters are like, why is she wearing those clothes? She looks

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.660
 kind of dumpy in that outfit. Like that's kind of a weird outfit for a president to wear doing

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.420
 a speech. Now she wasn't dressed in like rags. She was in a hobo with a spindle, you know,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.900
 smoking a big corn cob pipe, but it was out of character for her and it was out of character

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:08.820
 for someone of that stature. The rumor was, was that she was being punished. And Choi Soon-sil

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.700
 said, you know what, you're not doing what we said or you're being disrespectful. Where are these

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.580
 hobo clothes? Where are these poor people clothes? These non-designer clothes the next time you give

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:24.100
 a speech. She was under that level of control from the cult. The cult's gone by the names also was

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.220
 Eight Goddesses. That's really Eight Goddesses scandal was kind of how it was known in western

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:36.900
 media. It's a very evocative term. But the end result was, protests happened, Choi gets sentenced

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:43.700
 to 20 years in prison for corruption, Park, the president gets sentenced to 24 years for corruption,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:49.860
 and Choi Soon-sil had to pay $17 million in fines because she had all the money from her cult.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:58.580
 Now, fairly basic corruption story with simply an added element of a shaman and a cult and this

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.940
 religious belief system and things like that. On its face, you're like, okay, you know, I've heard

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:09.140
 of politicians being corrupt. I've heard of people being bribed and things like that. So this one just

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.500
 has kind of an added supernatural element to it. But the reason why I think this is important

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:21.620
 as a story is that it's a conspiracy that is true. We can take that and this is why I'm surprised

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:27.860
 it's not bigger news in the West. You have that and it's provable. And so why don't more conspiracy

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:33.060
 theorists say, well, look at this happened in South Korea and we know it was happening. So who's to

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:39.460
 say that the same thing isn't happening here with this other group? Like it's a anytime you can find

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.180
 an actual provable conspiracy theory, especially something along these lines where it is a

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:50.580
 religious cult controlling the highest person in the country. Why isn't it used more in Western

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:58.260
 culture and Western conspiracy culture? This is my theory. It's too mundane. Western conspiracy

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.420
 culture and I don't want to go off on a rant here, but Western conspiracy culture has really gotten

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:10.420
 super bizarre recently. I think it's too mundane for them. They don't want to have one group controlling

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.980
 one person because they can take this evidence and go, hey, look at here we have this cult that

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:21.700
 was controlling the president. So maybe this cult was controlling Obama, but they don't want that.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:29.700
 They want this huge overarching conspiracy where the Queen of England, George Soros, and Obama,

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:36.660
 and Hillary Clinton, and all these Katy Perry, is it in on it somehow? Katy Perry and Kevin Spacey

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:43.140
 are at the same level of Barack Obama and George Soros in this weird mind of theirs.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:51.220
 It's this huge net that comes around the world. And so it's too ridiculous. If you want to tell a

00:15:51.220 --> 00:16:00.980
 good conspiracy theory, you keep it simple. To say that Henry Kissinger and Rihanna have meetings

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:06.420
 and they're like, you know what we need to do? We need to push more sexy young women on the people

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:13.300
 of the world. It doesn't make any sense. Petto would and the Hollywood elite and the reptilians

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:20.420
 and the demons and stuff like that. It's way too unwieldy. And they all end up like that. The reason

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:28.900
 why it gets so weird like that and so big, because it's mostly made up. It's mythology. It's really

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:34.420
 conspiracy theory is modern-day mythology. And just like myths of old, everyone kind of picks

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:40.500
 and chooses what they want and they deform the story and turn it into their vision. And then

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.660
 they put it out there and someone picks and chooses from what they want and it builds this

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:51.460
 mythology. Reality, I love a good myth and I love a great story, but reality like this story right

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:58.980
 here is more interesting because it happened. And that was it. And it's super bizarre that this

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:03.620
 doesn't get brought up more in conspiracy theory circles. Approvable conspiracy theory,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.540
 the most powerful person in the country was under the thrall of a cult leader who believed

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:15.060
 she could talk to the dead. Dude, that should be a conspiracy theorist's wet dream. They wouldn't

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:21.060
 need the orgasmatron if they listened to this one. Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our last

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:32.580
 story. Out in the darkness of space, a planet explodes. Except there's no noise in space.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.820
 So you just see a bunch of rocks fly away. I guess if you were on the planet when it exploded,

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:42.580
 it would be quite loud. And there's a frozen chunk of it, creaning through the darkness.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:54.180
 Flying, who knows where, but we know where. Because millions of years later, this giant,

00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:03.060
 frozen block of an alien planet crashes into Earth's oceans.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:11.940
 All the single celled organisms are like, "What the hell was that? Oh no, we're evolving!

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:19.140
 I'm a dog! Hey, look at me, I'm a cat!" That's a little bit of a overview of it.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:26.180
 Simplification, but what we're doing right now is we're looking at the conspiracy theory.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.300
 It's a conspiracy theory that some scientists agree with,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.460
 and others don't. And it's interesting because it's kind of set up on different levels.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.660
 This one was actually requested on YouTube by Waffenbeer. If you wanted me to cover this one.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:44.260
 So where life came from on Earth, what we can do is we can look back to the Cambian era,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:51.380
 where we saw this massive explosion in advanced life. And most of the modern species that are here

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:56.180
 today, we can trace back to the Cambian era. Before that, it was just a bunch of little amoebas

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.740
 like dancing around on the planet, having a good time. It was like the movie Flubber,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:06.980
 but it was just all just goo, goo hanging out. And at some point, something happened that

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:13.700
 caused life to just explode. Now, an idea of that is this thing called panspermia,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.420
 which I think that's how you pronounce it, where life is seeded from other planets that somehow

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:24.980
 something came from another planet and helped advance life here. That's not super, the panspermia

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:33.540
 thing is a bit, I'm pretty sure I'm mispronouncing that, but the panspermia thing is kind of debatable,

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:39.140
 but science goes there was this big explosion of life at this certain point of time. Now,

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:47.460
 Waffenbeer, who suggested this, is looking at an actual article written by 33 science in particular,

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:53.620
 this was quite recently wrote this, they're saying yes. Oh, Cambrian, not Cambian, but anyways,

00:19:53.620 --> 00:20:01.860
 the Cambrian explosion happened, that's all fine. But when we look at the octopus, when we look in

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:08.740
 its big eyes, I think it has two of them, and it's not Squirt and Eacadus, we're like, look out,

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:14.340
 there are lab coats are all covered in black now, but why don't they wear black lab coats,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.780
 or like red lab coats or something like that and Star Trek, the doctors wear red,

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:24.260
 not their uniforms, but their medical, never mind, never mind. So anyways, the these 33 scientists

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:29.780
 recently released a report and it was in the progress in biophysics and molecular biology

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:35.860
 journal, peer reviewed article, by the way, saying that they had a different theory when it comes to

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:41.540
 the octopus. Well, I thought the polar ruler of octopus was octopi, but anyways, when you look at

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:49.780
 the octopus, you go, it has a bunch of evolutionary advantages that it's previous that nothing had

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:56.020
 previous to that, they had the ability to camouflage and change shape almost instantly to hide themselves.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:04.020
 It was a brand new evolutionary advantage, large brains, also a huge advantage that was not seen

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.860
 previous to the octopus, sophisticated nervous system, camera like eyes, which I don't really

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.940
 know what that means, but I'm assuming it's some sort of eye that's just more advanced,

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.740
 rather than your lame-o eyes over there, dude, the octopus is looking at the squid and being like,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.420
 dancing, dancing so fast, the squid's like, I don't know what's seeing what I'm looking at,

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:28.500
 I don't have camera like eyes, little GoPro eyes. So this is the theory that was put forth by these

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:36.340
 scientists in this journal. So what their idea is this, because the octopus showed up after the

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:43.780
 Cambrian explosion, according to these guys. So their theory is this, that a chunk from another

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:50.180
 planet was frozen with octopus eggs, that they are literally an alien species on this planet,

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:56.580
 they did not evolve on earth. And this chunk of octopus eggs crashed into the ocean and they

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:02.340
 hatched, and that's where the octopus comes from. Now, obviously there's debate about that. The

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:08.100
 interesting thing is the, the infer, like the debates I've seen, at least in the articles that I

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:14.100
 read, aren't the best. When the scientists who wrote the report, they said, you know, the,

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:22.180
 there's a huge, the octopus genome is very, very complex. And 33, this is weird, 33 shown up a

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:33.060
 lot in here. Ooh, conspiracy. Maybe the octopi are the Illuminati, the Illuma, the, the Illuma Inky,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:38.980
 maybe. There was a long pause there. If I edited that down, I had to think about that one for a while.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:46.660
 Octopus genome is very complex, was over 33,000 protein coding genes, which is more than is

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.340
 present in a, in a human. And a lot of the articles that are like, you know, like the debunking articles,

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.860
 they're like, you know, they say that it's complex, but you know, we've decoded the genome, so it

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:04.900
 can't be alien. But I'm thinking, why couldn't you decode an alien genome? Like, and every article

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.140
 that was debunking it kind of have that same phrase. And they're admitting, hey, we know what

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:14.500
 the genome is of this alien octopus. There's no argument about that. They're just saying it's

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.420
 more complex than human. And the pushback is like, what? We've decoded it. And they don't really go

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:25.060
 into detail. The, one of the best debunking articles I read said that if an octopus from

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:33.860
 another planet came here, it wouldn't be able to evolve from the squid unless there were also

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:42.740
 squids on the alien planet. So whether or not it was straight up like eggs coming in on the comet

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:52.100
 or asteroid, or that whatever came down somehow mutated existing squids, the pushback to that was

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:57.300
 you would have to have a squid on another planet, like the, like a descendant of a squid on another

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:03.700
 planet for it to be able to mutate or breed with the squids down here. That's fair. That's

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.780
 a fair pushback. But again, that's really not what the scientists are saying. They're straight

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:16.980
 up saying octopus eggs came from another planet. Now, I know this is getting messy because I keep

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.660
 going back and forth, but you know, they did this journal, it was an appear review journal.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.580
 And so that gives them a bit of credibility. However, I can start a journal with my, I don't

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:34.340
 know the pedigree of the progress in biophysics and molecular biology journal. We'll assume it's

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:40.980
 decent. Oh, and another pushback was like, there was no zoologist in the 33 scientists. So we should

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:48.500
 just throw out the whole study. It's really bizarre that the disagreements with this paper are pretty,

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:54.260
 at least the ones that are being quoted in news articles are pretty weak, actually.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:05.860
 What if what started the Cambrian explosion was panspermia? Was rocks of life flying from other

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:15.300
 planets to come here? But it was just like, I don't know, gene juice. It was just like little

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:20.900
 bits and pieces of alien dudes. Like they got blown up, their skin fell everywhere, and then

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:26.340
 their skin fall. I guess I should let you guys know now. I don't know what I'm talking about.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:32.660
 So let's skip that part. Here's the thing. This is my pushback to this. The fact that an alien

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:37.460
 egg could be frozen on an asteroid and crashed on Earth, I really don't have any problem with

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.340
 that. I could see that happening. It would be one in a million that it would survive. I could be

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.020
 frozen at the right temperature and wouldn't melt too close as it got close to any sun as it was

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.940
 flying around and then crashing the water and survived the impact and all this stuff. But one

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.740
 in a million chances in a universe that's infinite and time that's infinite is going to happen.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:02.180
 I would think it was weird that an alien, let's say the Cambrian life explosion was going on,

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.220
 and you started to have all these sea creatures evolve and land creatures evolve,

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:13.300
 and a creature shows up that is not only slightly related to other creatures that are currently there,

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:21.860
 but, dude, wait a second. Oh man, I just thought of something. This isn't in the article, so you'll

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:30.900
 have to forgive me if I go off the "science stock" for a second. What if it's true? What if it is an

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:43.700
 octopus is an alien life form? But it wasn't by chance that they look like they're like related to

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:52.020
 a squid. What if it's by choice? What if it's by some sort of design? Like what came down was the

00:26:52.020 --> 00:27:03.460
 matrix for some sort of life form, and it took the makeup of an existing creature in its environment,

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:10.660
 one of the best ones, which would be a giant squid, and then added in its own... Basically,

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:17.620
 what I'm basically trying to explain is some sort of shape-shifting alien, but more like it can

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:30.740
 adapt its... If that comet had landed on land, we may have had a four-legged creature, like a dog

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:36.180
 type of thing, but with more learning capability, it could instantly camouflage, it could change its

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:41.460
 shape, and things like that. Like what if... I mean, that's science fiction. Let's go back to the

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.940
 article just to reaffirm it real quick. Some scientists believe that an asteroid crashed in

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:53.860
 the earth, and it had octopus eggs on it, so octopi are an actual alien species. But we could

00:27:53.860 --> 00:28:00.420
 extrapolate that to say that it could have just not been an accident, where it landed determined

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:05.780
 what it would look like, and the advantages that it would have, because it landed in the ocean.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.940
 Basically, I guess what I'm explaining is when an Autobot crash lands on earth,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:17.700
 and they scan the nearest car, they can become that car. Because once we're in the realm of...

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:26.900
 Why not? Why not? What if the octopus is not an accidental hitchhiker, but an intentional

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:33.060
 resident? You know, the only reason why the octopus is not one of the most advanced

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.420
 species on the planet, because they're incredibly smart. They can learn things by watching people,

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.700
 and they're very, very smart. The only thing that limits them to not becoming a dominant life form

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:49.060
 on the planet is that they only live to be five years old. A lot of them die after mating. So if

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:56.580
 they lived longer, if they lived as long as a blue whale, they actually would be the dominant species

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:04.740
 of the ocean. And it's funny to think that there is a possibility in a world where the octopus

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:10.580
 lived longer, let's say 60, 70 years. I don't think humans would have control of the oceans.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:15.540
 I think once we first started sailing out across the oceans, I think boats would just be disappearing

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:25.380
 all the time. Because that's their land, and we... It's totally inhospitable to humans. You can't

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:32.340
 drink the water. You'll drown in it. You gotta build something to go across it. But if... If just a

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:42.340
 little twist in the genome where the octopus lives as long as a human, there is a world where

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:51.460
 the continents are completely separated. Like other than the Bering land bridge,

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.820
 there would be nobody on the Americas. And everyone would just be where they're at. There'd be no

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.540
 international trade. Because every time you send a ship out, it would crash. And you would just be

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:08.580
 like, "Well, I guess there's monsters out there." And then as society did develop and we started to

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:14.260
 do science stuff... I mean, think about it. The Americas not being found until the invention of

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:20.660
 the plane is what would happen in a world where the octopus... Everything's the same. They just

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:27.460
 simply lived a little longer. This wouldn't be our planet. It would just... Parts of it would be.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:34.340
 You'd have a totally different advanced species controlling two-thirds of the planet.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:41.540
 You know, we talked about gray aliens and dolphins the other day. And there was a theory. But...

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:49.380
 But the idea that if octopuses just lived a little longer, they would basically... We would be the...

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:57.060
 We would be the ones... Dude, what if they... What if they fished for us? They'd outnumber us, probably.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:04.980
 They'd control more of the world's surface. A world where octopi, eight arms are sneaking into your

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:10.580
 bedroom at night. "Mommy, I think there's a monster under my bed." When a kid said that, the parents

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.180
 would be like, "Oh my god, there's an octopus in here." Because you would have to believe it. Because

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:22.500
 octopi are constantly climbing into the surface, grabbing you, ripping your guts out. Whether or

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:32.500
 not the octopus is from another planet, we don't really know. Some scientists say yes, some scientists

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:42.580
 say no. But wherever they're from, with just a little switch, they could have been the dominant

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:49.780
 life form on this planet. We could have been the ones that were their food supply. They don't need...

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:58.660
 I mean, they can walk on land. We could have no coastal cities, no ports. Because at night, these

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:05.540
 eight armed creatures would come up and grab a little bite to eat. Maybe they would just do it

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:12.100
 for fun on the weekends. It's weird to think how the world works, like how science works,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:17.460
 how those little things can make big differences. Is it possible that the octopus is actually an

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:23.620
 alien life form from another planet? It is possible. And I think the arguments that are being used

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:30.900
 against it are relatively weak, which makes me think we don't have to look to the stars to find

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:38.900
 alien life. The stars already came to us. DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address.
