00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 Finding suitable mental health medications can be a challenge.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.360
 The Genesight test may help.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.620
 Did you know that genetics can play an important role in gaining insight on how a person may

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.680
 respond to various medications?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.340
 Understanding this may help reduce medication trial and error.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.920
 Genesight is a genetic test that analyzes variations in DNA.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.960
 It shows how genes may affect someone's metabolism or responds to medications commonly prescribed

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.400
 to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.800

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.360
 Tonight, a game show reveals a terrible secret.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.200
 What would you do if you found tiny people taking a bath in your bathroom sink?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.400
 What?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.960
 And then we travel to West Virginia.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:56.400
 Or a small creek bubbling through the dark forest actually has a powerful secret.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.540
 Is there a ghost in West Virginia that can warn us whenever a president will be assassinated

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.320
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:14.600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 I'm having a great day.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 Feeling a lot better.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.440
 I think you guys can hear that on my voice.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.440
 Still have the cough.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.640
 That cough has been around for a couple weeks now.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.200
 But we got a lot of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and jump right into this.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.520
 This show is a daily show.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.200
 So this is happening tonight.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.400
 But this also takes place in Germany.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.320
 So by the time I'm recording this at 7pm on March 24th, by the time I'm recording it,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.080
 it's probably already happened in Germany.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 But still.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.360
 That's our timely music news.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.840
 So Big Brother is the show where you get the contestants, they sit in the house and then

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 like people get voted.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.920
 I think I've, I can't ever say that I've ever watched more than a few episodes of it.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.480
 But they get voted out I believe.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.800
 And they win money or something.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 Or they win the house.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.800
 I don't know.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.320
 Maybe the last person in the house actually owns the house.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320
 But it was a British show.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.840
 And then it was spread all over the world.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.000
 Big Brother Germany is going on right now.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.160
 There's a couple other Big Brothers going on right now.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.400
 And the idea is this.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.000
 10 people or whatever.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.960
 You're chasing any basic research.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.120
 You get a group of people in a house.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.120
 They're totally cut off from the outside world.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.080
 And they bicker and squabble.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.720
 And us normals, us Homo sapiens, get to watch these guys 24 hours on camera feed.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.440
 Technically, we're the Big Brother.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.600
 We're the observing audience.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.120
 But there's actually a Big Brother in the house that can give news alerts or, it doesn't

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.120
 really give news alerts.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.520
 And a prompt drama.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.160
 Basically there's an overriding force in the house.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.840
 So people get voted out of the house.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.560
 And then there's this huge crowd.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560
 Woo!

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.840
 Because you go in and you're a nobody.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.320
 And then you come out and you're a celebrity.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.480
 People have been watching your antics for a week or two or three or four, however long

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.720
 you last on the show.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.720
 Ah yeah.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.720
 Woo!

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.760
 You come out and you find out you have a fan base.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.560
 And or a bunch of stalkers.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.720
 But you know, so we have two different things going on.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.440
 We have a bunch of people isolated in the house.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.320
 And they have no access to the outside world.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.600
 They have no television, no news, nothing.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.800
 The Big Brother show in Germany, it started on February 6th.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.200
 The season started on February 6th.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.120
 And at that time, coronavirus, you had like maybe a couple dozen cases in Germany, a couple

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.760
 dozen cases in America and stuff like that.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.000
 They've had no news about what's going on in the outside world.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.320
 This is, there's a lot of stuff that's messed up about this.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.960
 One, they're not telling them about it.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.040
 This is the gimmick, okay?

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.840
 This is what they're doing tonight on ITV.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.160
 On ITV, they're going to announce to these people who've been sequestered in their house

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160
 since February 6th.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.880
 They're like, "Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in big brother Germany history,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.920
 we're going to let you guys know what's going on in the outside world."

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.640
 Whoa, what's it going to be?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640
 Everyone's sick.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.560
 There's a disease rampaging across the planet.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560
 Be like, "What?

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.560
 I don't want to know that."

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.440
 They're getting ready to announce that on live television tonight.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.560
 There have been, so when someone gets voted out of the house and another person takes

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.560
 their place, the people who have taken their place, one person just entered the house a

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.840
 couple of days ago, I hope they tested them.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.920
 I hope they made sure the guy wasn't sick.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.680
 And they said, "You cannot mention what's going on outside at all."

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.400
 Even the pandemic, especially the pandemic.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.640
 You can't say anything.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.880
 They've been teasing, they've been advertising this.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.000
 Tune in tonight where we let 10 people know what's going on in the, that's horrible.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.880
 And that definitely raises the stakes for the show.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.600
 Because now you definitely don't want to get voted out.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.520
 Because you know where you're at, you're isolated.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.000
 You're in the lap of luxury, you have unlimited food and water.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.520
 Now you're like, "Oh my God, I live in an apartment with like 10 other roommates and

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.120
 they're super disgusting.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.120
 Please don't vote me out."

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.280
 The stakes for the show are so high now.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.960
 And I guess I should say this, when we had a similar thing here in the States, 9/11 happened

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.680
 and they were doing a season of Big Brother.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.720
 And the rule was, don't tell anyone what's going on in the outside world.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.800
 But one of the girls in the house lost somebody in 9/11.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.440
 So they did say, "Hey guys, we got attacked by terrorists."

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.400
 And they kind of broke the rules for that.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.960
 And a couple other seasons are doing Big Brother right now.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.120
 They've broken the rules for that.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.640
 But to let them know what's going on, in the Canadian Big Brother, this is creepy.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.080
 Canadian Big Brother, right?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.000
 The way I described it, remember the people get voted out and they leave and there's like

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.400
 a massive crowd outside the house.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.440
 "Chairing, you were nobody two weeks ago, but now we love you."

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.440
 Wow!

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.720
 Recently, they had the vote out thing, right?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.200
 And they voted the person saying goodbye to them and they walk out the door and everyone's

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.360
 like getting ready to hear the abhorious applause.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.400
 It's dead silent outside.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.320
 Because there's no audience.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.320
 Social distancing.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.560
 The Canadian television network, whatever, didn't have anyone come.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.580
 You can't be that close to anyone.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.440
 So you know the gimmick of the show.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.480
 You've been watching it growing up and now you're on it.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.760
 You know what to expect.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.160
 Someone walks out of the door.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.120
 It's dead silent outside.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.000
 The people are like, because they have the hour long special that you can watch on television

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.440
 and then you can watch them on webcams.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.200
 When people were watching the webcam footage after the person leaves, people in the house

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.360
 are waiting to hear the roar and they don't hear anything.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.760
 And then they're talking among each other later that night and the people are like,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.520
 "Why didn't we hear anything?"

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.300
 And the other person's like, "I don't know.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.860
 That was really weird, right?"

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.420
 Yeah, yeah.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.580
 Did they soundproof the house somehow?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.700
 Which would be impossible, but that's what they're thinking.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.060
 That's the only thing they can think of.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.500
 They must have somehow created some sort of...

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.300
 Did the Canadian television use all that money they got from Degrassi High and build a soundproof

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.740
 sci-fi dome around the building?

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.980
 And they start discussing why weren't there anyone outside.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.840
 And then the big brother, who like I said, can speak in this intercom system over the

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.800
 house to talk to them.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.160
 As these people are trying to figure out what could possibly be going on outside that there

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.120
 was no one there to greet the person exiting the house, the big brother voice speaks from

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.720
 above and says, "Please stop talking."

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.640
 And everyone in the house just gets quiet.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.960
 They did eventually a couple days later tell the people in that house what was going on

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.060
 and that's why there was no crowd.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.060
 But again, definitely raises the stakes for the show.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.060
 You don't want to get voted off.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.460
 Now, I wanted to cover that story for two reasons.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.380
 One, I think it's absolutely inhumane to make people fight to stay in a house when this

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.500
 is going on too.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.700
 I want to talk about a show called Dead Set.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.220
 When I was reading this article, they talked about the show Dead Set.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.660
 Dead Rabbit recommends Dead Set.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:01.680
 It is a show about the big brother house in Britain, which is where Big Brother originally

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.680
 started.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.040
 The big brother house.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.880
 And all these people are totally isolated.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.400
 They're a bunch of like, you get all these strangers putting this house together and

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.080
 they have 24 hour cameras on them and a zombie apocalypse starts outside.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.880
 It's one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.920
 It was actually a mini series.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.000
 But I have it in the show notes.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 You can watch it on YouTube.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.720
 I also got that movie Dig.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.040
 I said it was super rare to find.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.200
 I found that on YouTube.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.540
 It's also in the show notes for this episode as well.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.100
 But I definitely watched Dig.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.180
 I watched it the other night.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.500
 It's still an amazing documentary.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.540
 But Dead Set, and then they're in the big brother house.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.980
 And zombies are laying siege.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.140
 And this one girl's boyfriend is like trying to get to the big brother house to save her.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.100
 It's really dark.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.940
 So you may want to save it till after all this is done.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.460
 But definitely it's on there.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.460
 Dead Rabbit recommends Dead Set and Dig.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.060
 It's such a great documentary.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.380
 I also want to say this.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.440
 I've reached my level with coronavirus news.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.640
 I don't even read it anymore.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.520
 And I would suggest to most of you guys, if you haven't reached it, to stop reading it.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.400
 I know the basic stuff.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400
 Don't take ibuprofen.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.220
 They say don't take ibuprofen.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.220
 Keep your hands washed.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.720
 Now they're saying it can stay on services for 17 days.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.120
 But then you look into that and it's like it doesn't.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.000
 It's not contagious at that point.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.640
 I just know if I get cardboard from outside, I don't touch it for 24 hours.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:28.580
 You know what, the basic stuff, I stopped reading all of the horror stories about it.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.140
 I don't even look at the headlines.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.140
 That's not true.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.500
 I look at the headlines, but I got tired of clicking on these clickbaity links and finding

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:41.020
 either fake information that makes it far more horrible than it actually is.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.260
 And there's a lot of that going on.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.900
 It's really weird.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.420
 I found stories that were 100% that were absolutely horrifying.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.600
 I was like, oh my God.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.040
 And then other people goes that Twitter from that doctor who's telling you that story from

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.000
 Italy that he's misspelling words.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.600
 He misspelled his job.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.800
 That's not a real tweet.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800
 This is fake stuff.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.120
 But they're getting clipped in hammock.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120
 It's scary.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.120
 Don't get me wrong.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.200
 It is scary and you should social distance and if you can self-isolate and do all these

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200
 containment things.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.920
 I'm not saying that it's fake or anything like that.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.600
 But what I'm saying is that we can overdo on the scary news about it.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.300
 We need to know the basics.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.300
 That's the same thing.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.660
 There's one thing between knowing about ISIS and then watching ISIS beheading videos.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.660
 Right?

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.780
 You get the point.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.980
 There's a brutal terrorist regime taking over swaths of the Middle East.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.380
 You should be aware of basic facts.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.980
 But that doesn't mean you have to go start reading articles where it's telling you what

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.980
 they did.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.260
 Stuff like that.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.980
 So that's the approach I've taken towards this.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.820
 I got the basic information.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.240
 And I think it was really overwhelming for me, honestly, that first week and a half.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.240
 We're still in it.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.840
 But just reading so every hour looking for new articles to read about stuff and it was

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.440
 really, really affecting me.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.440
 It was really getting to me.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.840
 It doesn't mean I'm ignoring the danger.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.560
 But it doesn't mean that I'm overwhelming my sense of self and my anger.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.200
 You don't want to get too anxious about it.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.880
 You just want to be careful.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.880
 That's the main thing.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.880
 This is something that we...

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880
 And now this is turned kind of preachy.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.500
 But I just want to be preachy right now because I know that we already feel isolated just

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.540
 in a normal life.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.860
 And now that we actually have to stay away from people, we can feel it even more isolated.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.420
 So don't ignore the news, but know your limit.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.420
 I've reached my limit.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.220
 Now I'll go to websites to look at the headlines.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.220
 That's it.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.220
 I've reached my limit.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.380
 I'm doing what I can do.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.760
 And I'm no longer clicking on these horror stories of this person suffering from this

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760
 or this...

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.480
 I got really too deep into it.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.180
 And it was just too much.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.680
 People may say, "Ah, you're putting your head in the sand."

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.800
 But I say, "No, I think it's the same thing as knowing about a global terrorist group

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.680
 versus having to delve into what they do when they enter a village."

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.040
 You don't need to know that information.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.000
 You just know that they exist and stuff like that.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.100
 So know what the problem is.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.140
 Know how you can prevent it yourself.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.500
 Know what you can do to not get yourself sick or other people sick.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.500
 And then go on.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.940
 You don't have to be clicking on every single creepy Twitter or article that has a sad headline.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.940
 Just keep going forward.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.960
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story, though.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.420
 Our next story takes us to Malaysia.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.420
 So let's hop on board the Carpentercopter.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.780
 We're flying out to Selang Baru.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.100
 Selang Baru.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.180
 You guys know where that's at, right?

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.320
 I hope so, because I don't.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.640
 I'm flying the Carpentercopter.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.880
 We're flying out there.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.880
 It's March 1989.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.920
 We're going to meet a little kid, right?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.920
 Some nine-year-old boy.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.560
 His name's Faizul Effendi.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.760
 And he's walking to school.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.760
 [Singing]

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.920
 A little backpack.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.040
 He has it over one shoulder because he's one of the cool kids.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.720
 He's not one of those lamos that has it over.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.280
 I used to be that kid.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.080
 I didn't want to put my backpack on both shoulders because it looks super lame.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.340
 And then, like, your back starts to hurt.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.760
 But the time you get to high school and the books are super heavy, you're like, "Ugh,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.820
 you look like Quasimodo every time you walk everywhere."

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.700
 But anyways, I still did it.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.540
 Nowadays, I put it on both shoulders because I don't care.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:18.260
 Faizul is walking on the street to school and he sees this guy walk by.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.260
 Now that's normal, right?

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.380
 A lot of times, when you're walking down the street, other people are walking down the

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.380
 street, too.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.820
 But this guy was only six inches tall.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.040
 Like this little dude is just kind of walking by.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.920
 Now here's the thing.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.720
 You're walking on the street, you see a six inch person, which is unreasonably small.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.840
 Obviously, there are people, there are little people, and they'll be like three feet, two

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.200
 feet tall.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.960
 But six inches is not normal for anything outside of a uterus, right?

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.840
 But you see a little six inch person walking on the street.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.840
 What do you do?

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.480
 Quick reaction time.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.480
 What do you do?

00:13:53.480 --> 00:14:01.540
 Now I would probably jump back and then I would regain my composure because I'm cool

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.860
 and I'd easily take my backpack off because it's only on one shoulder and then I'd get

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.940
 down on one knee and go, "Who are you?"

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.820
 And I'd try to communicate with this six inch person.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.540
 Faizul does what I think, I think you'd basically have three reactions.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.060
 You'd run away because it's super spooky.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:25.020
 You'd try to talk to the six inch dude or you'd grab it because anything that's small

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.340
 enough to grab.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:32.420
 Now again, he's a kid, but I can understand why he grabbed it because, well actually

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.520
 no I can't because kids don't normally walk around grabbing squirrels and stuff like that.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.440
 I mean babies maybe.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.020
 But I mean, now that I think about it, what if this was just a six foot guy?

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.240
 Faizul was walking on the street, would he be grabbing on it?

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.240
 Get off of me kid, what are you doing?

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.920
 But he grabs the six inch dude, the little guy, little guy, bears his teeth and then

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.180
 begins super scratching him up.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.540
 And scratches him up so much that Faizul drops the dude, guy runs into the bushes.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.020
 You're thinking, "Okay, that's bizarre."

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.020
 Right?

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.300
 A little feral, you know?

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.620
 It's not that he just scratched him up, buried his teeth and then scratched him up.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.780
 It wouldn't make sense for a six inch person to have some really good self-defense techniques.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:19.320
 Not that it has to know like choke holds and stuff like that, but that it would have claws.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.560
 I wonder, no that's not, wait a second, think about it.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.960
 Small animals have claws and big animals don't, right?

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.080
 So like cats have claws and then tigers have claws.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.880
 Like tigers aren't small, well think about it, okay.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.320
 You have like birds, they're tiny, they have claws, right?

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.680
 But then humans don't and then cats have claws because you know they're like clawing at,

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.460
 like mice and stuff like that.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.160
 Why don't dogs have claws?

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160
 Why don't dogs?

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.840
 What would that be like good when they're like attacking bears and stuff like that?

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.540
 Bears have claws, they're pretty big, that doesn't work for my hypothesis.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.080
 But this is what I'm getting at.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.860
 Hippopotamuses, rhinos, elephants, they don't have claws.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:07.200
 So I think the bigger you get, the less likely it is you're gonna have claws.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.580
 If you have claws, you need every advantage possible to have.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.160
 What if everyone says that cats are small tigers, right?

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.120
 So like there's a bunch of tigers running around and then they kept having babies and

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.960
 the babies got smaller and smaller and that's where house cats came from.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.560
 I'm gonna give a different idea.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.320
 You're like Jason, that's nobody said that.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.280
 That's no scientific theory.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.860
 What if all cats started off as little and then they got big and that's why they still

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.940
 have their claws.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.680
 But then a thousand years from now, lions and tigers will no longer have claws because

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.220
 they'll not need them.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.260
 What do they use claws for anyways?

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.940
 They don't really climb trees.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.980
 Like, why do bears have claws actually?

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.980
 Like it's not just because gorillas don't have claws, right?

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.580
 So I'm gonna stand by my theory.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.780
 I'm gonna stand by my theory that the bigger the animal, the bear doesn't count.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.180
 The bigger the animal, the less likely it is to have claws.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.500
 Because if an elephant had claws, if an elephant ate meat, that might be the thing.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.660
 Maybe it's meat eater.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.040
 Wait, no, but rhinos, oh wait, no.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.040
 That's it.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.160
 That's it.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.480
 Meat eaters have claws and omnivores and herbivores.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.000
 You have elephants being like, ah, rip an open bin and never mind.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.080
 Okay, so where was I at?

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.660
 So this guy must be a carnivore because he has claws.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.160
 That's what I was trying to get at.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160
 I wonder if there's a carnivore.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.680
 Never mind, I'm not gonna.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.880
 Okay, so that's that.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.520
 April 1989, one month later, Salaeng Bahru, Malaysia.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520
 We're still here.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.760
 We never left town.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.540
 We've been eating their delicious noodles, I'm assuming that they eat noodles over there.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.620
 We're eating noodles and rice and it's so super tasty.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.380
 Mmm, it's tasting so good in my little quarantined belly.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.060
 Tasting so yummy.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.300
 We're gonna meet a dude named Nor Osme Mod Jamal.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.060
 Nor Osme Mod Jamal.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.980
 He's walking home from school.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.100
 He's coming the opposite direction, but the same area.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.900
 I don't actually know if it's the same geographical area, but same town.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.500
 He's walking home from school.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.840
 He sees, walking across the street, two six inch dudes.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.280
 One of them's actually a girl.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.200
 So two six inch dudes.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.280
 One of them's wearing a brown shirt and shorts, which is actually kind of comfortable because

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.480
 Malaysia is pretty tropical.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.200
 They're not dressed like the leprechaun.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.960
 They're not dressing like big old hats and stuff like jackets.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.400
 That's actually a good point.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.840
 The leprechauns dressed up like, wait a second, I'm thinking of the leprechaun from the leprechaun

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.840
 movies.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840
 That's not his actual.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.260
 But the leprechaun wears a jacket and you wear like big old socks and pants.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.260
 Like shorts.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.020
 They're shorts, but he has like long socks.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.220
 Because Ireland is cold.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.220
 Ireland's cold.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:51.460
 But if you had cryptids in more tropical areas, they'd be wearing like a little sun hat and

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.700
 like a commuter shirt.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.820
 Little short-sleeved shirt.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.820
 You wouldn't want to see like, if you were a cryptid, if you were a mythological creature

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.500
 in a warm climate, you would dress accordingly.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.300
 That's actually really interesting because it shows.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.000
 Well it shows one of two things.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.520
 It shows that cryptids would have to maintain some sort of internal body temperature that

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.920
 they're also affected by the climate or that the people making up the stories make them

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.920
 up in a way that's relatable to the people in their culture.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.120
 I.e. if you were in Ireland and you were talking about a leprechaun, you wouldn't say he had

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.400
 a boogie board and it wears shorts and no shirt.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.680
 People would be like, would it run any frees to death?

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.680
 And why does it have a boogie board?

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.680
 What's a boogie board?

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.680
 So it's one of those two things.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.160
 Most likely the second one.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.980
 Anyways, he's walking on the street, he sees two six inch people.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.140
 One of them is wearing a brown shirt, brown shorts.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.460
 The other one is wearing a brown shirt and a little skirt.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.060
 And he sees these little guys and he does.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.420
 This is what I think would be more likely than reaching out and grabbing one.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.900
 He starts chasing them.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.540
 Now I said I would sit down and go, what's your name?

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.620
 But if it was like walking, I would also probably be likely to pursue them as well.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.220
 I'd still want to talk to them but that's a pretty natural thing.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.060
 He starts chasing them and they take off into the bushes.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.440
 But a few days later, Nor, this kid Nor is at home.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.160
 So he walks into his bathroom.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.040
 Like you have the bathroom sink.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.160
 And he sees one of the little dudes just kind of hanging out, sitting on the porcelain,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.680
 just hanging out, just chilling on his sink.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.640
 What the hell's going on?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.520
 And then he looks and he sees that the basin of the sink is filled with water and the other

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.900
 one's totally naked, do do do do, washing itself.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.360
 Now I don't know if it took like a sliver of soap.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.280
 Aye, laddie, gotta get clean.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.280
 Irish spring!

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.040
 Maybe this is a really commercial for Irish spring.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.120
 The little dude is washing himself.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.240
 Which that would be awesome.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240
 Right?

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.240
 I would do multiple things right there.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.240
 One, I'd get a camera.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.240
 Now to be fair, that's not, I'm not pervert.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.240
 I'm not a pervert.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:57.640
 I'm not gonna post these photos on foundcryptidsnew.com or like cryptids on camera, stuff like that.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.020
 I'm not trying to be a pervert because there's a naked cryptid in my sink.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.220
 I'd grab a camera for proof because no one's gonna believe you, obviously.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.840
 And then I would still try to talk to the guys, but then I would sell the water online

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.780
 a bunch of weirdos and be like, "Hey guys, how would you like to buy water that a six

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.460
 inch person took a bath in?"

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.620
 And they would respond, "Man or woman."

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.460
 And I'd go, "Doesn't matter.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.980
 A six inch person took a bath in this."

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.420
 Okay, it was the woman.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.940
 No, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll buy it, buy it.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.840
 So anyways, he doesn't specify if it was the dude or the girl who was taking the bath,

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.400
 but we'll just assume.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.560
 Just to make the story a little more sexy, it was a six inch woman in there.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.560
 And so anyways, he's watching her take a bath and then he reaches in, this is the end

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.720
 thing, he goes to grab the girl in the sink and surprise, surprise, he gets attacked.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.240
 He gets bit really, really hard and drops her and the two little people took off.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.940
 Now he goes to tell his parents, obviously, he has to explain why his hand is bleeding

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.940
 profusely.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.940
 What happened to you?

00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.940
 I tried grabbing a naked woman.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.940
 No mom, don't get mad, she was only six inches tall.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.940
 Okay, I'm not pervert.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.900
 Well, kind of a pervert, but what would you do?

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.700
 He tells his parents this and this story, I got both of these off of that website, think

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.700
 about it, docs.com.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:16.620
 The story ends with this sentence, "He told his parents about the incident, but they

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.620
 did not believe him."

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:25.080
 Given that the tragedy that lives on forever, haven't we all been there, that moment where

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.120
 we got bit by a naked six inch woman and we went to our parents, the people who love us

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.120
 so much.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:36.080
 Mom, dad, I got bit by a tiny person taking a bath in our sink and then you being not

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.840
 believed, that is the true tragedy of this world.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.800
 Let's go ahead and move on to our, I find that story funny, I like that story, I like

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.800
 little people running around.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.040
 I think it's cute.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.940
 I mean, the constant assaults by the giants, maybe not so cute, but I do find it fascinating

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.140
 and it makes you think, what would you do if you saw a tiny person?

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.860
 I think I would try to talk to them and probably take pictures of them and sell their bathwater,

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.540
 but I don't think I'd be grabbing them all the time just because they're tiny, because

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.580
 again, I don't grab mice that are running around.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.940
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.700
 We're headed out to West Virginia.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.340
 All of this information I got from an article, I want to give credit where credit's due,

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.500
 from a website called West Virginia Explorer.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.080
 The article is "Horse Creek Ghost Set to Fortell the Demise of Presidents" and it was written

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.360
 by David Sibre.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.760
 So let's hop back on board the car.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760
 Let's take the Jason Jalopy.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.960
 We haven't been driving for a long time.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.960
 Well, we're in Malaysia.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.280
 Fine, let's hop back on the Carverner Copture.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.920
 We're going to fly out to West Virginia.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.440
 We're going to learn about the Horse Creek Ghost.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.720
 April 8th, 1865.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.520
 Major Walter Hansen and his buddy Elijah Miller, those are some old-timey names for you, are

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520
 hunting.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.060
 They're out hunting by Horse Creek in West Virginia.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.620
 And they hear something in the bushes.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.940
 "Turn around quickly!"

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.020
 They spin around to face the noise.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.660
 They get to deer and elk, possibly an elk with claws.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.660
 They've evolved.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.660
 They eat meat now.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.420
 And is the Major's ready to face this evolution abomination?

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:08.460
 A woman steps out of the bushes, dressed in all black, clothes soaking wet.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:16.560
 She points her finger at the man and says, "Lincoln will be gone before the full moon

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.160
 rises."

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.480
 And they're like, "What?"

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.880
 Because Lincoln's still president.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.720
 And then she, I don't know if she flashes away or if she just kind of like points at

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.120
 him for a while and then kind of puts her arm back down and just stands there silently

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.080
 and then is kind of like, "I'm going to go back in the bushes."

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.080
 She turns and walks away.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.080
 She simply disappears.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.080
 Now it's 1865.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.120
 It's not like you can just pick up a newspaper.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.500
 Major Walter Hansen said it took him two months to find out that Abraham Lincoln had been

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.100
 shot by the coward.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.100
 What was his name?

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.100
 I don't remember Jimmy Olson.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.100
 What was that guy's name?

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.100
 Lee Harvey Olswald.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.100
 No, that was the other guy.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.100
 Who was the guy who shot Lincoln?

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.100
 Not Aaron Burr.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:58.820
 And then he jumped and he like fell, he jumped and he like slid down a curtain all dramatically.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.140
 What was his name?

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.340
 Dude, he was that actor.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.940
 Who shot Lincoln?

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.720
 And then he ran and then he hid in a barn and then the authorities surrounded him.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.640
 You're like, "Jason, you know all this stuff.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.640
 You don't know his name."

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.480
 They said the barn on fire and he died.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.200
 There's always been that big conspiracy theory that he didn't die in the barn, that he got

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.200
 away.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.920
 What was his name?

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.920
 Patton Olswald?

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920
 It started with an "O."

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.240
 I think it had an "O" in it, right?

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.040
 I'm going to Google it here real quick.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.920
 It had an "O" in it.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920
 That's specific.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.920
 Let's see.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.420
 Who killed Lincoln?

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:38.340
 What was his name, Perkins?

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.980
 John Wilkes Booth.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.580
 See there's three "Os" in it.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.980
 That's what was throwing me off.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:43.980
 There's too many "Os."

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.980
 It's throwing me off.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.740
 John Wilkes Booth shoots Abraham Lincoln, then does all that other stuff, I said.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.380
 And may or may not have gotten away with it.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.980
 But anyways, now we're going to go to the year 1881.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.620
 And this guy named Clyde Perdue and his wife, doesn't matter what her name is, are driving,

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.860
 are riding their horses or whatever down.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.980
 This same street by Horse Creek in West Virginia.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.980
 And this one's interesting.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.340
 So the first time you had the woman, I'm going to assume she was hot, coming out of the bushes,

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.180
 dressed in all black, dripping wet.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.860
 This one, you still have the black clothing.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.860
 So this thing comes out in a black shawl.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.260
 That's still dripping wet.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.220
 But this time it's a flaming skull and crossbones.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.220
 It's kind of weird.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.780
 They're driving down the road and they see this flaming skull and crossbones with wearing

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.860
 a black, dripping wet shawl up here in front of them.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.380
 And the skeleton guy goes, "James Garfield's going to be assassinated."

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:39.060
 And again, I don't know if it faded away or just kind of floated there for a while and

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.420
 then they drove past it and they're waving to it in the rearview mirror.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.420
 Or they're on horses.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.260
 So they were just, I don't actually know where Carson went.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.260
 I was thinking that.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.820
 I was like, "Carrs wore around in 1881, right?

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.300
 But there was only like two of them.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:00.060
 And you're like, "Jason, this might be your least informed episode ever."

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.060
 That may be true.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.060
 But I think cars wore around in 1881, but nobody had them.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.380
 So I think these guys are on horses.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.740
 It doesn't really matter.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.380
 It has no bearing on the plot.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.980
 The point is, is that a flaming skull and crossbones said that James Garfield's going

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.980
 to be assassinated.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.700
 And he was in 1881.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.140
 In 1963, there's this dude named Max Alberts.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.900
 Tell me if this is the most depressing job possible.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.700
 He's a traveling...

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.020
 I mean, how much money could you possibly...

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.980
 This is the albundi of the 1960s.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.580
 He was a traveling magazine subscription salesman.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.100
 So you would just walk around the country or drive around the country because I know

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.340
 cars were invented in 1963 where they were around.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.980
 And you go up knocking on people's doors and says, "Would you like to buy 12 issues of

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.620
 this life magazine?"

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.780
 Like, how much money could you possibly make doing that?

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.780
 It's ridiculous.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.100
 I mean, and then you basically...

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.700
 Or you can buy a magazine and all those little cards fall out of it that you can do subscriptions

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.580
 and stuff like that for.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.660
 That's so sad.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.660
 That's so sad, right?

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:07.580
 But anyways, this guy, maybe it was his favorite job in the world, Max Alberts, traveling magazine

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.060
 subscription salesman.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.500
 I remember once this salesman came to my mom's house.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.500
 Why?

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.340
 It was my house too when I was a kid.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.220
 This traveling salesman came to our house to sell us like a vacuum cleaner or set of

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.260
 knives or whatever he was selling, right?

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.820
 And we had a little bowl of milk laid out for a local cat.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.820
 It wasn't our cat.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.900
 It was like a stray cat, but we fed him milk every day.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:34.020
 I mean, we didn't know that milk causes cats to have diarrhea everywhere, but it wasn't

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.020
 our cat.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.060
 So we didn't care.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.420
 And so we'd set this milk out.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.340
 And I remember one day my mom, like, I see her talking at the door and she's like, "No,

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.340
 no, that's okay.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.340
 We don't want anything."

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.180
 And then she goes, "Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.820
 I'm so sorry."

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.180
 And then she shuts the door and I was like, "What happened?"

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.980
 And mom goes, "Oh my goodness.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.980
 I feel so bad.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:55.980
 I feel so bad."

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.980
 I go, "What?

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.980
 Okay, now what's going on?"

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:02.140
 And she goes, "Well, this man came to the house and he looked down on his luck.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.100
 He looked like things were not going well in his life.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.620
 And he's a door-to-door salesman.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.540
 So that's a really difficult job.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.940
 And he already looked like things weren't going well.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.420
 And knocked on the door, tried to sell my mom something.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.420
 She said, "No."

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:19.420
 And then as he went to leave, he stepped in.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:27.100
 He stepped in the bowl of cat milk, spilling cat milk all over his pant leg.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.100
 Right?

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.100
 It wasn't cat milk.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.780
 It wasn't milk from a cat.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.380
 But it was a sizable amount of milk.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.580
 He got it all over his leg.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.340
 And I remember my mom, she felt really bad about it.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.020
 Because here you have this guy who's already things aren't going good for him.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.740
 Now he has milk all over his clothes.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.700
 The worst material, because you've got to wash it right away.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.740
 Otherwise you're going to start smelling like sour milk.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.740
 It's all over his sock.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.400
 It's all over his shoe.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:54.220
 And my mom's telling the story and she can't finish it without kind of smiling, right?

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:59.260
 Because it's also kind of, it's like you're so down on your luck and then you get milk.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.500
 And then you get milk all over you.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.260
 And we always, we always felt super bad for the guy.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:09.620
 But me and my brother and my mom always used that as an end of a phrase.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.340
 Whenever we were talking about bad news, we're like, "Yeah, and Johnny, not only did he fall

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.420
 down and break his ankle, but then his girlfriend left him."

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.660
 And then he stepped in some milk.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:22.140
 Like that was always the way for us to end a phrase of a streak of battle luck with

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.400
 stepping in some milk.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.240
 So maybe that, maybe that salesman is listening to us right now.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.120
 Anyways, cat milk aside or just milk for cats aside.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.620
 1963.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.680
 Max Alberts is driving down the street.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.680
 He sees the woman, it's a woman again this time.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.560
 Dressed in all black, soaking wet clothes.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.480
 Now this is interesting.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.280
 Because all of these stories were a local legend in the area.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.380
 And then they became campfire stories that people told all over West Virginia.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:55.220
 And then they were collected in a book of writings by a guy named Jim Comstock.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.920
 He wrote, wrote about this story in the 1970s.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.280
 It's been nationwide since.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.940
 This one's interesting because this one, he's driving down the road and this phantom, this

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:12.340
 woman walks out of the bushes, dripping wet, black clothes, a phantom, an oracle of death.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.600
 And the guy doesn't hear what she says.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.160
 She's driving down the road and he sees her step out into the road and she points at him

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.440
 and she's saying something.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.280
 But he doesn't hear what she's saying.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.280
 What?

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.280
 I'm sorry, Layton, what?

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.280
 She's like, "Kennedy will die!"

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.780
 He's like, "I can't hear you."

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.780
 I'm like, "What?"

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.780
 And the car's super loud.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.500
 She's like, "I'm trying to warn you, Kennedy's gone."

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.780
 He doesn't stop.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.640
 He just keeps on driving.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.260
 And this story is included in this collection because in 1963 is when Kennedy died.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.840
 Now he apparently told people when he got to the next town, it was super weird, he was

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.800
 driving down the road, this woman popped out of the bushes, started yelling at me and I

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.320
 just kept driving and people are like, "Uhhh."

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.780
 And then Kennedy dies that year.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:58.360
 What's interesting about that part of the story is that if the story is made up, that

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.900
 wouldn't be in there, right?

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.880
 If the story is 100% made up, you wouldn't add it in a part where the guy doesn't hear

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.880
 the warning.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.880
 Does that make sense?

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.640
 Like if you're, I've always used, I've used this for a couple different times, a couple

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640
 different episodes.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.860
 If the story is made up, it should be more, a little more sensational.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.220
 It doesn't have to be over the top.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.580
 It doesn't have to be that she actually like hopped out of his glove box and said, "Lee

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.820
 Harvey all is well, it's gonna shoot."

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.700
 You don't have to have it that dramatic, but he should at least have heard the warning.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.140
 Because if you're making it up, you can change the facts however you want.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.220
 The fact that he didn't hear the warning at all and simply told someone later that this

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.800
 happened and everyone was like, "Oh."

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.500
 Makes me think that the story might be true.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.840
 So that's kind of creepy that for whatever reason this location, now there are five

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.160
 different places in West Virginia called Horse Creek.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.400
 Nobody knows which one it actually is.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.960
 Which again, makes me, if it was made up, you would say it was this horse creek and this

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.360
 location and these, these are what happened each time.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.880
 This is what the person said.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.040
 You can make it super specific because you're making it up out of a whole cloth.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.160
 This is the interesting part.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.160
 Let's say that this is true.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.640
 Let's accept that these stories are true.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.340
 There's a location for whatever reason, Horse Creek in West Virginia, that a phantom will

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:17.140
 appear whenever a president is assassinated.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:22.980
 If that story is true, you know as well as I do that there is a secret service agent

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.100
 in that area now.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.980
 The first time, there was no secret service back when Lincoln was killed.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.700
 No one would think about it.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.540
 The second time when Garfield died, you'd be like, "Oh, that's kind of weird, right?"

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:39.680
 But by the third time that it happens, you know if the CIA is testing psychic abilities,

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.800
 walking through walls, all this stuff, you know that someone in the government has heard

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:47.080
 these stories and said, "Let's find this horse creek."

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.800
 There's only five of them.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.920
 And if they don't know which one's which, you could have someone in each location.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.760
 You could easily pay someone to just fish all day long at Horse Creek.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.000
 It doesn't have to be the same guy.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 They can work shifts.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.600
 But you'd have someone there all the time.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.720
 What would it really cost?

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.380
 You have five locations, rotating shifts.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:10.060
 You have two to three people working a camp at a time.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:18.500
 So for 15 employees, you could predict whether or not a president was going to be assassinated.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.900
 And what's interesting is that the last sighting was in 1963.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:28.180
 In all of these sightings, the person warns of the death ahead of time.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.740
 Let's them know it's coming.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:36.640
 So is it possible that after 1963, word gets out about this urban legend of West Virginia,

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.440
 which is right in that hub of you have the Pentagon, you have Langley, all that stuff.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:47.880
 They say, "Let's take some agents, have them camp out, big ol' they can sit there and

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:53.880
 make s'mores all day long, big ol' jamboree, we can come and visit on the weekends."

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.440
 And if this happens again, we'll be warned.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.840
 In the 1980s, Reagan was almost assassinated.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.840
 He was shot.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.900
 You got a secret, as the guy was pulling the trigger, putting bullets into Reagan, one

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:10.580
 of the secret service agents jumped in and stuck his finger in between the trigger and

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.140
 the other part of the gun where the trigger goes.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.100
 He stuck his finger in behind the trigger so another shot couldn't get out.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.260
 That's one in a million.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.220
 That's what training's for.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.980
 Sticking your finger as it's going pop, as that trigger's pulling back, pop.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.820
 Pop his finger goes in and jams the gun.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.660
 You can't get another shot off.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:35.440
 Is it possible that on that day people were prepared for an attack on the president?

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.520
 Is it possible that there are creeks in West Virginia staffed by secret service agents

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.960
 just in case?

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.920
 It may seem like a tall tale, it may seem like a campfire story, but when you have the life

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.340
 of the leader of the free world on the line, is it really that much trouble to have a couple

00:35:53.340 --> 00:36:01.780
 secret service agents fishing, hunting, and waiting for a spirit to warn them of an assassination?

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:16.180
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.100
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.500
 Stay safe, be kind.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.900
 I love you guys and I will see you tomorrow.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.900
 Bye.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.900
 Bye.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.900
 Bye.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:24.900
 Bye.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:40.300
